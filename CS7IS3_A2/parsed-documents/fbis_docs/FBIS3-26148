There will be no significant breakthroughs in the effort to change government functions and the pace of political structural reform will probably not be accelerated. Moreover, if the CPC cannot effectively resolve the problem of corruption, social unrest may appear in some parts of the country because of possible resentfulness among the masses. The report points out: A reason for the economic disorder on the Chinese mainland last year was that the CPC was not sufficiently prepared mentally for the appearance of an economic boom after Deng's south China tour in 1992. As a result, the ability of government involvement and control was unable to catch up with social development. Moreover, as a result of the reshuffle in the central and local government organizations last year, the morale of some officials had been sapped and they have taken an attitude of wait and see instead, and their ability to handle affairs has thus decreased. The report believes that to suit rapid changes in economic and social fields and demand, it is necessary to split up government functions. But at the same time, the administrative power of the government should be relatively centralized, because without this power the government will be unable to exercise its functions. However, the splitting of government functions is often confused with dispersed administrative power and various government departments often make use of their power to restrain each other, which has resulted in low work efficiency. The report is not optimistic about reform of government organizations and change of government functions this year. It points out: The CPC will still mainly rely on administrative means to exercise social control this year, and its policies will continue to play some superficial and temporary roles. It also says that all three organizational reforms on the Chinese mainland over the last 10 years or so were supposedly carried out simultaneously with the change of leadership in state organizations, but the first two were only touted in a big way before leadership changes and then petered out after the changes were made. At the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, held last November, a "Decision on Certain Questions Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure" was adopted, which will serve as a general program for changing the economic structure in the future. The report of the Academy of Social Sciences points out: Although this decision is operable in concrete practice, judging from the current management ability and authority of the mainland government, its implementation remains an arduous task. It warns that when implementing this "decision" in various economic reforms, its possible impact on political and social affairs should not be overlooked. On the relationship between central and local authorities, the report says that it is necessary to resolve the contradictions between central and local authorities arising from the implementation of the revenue-sharing system. It particularly points out that with the expansion of the scale of opening to the outside world, there will be increasing space for various localities to participate in international activities. However, local governments should not regard participation in international activities as their central work. If they go against major diplomatic policies of the central authorities, the latter should deal with them seriously so that they do not lose their authority. Many people are expecting that the change in the mainland's economic structure will bring forth a reform of its political structure. But the report believes that at present, conditions are still not ripe for carrying out political structural reform. This year, the pace of legislative work and the legalization drive will be faster than last year, but that of political structural reform will remain basically the same. On the problem of corruption, the report predicts that if substantive results are not achieved in the "struggle against corruption," the masses of people will be disappointed and resentful, which will affect social stability to a certain extent. But it believes that if the CPC handles the matter properly, resentfulness in some parts of the country will not result in overall disorder. In conclusion, the report of the Academy of Social Sciences points out: The most important work for 1994 is to maintain political stability and continue to strengthen economic reform and construction.
