Unlike the Lok Sabha where the ruling party has been progressively adding to its numbers, in the upper house the treasury benches will shrink in size, no longer commanding the comfortable position they do at present. From 106, the Congress strength will come down to 95 while the main opposition party, the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party], will have added substantially to its numbers, which will go up from 33 to 45. Even the Janata Dal, which has been written off by political pundits, will increase its presence from 27 to 29. With the Mulayam Singh Yadav-Kanshi Ram combine coming to power in U.P., [Uttar Pradesh] their respective parties will be better represented now in the Rajya Sabha. While the Samajwadi Party's representation will go up from two to five, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) will be making its debut in the upper house. Among the losers are the Samajwadi Janata Party (SJP), which will be losing three of its 11 members while the TDP [Telugu Desam Party] strength will be depleted from five to three. The "shouting brigade" of the Congress will now be poorer by one of its most effective members, Mr Vishvajit Prithvijit Singh, who was equally capable of solid argument when the occasion demanded. It will probably gain from the return of the former Bihar chief minister, Dr Jagannath Mishra, who also enjoys the reputation of being a voluble parliamentarian. The party's doughty fighter, Mrs Satyabehin, will also not be returning next month just as Mr M.C. Bhandare, whose legal acumen is bound to be missed by the ruling party. The party seniors who will be gracing the treasury benches, include Mr V.N. Gadgil, who is coming back to the upper house after a gap of 18 years, Mr Janardhan Poojary, Mr Madhavsinh Solanki and Mr Jitender Prasad, political secretary to the Congress president, who comes to the Rajya Sabha for the first time as he has been a member of the other House till now. Mr Solanki's return, of course, is contingent on the ongoing leadership battle being waged in Gujarat. Should Mr Solanki succeed in "capturing" the chief minister's post he will have to vacate his seat in the upper house. Another Congress leader, who is coming back after a gap, is Mr Ramji Lal, who had vacated his seat at the party high command's behest to make way for Mr Dinesh Singh. Mr Lal has been elected from Harayana in place of Mr Mohinder Singh Lather, Mr Devi Lal's relation, whose exit means the severing of the Tau's last link with this house. Among those who have been reelected are Mr Suresh Kalmadi, Ms Saroj Kharpade, Mr Sitaram Kesari, Mr Bhuvnesh Chaturvedi and Mr Hansraj Bhardwaj, who has managed to survive despite Mr T.N. Seshan's efforts to do him out of his seat. The opposition ranks in the Rajya Sabha might have been steadily swelling but this increase in numbers has been more than offset by the loss of effective speakers like Mr Kamal Morarka of the SJP. As the Janata Dal leader, Mr S. Jaipal Reddy, rightly put it in his farewell speech, Mr Morarka scaled great oratorial heights and was undoubtedly one of the ablest parliamentarians, who had the knack of coming to the root of a problem without resorting to rhetoric. Mr Morarka's loss will be doubly felt by the opposition as it had already lost an effective speaker and fighter in Mr Yashwant Sinha, who resigned his seat when he snapped ties with the SJP and joined the BJP last November. Similarly, the maverick politician, Dr Subramaniam Swamy, always a delight to listen to irrespective of whether one agreed with his brand of politics, will leave a vacuum which will not be easy to fill. His retirement, however, will be quite a relief to the AIADMK [All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam] members at least, considering Dr Swamy's penchant for raising uncomfortable questions regarding Tamil Nadu and its chief minister. However, the opposition will find itself fortified by the fiery presence of the first-timer, Ms Mayawati of the BSP, who has already become a controversial figure because of her unsavoury remarks about the Father of the Nation. Considering her track record in the Lok Sabha, Ms Mayawati, known for her intemperate and colourful language, is set to make waves in the upper house. Film star-turned-politician, Mr Raj Babbar, will be taking a bow on the country's political stage, having been elected by the SP [Superintendent of Police]. Ironically, he will find himself face-to-face with his father-in-law, Mr Shivaji Patil (Smita Patil's father).
