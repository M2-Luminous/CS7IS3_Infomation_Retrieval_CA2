FR941121-2-00099 FR941121-2-00082 Issuer Delisting; Notice of Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company, Common Stock, P5 Par Value) File No. 1&hyph;3006 November 15, 1994. Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2&hyph;2(d) promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified security (``Security'') from listing and registration on the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex''). The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing the Security from listing and registration include the following: According to the Company, in addition to being listed on the Amex, its American Depositary Receipts (the ``ADRs'') representing the American Depositary Shares (the ``ADSs'') each representing one share of Common Stock have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'') and Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE''). The Company's ADSs commenced trading on the NYSE and PSE at the opening of business on October 19, 1994 and concurrently therewith the Common Stock was suspended from trading on the Amex and PSE. In making the decision to withdraw its common stock from listing on the Amex, the Company considered the direct and indirect costs and expenses attendant in maintaining the dual listing of its ADRs representing ADSs on the NYSE and PSE and its common stock on the Amex on the PSE. The Company does not see any particular advantage in the dual trading of its stock and believes that dual listing would fragment the market for the common stock and its ADRs. Any interested person may, on or before December 6, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter. For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary.
