FR940922-1-00017 FR940922-1-00005 A final disapproval of these Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 SIP elements will authorize the imposition of discretionary sanctions under section 110(m) of the Act, and will institute the 18-month clock for the imposition of mandatory sanctions under section 179 of the Act and the two-year clock for the promulgation of a Federal Implementation Plan under section 110(c)(1) of the Act. If, however, the State submits the additional control measures on which it relies in its SIP submittal and, based on EPA's review, these additional control measures adequately address the outstanding deficiencies, EPA will consider withdrawing this limited approval/disapproval and instead proposing full approval of the PM&hyph;10 plan for Ada County/Boise relative to those moderate area PM&hyph;10 SIP requirements which were due November 15, 1991. IV. Request for Public Comments EPA is requesting comments on all aspects of this proposal. As indicated at the outset of this document, EPA will consider any comments postmarked by October 24, 1994. V. Administrative Review This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2224), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from E.O. 12866 review. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq. , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. SIP approvals under sections 110 and 301 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds (see Union Electric Co. v. U.S.E.P.A. , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)). EPA's disapproval of the State request under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA does not affect any existing requirements applicable to small entities. Any pre-existing Federal requirements remain in place after this disapproval. Federal disapproval of the State submittal does not affect its state-enforceability. Moreover, EPA's disapproval of the submittal does not impose any new Federal requirements. Therefore, EPA certifies that this disapproval action does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because it does not impose any new Federal requirements.
