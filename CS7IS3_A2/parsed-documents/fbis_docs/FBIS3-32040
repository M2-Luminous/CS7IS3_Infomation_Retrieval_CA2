In an incident related to the disturbances, however, an elderly lady suffered a heart attack and died. According to a Military Police source, the incident occurred at Dos Caminos subway station, where secondary school students sought refuge while fleeing from police after participating in a protest. As the result of the nervousness caused by the students' arrival, the woman, some 70 years old, suffered a heart attack and, although paramedics at the subway station gave her first aid assistance, she died shortly thereafter. The disturbances occurred at the Rafael Urdaneta and Santos Michelena Secondary Schools early in the morning. Both schools were vacated and the Military Police forced the students to scatter. Some of them, however, put garbage bags on the pavement and set them on fire. Similar protests were staged in front of the Carlos Soublette Secondary School, located in the San Bernardino neighborhood, where Special Brigade members helped restore order. In Sucre, students from several secondary schools started a march. When they were dispersed by the police, however, they sought refuge in the subway stations, where the elderly woman's death occurred. Traffic was interrupted near the Andres Bello School on Mexico Avenue, Gustavo Herrera School on Libertador Avenue in Chacao, and in front of the Caracas Instituto Pedagogico, located on Paez Avenue in El Paraiso. At all of these places, students placed garbage and obstacles in the street while the police cordoned off the areas to prevent an aggravation of the situation. In the afternoon, hooded individuals from Ciudad University tried to commandeer a cargo vehicle, but police thwarted the attempt. Later, the same hooded men confronted police in the Tres Gracias sector. [Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish on page D-12 of its 28 January edition publishes a related 800-word report that adds that hooded individuals who infiltrated student demonstrations set three trucks on fire near the Central University of Venezuela in Maracay and near the Technological University in La Victoria. The report says the students were protesting the arrest of Juan Valladares, a young worker and student at the Libertador Pedagogical University in Maracay. The newspaper also reports that Mario Popoli, third judge for preliminary investigations on crime, has ordered an expeditious investigation because six trucks have been looted and set on fire in less than a week.]
