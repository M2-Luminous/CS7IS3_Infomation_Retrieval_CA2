SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background Section 15.605 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) permits contracting officers to evaluate offers on the basis of cost or price and non-cost or non-price-related factors. The Director of Defense Procurement issued an interim rule on September 29, 1994, by Departmental Letter 94&hyph;016, to revise the guidance at DFARS 247.270&hyph;5 and 247.270&hyph;6 for consistency with section 15.605 of the FAR. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The interim rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq., because the rule is consistent with the existing policy at FAR 15.605. An initial regulatory flexibility analysis has therefore not been performed. Comments are invited from small businesses and other interested parties. Comments from small entities concerning the affected subpart will be considered in accordance with Section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite DFARS Case 94&hyph;D005 in correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the rule does not impose any information collection requirements which require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq. List of Subjects in 48 CFR Part 247 Government procurement. Claudia L. Naugle, Deputy Director, Defense Acquisition Regulations Council.
