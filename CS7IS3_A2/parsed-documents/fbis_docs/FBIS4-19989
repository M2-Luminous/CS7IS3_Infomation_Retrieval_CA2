Despite forty years of totalitarianism, the Czech lands had always been a part of Europe not only geographically but also historically and culturally, Vondra said. Vondra said in an interview for CTK that "The countries of the European Union (EU) should show the same courage as Germany and France did after the Second World War when they set out on the road to European integration and cooperation. EU countries should rapidly open their markets to us and demolish trade barriers so that we may enter the common market before we even become members of the EU." He added that Western Europe (WEU) [as received] should allow the Czech Republic to join a defence community such as the WEU before the country became a NATO member. Asked for his assessment of Czech-German relations, Vondra said bilateral relations had been good especially in the last few months. Progress had been made in completing the negotiations on bilateral agreements, which had been bogged down for the past two years, concerning the Czech-German border regime and refugees. If different opinions appeared in the Czech press it was a question of the psychological level -- real relations were good, Vondra said.
