FR941220-2-00021 FR941220-2-00014 [Docket No. CP95&hyph;115&hyph;000] Questar Pipeline Company; Notice of Application December 14, 1994. Take notice that on December 7, 1994, Questar Pipeline company (Questar), 79 South State Street, Salt Lake City, Utah 84111, filed in docket No. CP95&hyph;115&hyph;000 an application pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act requesting authority to install one compressor unit, restage an existing compressor unit, and construct and operate appurtenant facilities at Questar's existing jurisdictional Fidlar Compressor Station (Fidlar Station) located in Uintah County, Utah, all as more fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Specifically, Questar proposes to install one 1,085 nominal horsepower Solar Saturn T1001S gas turbine-driven centrifugal compressor unit, restage an existing Solar Saturn T1001S compressor unit, and make related auxiliary modification at Fidlar Station. Questar estimates the total cost of the proposal to be $1.5 million. Questar states that the Fidlar Station modifications will increase its available main-line capacity by approximately 22 Mmcf per day. Questar indicates that it has entered into two firm transportation service agreements with Barrett Fuels Corporation (Barrett) and VESGAS Company (VESGAS) for a total of 19 Mmcf per day (20,000 Dth) of which 14 Mmcf per day will become available through a main-line replacement project pending in Docket No. CP94&hyph;765&hyph;000. Questar asserts that the remaining 5 Mmcf per day will be furnished through the proposed Fidlar Station expansion, leaving 17 Mmcf per day to be marketed to prospective customers. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before January 4, 1995, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulation Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that a grant of the certificate is required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for Questar to appear or be represented at the hearing. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
