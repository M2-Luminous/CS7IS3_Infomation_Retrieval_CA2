The experts included parliamentary journalists of leading newspapers, radio and television and political scientists. Their findings, wired in an INTERFAX report, indicate that Speaker Ivan Rybkin holds the lead just as in previous polls. While remaining uncontested leader, his April rating dropped to 7.6 points from 8.2 in March. Political scientists put this down to the fact that a considerable number of his supporters demanded his resignation over his conciliatory stance on the president's version of the Treaty on Social Accord. The runner-up is the Communist leader Gennadiy Zyuganov with 6.2 points. The poll results indicate that he is becoming an increasingly weighty and acceptable political figure in the eyes of both presidential supporters and the opposition. G. Zyuganov was third in the March poll. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, Liberal Democratic Party of Russia leader, is back among the three top deputies (he scored 6 points in April up from 5.4 in March) after the Duma supported last month his suggestion that the internal affairs minister should quit over the killing of deputy Ayzderdzis, and after he negotiated his signing of the Treaty on Social Accord with the president's team. The budget debate jacked up the rating of Sergey Glazyev (Democratic Party of Russia), chairman of the Duma Committee on Economic Policy, who published in April a draft program of the "Accord in the Name of Russia" opposition movement. He scored 5.6 points. Next comes Grigoriy Yavlinskiy (Yabloko) who managed to move in the April poll to fifth position from 17th in March. Yegor Gaydar, "Russia's Choice" leader, dropped to sixth position from second in March over his weakened influence on the decision- making process in the State Duma. Vladimir Isakov (Agrarian Party of Russia), Sergey Shakhray (Party of Russian Unity and Accord), Viktor Ilyukhin (Communist Party of the Russian Federation), and Aleksandr Vengerovskiy (Liberal Democratic Party of Russia) are in the upper part of the table as they have always been in the Center for Political Culture Studies polls.
