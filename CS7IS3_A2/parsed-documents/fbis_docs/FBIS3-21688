The meeting of two Turkish drug dealers with a Tunisian customer in Vienna is described. According to an Interpol report, drugs valued at 2 billion schillings were sold in Vienna last year. NEWS describes in detail how the drug money is laundered in Austrian casinos, paid into anonymous accounts in several Viennese banks, and then transferred to Turkey. The article notes that European investigators have been concentrating on the small town of Elazig for two years. They call it "Europe's heroin exchange" because "more schillings, German marks, and dollars flow to the roughly 30 banks in the town than to Ankara or Istanbul put together." Reportedly, almost all heroin shipments to or via Vienna come from Elazig and almost all the dealers caught by the Austrian drugs squad are citizens of this town. Captain Gerhard Joszt from Interpol in Vienna wants to bust this heroin connection together with his European colleagues in Wiesbaden. "According to the police, 4.3 tonnes of heroin are delivered to Vienna every year," but only 16 kg were seized in 1992. It is noted that the drug bosses have developed a "gigantic apparatus consisting of hundreds of followers, clever action plans, and internal secret codes." The report continues with a description of a visit to Elazig, which is booming. The people drive luxurious cars and wear "models of Armani and Chanel." While the mayor denies that drug deals are carried out in his town, a member of the Turkish secret police states the following: "The crude opium from Afghanistan, Syria, Iran, and Iraq is illegally taken here across the border. It is transformed into heroin with the help of French chemists in laboratories that are hidden in cellars in Bingol and Palu, suburbs of Elazig. Then it is transported to Europe overland in trucks with vegetables and fruit and by ship. The smugglers mostly choose the Balkan route via Sofia or Budapest. In Bratislava the heroin is loaded into Bulgarian or Czech trucks and taken to Vienna." Five extended families are in control of the drug business in Elazig, while their relatives are in Austria, Germany, Spain, Belgium, and France. The report concludes with the following statement of the German mafia expert Dagobert Lindlau: "Because of its negligence, Austria became the toy of organized crime long ago."
