FR940922-0-00041 FR940922-0-00017 This concern is consistent with the Department's intent to preserve existing tenant protections. Consequently, the rule has been modified to include statutory language prohibiting the Secretary from selling any mortgages held by the Secretary on any subsidized project unless the sale is made part of a transaction that ensures that the project will continue to operate, at least until the maturity date of the loan or mortgage, in a manner that will provide rental housing on terms at least as advantageous to existing and future tenants as the terms required by the program under which the original loan or mortgage was made or insured. In other words, sale of a HUD-held subsidized mortgage will not affect the existing regulatory agreement, prepayment restrictions, flexible subsidy agreements, rental subsidy contracts, or other applicable program regulations and housing policies. The NHLP also sought clarification that purchase money mortgages (PMMs) for previously subsidized projects will be treated like subsidized mortgages. The Department so intends and has modified the rule to make this evident. The NHLP requested that a project with any project-based Section 8 assistance be treated as a subsidized project and be sold with insurance. However, doing so would be contrary to the Multifamily Property Disposition Act. In the Multifamily Property Disposition Act, Congress revised the definition of a subsidized project for the mortgage sale program (see section 203(b)(2)). Under the prior law (see section 203(i)(2)), a project that had any rent supplement assisted units was a subsidized project. The requirement that more than 50 percent of the units had to be assisted for the project to be a subsidized project applied only to assistance provided under the United States Housing Act of 1937 (other than with certificate and voucher assistance). Finally, under the former law for purposes of mortgage sales, any unit assisted under the United States Housing Act of 1937 (other than certificate and voucher assistance) made the project a subsidized project. Under the new statutory definition of subsidized project, the more than 50 percent of the units provision applies to all forms of project-based rental assistance listed. Also, there is no longer an exception from the 50 percent requirement for mortgage sales. Thus, under the new law the definition of ``subsidized project'' is the same for the purpose of disposing of HUD-owned projects and for mortgage sales. The definition of ``subsidized project'' in this final rule conforms to the statutory definition of ``subsidized project.'' Accordingly, projects that are not Section 236, Section 221(d)(3) BMIR, or Section 202 projects and have some units, but not more than 50 percent of the units, assisted with project-based rental assistance are under both the statute and the rule ``unsubsidized projects.'' However, the Department acknowledges that such partially assisted, unsubsidized mortgages merit special treatment. Therefore, the Department plans to sell these mortgages in specialized auctions to investors who will be selected, in part, on the basis of their commitment to preserving the economically integrated nature of the rental housing. The NHLP also suggested that unsubsidized projects with affordable rents be treated as though they were subsidized and be sold with insurance. Adoption of this approach would be inconsistent with congressional direction. Therefore, the Department must reject this approach. The statute defines ``subsidized project'' as a project that is receiving assistance: (1) Under the section 221(d)(5) (Below Market Interest Rate) or the section 236 (Interest Reduction Payments) programs; (2) under the section 202 direct loan program; or (3) in the form of rental assistance for more than 50 percent of its units under the section 8, section 23, rent supplement or rental assistance payments (``RAP'') programs. This rule merely adopts the statutory definition of ``subsidized project'' as the regulatory definition. The NHLP recommended that HUD move certain statements regarding the availability of Section 8 assistance to tenants in unsubsidized projects from the preamble of the proposed rule to the regulatory text. The statements in the preamble describe HUD standards which are already addressed in other HUD regulations. As such, there is no need to repeat these standards in the mortgage sale rule. The NHLP asked why HUD would not sell mortgages without insurance to mortgagees that are HUD-approved as well as to mortgagees that are not HUD-approved. In fact, HUD plans to offer the mortgages for sale to both types of mortgagees. The NHLP also questioned the wisdom of selling mortgages to mortgagees that are not HUD-approved, on the ground that HUD will have little regulatory leverage over such mortgagees. HUD expects that HUD's relationship with such mortgagees will be governed by and enforceable under the terms and conditions of the loan sale. The NHLP recommended that HUD impose certain requirements in the event that a delinquent mortgage is restructured by a purchaser. Specifically, the NHLP recommended that the purchaser/mortgagor should agree: (1) Not to discriminate against Certificate and Voucher holders merely because of their status as Certificate or Voucher holders; (2) To accept a project-based Section 8 contract if offered, as long as the rents charged at the project are within 120 percent of the Section 8 Fair Market Rents; (3) To require good cause eviction for all tenants; and (4) To require that the owner provide good repair and maintenance. HUD's ability to regulate a mortgage restructuring will depend upon whether the mortgage is subsidized or unsubsidized. In the case of a delinquent subsidized mortgage, where the mortgage will be insured upon sale, HUD's oversight can be expected to be close and prescriptive; however, in the case of delinquent unsubsidized mortgages, where the mortgages will not be insured upon sale, HUD does not expect to regulate a mortgage restructuring closely.
