Specifically, the municipality's economic development will display the following trends: Economic growth will continue to be fairly strong, showing a trend of sustained, rapid, and healthy development. In recent years, Shanghai has continued to put large amounts of domestic and foreign capital into its economy. The marketization process is playing an increasingly prominent role in optimizing the allocation of resources; the scopes of the mainstay industries are rapidly expanding. This year, given Shanghai's market condition, quality, and efficiency, its GNP is expected to grow by approximately 14 percent. Because of the sudden surge in many large markets this year, the tertiary industry will undergo unprecedented development. Its growth rate may exceed that of the GNP, and the economic efficiency of its industries will continue to set national standards. In the wake of the implementation of the classified tax system and the continued increase in overall income, local government revenues will continue to increase at a steady pace. Development of the financial industry will accelerate; fund utilization will become even more orderly. Today, the specialized banks are operating more like commercial banks and the existing commercial banks have laid a good foundation for future development; 28 foreign-funded financial institutions have opened in Shanghai. These have created the conditions for a financial system which is unified but open, which facilitates orderly competition, and which is strictly managed. We can anticipate that even though it will be harder to raise capital this year, Shanghai's financial market will become even more orderly, and construction and production funds are assured. The opening and development of Pudong will be marked by progress in basic development which will gather momentum; the development of new functions will continue to accelerate, and city and district development will keep pace with growth. In the three years since the opening of Pudong, the first group of 10 major infrastructure construction projects has been completed two years ahead of schedule. The construction of the first group of 50 commercial buildings in the Lujiazui financial district has begun ahead of schedule. The Jinqiao export processing zone has taken in more than 200 projects; 30 have already gone into production and are among the first to harvest the fruits of development. Waigaoqiao's tax-shelter zone has as many as 800 projects; the tax-shelter market and the piers in the port area are in operation. The New Pudong District, which concetrates on international trade, export processing, and financial business, will soon reach a high tide in accelerating the development of those functions. The construction of a big market system will continue to be marked by expanded scope, orderly transactions, and the bringing in of more and more functions into play. Shanghai already has formed the basic framework of a big market system; it already has a fledgling state-class market. Last year, the municipality's volume of securities exchange surpassed 400 billion yuan; there were more than 1,600 seats in the securities exchange, with more than 100 different types of stocks being traded. Volume of transaction in the metals exchange topped 300 billion yuan. As the market plays an increasingly prominent role in optimizing resource allocation, and with the economy sustaining a fairly high rate of growth, the number of big markets and the volume of transaction in Shanghai will continue to grow, and many economic laws and provisions and market regulations will be introduced. A prominent feature of Shanghai's big market development this year will be its growing impact on the rest of the nation through its fund gathering and distribution and resource allocation functions, and it will forge even closer ties with the international markets. There will be new breakthroughs in terms of territory and scale with respect to the bringing in of foreign capital. Foreign trade will be marked by steady recovery. This year, there will be continued breakthroughs in terms of projects and dollar amount of foreign capital brought in. The secondary industry's focus in bringing in foreign capital will be on the development of heavy industry and township enterprises. Foreign investments in the tertiary industry will be attracted more to finance, commerce, and retail. Domestic sales of commercial buildings and the adoption of the BOT method will make new breakthroughs too. In the wake of Shanghai's readjustment of its foreign trade thinkings and the rapidly increasing functions of the New Pudong Zone, some enterprises that manage their own exports will become more mature; non-commodity trade will continue to increase. The rate of increase in foreign exports will equal that of the increase in the GNP. Other forms of foreign economic cooperation will also make great strides. Urban infrastructure construction will be marked by its sharp focus, accelerated progress, and clear results. This year should mark a season of bumper harvest in infrastructure construction. One by one, a group of important municipal construction projects will be completed and put to use. After the completion of the Yangpu Bridge, the second phase of the waterfront project, and the project to widen Jiangsu Road, the inner loop is completely open to traffic; the first phase of the combined sewage treatment project is in operation. At the same time, another group of municipal construction work is reaching high tide. The Number 1 subway track will be tested upon completion; construction of the elevated roadway of the Chengdu Highway will be accelerated to create a 8.3 km framework of roadways. A new round of major construction work has been unveiled. Construction of the outer loop roads and the multiple track Huangpujiang tunnel will soon begin. Acceleration of infrastructure construction will continue to promote the development of other related trades and industries and will become one of the driving forces behind the rapid economic growth. District and county economies will be marked by the development of the tertiary industry, especially by the speeding up of the development of specialty businesses, to promote economic growth. The construction of a large group of commercial and tourist facilities will be accelerated in the suburban counties. Upon strengthening unified planning, many new specialty markets will be developed in the urban areas. A central business district will soon take shape. The living standard will rise even higher, and the consumer goods market will continue to be brisk. Retail sales will increase at a rate of more than 30 percent and volume will exceed 80 billion yuan this year. Construction of high-quality commercial and residential buildings and vacation homes may slow somewhat, but domestic demand for commercial buildings and residential homes is still brisk, and construction will be stepped up. Markets for decorations and other accessories will also grow accordingly. While Shanghai's economy will continue to develop fairly rapidly, its economic development still has many unresolved contradictions--contradictions that have been around since the beginning, but in addition, there will be new effects and new problems produced by the central government's strengthening of its macro regulation and control and thorough reform. For example, there will be further increases in the demand for production funds; problems in the original channels for fund gathering and distribution will continue to grow; new chains of debt may resurface. New thinkings and new countermeasures are needed to solve the new fund predicaments. It is urgent that Shanghai increases its foreign trade development momentum, and it is imperative that enterprises actively open up new markets. They must promote development in the investment goods and the consumer goods markets and in retail and wholesale businesses under the conditions of slowing total demand and intense competition. There is a growing number of factors contributing to lower enterprise profits and higher enterprise losses. We can predict that this year will be a year full of hope. So long as it upholds the strategic principle of taking the lead in reform and solves its many problems diligently, Shanghai's economic development will continue to reach new heights.
