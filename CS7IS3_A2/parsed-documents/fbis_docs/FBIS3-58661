After the summit in Brussels the talks in Prague with central European leaders were a relaxation prior to the contacts in Moscow with Boris Yeltsin and other Russian leaders. But what can the U.S. President achieve in the nervy beginning of Russia's new "parliamentary" phase, and what sort of security solutions are he and other NATO leaders actually offering Europe? One would like to see key players being able to achieve great things. Take the newly launched Partnership for Peace (PFP), for example. Of course it would mean a great deal if a number of central European states did not simply feel disappointed, but actually saw an opportunity to begin to make a practical contribution in a far-reaching security arrangement. And take Clinton's belief that his meeting with Yeltsin will strengthen Russian democracy and developments toward a market economy or his conviction that he has solved the problem of Ukraine's nuclear arms. If only it were so simple. Or take the Brussels summit's decision to sharpen up the bombing threat against Bosnia's Serbs, if they continue to defy the United Nations. If only these Serbs, the strongest side in war-torn Bosnia, were to finally say to themselves that this time NATO is in earnest about its warning. Then the UN peacekeeping forces could at least perform some of their humanitarian mission among people who are under threat from the horrors of a second winter of war. However, in reality NATO is restating its previous, never tested readiness to intervene using aircraft, if General Secretary Butrus-Ghali at the request of the UN commanders on the ground orders the first armed action. But as a result of losses among French soldiers French President Mitterrand has finally been forced to back a seemingly new purposefulness. NATO is also making a direct linkage not only (at Clinton's request) to the lifting of the Serbs' strangulation of Sarajevo, but also to demands for a change of guard in besieged Srebrenica and the opening of the airport at Tuzla to Hercules aircraft with necessary supplies for a suffering civilian population. Tuzla's role in this context is of direct significance for Sweden. According to the warning that has just been repeated in Brussels, NATO aircraft could be deployed where the Nordic battalion has its headquarters in direct combat against Bosnian Serbs. We can ponder what this could mean for the Nordic troops' activities on the ground, but NATO's attitude illuminates as if by lightning the potential importance of the PFP offer. NATO's plans, whose aim is to hold back outside countries' wishes for full membership, opens up what are perhaps completely new cooperation possibilities that have never been on the agenda before as far as Sweden is concerned. In its diffuseness PFP clearly does not go far toward giving central Europeans a feeling of increased national security. But through joint exercises, maneuvers, consultations, and liaison officers a country like Sweden would have an insight into and be involved in the planning of peace operations that are of importance to the security of the whole of Europe. The Bildt government's reaction has been one of welcome, and the Social Democratic Party suddenly seems to see PFP as something operationally better than a role in the consultative NACC [North Atlantic Cooperation Council], of which it was until recently a keen supporter. The idea is that the PFP will be tailor-made for each country, and Sweden must of course take a closer look at the possibilities -- particularly in the light of the fact that today the Nordic battalion is already under a UN military command which has in practice been set up by NATO. But we have to realize that the prospects now opening up will not necessarily lead to a totally harmonious front against disturbers of the peace embracing both the United States and Russia. Russian ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's comment on NATO's bombing warning was that Mitterrand is mad. This is the same Zhirinovskiy who, after his unfortunately success in the elections in December, is preparing to try to dominate the Russian parliament's second chamber, the Duma. It is good that Boris Yeltsin is sticking to the new constitution which in principle increases his independence of the popularly elected assembly. But the president clearly thinks it unwise to go against Russian nationalism, which could just as well be called imperialism or revanchism. Government head Viktor Chernomyrdin reiterated to the Duma on Tuesday that the pace of reform will be slowed down; we do not know what scope for maneuver overwintering Russian reformist ministers will have. Today's Russia is in all its misery a great power which is threatening its little neighbor, Latvia, with a "very tough reaction." Not an easy partner for Bill Clinton.
