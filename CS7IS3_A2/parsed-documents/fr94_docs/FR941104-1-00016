FR941104-1-00016 FR941104-1-00002 36. Section 351.202(c)(7) is added to read as follows: §351.202 Coverage. * * * * * (c) * * * (7) A change in an employee's work schedule from other-than-full-time to full-time. (A change from full-time to other-than-full-time for a reason covered in 351.201(a)(2) is covered by this part.) 37. Section 351.203 is amended by adding alphabetically the definitions of ``Furlough'' and ``Undue interruption'' to read as follows: §351.203 Definitions. * * * * * Furlough under this part means the placement of an employee in a temporary nonduty and nonpay status for more than 30 consecutive calendar days, or more than 22 workdays if done on a discontinuous basis, but not more than 1 year. * * * * * Undue interruption means a degree of interruption that would prevent the completion of required work by the employee 90 days after the employee has been placed in a different position under this part. The 90-day standard should be considered within the allowable limits of time and quality, taking into account the pressures of priorities, deadlines, and other demands. However, a work program would generally not be unduly interrupted even if an employee needed more than 90 days after the reduction in force to preform the optimum quality or quantity of work. The 90-day standard may be extended if placement is made under this part to a low priority program or to a vacant position. 38. In §351.301, the current paragraph is redesignated as paragraph (a) and paragraph (b) is added to read as follows: §351.301 Applicability. * * * * * (b) In a transfer of function, the function must cease in the losing competitive area and continue in an identical form in the gaining competitive area (i.e., in the gaining competitive area, the function continues to be carried out by competing employees rather than by noncompeting employees). 39. In §351.302, paragraphs (f) and (g) are added to read as follows: §351.302 Transfer of employees. * * * * * (f) An agency may not separate an employee who declines to transfer with the function any sooner than it transfers employees who chose to transfer with the function to the gaining competitive area. (g) Agencies may ask employees in a canvass letter whether the employee wishes to transfer with the function when the function transfers to a different local commuting area. The canvass letter must give the employee information concerning entitlements available to the employee if the employee accepts the offer to transfer, and if the employee declines the offer to transfer. An employee may later change an initial acceptance offer without penalty. However, an employee may not later change an initial declination of the offer to transfer. 40. In §351.303, paragraph (a) is revised and paragraph (c)(3) is added to read as follows: §351.303 Identification of positions with a transferring function. (a) The competitive area losing the function is responsible for identifying the positions of competing employees with the transferring function. A competing employee is identified with the transferring function on the basis of the employee's official position. Two methods are provided to identify employees with the transferring function: (1) Identification Method One; and (2) Identification Method Two. * * * * * (c) * * * (3) In determining what percentage of time an employee performs a function in the employee's official position, the agency may supplement the employee's official position description by the use of appropriate records (e.g., work reports, organizational time logs, work schedules, etc.). * * * * * 41. In §351.403, paragraph (a) is revised, paragraph (b)(5) is removed, and paragraph (b)(6) is redesignated as (b)(5) to read as follows: §351.403 Competitive level. (a) (1) Each agency shall establish competitive levels consisting of all positions in a competitive area which are in the same grade (or occupational level) and classification series, and which are similar enough in duties, qualification requirements, pay schedules, and working conditions so that an agency may reassign the incumbent of one position to any of the other positions in the level without undue interruption. (2) Competitive level determinations are based on each employee's official position, not the employee's personal qualifications. (3) Sex may not be the basis for a competitive level determination, except for a position OPM designates that certification of eligibles by sex is justified. (4) A probationary period required by subpart I of party 315 of this chapter for initial appointment to a supervisory or managerial position is not a basis for establishing a separate competitive level. * * * * * 42. In §351.501, paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) are revised to read as follows:
