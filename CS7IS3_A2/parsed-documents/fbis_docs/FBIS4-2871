In his letter Li Lanqing, vice premier of the State Council, extended congratulations on the convocation of the work conference and expressed cordial regard to teachers, cadres, staff members, and workers throughout the municipality, who are engaging in the adult education work. He said: Developing educational undertakings and enhancing the socialist spiritual civilization represent not only the content of building modernizations in China but also an important guarantee for the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and economic construction. Under the present situation in which reform is being deepened and opening up is being broadened, it is necessary for us to upgrade in an overall way the quality of people in China and to train a large number of talented personnel suitable to the demand of modernizations and a large number of high-quality laborers. Therefore, it is imperative to put education in a strategic position of priority development. Adult education is an important component of educational undertakings in China and deserves to develop vigorously. He urged relevant personnel in the municipality to emancipate their minds, to seek truth from facts, to continuously deepen the reform by proceeding from the country's reality, to promote the healthy development of adult education through reform, and to train more outstanding and practical talented personnel so as to enable them to play an important role in the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Vice Mayor Hu Zhaoguang delivered a report entitled "Emancipate Minds, Seize the Opportunity, Deepen the Reform, and Vigorously Develop Adult Education in the Capital" at the conference on behalf of the municipal party committee and the municipal people's government. In his report he chiefly mentioned about the following five aspects: The review of adult education conducted by the capital over the past 15 years in which reform and opening up have been enforced. The position and role played by the adult education in the capital's economic construction and social development. The target and mission set for the development of adult education in the capital in a coming period. The orientation and major contents set for the capital to deepen its reform in the adult education. Major measures for the capital to vigorously develop its adult education. In his report Hu Zhaoguang said: The capital's achievements scored in the adult education has been marked. It has fostered the schooling systems of adult education; with the capital's characteristics; at multiple levels; and with multiple standards, styles, and channels. In 1993 the municipality held training classes that were attended by 3.01 million personnel. However, the present quality as a whole of several millions of labor forces in the municipality still cannot meet the demand of reform and construction. He urged governments at all levels, various industries and trades, and enterprises, to place adult education as an important daily schedule; to orient adult education into their local and departmental plans for economic and social development; and to regard it as an important content in arranging, examining, and summarizing their fiscal work. In citing the target and purpose set for the capital to achieve in development of adult education in the upcoming period, Hu Zhaoguang said: The municipality will concentrate its efforts in the coming period on enforcing the "Beijing personnel training project to cope with the personnel shortage at the high level," "Beijing training project for personnel transfer," and "Beijing training project for the staff members and workers of township enterprises." By regarding the three projects as leading targets, the municipality will promote reform and development in the adult education. Wang Mingda, vice minister of education, also delivered a speech at the work conference, in which he fully acknowledged the achievements scored by the municipality in its education work and the characteristics fostered by the municipality in its adult education. He also mentioned from the macro angle about the important role of adult education and about some issues needing attention. He said: The Beijing Municipal Party Committee and the municipal people's government have attached great importance on the adult education. The content of report made at the work conference jointly sponsored by them on adult education is substantial and the measures put in the report are helpful. The municipality will certainly play a model role in developing adult education in the country. [passage omitted]
