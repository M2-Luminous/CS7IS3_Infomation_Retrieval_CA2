Above all, many questions are raised about the pace at which it is being realized. In your opinion, are the charges of incorrect choice of the chosen privatization paths justified? Or the accusation that they are not effective from the economic viewpoint? [Kaczmarek] It seems that the all-too-frequent debates on whether we could privatize faster and better are not to be taken seriously. This is because, in my opinion, we have reached the level of effectiveness and efficiency expected of the privatization process at the present stage of its implementation. Our financial results to date are illustrated by the budget revenue of 13.5 trillion zlotys [Z]. However, we must remember that it is estimated that, between the years 1994 and 1998, the countries of the former Eastern bloc will put up for sale assets to the value of $190-200 billion. Consequently, it is hard to compare these two figures today and analyze on this basis whether much or little has been done in Poland so far. As regards the concepts on which the ownership transformation programs are based, I believe that the programs implemented so far were perfectly correct. [Kocowski] Would you give a similar rating to the West Pomeranian firms that have already been privatized? [Kaczmarek] Privatization progresses at very different rates in different regions of the country. In your voivodship, there are no strikingly exceptional projects of ownership transformations with, say, the involvement of foreign capital. But there are other excellent ideas. One of these is the pioneering solution adopted by the Szczecin Shipyard. This concept should be imitated throughout the country as an example of a wise contract entered into by managers and employees of an enterprise. Such solutions are exactly in line with my philosophy of viewing the ownership-transformation process. [Kocowski] Nevertheless, not all firms were able to follow the road to privatization as easily as that. That road has proved far more tortuous for the Szczecin Brewery, which is still trying to change its ownership status. [Kaczmarek] Indeed, that case has taken many months and we are only at the stage of the preliminary agreement. This is because the investor who wants to buy shares in the enterprise must first pay an agreed-upon sum in a down payment, within a specified time. If he fails to do so, we will be forced to begin new negotiations, which will naturally delay the completion of the process. [Kocowski] Recent opinion polls by the Public Opinion Survey Center [CBOS] investigating the population's attitude toward the Universal Privatization Program [PPP] show that 33 percent of our citizens are in favor of the program. The rest are not interested in it. Do these results bode well for the future of the privatization process? [Kaczmarek] Of course they do because they indicate that 9 million adult Poles accept the idea of privatization. This is, in any case, a very high index of popular support for the government program. I do not recall a country in which this index is higher. Of course, we need to educate the public further in order to explain to the people the economic and financial intricacies of the program. Anything thatch is new and hard to understand at first glance is bound to have a difficult time winning the public's acceptance. [Kocowski] Surely, the present situation, with a budget that has not yet been approved and a vacant office of the head of the national economy sector, cannot make it easy for you to convince anyone that privatization is a system superior to the present model of economic management. [Kaczmarek] It certainly makes it much more difficult. The economy must have a leader--someone who will realize the program course mapped out by the budget policy. After all, privatization is not a short-term proposal. It is a concept for long-term economic development.
