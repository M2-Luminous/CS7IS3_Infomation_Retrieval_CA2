FR940106-1-00056 FR940106-1-00011 _Sacramento splittail. Sacramento splittail ( Pogonichthys macrolepidotus ) are now restricted to the lower reaches of the rivers flowing into the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and the upper regions of the San Francisco Bay complex, particularly Suisun Bay and Suisun Marsh (Moyle 1976; Moyle 1980). Historically, this species occurred throughout the lowlands of the Sacramento Valley, but diking and dredging have eliminated 96% of the wetland habitats this species appears to require (Meiorin et al. 1991). Currently, the population lives largely in the shallow, low salinity habitat of Suisun Bay and Marsh but in early spring adults migrate upstream through the Delta to spawn near the mouths of the rivers along the Delta's eastern edge (Daniels and Moyle 1983). Although this migration pattern predominates for most of the splittail, lower concentrations of the species can be found in most locations in the Delta throughout the year. In recent years, fewer numbers of newly-spawned splittail have moved across the Delta, back to Suisun Bay. Recent severe declines in regions in which splittail were formerly abundant resulted in the filing of petitions to list the species as endangered under the ESA. 50 FR 36184 (July 6, 1993). The only other member of the genus, found in Clear Lake, California, became extinct in the early 1970's. No physiological studies have been done to determine the specific salinity tolerances of the splittail, but it is likely that high salinities restrict their downstream range. The scarcity of shallow habitats upstream and the increase of salinity in Suisun Bay and Suisun Marsh have greatly restricted the habitat required by this species. Sacramento splittail recruitment displays a strong relationship to annual outflow (Daniels and Moyle 1983). The exact mechanism that results in this relationship is unclear; years of higher outflow provide better cues to direct successful migration upstream by adults, larger areas of flooded vegetation on which the adults can spawn (Caywood 1974), higher flows to transport the newly spawned young downstream, and larger areas of suitable habitat in Suisun Bay and Suisun Marsh. Protection of historical habitat conditions in the Bay/Delta through the implementation of the proposed salinity criteria should therefore provide indirect protection for all the needs of this species that depend on outflow. _Estuary dependent species. In addition to Delta smelt and striped bass, several other fish species are dependent on brackish-water nursery habitat. The juveniles of these species, collectively referred to as ``estuary dependent species'' by the California DFG, live predominantly downstream of the Delta within a salinity range of approximately 0 to 22 ppt, although the range varies somewhat by species. This habitat is larger than the nursery habitat for Delta smelt and striped bass, but nevertheless has substantially diminished in size as water has been diverted and stored for upstream uses.
