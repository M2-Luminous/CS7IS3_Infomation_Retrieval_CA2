In statements to the press, the official said that the Mexican Government has always maintained a very close relationship with Cuba, not only because of their close border, but because of the obvious ties of friendship and affection between both peoples. Regarding the upcoming visit to Havana by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, Pinto Mazal said that the idea is to maintain a "very open and fluid" bilateral relation. According to Foreign Affairs Secretariat sources, during Salinas de Gortari's visit to Cuba, planned for 13 June, there will be contacts at the highest level with Cuban officials, which reaffirms Mexico's policies and principles toward Cuba. Likewise, the official emphasized that Mexico demands an end to the U.S. economic blockade against Cuba, as reflected in Friday's resolution adopted by the Latin American Economic System (SELA). Pinto Mazal ruled out highs and lows in Mexico's ties with Cuba and added that Salinas' presence in Cuba will endorse the traditional ties between both peoples.
