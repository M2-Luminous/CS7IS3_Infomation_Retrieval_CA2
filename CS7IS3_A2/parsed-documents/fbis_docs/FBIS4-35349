The source stressed that only the city's airport was targeted by Yemeni Armed Forces artillery. In a statement transmitted today by the official Yemeni News Agency, SABA', the source said that the objective of the shelling is to prevent the secessionists from using the airport to launch raids with warplanes on defenseless citizens and the forces of unity and legitimacy. The source stressed that none of the civilian installations or residential areas in Aden will ever be a target of the artillery shelling. The source explained, however, that all military targets in the city are now within the range of the unity forces' artillery, which is now engaging them from a distance of no more 14 km.
