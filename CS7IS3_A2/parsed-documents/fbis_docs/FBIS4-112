President Robert Mugabe is currently abroad seeking foreign investment. At a news conference Agriculture Minister Kumbirai Kangai accused Zimbabwe's press of being "bent on frustrating the efforts of government promoting foreign investment" with reports of how at least a dozen senior officials had been issued with large commercial farms initially intended for resettlement of landless peasants. Mr Kangai denounced the independent DAILY GAZETTE for being "misguided and mischievous". But the government was criticised for the first time from within the ruling ZANU (PF) party, with chairman of the populous and influential Mastingo Province, Dzikamai Mavhaire, denouncing the land policy as "government's worst corruption ever". His remark was a sign the scandal could create a split in the party. On March 3 the DAILY GAZETTE reported former agriculture minister, and now minister of education, Witness Mangwende, was the first beneficiary of the land policy of confiscating white-owned farms to resettle landless black peasants. Mr Mangwende pushed for the Land Acquisition Act two years ago. The act allows government to seize land and pay farmers a rate of compensation determined by government. It also excludes farmers' claims for unfair compensation. The newspaper has since named eleven other officials -- including two cabinet ministers and the police and army chiefs -- who were granted leases for land of white tenants or land bought over the last decade to resettle [word indistinct] farmers. At Wednesday's news conference, Mr Kangai repeated his assertion that "there is nothing wrong with giving farms to my colleagues", but refused to provide a list of beneficiaries. The Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace in Zimbabwe on Wednesday "condemned unreservedly the so-called tenant resettlement scheme" under which officials were granted land "at the expense of landless peasants whose need is desperate". A commission statement said the allocation of farms to officials was "highly unethical (and did not) in any way redress the disparities in land distribution, but simply has the effect of replacing one elite group with another". The commission said its concerns about the legislation had been vindicated by the current trends.
