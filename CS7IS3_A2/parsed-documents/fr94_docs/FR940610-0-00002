FR940610-0-00002 FR940610-0-00001 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;21] Alteration of VOR Federal Airway V&hyph;229; CT AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action modifies Federal Airway V&hyph;229 located in Connecticut. This action is necessary to accommodate airspace users, reduce air traffic control (ATC) coordination and improve operations. The description for V&hyph;229 is also being changed to eliminate the exclusionary language regarding R&hyph;5002A, R&hyph;5002E, V&hyph;139 and V&hyph;308. In addition, this action will correct an inadvertent error in the airway description that reversed the Hartford true and magnetic radials. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 u.t.c., August 18, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Patricia P. Crawford, Airspace and Obstruction Evaluation Branch (ATP&hyph;240), Airspace_Rules and Aeronautical Information Division, Air Traffic Rules and Procedures Service, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone: (202) 267&hyph;9255. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On November 1, 1993, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify V&hyph;229 between the Hartford, CT, Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) facility and the Gardner, MA, VORTAC. It also proposed to eliminate the exclusionary language regarding R&hyph;5002A, R&hyph;5002E, V&hyph;139 and V&hyph;308 (58 FR 58312). Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. Except for editorial changes and the correction to the Hartford 040 ○ radial, this amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice. Domestic VOR Federal airways are published in paragraph 6010(a) of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The airway listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations modifies V&hyph;229 between the Hartford, CT, VORTAC and the Gardner, MA, VORTAC. Realigning the airway will accommodate the airspace users, reduce ATC coordination, and improve operations. The airspace designation for V&hyph;229 presently excludes R&hyph;5002A, R&hyph;5002E, V&hyph;139 and V&hyph;308. These exclusions are being removed because the airspace boundaries of the restricted areas and the airways do not overlap the airspace of V&hyph;229. In addition, the Hartford true and magnetic radials used to define an intersection on V&hyph;229 were reversed. This action corrects the description to read ``INT Hartford 040 ○T(053 ○M).'' The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
