The State Duma will also demand that the Russian Government take measures in order to put an end to any uncontrolled and illegal traffic of goods through the border, especially to the Baltic states and to transferring financial funds from Russia to foreign banks. This was stated in the draft resolution which is expected to be adopted as a result of the closed parliamentary hearings in the State Duma on the Russian state borders today. The draft resolution has been worked out by the parliamentary Committee on Geo-Politics (led by Viktor Ustinov from the faction of the Liberal Democratic Party). It also recommends that the government prevent uncontrolled traffic of foreigners and persons without citizenship to Russia, especially those from China and Korea, and deport all foreigners and persons without citizenship illegally staying on Russian territory. In accordance with the draft resolution, the Duma Committees on Geo-Politics and International Affairs are expected to set up working groups which will also examine the possible conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan taking into consideration the declaration of 1956 on the Shikotan and Habomai islands. There will also be established working groups in order to make the appropriate preparations for ratification of the UN Convention on Maritime Law of 1982 and in order to assess the agreements between the USSR and the U.S.A. on the line of delimitation of maritime space.
