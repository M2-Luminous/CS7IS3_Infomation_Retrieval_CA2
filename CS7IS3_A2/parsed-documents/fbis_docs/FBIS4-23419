Speaking in Pretoria at a Department of Constitutional Development and Provincial Affairs briefing, Mr. Botha said the elections would definitely not take place in October and that even the later date was questionable. He said voter registration and ward delimitation were among the tasks that have still to be completed before local elections could take place. The negotiating council had earlier proposed that the elections be held in October.
