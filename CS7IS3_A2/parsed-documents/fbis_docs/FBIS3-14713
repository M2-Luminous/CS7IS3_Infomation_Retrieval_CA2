It is easy for any observer to diagnose, refute, and expose their suspect aims. This article is a modest attempt in that direction. After saying that "the strategy and principles of U.S. policy in the Gulf are based on establishing a balance of forces in the region with the aim of protecting U.S.interests," U.S. national security adviser Lake speaks about an endeavor by the U.S. Administration and its regional allies to maintain the balance in the region without Iraq and Iran. He believes several factors that did not exist before have helped the U.S. Administration pursue this policy. He then speaks about "the removal of the strategic consideration" from U.S. calculations with the end of Cold War and says: "The strategic importance of both Iraq and Iran has dropped dramatically"! More than that, the U.S. national security adviser goes on to say: "The general trend in the area is positive and Washington enjoys the support of basic forces in it, such as Egypt, `Israel,' Turkey, and Saudi Arabia." He adds that progress in the "peace" process has contributed toward strengthening the U.S. position in the Arab World! It is very clear that Anthony Lake is expressing wishes rather than stating facts and realities. He says things the way he and his administration like to see them, not as they are in reality. The U.S. Administration's endeavor to maintain a balance in the region with the cooperation of its regional allies without Iraq is a complete failure. What the region has witnessed over the past three years has clearly shown it is suffering from a flaw in the balance of power due to the absence of Iraqi power. This flaw from which the region is suffering has expressed itself in more than one occasion and event: Foremost was Iran's occupation of the UAE island of Abu Musa and Saudi Arabia's attack on the Qatari post of al-Khufus, in addition to other tangible manifestations. The U.S. national security adviser tells his biggest lie when he claims that "the general trend in the region is positive." The fact that neither he nor his master Clinton can ignore is that the general trend in the region is neither positive nor in the interest of the United States; in fact, it is hostile to it. Therefore, when he says that "Washington enjoys the support of basic forces in the region such as Egypt, 'Israel,' Turkey, and Saudi Arabia" he is playing with words and not telling the whole truth. These states enjoy clear and effective U.S. political, financial, and military support. In fact, some of them have become a burden to the United States because of their financial needs and political and security problems! And when he speaks about "progress in the peace process," which has helped strengthen their position in the Arab World, he is only deceiving himself, and perhaps his administration, by such talk. For there has been no real progress so far in what he terms "the peace process." And, in addition to U.S. partiality toward the Zionist entity, a partiality preventing the achievement of any progress, an Arab conviction is growing day after day that the Arab regimes taking part in the "peace process" have not received anything for their involvement from "Israel" or the U.S. Administration. The great fallacy of the U.S. national security adviser is his statement that "the strategic importance of both Iraq and Iran has dropped dramatically," because political and strategic facts cannot be changed or wished away. Nobody can create political or strategic facts that do not exist. If Iraq's strategic importance has "dropped," as he claims, has the strategic importance of any Gulf state, of limited resources and capabilities, increased even if it is an ally of the United States?! And, when Lake says "it is not strange to renew the sanctions on Iraq every 60 days without a debate" he is talking about the past rather than the present or future. What happened during the periodic review of the blockade on Iraq a few days ago confirms that what the U.S. national security adviser says is absolutely not true. There were debates and differences over the issuance of a statement renewing the blockade. Chinese, Russian, and French viewpoints conflicted with the viewpoint of the United States concerning the extension decision. In fact, it was clear that a split had occurred in the Security Council over the renewal of the blockade on Iraq. It remains to be said that the current U.S. Administration does not define its aims and means in the Gulf in light of the real U.S. interests, but is defining them under the influence and pressure of the Zionist lobby on the U.S. decision maker. What the U.S. national security adviser cannot say is that the Zionist factor plays a decisive role now in determining the aims and means of U.S. policy in the region, and that this Zionist factor stands behind all this U.S. hatred and hostility to Iraq.
