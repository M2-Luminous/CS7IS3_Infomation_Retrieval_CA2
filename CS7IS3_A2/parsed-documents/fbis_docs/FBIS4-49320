China, which has refused to establish diplomatic relations with South Africa due to its system of apartheid, will be sending a delegation from the China-Africa Friendship Association led by Vice President Xie Banding to Mandela's May 10 inauguration, he said. Wu refused to say when and if diplomatic relations between the two countries will be established.
