Under the Cotonou Agreement, signed by the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia], ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia], and the interim government, Liberia should be preparing for multiparty elections this month but the peace process has virtually ground to a halt despite the arrival of UN observers and the reinforcements for ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group]. At the end of last week, UN special envoy Trevor Gordon-Somers carried a message from the Security Council in New York back to the faction leaders in Liberia and at the weekend he had a meeting with Charles Taylor in Gbarnga. He is now back in Monrovia and on the line. Josephine Hazely asked him what the message says. [Begin recording] [Gordon-Somers] Well, the Security Council has issued a communique asking the leaders of the three parties to demonstrate tangible progress in the process and the Security Council identified that tangible process as the immediate commencement of disarmament and the immediate seating of the transitional government, and also, the council wants a schedule for the holding of free and fair elections. [Hazely] How was that message received by Mr. Taylor? [Gordon-Somers] Very well. He was in complete accord with the message. [Hazely] But, what does that mean? I mean, does that take your negotiations anywhere nearer to the end of this old saga in Liberia? [Gordon-Somers] Well, I should think so. If the three parties, and I might say that not only did Mr. Taylor find the message acceptable, but I also had met with Dr. Sawyer before and I had met with Chairman Alhaji Koromah before, and all of them accepted the thrust of the Security Council message. I think that is very positive. [Hazely] Mr. Somers, as you very well know, they always accept these messages. They always accept these resolutions and accords, but they do not put them into practice, do they? [Gordon-Somers] Well, let us say that there has been a history and there are present circumstances. I would like to believe that the parties themselves, having been reassured of the support of the international community, will be able to translate that into tangible action. [Hazely] OK, let us talk about tangible action now. When do you see this transitional government sitting? [Gordon-Somers] Remember that the sitting of the transitional government is clearly the prerogative of the three parties. The Security Council was not attempting to impose something on the parties, just to signal to them what the Security Council wants to see, so I have not yet consulted the three parties together, which I hope to do soon and see if we can reach an agreement on that. [Hazely] As you would realize, what most Liberians want to know now is: For God's sake, when is the date going to be given when we have a transitional government, when we have this disarmament started? I mean, is it not.... [pauses] Is that not what we want to hear now? The date? [Gordon-Somers] I share the frustration with all Liberians who want to hear the date. I, too, want to hear the date, and I think we are moving to that position. I wish I could be more forthcoming at this moment, but I cannot be, as you may well understand. This is a sensitive matter, and it is one in which the Liberian leadership, with all the counsel that they can get from Liberians on how soon and how quickly we can move forward.
