The historic elections are recognized by the international community as a momentous event and the completion of the transition from apartheid to democracy. The elections are the final repudiation of institutionalized racism in the world. About 22.71 million South African voters will elect a 400-seat national assembly and provincial legislatures during the three days of elections. An estimated 16.2 million members of the Black community, or 72 percent of the total number of voters in South Africa, will be voting for the first time in their life, marking the end of 342 years of the White domination. Twenty-seven parties, including the African National Congress (ANC), the National Party and the Inkatha Freedom Party, are contesting the elections, with another eight at regional level. Today is the first day of the elections, or special voting day. Voters who are physically disabled, pregnant, infirm, aged, and ill, and members of the defense force, police force and national peace-keeping force, are voting today at about 800 special polling stations, both fixed and mobile, across the country. Hospitals, homes and care centers catering for more than 200 patients are fixed voting stations while those with less than 200 patients are being visited by a mobile station which will remain at the institution until all those who wish to vote have voted. Most of the South African voters will cast their ballots on Wednesday and Thursday. On Wednesday and Thursday, 9,000 polling stations throughout the country will be opened at 07:00 (0500 GMT) on Friday at between 800 and 1,000 counting centers around the country. Initial election results are expected to be released 48 hours after the elections and final results may be announced by the independent electoral commission on May 1 or May 2. The ANC, which enjoys high reputation for its anti-apartheid struggle during the past decades, is likely to win a sweeping victory in the elections.
