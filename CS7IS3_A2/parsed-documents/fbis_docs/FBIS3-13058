"The state forces have seized the Konduz Bala Hesar (fort) and key points around the airport," the military strongman of president Borhanoddin Rabbani said in an interview. Speaking at Bagram airbase, some 50 kilometres (30 miles) north of Kabul, a relaxed and confident Mas'ud said that the Uzbek militia of ex-communist General Abdul Rashid Dostam had pulled all their heavy weapons back from the Konduz airport under pressure from mojahedin fighters Tuesday. He said before the state forces launched their offensive, armed locals in Konduz had already started to attack individuals of the Dostam militia because of the "Uzbek excesses" when they captured the city about a week ago. "They committed every sin known to man," said Mas'ud, recounting rape, robbery, kidnapping and murder. Mas'ud, who received continual radio updates on the fighting in Konduz, said more than 50 Uzbek troops had been killed and another 150 taken prisoner so far, while an unknown number of tanks had been captured. He gave no figures for casualties among pro-Rabbani forces. With the aid of a hand-drawn sketch-map, Mas'ud took pains to describe how Dostam got the upper hand in the Konduz fighting earlier. He said state mojahedin had repulsed Dostam's attacks successfully, confining the Uzbeks to the west of the Konduz River until Hezb-e-Eslami inside the city staged an internal uprising and attacked them from the rear, after which they were obliged to flee. Afterwards, these same Hezb-e-Eslami faction guerrillas, who are loyal to Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar, turned against Dostam when the Uzbeks tried to disarm them after Hezb protests about looting in the city. Mas'ud said the only Hezb-e-Eslami fighters in Konduz still loyal to Dostam "are ethnic Turkomans who are based in the mountains to the west, and who are outsiders like Dostam's Uzbeks." "In general the majority of Uzbeks in Konduz and Takhar provinces are loyal to the state, only the Turkomans side with Dostam," claimed Mas'ud. Admitting that the neighbouring town of Khanabad, 25 kilometres to the east, had also been captured by joint Dostam-Hezb forces and occupied for two days, he said it was re-captured by his troops after three days. He said advancing westwards from Khanabad, the pro-Rabbani mojahedin captured two key posts Monday -- one on the road to Konduz and the other near the airbase. "It wasn't the plan to attack the airbase. We didn't have a strong enough force but the enemy pulled back so fast our forces made a hot pursuit," Mas'ud explained. Tuesday's successful capture of Bala Hesar, once the fortress of a 19th Century Uzbek ruler in Konduz, has cut Dostam off from his base at Sher Khan Bandar on the Amu Darya River, he said. Furthermore, in an operation east of Sher Khan Bandar along this river, which forms the international boundary with the former Soviet Union, three commanders had cleaned up pockets of pro-Dostam Uzbek supporters who had "created problems for the local people," Mas'ud said. "The border is now secure between Emam Sahib and Dasht-i-Archi," Mas'ud declared.
