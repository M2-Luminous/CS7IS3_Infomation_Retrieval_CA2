The hitch, so far, has been an overly broad application of the Pressler Amendment under which US military and economic assistance to Pakistan has been cut off since 1990 on the grounds that the US president has been unable to certify that Pakistan was not in possession of a nuclear device nor in the process of acquiring one. But the aircraft have been paid for out of Pakistan's own funds and the deal simply should not be subjected to restrictions under this amendment. However the Congress and, till fairly recently, the US administration appeared quite content to use this amendment in order to deny the aircraft to Pakistan and to increase pressure on it to roll back its nuclear programme. In the face of Pakistan's refusal to oblige, the US administration appears to be taking a different tack. It now seems to be inclined to convince the congress of the merits of allowing Pakistan to supplement its strength in conventional arms in order to provide it greater incentive for not undertaking a nuclear weapons programme. Clearly the latter issue pertains to the country's perceived security needs and it is for Pakistan to determine whether it should keep its options open in this context. To the extent that the reported move by the US administration provides some hope that Pakistan will be able to get what it has paid for is an encouraging development. However, there are all kinds of lobbies within the US political and governmental circles that have been active in trying to block the move by whatever means necessary regardless of the merits of the case. Meanwhile India has also sought to influence the matter with its prime minister observing in this regard that if the aircraft were indeed to be delivered to Pakistan then his country will also be forced to review its defence requirements. Considering India's vast superiority in arms over Pakistan this is a completely untenable argument. In response to informal US proposals regarding nuclear non-proliferation and resumption of limited military and economic assistance reportedly received by the government Pakistan should make its position clear both in terms of its legitimate security requirements as well as the importance on the part of the US to meet its obligations under generally recognised principles governing transactions such as the F-16 deal. The prime minister's meeting with the U.S. ambassador on Sunday was probably meant to convey Pakistan's growing impatience on this issue to the United States government. The upcoming visit of the chief of the army staff to the US should also help clarify Pakistan's stand. If the US still appears prone to hedge on the matter then perhaps the government will have little choice but to continue to withhold further payments and take the matter to court in the United States as it is reportedly contemplating.
