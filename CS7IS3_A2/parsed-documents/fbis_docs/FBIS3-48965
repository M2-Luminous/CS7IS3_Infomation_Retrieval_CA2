The letter says that this truce was being violated by Muslim extremists who, in Karadzic's words, are intolerant of Christian holidays. "Dear Mr. Claes, I am deeply moved by your concern about the violations of the Christmas truce," President Radovan Karadzic says in his letter. He further stresses that, in this civil war, as in the previous two World Wars, the Serbs are exposed to vicious attacks by their neighbors of different denominations, especially during Orthodox Christian holidays. Underlining that the Serbs would be thrilled if the Muslims ceased their military activities, the republic of Srpska president expressed his hope that Willy Claes, as chairman of the European Union's council, could influence the Muslim side to accept the peace plan drawn up thanks to Serb concessions.
