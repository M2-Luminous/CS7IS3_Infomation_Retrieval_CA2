Led by parliament member Herve Oussamane the UDS tows a centrist line, and is the outcome of a rift that has been brewing for the past several months within the Gabonese Socialist Union [USG], one of the political organizations leaning toward the president's party. Herve Oussamane speaks here to Jean Valere Mbinamanza: [Begin Oussamane recording] In April last year, we formed the USG-CGI [expansion unknown]. The idea was to keep in tune with a political and legal procedure, because the CGI represented a political persuasion which we upheld at that time within the USG. The USG and the CGI share the same philosophy: the struggle for free expression and against social inequalities. The problem, however, is in terms of approach. We thought that one cannot claim to be democratizing the country without first democratizing the party, and we noted that, indeed, the socialist ideals for which we stood during the national conference had been relegated to the background.
