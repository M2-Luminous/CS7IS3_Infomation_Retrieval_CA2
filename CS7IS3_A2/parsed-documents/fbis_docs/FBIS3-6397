Quoting Seoul sources, JIJI reported that, although the IAEA inspection team has conducted inspections mainly in Yongbyon since 3 March, at one point North Korea refused inspection of its nuclear fuel rod plant after already agreeing to include it on the inspection list, and demanded that the IAEA provide $300,000 if it wanted to inspect this facility.
