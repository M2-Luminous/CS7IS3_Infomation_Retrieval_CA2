While several countries have already reached the inflation rates indicated by the Commission, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Britain must do more to bring down inflation in their countries, he said. However, Christophersen added that he expected both Italy and Britain to be able to get their inflation rates significantly closer to the limits indicated by the Commission by next year. The commissioner saw more rigid fiscal policies as the way to achieve that consolidation of national budgets called for in convergence programs. Here again Italy must make an additional effort to re-structure its tax system, finding alternative ways to bring in revenue -- such as the eco-tax, for example, so as to promote employment and not overburden the labor force, he said. Christophersen said it was "unacceptable" that unemployment levels remained high even in the presence of economic recovery like that observed in numerous European nations. Given the recovery, he said it was "illogical" that long-term interest rates continue rising and he insisted that it was necessary to combat this tendency through structural adjustments and interventions on the job market so as to the raise the growth rate from the present 1.6 percent to 2.5 percent in 1995. Christophersen would not be drawn on the question of when Italy might return to the European Monetary System but defined as "ambitious" the Italian government's project to create one million jobs. Although he admitted he did not know how the Berlusconi government planned to achieve this goal, Christophersen said that ambitious governments were a good thing to have.
