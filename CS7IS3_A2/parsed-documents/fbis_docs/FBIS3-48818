FBIS3-48818 "dreas020_g_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-020 Document Type:Daily Report 31 Jan 1994 SOUTHEAST ASIA Burma BBC Report on KNU Detention Said Mistaken BK3001142594 Bangkok THE SUNDAY POST in English 30 Jan 94 p 18 BK3001142594 Bangkok THE SUNDAY POST Language: English Article Type:BFN [From the "Letters" Section] [Text] SIR: In the evening session of the Burmese program on January 17 1994, the BBC mistakenly announced that ABSDF [All Burma Students Democratic Front] student leader, Moe Thee Zun, and 11 others had been detained by the KNU [Karen National Union). On account that there had been some confusion among the members of the NCUB (National Council of the Union of Burma), and a misunderstanding upon the KNU by the people and the international community [as published]. Accordingly, we, the meeting of the NCUB members present in Manerplaw, issue a statement as follows: The fact is that the BBC announcement came at a time when discussions were being held between the ABSDF led by Moe Thee Zun and the KNU, in order to prevent, in advance, any misunderstanding from occurring between the two, in connection with the KNU's decision to hold talks individually with the Slorc [State Law and Order Restoration Council], occasioned by various circumstances. The (11-1-94) Central Committee Emergency Meeting of the DAB [Democratic Alliance of Burma], which is a member of the NCUB [National Council of the Union of Burma], adopted by consensus a position expressing understanding for the NMSP (New Mon State Party) which had to hold talks individually with the Slorc because of circumstances and the KNU which intended to hold talks individually with the Slorc. The KNU accepts with understanding the implementation of their own program by its allies, the political organisations including the Student Army, though it had to decide, because of circumstances, to find solutions to political problems through negotiations. There is no serious problems between the KNU and the Student Army or any other ally. Consequently, we have to declare that the news reported by BBC correspondent Larry Jagan and broadcast by the BBC in its evening session on January 17, 1994 is incorrect.
