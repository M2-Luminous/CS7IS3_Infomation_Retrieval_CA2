FR940919-2-00113 FR940919-2-00046 Benchmarking ``Internal benchmarking'' refers to the identification and understanding of site-specific best practices that currently exist within the Agency and is focused on the improvement and standardization of internal operations. The Team completed this phase of benchmarking by reviewing lists of sites engaging in ``best practices'' which were submitted by various SSA components, and visiting or telephoning as many of these SSA and DDS offices as possible. ``External benchmarking'' is essentially the same, except the search for best practices and proven process innovations is expanded to comparable companies and organizations outside of SSA. It is focused outside the organization and is concerned with the relative performance of one specific function or process. The table below identifies the companies/organizations the Team used as benchmarking partners. BILLING CODE 4190&hyph;29&hyph;P E:GRAPHICSEN19SE94.073 BILLING CODE 4190&hyph;29&hyph;C
