European Union rules give EU citizens the right to vote and be elected in member countries other than their own, on condition of residency. The Portuguese association in France (CCPF) and the Federation of Spanish Emigre Associations in France, called for the registration period to be extended from April 15 to the end of April. With 700,000 emigres in France, the Portuguese are the largest EU grouping living as expatriates in France, ahead of both the Italians and Spanish.
