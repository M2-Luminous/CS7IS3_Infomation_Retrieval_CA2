The Act applies to all contracts entered into by executive agencies for the sale of personal property, except the following: (a) Contracts with a foreign government or agency of that government when the agency head determines that application of the Act to the contract would not be in the public interest, (b) Contracts with an international organization or a subsidiary body of that organization, if the agency head determines that the application of the Act to the contract would not be in the public interest, and (c) Contracts of the Tennessee Valley Authority unless such contracts contain a disputes clause requiring dispute resolution via an administrative process. §101&hyph;45.401 The disputes clause. The disputes clause contained at 48 CFR 52.233&hyph;1 must be included in all solicitations and contracts for the sale of personal property unless the exceptions in §101&hyph;45.400 apply. §101&hyph;45.402 Alternative disputes resolution. The Government's policy is to try to resolve all contractual issues in controversy by mutual agreement at the contracting officer's level. Agencies are encouraged to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) procedures to the maximum extent practicable in accordance with the authority and the requirements of the Administrative Disputes Resolution Act (Pub. L. 101&hyph;522) and agency policies. Dated: November 4, 1994. Julia M. Stasch, Acting Administrator of General Services.
