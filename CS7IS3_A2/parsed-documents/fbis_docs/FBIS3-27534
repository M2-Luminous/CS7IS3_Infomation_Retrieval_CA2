U.S. policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina experienced a major change over the past two weeks. Originally the United States objected to any attempt to exert pressure on the Moslem "victims," maintaining that the arms embargo on the Bosnian Moslems should be lifted. But now the United States has changed its mind, asking the Moslems to give up armed resistance and accept the offer to open negotiations in pursuit of a solution to the dispute. It was originally opposed to the peace plan based on a partition between the Serbs and Moslems in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but now it has begun to persuade the Moslems to accept the partition plan. Originally the United States had always maintained a hard line against the Bosnian Serbs and stressed the need for sanctions and military action against them, but now it has suggested that the United Nations lift step by step the economic sanctions against the Serbs. After the NATO summit, especially after the tragedy caused by the bombing of civilians in Sarajevo on 5 February, the settlement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict has become a more and more pressing need. The further extension of the Bosnia-Herzegovina war will inevitably impaired NATO's reputation to an extreme extent, and will be unfavorable to the efforts to consolidate relations between the United States and its European allies as well. So U.S. policymakers have begun to consider a readjustment of their Bosnia-Herzegovina policy. They have changed some hardline measures that used to be practiced in the past, and started playing a more active part in seeking a solution to the issue. Clinton's speech serves as a concrete indication of this change, and it has also clearly defined the orientation of the updated U.S. policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina. First of all, in his speech Clinton stressed that the United States, as the only existing superpower, cannot give up its leadership over global affairs, and its involvement in the settlement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict is in line with U.S. interests. The U.S. policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina has undergone several stages since Clinton assumed office at the White House last year. At first, the United States proposed lifting the arms embargo on the Moslem armed forces, which was vetoed by European countries. After that, the United States sent airplanes on the mission aimed at ensuring the delivery of relief supplies to the people in distress. Later on, it advocated an air raid operation against the Serb armed forces, which was given up, again because of British and French opposition. For quite a while, the stance taken by the United States had made an impression on Europe that it was looking on at others' trouble with indifference. Now that the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is further deteriorating and Britain and France have shown a greater flexibility on the air raid proposal, the United States will lose its leadership over the NATO if it still keeps looking on at the conflict with indifference. Under such circumstances, the United States needs to readjust its Bosnia-Herzegovina policy. Second, the United States, while wanting to retain its leadership over global affairs, does not want to be involved too deeply in the conflict in Europe. In his speech Clinton stressed that Europe "must assume the major responsibility" for settlement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict. The protracted Cold War has very much worn out the United States. Nowadays it can no longer meddle or directly play a part in regional conflicts wherever it wants to as it once did. Therefore, more and more Americans maintain that they should first deal with domestic problems. And this tendency has been highlighted in the Clinton administration's Bosnia-Herzegovina policy. The United States will take a more cautious attitude toward direct military involvement abroad in particular. In his speech Clinton emphasized the United States has not dispatched and is not intending to dispatch any ground force to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Third, while dealing with the European security issue, the United States needs to properly handle its relations with Russia as well. For the moment, despite the many economic difficulties it is facing, Russia remains quite influential militarily and politically. Recently, in assuming a dominant posture, Russia first managed to persuade the Bosnian Serbs to accept the conditions set by the NATO in the ultimatum and withdraw their heavy arms from Sarajevo or turn them over to the UN peacekeeping forces. After that, Russia decided to send troops to join the U.N. peacekeeping force in their Bosnia- Herzegovina mission. Russia's moves have shown the world that the settlement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict would be impossible without Russia's participation. The Clinton administration, surprised at Russia's act at first, could not but give it a welcome with reservations afterward. In his speech President Clinton said: Russia has made an important contribution to bringing forth a change in the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. According to analyses by the U.S. press, in adjusting its Bosnia- Herzegovina policy and changing its mind to support its European allies' partition plan for Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Clinton administration's greatest expectation is that all the parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina will achieve a sustained armistice under the threat of the NATO's ultimatum, so that the United States will be exempted from direct military involvement in the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict.
