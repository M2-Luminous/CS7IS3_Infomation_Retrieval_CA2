FR941017-2-00105 FR941017-2-00062 [Release No. 34&hyph;34806; File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;93&hyph;37] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Amendment Nos. 1, 2, and 3 to the Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to Exercise Cut-Off Procedures for Expiring Equity Options October 7, 1994. Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 on December 20, 1993, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change relating to the exercise procedures for expiring equity option contracts. The proposal was published for comment in the Federal Register on February 18, 1994. 3 No comments were received on the proposed rule change. The Phlx filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposal on July 12, 1994, Amendment No. 2 on September 22, 1994, and Amendment No. 3 on October 5, 1994. 4 This order approves the proposed rule change, as amended. 5 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). 3 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33610 (February 9, 1994), 59 FR 8280 (February 18, 1994). 4 In Amendment Nos. 1, 2, and 3 the Phlx proposes to make certain clarifying amendments to Rule 1042, as discussed herein. See Letters from Gerald O'Connell, First Vice President, Phlx, to Michael Walinskas, Branch Chief, Office of Market Supervision (``OMS''), Division of Market Regulation (``Division''), Commission, dated July 12, 1994; from Gerald O'Connell, First Vice President, Phlx, to Michael Walinskas, Branch Chief, OMS, Division, Commission, dated September 22, 1994 (``Amendment No. 2''); and from Gerald O'Connell, First Vice President, Phlx, to Brad Ritter, Senior Counsel, OMS, Division, Commission, dated October 5, 1994 (``Amendment No. 3''). 5 The Commission notes that substantively similar proposals by the other options exchanges are being approved concurrently with the Phlx's proposed rule change. See File Nos. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;01; SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;94&hyph;06; SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;12; and SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;94&hyph;12. Currently, with regard to expiring equity options, Phlx customers and member organizations 6 are required to indicate their exercise decisions to clearing members no later than 5:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (``E.S.T.'') on the business day immediately prior to the expiration date of the options (``Exercise Cut-Off Time''). 7 This is the latest time by which an exercise instruction 8 may be: (1) Prepared by a clearing member for positions in its proprietary trading account; (2) accepted by a clearing member from a non-clearing member; or (3) accepted by a member organization from any customer. 9 The only exceptions to Rule 1042 are: (1) To remedy mistakes made in good faith; (2) to take appropriate action as the result of a failure to reconcile unmatched Exchange option transactions; (3) where exceptional circumstances relating to a customer's ability to communicate exercise instructions to a member organization (or a member organization's ability to receive such exercise instructions) prior to the Exercise Cut-Off Time warrant such action; and (4) with respect to foreign currency options. 10 Member organizations are required to prepare a memorandum of every exercise instruction received from a customer stating the time when such instruction was received. If a member organization receives an exercise instruction or tenders an exercise notice to the OCC pursuant to one of the first three exceptions described above, the member organization must maintain a memorandum setting forth the circumstances giving rise to the exception. If the member organization is relying on either the first or third exception described above, it must promptly file a copy of the memorandum with the Exchange. 6 As used herein, the term ``member organization'' also includes individual members of the Exchange. 7 See Phlx Rule 1042. Generally, equity options may be traded until the close of business on the last business day before expiration, which is generally the third Friday of the expiration month (``Expiration Friday''). 8 For customers, an exercise instruction is a notice delivered to a member organization to exercise an option. For a member organization or clearing member, an exercise instruction is a notice to The Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') to exercise an option that would not be automatically exercised pursuant to the OCC's exercise-by-exception procedure (``OCC Rule 805''), or not to exercise an option that otherwise would automatically be exercised pursuant to OCC Rule 805. See infra note 14. The OCC has separate rules regarding the cut-off time by which exercise notices must be delivered to the OCC by the clearing members. The proposed rule change does not in any way affect the rules of the OCC. 9 In most cases, exercise instructions are transmitted to Exchange clearing members electronically through the Clearing Management and Control System (``C/MACS''). 10 Rule 1042 also does not apply to expiring index options. See Phlx Rules 1001A and 1042A. An additional purpose of the proposed rule change is to specifically state within Rule 1042 that the Exercise Cut-Off Time does not apply to either expiring foreign currency options or index options.
