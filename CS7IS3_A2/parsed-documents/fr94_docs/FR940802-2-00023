Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 1. CNG Transmission Corporation [Docket No. CP94&hyph;669&hyph;000] Take notice that on July 19, 1994, CNG Transmission Corporation (CNGT), 445 West Main Street, Clarksburg, West Virginia 26301, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;669&hyph;000 an application pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for permission and approval to abandon a storage service, all as more fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. CNGT proposes to abandon a storage service it is providing to UGI Utilities, Inc. (formerly UGI Corporation) (UGI) under CNGT's Rate Schedule GSS-II Storage Service, and pursuant to an agreement dated September 30, 1993. CNGT states that 666,667 Dekatherms of storage capacity and a maximum daily demand of 6,667 Dekatherms is provided to UGI. CNGT explains that, upon receipt of the requested abandonment, CNGT would provide UGI with GSS-II service under Part 284 of the Commission's Regulations. CNGT states that the proposal would have no impact on customers since the proposal involves the conversion by UGI of Part 157 service to a corresponding level of Part 284 service.
