While the African continent traversed some of the most difficult times in the last year, it also witnessed moments of triumph and hope. The Cairo Declaration adopted by the OAU in June last year on the establishment of the mechanism to resolve African disputes peacefully represented a landmark achievement of the organization in the political sphere. The treaty establishing the African Economic Community, that came into effect last month, was the first step Africa has taken toward economic integration and it is expected to have a significant impact on the revitalization of the African economy. The summit also acquires its special significance as it comes in the wake of the first all-race elections in South Africa, and the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as its president. Reforms to end apartheid in Pretoria have brought about world acceptance and South Africa was formally welcomed as the newest member of the OAU on May 25. But there are new challenges that the African continent is still facing. Despite the political and economic progress in the past year, some African countries are still suffering from war and domestic disputes. The conflict in Rwanda has shocked the world by its scale, brutality and savagery, which is expected to call urgent attention of the African leaders. Besides, the accumulated crucial economic and social problems are hindering development of the African countries. Over the recent years, African countries suffered greatly from the low prices of primary commodities in the international markets. The 53 OAU member states are struggling with growing foreign debts, which in 1993 amounted to 302 billion U.S. dollars, or three times the figure in 1980. The unfavorable trade balance in 1993 reached as high as 1.6 billion U.S. dollars. In Africa alone, 33 belong to the 47 least developed countries in the world. Perhaps more devastating are Africa's exploding population, which now totals nearly 700 million. According to OAU estimates, at the region's current average annual growth rate of 3.1 percent, Africa's population will reach approximately 1 billion by the year 2005. In the early years of the decade of the 1990s, the annual average growth rate of the GDP (gross domestic product) has been a mere 1.5 percent. This is barely half of the African population growing the trend of continuing decline in per capita income and a further slide into poverty in Africa. It is evident that the most pressing issue is the resolution of ethnic tension and conflict throughout the African continent. And the second most important problem is finding ways and means of combating the rising tide of economic problems. African conflicts and economic development will top the list of concern on the agenda of the OAU summit from June 13 to 15. Given the changing international situation, it has become increasingly important for African countries to maintain political stability for the benefit of economic development. In that light, the issue of assuring security for economic development will appear to be the main theme of the African summit.
