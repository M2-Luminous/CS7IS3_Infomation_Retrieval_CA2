FR941103-1-00002 FR941103-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Federal Grain Inspection Service 7 CFR Part 68 Fees for Beltsville Commodity Testing Laboratory Services AGENCY: Federal Grain Inspection Service, USDA. 1 1 The authority to exercise the functions of the Secretary of Agriculture contained in the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1621&hyph;1627) concerning inspection and standardization activities related to grain and similar commodities and products thereof has been delegated to the Administrator, Federal Grain Inspection Service (7 U.S.C. 75a; 7 CFR 68.5). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS), under authority of the Agricultural Marketing Act (AMA) of 1946, is proposing to increase service fees charged by the FGIS Commodity Testing Laboratory at Beltsville, Maryland. FGIS is also proposing to establish a test and unit fee for vomitoxin testing at the Laboratory. These revisions are necessary to cover, as nearly as practicable, the projected operating costs, including related supervisory and administrative costs, for commodity laboratory testing services. DATES: Written comments must be submitted on or before December 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments must be submitted to George Wollam, Federal Grain Inspection Service, USDA, Room 0624 South Building, P.O. Box 96454, Washington DC 20090&hyph;6454; or FAX (202) 720&hyph;4628. All comments received will be made available for public inspection during regular business hours in room 0623 South Building, 1400 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC. (7 CFR 1.27(b)). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: George Wollam, address as above, telephone (202) 720&hyph;0292. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act This rule has been determined to be significant for the purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. This proposed increase in the service fees is necessary to recover operating losses at the Beltsville Commodity Testing Laboratory. These fees were last increased on December 17, 1984 (57 FR 59887), and due to increases in operating costs, revenue is not covering operating costs. The overall cost of operating the laboratory increased between FY 92 and 93 by more than 8 percent. This cost increase occurred simultaneously with a more than 17 percent downturn in revenue due to fewer service requests. Revenue of $1,035,411 did not cover the operating cost of $1,192,669 for FY 93, resulting in a 1-year operating loss of $157,228. Given FY 93 volume, the proposed fee increase will generate revenue of $1,394,577 or an increase of $355,224. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Federal Grain Inspection Service has determined that this proposed action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Executive Order 12778 This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to have a retroactive effect. This proposed rule will not pre-empt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies unless they present irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to provisions of this rule. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification David R. Shipman, Acting Administrator, FGIS, has determined that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq .) because most users of the official commodity laboratory testing services do not meet the requirements for small entities. In addition, FGIS is required by statute to recover the costs of providing official commodity laboratory testing services, as nearly as practicable.
