These were merely preliminary contacts, but it has been learned that President Saddam Husayn did not reject the initiative out of hand. The elements apprised the Iraqi top echelons and a senior Israeli official of the situation. The objective of the contacts is to set up a secret negotiating track with the Iraqis in a bid to include Iraq in the peace process. If the preliminary mediation goes well, the elements will arrange a first, clandestine meeting between Israeli and Iraqi elements in the not-too-distant future, to be held in the presence of the Middle Eastern and European middlemen. The initiative was conceived jointly as a result of the various interests of the pertinent elements. The European interest is to rescue Iraq from the embargo. They believe this will best be achieved through Iraqi contacts with Israelis. They believe such contacts may assuage the United States' anger at Saddam Husayn. The motive here is neither the peace process nor concern for Iraq, but rather a purely economic interest on the part of the European country that initiated the mediation. The Arab element's motivation lies in the assessment that only Iraq's incorporation into the peace process will exert dramatic pressure on Syria to engage in an accelerated process and get the peace process moving. The European/Middle Eastern initiative was keenly received in Iraq. Elements close to the Iraqi top echelons have for some time noticed a subtle, almost imperceptible change in the attitude toward Israel. About a year after the war, it was learned that several of Saddam Husayn's advisers had suggested that he publicly recognize Israel as the only way out of the embargo, which was crippling Iraq. The idea, to which Saddam Husayn was cautiously introduced, seemed to enjoy the support of Tariq 'Aziz and Nizar Hamdun, the ambassador to the United Nations. The two men conveyed their suggestion separately via the president's relatives rather than directly to Saddam: Hamdun made his suggestion through Quza'i, the president's son, and 'Aziz made his through another relative. As far as is known, Saddam categorically rejected the idea of recognizing Israel. Last year, Hamdun made another attempt, which also failed. By the way, Hamdun has never hesitated to admit in private conversations that he supports Israel. A certain shift took place in September, immediately after the Yitzhaq Rabin-Yasir 'Arafat handshake. Faruq Qaddumi, who was the PLO foreign minister until then, opposed the agreement and was replaced in Washington by Mahmud 'Abbas, alias Abu-Mazin. The frustrated Qaddumi flew to Baghdad to raise support for his opposition to the process. There were rumors that a new, Iraq-supported PLO would be established. To Qaddumi's great surprise, not only did Saddam withhold his congratulations for Qaddumi's opposition to the process, but he received him with curses and profanities and sent him back to Tunis without any support, either declaratory or financial. A short time later, the Iraqi president relayed a message to 'Arafat saying that "Iraq supports the path chosen by its Palestinian brothers." Some claim that this seemingly surprising stand was the Iraqi president's way to repay 'Arafat for his sweeping support during the Gulf war. Other people, those who are familiar with the goings-on in Saddam's kitchen, believe that pragmatism, not gratitude, prompted the declaration. When Saddam said he was launching missiles at Israel on behalf of the Palestinians, he meant just that. When he said he supported the Palestinian peace process, he meant that, too, although he is still unwilling to announce it in public, primarily for domestic reasons. With or without Saddam, Iraq will be unable to remain on the fringes of the peace process for long. It shares no border with Israel, and the Palestinian problem was and is the heart of the conflict. With this problem on the verge of a solution -- be it quick or sluggish -- the main cause for Iraq's hostility toward Israel is also disappearing. The paradox is that the disappearance -- or at least the reduction -- of the Palestinian problem has caused Syria, the northwestern neighbor, to emerge as Iraq's real enemy. Both Baghdad and Damascus are ruled by the Ba'th Party, the brainchild of Zaki al-Arsuzi. Distinct brands of this party developed in the two capitals, and for many years now the parties, which derived from similar platforms, have been antagonistic toward each other. The Iraqis will not allow the Syrians to play first violin in the new Middle East orchestra that is performing to the tune of the new world order directed by Washington. Iraq's opening conditions in its contest with Syria over Washington's heart are almost impossible, but Iraq is not giving in. The Iraqi intellectuals' exposure to the West cannot be compared with that of the Syrians. Members of the Iraqi academic community are known in the best universities around the world, while Syria faces the West approximately like Albania of the previous decade. The political opening conditions are disadvantageous to the Iraqis. The other opening conditions -- academic, diplomatic, and economic -- are all advantageous to the Iraqis. Baghdad is now trying to find a crack to insert a foot that will open the American steel door that has locked Iraq out. Resorting to Israel as a way of opening this door is not the worst idea heard in Baghdad. For their part, the Syrians are aware of the possibility of a surprise from that direction. Knowledgeable sources believe that this is the true reason for President al-Asad's uncharacteristic restlessness and the sense of urgency he communicated in his meeting with U.S. President Clinton last month. The Syrian president can live with a stable Israeli-PLO arrangement. A year ago, he even said as much to journalist Patrick Seal. Iraqi recognition of Israel would be a pill too bitter for al-Asad to swallow. It would mean that in the contest between the two countries to win over the United States, Iraq would have beaten Syria, Iraq would be exculpated, and that overnight, Iraq would become the leading country in the Arab world, together with Egypt, and certainly the leading country in the region once called the Fertile Crescent. Since he rose to power in June 1992, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has been "accused" several times of playing a divide-and-rule game with Syria and the Palestinians. That may have been his tactic, but it is doubtful. To make such complex moves vis-a-vis the Arabs requires exhaustive familiarity with the map of Palestinian and Syrian power components. The prime minister is not conversant with it, and no one in his surroundings is capable of providing him with sufficient professional counseling on this matter -- not even Uri Sagi, head of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] Intelligence Branch, or the former Intelligence Branch heads, Shahaq and Baraq. The real barrier is between Syria and Iraq and not Syria and the Palestinians. As in spheres unrelated to politics, the divide-and-rule tactic is short-lived and liable to backfire against the one who employs it. The Israeli approach to Iraq should be on the strategic level, which dictates the urgency of the Israeli need to reach rapid reconciliation with the Iraqis. Two camps have long existed in Israel: the Iraqi camp and the Iranian camp. Leading elements in Israeli political, economic, and academic life have advocated alliances with either the Iraqis or the Iranians. This controversy seems to have been decided for at least the coming decade. Iran is gradually becoming Israel's No. 1 enemy. Iran's military procurement plan will very soon make it the most formidable military power in the Middle East. The blend of military power and Khomeyni's gospel is a dangerous cocktail, and it has been the cause of sleepless nights for Yitzhaq Rabin and other officials responsible for state security. Expert evaluations speak of an Iranian nuclear bomb within six years. According to various guesses, Iran already has one in the basement. The Israeli procurement of upgraded F-15's at the cost of $2 billion was designed to provide the capability to reach Iran in order to take care of the bomb problem. Just like the Syrians, Israel has always been fond of working the Middle East through messengers. That was the case with the Kurds in Iraq and the Maronites in Lebanon. An Israeli initiative for reconciliation with Iraq can serve several objectives, the first and foremost being the start of Iraq's rehabilitation and its evolvement from a crippled country to a prominent power in the eastern sector of the Fertile Crescent as a response to the Iranian threat. A strong (but not too strong) Iraq, which has a peace treaty with Israel, can become a potent counterbalance to the Iranian threat. Such an Iraq may even force the Iranians to have second thoughts about Israel. An Israeli-Iraqi reconciliation will rush al-Asad's Syria to the negotiating table and relegate the present power and prestige games to oblivion. If the initial advances take shape, Israel should seize the opportunity with both hands. Despite all the hazards which are forever present in the Middle East, it would be the most significant tactical and strategic achievement of the Rabin government's peace moves.
