Speaking in Beijing after meetings with senior Chinese officials, Senator Evans said China was very conscious of the stakes involved and very conscious of its own interests in keeping nuclear weapons off the Korean peninsula. He said Chinese ministers and leaders had a relatively relaxed attitude to the issue, leading him to think that the Chinese did not believe Pyongyang had yet made formidable developments. However, Senator Evans said he believed North Korea was certainly far enough advanced to justify thorough international inspections. Australia's foreign minister said there was great optimism on the Chinese part the dialogue would be successful in resolving the Korean crisis.
