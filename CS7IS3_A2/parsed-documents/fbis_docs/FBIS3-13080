The sources said that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher offered Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to the Palestinian president, during the latter's visit to Washington the U.S. Administration's willingness to host a high-level meeting in Washington to discuss Palestinian demands, resume the negotiations, and impart impetus to the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement, because that "would be considered an achievement and a victory over the forces of extremism." The Palestinian sources stressed "Palestinian eagerness to continue the negotiations and implement the agreement." However, they expressed the "PLO's insistence on the adoption of an international resolution, inasmuch as Security Council resolutions should not be ignored as an authority, nor should this disregard be perpetuated, as reflected in the U.S. offer." The sources stressed that the "PLO cannot ignore angry Palestinian reactions inside the the occupied territories." The sources said that "a meeting between 'Arafat and Rabin in this atmosphere will not be successful." However, they pointed out that "the U.S. position is being studied, as is the possibility of holding such a meeting" -- that is, if suitable conditions are available to ensure its success, "first and foremost the adoption of an international resolution." The sources went on: "It is the U.S. Administration which is in an embarrassing position, not the PLO, which enjoys collective international -- with the exception of the United States and Israel -- support for its demands." [passage omitted] Asked whether the PLO would accept Israeli proposals that respond to PLO demands, provided an international resolution is not adopted, the Palestinian sources stressed to AL-HAYAH that "that is ruled out, because it would constitute a precedent." They also said: "The international organization's disregard for a massacre committed within the context of a conflict on which a considerable number of international resolutions have been adopted is a precedent with regard to the Security Council and represents the first real nail in the United Nation's coffin."
