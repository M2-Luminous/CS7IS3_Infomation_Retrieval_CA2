Compliance: Required as indicated, unless already accomplished. To prevent collapse of the main landing gear caused by cracked trunnions, which could result in airplane damage, accomplish the following: Note 1: The paragraph structure of this AD is as follows: Level 1: (a), (b), (c), etc. Level 2: (1), (2), (3), etc. Level 3: (i), (ii), (iii), etc. Level 2 and Level 3 structures are designations of the Level 1 paragraph they immediately follow. (a) Upon the accumulation of 500 hours time-in-service (TIS) on a MLG trunnion, dye-penetrant inspect the MLG trunnion for cracks in accordance with the INSTRUCTIONS section of Piper Service Bulletin (SB) No. 787B, dated August 25, 1993. Note 2: If hours TIS on the MLG trunnion are unknown, hours TIS accumulated on the airplane may be substituted. (1) Prior to further flight, blend out any grinding marks in the web area (depicted in the sketches of the SB referenced above), using aluminum oxide paper, 300 grit (or finer), or an equivalent material. Alodine and repaint areas where grinding marks are blended out. (2) For MLG trunnions found cracked, prior to further flight, replace the cracked MLG trunnion with a part of improved design, P/N 67926&hyph;30, 67926&hyph;31, 67926&hyph;32, 67926&hyph;33, 39486&hyph;14, or 39486&hyph;15, as applicable, in accordance with the applicable maintenance manual. (3) For MLG trunnions not found cracked, reinspect at intervals not to exceed 100 hours TIS until the replacement specified in paragraph (b) of this AD is accomplished. (4) If one trunnion is found cracked and is replaced as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this AD, the other trunnion must still be reinspected as specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this AD until it also is replaced. (b) Upon the accumulation of 2,000 hours TIS on a MLG trunnion or within the next 100 hours TIS after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later, unless already accomplished as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this AD, replace each MLG trunnion with a part of improved design, P/N 67926&hyph;30, 67926&hyph;31, 67926&hyph;32, 67926&hyph;33, 39486&hyph;14, or 39486&hyph;15, as applicable, in accordance with the applicable maintenance manual. (1) If parts for any MLG replacement have been ordered from the manufacturer but are not available, prior to further flight and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 100 hour TIS, dye-penetrant inspect the MLG trunnion for cracks in accordance with the INSTRUCTIONS section of Piper No. SB 787B, dated August 25, 1993. If any one of the following occurs, prior to further flight, terminate the above repetitive inspections and replace the trunnion as specified in paragraph (b) of this AD: (i) Parts become available; (ii) A trunnion is found cracked; or (iii) 2,500 hours TIS are accumulated on the trunnion or 500 hours TIS after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later. (2) Replacing both the left and right MLG trunnion with P/N 67926&hyph;30, 67926&hyph;31, 67926&hyph;32, 67926&hyph;33, 39486&hyph;14, or 39486&hyph;15, as applicable, eliminates the inspection requirement of this AD. (c) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. (d) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an equivalent level of safety may be approved by the Manager, Atlanta Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), 1669 Phoenix Parkway, Suite 210C, Atlanta, Georgia 30349. The request shall be forwarded through an appropriate FAA Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Atlanta ACO. Note 3: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Atlanta ACO. (e) The inspections required by this AD shall be done in accordance with Piper Service Bulletin No. 787B, dated August 25, 1993. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.
