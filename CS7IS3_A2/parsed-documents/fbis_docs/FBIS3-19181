French and Italian judges are meeting near Aix-en-Provence today to assess the infiltration of the Mafia in the southeast of France. More details from Michelle Fine and Pascal Pons: [Fine] Even though his report stimulated the measures announced by the justice minister, Judge Thierry Jean-Pierre was the only absentee from this meeting of 30 or so French and Italian judges, where the minister announced these three measures to toughen the fight against the Mafia. [Begin Justice Minister Pierre Mehaignerie recording] Organized crime does not respect borders, therefore justice will not stop at borders. This is why the three decisions following the contacts we intend to establish in coming weeks are, first, to set up a central intelligence network to support -- this is the second decision -- special courts to deal with all forms of organized crime. The third issue, stressed by our Italian friends, is that organized crime is not only made up of obvious violent actions, but also of moneylaundering, of entering French territory to seek refuge from Italian justice. In the coming weeks, we will adopt additional laws to combat all forms of money laundering. [end recording] [Fine] Many more meetings between French and Italian judges and several months' work will be needed before the measures announced this evening can be implemented.
