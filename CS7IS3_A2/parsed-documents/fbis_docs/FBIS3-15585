The situation in Kurgan-Tyube and the neighboring districts remains calm and there are no trends for its deterioration, the major-general told ITAR-TASS today stressing that certain forces stop at nothing, including spreading various rumors, in an attempt to destabilize the situation. According to Anatoliy Kuptsov, several tragic incidents really occurred in these inhabited localities in the second half of February this year. For instance, unidentified persons provoked shooting on the territory of the Sangak Safarov collective farm in the Bokhtar district. As a result, one of the officers of a military unit of the Tajikistan Defense Ministry stationed in Kurgan-Tyube, and three civilians were killed. Unidentified bandits also killed a resident of the Bokhtar district who worked in a local branch of the international non-governmental organization "Physicians Beyond Borders". Three people in a car driving from the frontier center of Pyandzh to Dushanbe came under fire and were killed. Competent bodies are carefully investigating each criminal case, the first deputy minister noted. But already now it is possible to say that all three incidents are not of a clan or an inter-ethnic nature. They are purely criminal cases. It is no secret, the general said, that the general crime situation in the Republic is very tense, including the former Kurgan-Tyube region. There are several reasons for the outburst of criminal actions, one of them being the consequences of the recent civil war, violations of legal laws, as well as the availability of large quantities of firearms, which the local inhabitants still possess despite measures taken by the "power" structures of the Republic.
