I. Headquarters Reserve The Department is retaining in a Headquarters Reserve approximately $51.3 million of the $1.0 billion of budget authority available for allocation by formula for rental vouchers and rental certificates. Funds in the Headquarters Reserve will not be allocated by formula because these funds will be used in connection with natural disasters, litigation, desegregation, and other housing emergencies, consistent with 24 CFR 791.407. Headquarters will notify HAs when they are eligible to receive assistance from the Headquarters Reserve and may invite the HAs to submit applications. J. Other Allocations In addition to the budget authority for ``fair share'' rental vouchers and rental certificates, additional budget authority (including carryover budget authority) is available for allocation in Fiscal Year 1994 for rental vouchers and rental certificates for the following purposes: (1) Relocation, Demolition and Disposition (HOPE I, II, Section 5(h), Section 18 and Urban Revitalization) Headquarters will allocate funds directly to the HUD State or Area Offices to assist families living in public housing projects that are being demolished or disposed with HUD approval; to provide replacement housing in connection with Section 18, Urban Revitalization, HOPE I or Section 5(h) activities; or relocation assistance to families affected by HOPE I, HOPE II, and Section 5(h) activities; or assistance to non-purchasing families affected by HOPE II activities. HUD State or Area Office/Native American Programs Office requests for funding under this category will be approved on a first-come, first-served basis after notification by HUD that an application for public housing demolition or disposition, Section 18, Urban Revitalization, HOPE I, HOPE II, or Section 5(h) was approved. HUD State or Area Office/Native American Programs Office requests should include all data pertinent to determining the eligibility of the request for funding under the appropriate program and the amount of funds required. Replacement housing assistance will be provided in the form of 5-year rental voucher or rental certificate funding. (Approximately 2,988 units and $99.852 million in budget authority.)
