"Placing posts (of cabinet members) is the prime minister's exclusive authority. We should speak (only) when we are consulted or asked for our opinions. The prime minister should do it by his own decision," Ozawa said at a press conference. His remarks represented a rebuke against the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) and Sakigake [Harbinger], the three ruling coalition parties opposing Hosokawa's reshuffle plan. The proposed cabinet reshuffle is expected to center on removing Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, leader of Sakigake, from his post. Ozawa, who is regarded as the chief coalition strategist, said he will not join the 21-member cabinet upon the reshuffle. The seven parties are divided on the cabinet reshuffle, with the SDPJ, the largest among the seven ruling parties, DSP and Takemura's Sakigake against it and Shinseito and Komeito [Clean Government Party] pushing strongly for it. Ozawa reiterated calls for merging all seven ruling parties into a single group to compete with the major opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in the next general election for the House of Representatives. Takemura has opposed Ozawa's stand to set up a two-party system in Japan, hoping instead to form a third "liberal" force of Sakigake, the SDPJ, the DSP and reformists from the LDP.
