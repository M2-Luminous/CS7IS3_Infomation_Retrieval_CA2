The Left Party on the other hand has taken a sizeable step up, the SVENSKA DAGBLADET/Sifo [Swedish Institute for Opinion Research] opinion poll for March shows. For the other Riksdag parties the changes are smaller. The Moderate Coalition Party and the Center Party have continued the gains of the past few months. The Liberal Party has also moved forward, while the Social Democrats and the Christian Democratic Party are losing voters. New Democracy has lost 0.9 percentage points since last month. With 3.3 percent of votes the party is now quite a way below the 4-percent threshold for representation in the Riksdag. "It is the tumult in the party and the uncertainty about where the party is heading that are having an effect," said Alf Sjostrom, head of Sifo opinion polls. "From the very start it was clear that New Democracy was two parties really, an Ian party and a Bert party [reference to party's two founders], where Ian Wachtmeister attracted Moderate voters and Bert Karlsson hesitant Social Democrats. ``It is now uncertain whether New Democracy will become a Bert party or a former Ian party or no party at all. Many voters are therefore returning to their old parties.'' During the polling period New Democracy has lost as many votes to the Social Democrats as to the Moderates. The second large and statistically reliable change in voters' intentions is the rise of 1.1 percent for the Left Party. The party more than regained its losses from last month and is now some way over the 4 percent threshold. Many of the new sympathizers are former "stay-at-homes." The party has also attracted some Social Democrats, perhaps those dissatisfied with the party's position on the question of unemployment insurance. Some new Left Party votes also come from the nonsocialist bloc -- something that could indicate that the EU question has begun to play a role. Perhaps some nonsocialist opponents of the EU are singalling their dissatisfaction by supporting the Left Party. The overall SVENSKA DAGBLADET/Sifo poll for March is as follows, with changes from the previous months in parentheses: Social Democrats 48.3 (minus 0.7) Left Party 4.3 (plus 1.1) Moderate Coalition Party 21.4 (plus 0.4) Center Party 7.7 (plus 0.1) Liberal Party 6.7 (plus 0.5) Christian Democratic Party 4.3 (minus 0.3) Green Ecology Party 3.0 (plus 0.1) New Democracy 3.3 (minus 0.9) Others 1.0 (minus 0.3) Some 11.1 percent of those interviewed either abstained or were unwilling to name any party. A total of 3,732 people were interviewed in the period 28 February to 24 March. They were asked the question: "Which party would you vote for in a Riksdag election if there were an election today?" Four parties are currently balancing around the 4-percent threshold. The Christian Democratic Party and the Left Party each with 4.3 percent, New Democracy with 3.3 percent, and the Green Ecology Party with 3.0 percent. The Moderates and the Center Party have continued their gains of the past few months. Since December the Moderates have increased by 1.1 percent and the Center Party by 1.3 percent. The Liberal Party makes gains in the March poll, but is still below the 7.5 percent the party had in December. The Christian Democratic Party continues to move up and down, but is remaining around the 4 percent mark. The Social Democrats lost ground for the second month in a row and this month lost 0.7 percentage points. In the previous poll in February there was clear support for a new women's party. Of the 1.3 percent of voters who were willing to vote for a party other than the established parties, more than half made spontaneous mention of the women's party/women's list. Now this support has decreased. Fewer people are ready to vote for another party and fewer people mentioned the women's party/women's list. "There is therefore not the same tendency as when the Green Ecology Party or New Democracy came into being," Alf Sjostrom said. In these two cases support increased noticeably month by month. The reduced support could in part be a result of the fact that recently there has not been as much attention paid to writer Maria-Pia Boethius and her possible plans to form a new women's party. "If you are going to form a party, you really need to be outwardly active and work for the party's ideas," Alf Sjostrom said.
