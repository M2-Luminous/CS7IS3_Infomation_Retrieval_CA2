He was there to represent Congo at the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Brazzaville Conference. The Congolese prime minister used this opportunity to hold discussions with French authorities and businessmen on the political and economic situation prevailing in Congo. His interlocutors included French Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin, Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac, Socialist Party Secretary General Michel Rocard, the French defense minister's delegate, and UNESCO Director General Frederico Mayor. The topics they discussed included the political situation prevailing in Congo, cooperation between France and Congo, and the devaluation of the CFA franc. Was it an easy task? Here are the details from Prime Minister Yhombi-Opango: [Begin recording] [Yhombi-Opango] No task is ever easy. What is lacking in the current situation is communication. There is lack of communication. Before my departure for France, the government reported on the situation at a cabinet meeting, noting that there is lack of communication and lack of understanding of the government's message. That is why the head of state's recommendations to the government stated that the activities of our embassies should be reactivated at the level of the EEC countries, mainly, with Rome and Brussels. In regard to the financial and business circles, we shall not rush into anything. Discussions should be held first. We contacted some business circles to invite them back to our country for discussions. Economic issues are not tackled in the same way as political issues. Economic issues are tackled with documents and files and we have to present them. I took the liberty to invite some French financial backers to come here to assess the various fields that will be identified and to see how to revive our cooperation. [Unidentified correspondent] Do you agree to continue talks with the IMF? [Opango] Of course, yes. Our discussions with the IMF to reach an agreement are well under way. We are still waiting for the results of our discussions. I will first meet with the head of state and then with members of government for a speedy response that will be conveyed to the IMF. I am convinced that by the end of the week a memorandum of understanding representing the concrete beginning of the establishment of our program will be signed. [Correspondent] A last question, Mr. Prime Minister. What about the negotiations relating to the Arbitral College and the consultations between parliamentarians from Pool and Gnari Provinces? [Opango] I would like to say that I was very happy to see that the Arbitral College has handed down its verdict, a verdict everybody was waiting for and on which many rumors circulated. I felt particularly moved not only because of the results themselves but by the attitude of the politicians who went to Libreville and by the various statements they made. Each of them made it a point to say that they will abide by the verdict of the college on the electoral dispute which means that henceforth, the electoral process in our country has been completed and it is now up to the government, with the agreement of the president of the Republic and the friends who assisted us to solve this crisis, to see in which way things could be clarified and how to proceed with the organization of by-elections. I am saying here that when our politicians face their responsibility -- as is the case here -- to abide by a verdict, this shows that there is a certain spirit that is being established in our country and that can turn things around and bring hope to the our people. In regard to the communique signed by parliamentarians from Gnari and Pool Provinces, it was very important. We even took the liberty to disclose it officially at the dinner that was held on the occasion of the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Brazzaville Conference and all our partners warmly applauded the news because it meant the beginning of the return of peace in our country. Believe me, our country has many friends. Our country is respected abroad so when people talk about us in terms of weapons, guns, and rifles, it does not befit our image. We are a country that is still respected in France. The French are happy to recall that it was in Brazzaville that many actions were first initiated. [end recording]
