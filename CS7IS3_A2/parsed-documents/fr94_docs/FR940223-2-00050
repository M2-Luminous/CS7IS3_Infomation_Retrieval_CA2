FR940223-2-00050 FR940223-2-00035 Appendix A [Date] Announcement The American Society of Interpreters (``ASI'') has entered into a consent agreement with the Federal Trade Commission. Pursuant to this consent agreement, the Commission issued an order on [Date] that prohibits ASI, including its chapters, committees, or organizational subdivisions, from: (1) Creating, distributing, authorizing, or endorsing any list or schedule of fees or other charges for interpretation, translation, or other language services; (2) Entering into, or maintaining any agreement, plan, or program, to construct, fix, stabilize, raise, maintain, or otherwise interfere with the fees or other charges for interpretation, translation, or other language services; (3) Suggesting, recommending, or encouraging, in any way, interpreters, translators, or other language specialists that charge, adhere to, or refrain from charging any existing or proposed fee; (4) For a period of ten (10) years after the date this order becomes final, continuing a meeting after (a) Any person makes a statement to the body of the meeting, concerning the fees charged or proposed to be charged for interpretation, translation, or any other language service and ASI fails to declare such statement to be out of order, (b) any person makes two such statements and ASI fails to eject him or her from the meeting, or (c) two people make such statements; (5) Prohibiting, restricting, regulating, or advising against any form of price competition among its members or other interpreters, translators, or other language specialists, including undercutting a competitor's actual fee or a customer's announced fee, advertising discounted rates or accepting any particular lodging or travel arrangements; (6) Discouraging, restricting, or prohibiting interpreters, translators, or other language specialists from accepting hourly fees, weekly fees, or fees calculated on other than a full-day basis; and (7) Discouraging, restricting, or prohibiting interpreters, translators, or other language specialists from performing services free of charge or from paying their own travel, lodging, meals, or other expenses. In addition, the order prohibits ASI from maintaining any agreement, understanding, plan or program to: (1) Limit, restrict, or mandate the length of time that interpreters, translators, or other language specialists work in a given period, or for which they are paid for preparation or study; or (2) Limit, restrict, or mandate the number of interpreters, translators, or other language specialists hired for a job or type of job. Under the order, ``fees'' are defined to include all cash or non-cash charges, rates, benefits, or other compensation for interpretation, translation or other language services, including but not limited to, lodging, meals, subsistence and travel allowances, reimbursements for expenses, cancellation fees, and compensation for time not worked, travel time or briefing time. ``Language specialist'' means one who performs ``other language services,'' which are defined to refer to any services that involve the conversion of any form of expression from one language into another or any services incident to or related to interpretation and translation. Consequently, when the order mentions ``language specialists,'' it includes anyone who rents equipment, organizes conferences, performs teleconferencing or pr√©cis writing, supervises or coordinates interpreters, reviews or revises translations, or provides recordings of interpretations. Further, under the order, ASI must amend its Code of Professional Standards, Professional Guidelines, and Yearbook Professional Guidelines to conform to the requirements of Paragraphs II and IV of the attached order, which are summarized above. ASI must also amend its bylaws to require each member, chapter, and organizational subdivision to observe the requirements of the order. In addition, the order requires ASI to provide to its members and affiliates and to the Federal Trade Commission the text of each amendment to the ASI Bylaws, the ASI Code of Professional Standards, and all ASI Professional Guidelines, including those found in the ASI Membership Lists, and the texts of any new rules, regulations or guidelines. The order also requires that, within thirty days after obtaining them, ASI must provide to the Federal Trade Commission copies of all lists of fees that have been produced by any associations and come into ASI's possession. We note, however, that ASI will be permitted to compile and distribute accurate aggregate historical market information concerning past fees that were actually charged no earlier than three years after this order becomes final, if presented in an unbiased and nondeceptive manner that maintains the anonymity of the parties to the transactions underlying such reports. Similarly, the order does not prohibit ASI from collecting and publishing accurate publicly available information on fees paid by governmental and intergovernmental agencies if such publication states the qualifications and requirements for such fees. With any publication of fees permitted by the order, ASI must include a statement that it is prohibited from recommending fees and that interpreters must independently determine their own fees. In addition, the order states that it does not prohibit ASI from providing information or its nonbinding and non-coercive views concerning the hours of work or preparation or the number of language specialists used for a type of job. For more specific information, members should refer to the FTC order itself, which is enclosed. Counsel, American Society of Interpreters.
