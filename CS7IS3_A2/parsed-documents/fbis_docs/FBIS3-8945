The talks which according to observers concern filling ministerial posts in a new government are conducted secretly by opposition leaders. The opposition parties will meet also President Michal Kovac today to inform him about the outcome of their talks. Kovac will recall the government of Premier Vladimir Meciar against whom the no-confidence vote was passed by parliament, on Monday [14 March]. Meanwhile Ivan Laluha, representative of Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovak (HZDS) and chairman of the parliamentary foreign committee, told Slovak Television today that the HZDS would charge nobody else than Meciar with forming a new cabinet. "If the president does not agree with Meciar that it is clear that he would be talking with other political entities about forming a new government," Laluha said. He said that Chairman of the HZDS Deputies' Group Tibor Cabaj was not entitled to negotiate the composition of a new government, as the media reported. On Saturday [12 March] Kovac asked Cabaj to visit him to discuss the forming a new cabinet. Cabaj did not, however, accept the invitation citing a meeting of the HZDS Presidium which took place in Spisska Nova Ves, East Slovakia, also on Saturday. Milan Zemko from the President's Office said that in spite of Meciar's statement that the HZDS will not enter a new government, it is a "political decency" on the part of Kovac to put such an offer to the largest deputies' group. "Everything is under discussion, nothing is concluded," Stefan Harna, deputy chairman of Egyutteles (Co-Existence), a Hungarian minority movement in Slovakia, told Slovak Television after the first round of talks of the opposition parties on appointing a new government. Asked whether the name of the future premier or other ministers in a new cabinet are known, Harna said that although "nothing definitive is known," it can be supposed that the talks will end tonight. He excluded the possibility of participation of Hungarian party representatives in a new government.
