Moslems thus violated the ceasefire which they had agreed with Croats on February 25, warned a statement by the defence ministry of the Bosnian Croat state of Herceg-Bosna in the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Zagreb-based Croatian Radio said. The radio also said that Moslem forces were bringing in reinforcements and regrouping their troops around Uskolje (former Gornji Vakuf) in central Bosnia. Heavy clashes between local Moslems and Croats, former allies in their war against Bosnian Serbs, have been underway in central and southern Bosnia-Herzegovina for over a year. The clashes have not ceased even after the two sides agreed to form a Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The agreement was signed by representatives of Bosnian Moslems and Croats in Washington on March 1, under strong pressure from the United States. Moslem forces opened strong infantry and artillery fire on Serb villages and positions in the area of Mt. Ozren, northern Bosnia, on Monday and Tuesday, Bosnian Serb military sources said. The army of the Serb republic repulsed a Moslem combined artillery-infantry attack in the region of this mountain, the sources said. Strong Moslem infantry attacks were also repulsed in the valley of the River Trebava and around Maglaj in northern Bosnia. Moslem forces used helicopters to scout Bosnian Serb army positions in southern Bosnia-Herzegovina, despite the United Nations resolution on a no-fly zone over Bosnia-Herzegovina.
