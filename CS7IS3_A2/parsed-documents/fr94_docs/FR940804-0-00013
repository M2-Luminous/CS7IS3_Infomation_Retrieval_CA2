FR940804-0-00013 FR940804-0-00007 First, CPI notes that New York has failed to meet the commitment made in its 1982 SIP in a timely manner, and questions whether New York will further ``slip'' in meeting other SIP requirements. New York's 1982 SIP committed to develop and adopt an architectural regulation by January, 1986. New York did not meet this date for a variety of reasons. The Clean Air Act, as revised in 1977, provided limited remedies for a state which failed to meet Act and SIP requirements, but these were sufficient to result in New York adopting part 205 on August 15, 1988. The amendments of 1990 substantially strengthen EPA's enforcement abilities by providing specific procedures, time frames for SIP submittals and sanctions should a state fail to submit or implement their SIPs. The sanctions which the Act mandates are: restrictions on new growth of industries which generate air pollutants and a loss of federal highway funds. EPA believes these new strengthened procedures and sanctions will induce the states to fulfill their obligations. Second, CPI notes that New York committed to obtaining 11,682 tons of reductions in VOCs in its 1982 SIP, yet New York now estimates that part 205 will only result in emission reductions of 3,000 tons per year. CPI questions how New York will meet this commitment for equivalent tonnage reductions in VOCs. This comment raises concerns regarding the level of controls that have been required and the ability of New York to demonstrate attainment (i.e., rectify the shortfall). The Clean Air Act addresses both of these concerns. The Act uses a fundamental concept that sources should apply reasonably available control technology (RACT), as defined in control techniques guidelines (CTGs) or as determined by a state through a specific technical and economic review of the industry. As EPA explained in its proposed action, New York's original emission reduction was based on 1975 data which New York believes overestimated the amount of solvent based coatings used in the NYCMA, and on which the projected emission reductions were based. The present emission reduction estimate reflects current coating usage and solvent content which EPA believes is more accurate. EPA also notes that New York has regulated all the high volume coatings as well as most of the lower usage coatings that the original commitment intended. In addition, EPA has found that New York's VOC limitations are consistent with regulations of the limited number of states that have also regulated these coatings. Furthermore, section 183(e) of the Act requires EPA to regulate consumer products, which include architectural coatings. EPA has a major rule development effort underway to develop a national architectural coatings regulation that will provide more extensive and current data on coating content and usage. Once this data is available, New York will be able to reevaluate its rule to determine if additional reductions are achievable. In terms of New York's ability to reach attainment, Congress, in recognizing that many states, including New York were having problems solving their air pollution problems, set forth a procedure for states to follow in the Act as amended in 1990. This procedure consists of requirements to develop accurate current emission inventories that can be used in selecting control strategies, to adopt specific control measures, to develop reasonable further progress plans, and to develop any additional control measures needed to attain the standard by the specified dates. These requirements will address any shortfalls that remain from the previously approved SIP and insure that states, like New York, attain the ozone standard in an expeditious manner. Third, CPI raises its concern that, while New York State has adopted the regulation, it may not actually be enforcing it. Part 205 contains labeling requirements with which manufacturers of architectural coatings must comply. This provides a quick method of screening the coatings being sold. In addition, after the regulation became effective, New York State performed random checks of retail stores to ensure that only compliant coatings were being sold. New York has continued to take action to ensure that retailers and manufacturers are complying with part 205. In addition, by incorporating this regulation into New York's SIP, it becomes federally enforceable. Thus EPA has the authority to take enforcement action should EPA determine there is any lack of compliance. Conclusion The Agency has reviewed New York's request for revision of the federally-approved SIP for conformance with the provisions of the 1990 Amendments enacted on November 15, 1990. The Agency has determined that this action conforms with those requirements irrespective of the fact that the submittal preceded the date of enactment. The revision incorporates a control program consistent to the one committed to in the 1982 SIP and results in emission reductions. Therefore, New York's submittal meets the requirements of section 193. Beyond that, the revision will not interfere with the SIP's ability to meet the new Act's requirements, and thus it meets the test in section 110(i) of the Act. Because of a missing test method, EPA cannot grant full approval to this regulation under section 110(k)(3). Because the submitted regulation is not composed of separable parts which meet all the applicable requirements of the Act, EPA cannot grant partial approval for the rule under section 110(k)(3). However, EPA may grant limited approval of the submittal under section 110(k)(3) in light of EPA's authority pursuant to section 301(a) to adopt regulations necessary to further air quality by strengthening the SIP. EPA also finds that the State has partially fulfilled its commitment in the SIP to adopt an architectural coatings control measure (contained in part 205). Adoption of the missing test procedure, as discussed above, is necessary to fulfill this commitment in whole. Section 183(e)(3) of the Clean Air Act requires that EPA develop either national regulations or CTG for consumer and commercial products, which may include architectural coatings. If EPA promulgates a federal regulation for architectural coatings under this authority, then sources covered by New York's part 205 would also be required to comply with the federal regulation. New York does retain the right to promulgate regulations that are more stringent than either a federal regulation or a CTG. Nothing in this rule should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to any SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
