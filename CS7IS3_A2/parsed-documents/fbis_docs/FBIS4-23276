Almost all belong to the British Commonwealth. Mozambique is one such country, and its status as observer has led many economists and intellectuals to say that Mozambique should adopt the English language. However, speaking to RDP1 this morning, President Joaquim Chissano said Mozambique will keep Portuguese as its official language and will not seek membership in the Commonwealth. [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Will Mozambique seek full membership of the Commonwealth? [Chissano] Mozambique has never asked to join the Commonwealth. Mozambique has always asked for support and has widened its range of countries for economic and other, diplomatic, cooperation. And so the Commonwealth decided at one point to invite us to attend its meetings as an observer. This was because our country is surrounded by Commonwealth countries and because we played a very important role in the independence struggle in Zimbabwe, South Africa-Namibia. We have always been considered an important country in these processes, and the Commonwealth wanted to benefit from our practice and from our experience. But we have never asked to join the Commonwealth. Therefore I do not understand why there is concern in Portugal about whether we are members of the Commonwealth or not. [Correspondent] But will you seek to join? [Chissano] We will not ask to join. If we are invited to join, I also do not see it, even though today the Commonwealth does not mean being a member of Great Britain or paying [word indistinct] to Great Britain. It is an organization like the Islamic Conference or other conferences where countries are welcome; it is an international organization which today is not based on whether a country speaks English or not. At the moment is it the English- speaking countries. [passage indistinct] [end recording] That was President Chissano speaking on the first day of the registration of voters in Mozambique. He was speaking about the future of Mozambique and its language, and its relations with the Commonwealth. We apologize for the sound quality of the recording.
