One of the three was identified as 'Abd-al-Rahman Zino, a 37-year-old ambulance driver from Gaza City. Zino, the father of nine, was abducted from his home last Friday. Fatimah Abu-'Awdah, 55, from the town of Khan Yunus, was dragged out of her home by masked Palestinians and then shot several times. The third was Qadir Dalamli, a 35-year-old taxi driver from Gaza City, kidnapped by masked men on Thursday. Arab reporters said Dalamli's dismembered body was found outside his home inside a garbage bag. The reports said Dalamli was believed to have been a drug dealer as well as an informer. No group has claimed responsibility for the killings.
