The party views such a departure as a departure from the Yemeni people's consensus and will. The statement issued by the committee today asserts that the LSYP adheres to the Yemeni unity, views it as a destiny, and believes in democracy, political pluralism, the multiparty system, and constitutional legitimacy, which was established by the Yemeni people's consensus and in light of the general elections that were held on 27 April before the eyes of the entire world, including all the fraternal Arab countries. The statement expresses the Executive Committee's rejection of any statement, issued in the name of the league without its approval, and which conflicts with the party's positions stated in this statement. It also stresses that assigning certain tasks by the party to its representatives from the national opposition bloc is temporary and not permanent.
