LDP President Yohei Kono and SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama are scheduled to meet at 10 AM at the Diet building, the officials said. The LDP has proposed a summit meeting among leaders of the LDP, the SDP and the new party Sakigake on Sunday. LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori made the proposal at a meeting with SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo. Mori told Kubo the LDP intends to settle the latest political chaos with the three parties. Mori added that a new prime minister should be chosen as soon as possible, the officials said. Later in the day, the SDP decided to accept the LDP's proposal at a party leadership meeting, the officials said. But the New Party Sakigake has not immediately accepted the proposal. Hiroyuki Sonoda, secretary general of Sakigake, said in a meeting with Mori that Sakigake will watch consultations between the LDP and the SDP, they said. The LDP earlier the same day decided to set a priority on consultations with the SDP and Sakigake toward setting up a new government at a party leadership meeting, the officials said. LDP President Kono has showed the willingness for a tie-up between the LDP and the SDP together with Sakigake during a TV program on Sunday morning. SDP Chairman Murayama said Sunday during a TV program that he will also consider a possible tie-up between the LDP and the SDP. However, SDP's Kubo told reporters after the meeting with Mori that the proposed summit meeting does not mean the start of consultations toward setting up a new government. Kubo also said the SDP is ready to propose a meeting with outgoing Prime Minister Hata representing the coalition. Meanwhile, Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Hata's Shinseito, appeared to reject consultations with the SDP over realliance for the time being. Ozawa urged the LDP and the SDP to offer their own vision of a new government to succeed Hata's minority coalition administration.
