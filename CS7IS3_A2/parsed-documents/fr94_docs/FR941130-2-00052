FR941130-2-00052 FR941130-2-00032 In addition, a review of materials furnished in response to subpenas by the Investigative Officers indicate that, in May 1994, the carrier members agreed in a meeting of the TAA to permit such pools to continue in existence through August 31, 1994, despite concerns and complaints by some members that operation of the pools was untariffed and unlawful. It appears that the membership agreed that such pools would be limited to those already established, and further limited to shippers of dried fruit and nuts for the balance of the 1993&hyph;1994 shipping season. These latter allegations raise the implication that TAA member carriers, in addition to maintaining container pools or equipment depots on an individual carrier basis, may have participated in a TAA decision jointly to permit some carriers to operate container pools in violation of the 1984 Act. To the extent that TAA's action was further limited to certain shippers of dried fruit and nuts, other shippers of similar commodities or shippers in locations physically proximate to these so-called container pools may have been deprived of equivalent concessions or benefits, or subjected to undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in respect of such container pools. 4 4 It is unclear whether the TAA carriers individually limited their container pool practices to shippers of specified commodities as apparently was agreed for the period prior to August 31, 1994. It is also unclear that the carriers terminated these alleged practices by August 31, 1994. Now therefore, it is ordered, That pursuant to sections 10, 11, and 13 of the 1984 Act, 46 U.S.C. app. 1709, 1710, and 1712, an investigation is instituted to determine: (1) Whether the TAA or its carrier members, jointly or severally, violated section 10 (b)(1) or (b)(4) of the 1984 Act by charging a lesser or different compensation for transportation or services involving the use of container pools than the rates or charges set forth in its tariffs or service contracts, or allowed any person to obtain such transportation or services at less than applicable charges by an unjust or unfair device or means with respect to such container pools; (2) Whether the TAA or its carrier members, jointly or severally, violated section 10 (b)(3) or (b)(11) of the 1984 Act by extending to any person a privilege, concession, equipment or facility involving the use of container pools except in accordance with its tariffs or service contracts, or made or gave any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person or description of traffic with respect to such container pools; (3) Whether the TAA or its carrier members, jointly or severally, violated section 10 (b)(3), (b)(6) or (b)(12) of the 1984 Act by denying to any person a privilege, concession, equipment or facility involving the use of container pools except in accordance with its tariffs or service contracts, engaged in any unfair or unjustly discriminatory practice in the matter of container pool facilities, or subjected any particular person or description of traffic to any undue or unreasonable disadvantage or prejudice with respect to such container pools; (4) Whether the TAA or its carrier members, jointly or severally, violated section 10 (b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(4), (b)(6), (b)(11), or (b)(12) of the 1984 Act by agreeing to permit the continuation by certain carriers of the use of container pools through the period ending August 31, 1994; (5) Whether the TAA or its carrier members, jointly or severally, violated section 10 (b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(4), (b)(6), (b)(11), or (b)(12) of the 1984 Act by agreeing to permit the continuation by certain carriers of the use of container pools through the period ending August 31, 1994, which agreement limited such privileged, concessions or facilities to shippers of dried fruits and nuts in California; (6) Whether, in event violations of section 10 (b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(4), (b)(6), (b)(11) or (b)(12) of the 1984 Act are found, civil penalties should be assessed and, if so, the amount of such penalties; (7) Whether, in the event violations of section 10 (b)(1), (b)(3) or (b)(4) of the 1984 Act are found, the Commission should suspend any common carrier's rights to use any or all tariffs of the TAA and, if so, the period of such tariff suspension; and (8) Whether, in the event violations are found, an appropriate cease and desist order should be issued.
