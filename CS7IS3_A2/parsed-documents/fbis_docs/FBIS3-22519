Here is journalist Guillermo Morales with exclusive details for this newscast. Morales: Manuel Santin, national director of Hygiene and Epidemiology [name and title as heard] said these people are asymptomatic and are back at their respective work centers, where they worked before contracting the virus. He explained: (Santin): "These people had been maintaining their work status; that is, the Cuban Government protects their right to remain in their work groups. So, preferentially -- so long as it does not constitute a health risk because of, say, the intensity of the work or some potential danger inherent in the work -- the person will continue doing the work he did in the past. Where there may be limitations, where the type of work might constitute a health risk to the person, proper adjustments will be made -- with the technical committee and leadership at his work center -- and alternatives will be sought for him." Since 1983, when the AIDS monitoring and prevention program began, Cuba has reported 987 HIV-positive people: 702 males and 285 females. Of these, 230 have developed AIDS, and 147 have died to-date, according to latest statistics. This data speaks for itself when worldwide, 4,500 people are infected with AIDS every day. Bear in mind that one HIV-positive person or AIDS patient costs the nation some $42,000 per year, and that the new outpatient system does not deprive those who are able and wish to avail themselves of these possibilities from doing so. This was made very clear by Manuel Santin, director of hygiene and epidemiology in Cuba. (Santin): "(The nation) is maintaining our program of AIDS prevention and monitoring, giving it high priority. These patients, carriers of the virus or suffering from the disease, will continue to be attended to with the same priority. This investment by the state, proof of its humanistic policy and practice, will be maintained. At no time is it contingent upon economic considerations. "The resources for this, though limited because of the nation's economy, are available, so these people will receive the humane, just treatment they require." Alarm, concern, surprise over incorporation of carriers of the AIDS virus into your work centers? What if it were you? What would you think? In future broadcasts: What HIV-positive people and their colleagues at their workplaces think. This is the national radio newscast.
