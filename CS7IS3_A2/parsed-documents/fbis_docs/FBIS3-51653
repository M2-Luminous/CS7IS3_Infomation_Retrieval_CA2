MacLaren, who paid a two-day visit to Chile to enhance commercial ties and discuss Chile's possible entry into NAFTA, met Finance Minister Alejandro Foxley. Reporting on their meeting, Foxley pointed out that they discussed the various methods for Chile to join NAFTA. MacLaren mentioned the possibility that our country might directly join NAFTA through an access clause, instead of reaching bilateral agreements with each one of the NAFTA member countries. [passage omitted] Over the past few years Canada has been one of the greatest foreign investors in Chile, with investments totaling about $4 billion, basically concentrated in the mining area. The latest investment was made by the Canadian firm Lac Minerals, which formed a consortium with the U.S. company Cyprus to mine the El Abra copper deposit in northern Chile. Nevertheless, the trade flow between the two countries is very low, with Chilean exports totaling $53 million in 1991 and $63.7 million in 1992. In turn, Canadian exports to Chile totaled $157 million in 1991 and $162 million in 1992. APEC and GATT The two ministers announced their decision to continue cooperating with GATT, the establishment of a new world trade organization, and with APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation), which Chile will join as a full-fledged member in November. Foxley thanked the Canadian Government for its support for Chile's entry into APEC, and reported that he and MacLaren established the beginnings of cooperation in forming the orientation APEC ought to have. For the Chilean minister, one of the most important issues discussed in their meeting were the prospects for the international economy after agreement had been reached on the Uruguay Round. Foxley explained that the new world trade organization that will replace GATT will establish the rules and regulations; it will establish mechanisms to settle disputes, and will oversee the enforcement of the rules and regulations by the member countries. Foxley said that in the same way the two countries had managed to cooperate within the context of the Cairns Group in the discussion of the agricultural issue during the Uruguay Round, Chile and Canada should continue cooperating as medium- and small-sized countries that have common interests in the establishment of this organization. All these issues will continue to be reviewed by the next administration. MacLaren and Foxley thus participated in a working luncheon with Foreign Minister-designate Carlos Figueroa and Finance Minister-designate Eduardo Aninat. Foxley said that, with Figueroa and Aninat, "we established a line of continuity between our actions, to coordinate these negotiations and agreements and the actions to be carried out by the next administration."
