The parliamentary majority in the Georgian Supreme Council has come up with an initiative to hold an interparliamentary dialogue with Russian State Duma deputies. Our OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent contacted the head of the Georgian delegation, the parliament's deputy speaker, Vakhtang Rcheulishvili. [Rcheulishvili] We are aware of the irreconcilable positions of some deputies on both sides. But this is precisely why the interparliamentary dialogue is so important. After signing a broad agreement between our countries, it is necessary to do everything possible to establish partnership ties with the Russian Federal Assembly. Georgia has signed agreements on interparliamentary cooperation with many countries--Turkey, Azerbaijan, Ukraine, and Armenia. We need to sign such a document with Russia. Interparliamentary cooperation assumes the setting up of support groups in both parliaments. The next stage is to establish liaison between various parliamentary commissions. First and foremost economic. Keeping in mind the close integration between our countries in the past and, to a certain extent, in the future. Georgia and Russia have similar problems. Both Georgia and Russia are multinational states; they have certain problems with autonomies. Both Russia and Georgia are states in the process of building a democratic society. This is a difficult road, and we have a huge common sphere of interests. [Imedashvili] Then how do you explain the negative attitude on the part of a number of Duma deputies to the Russian-Georgian agreements? [Rcheulishvili] In my opinion, one of the main reasons is that Russian deputies lack true information on the events in Georgia. Correcting mistakes should be a joint effort--of the parliaments, governments, and information agencies. Imperial forces are quite widely represented in the Russian Duma. But we came to Russia to talk in a calm atmosphere devoid of ideological or accusatory overtones. Over the past few years this has frequently been the mode of conversation, and has brought no good to either Georgia or Russia. I believe that we will find a common language. After all, good-neighbor relations and strategic cooperation are in the true national interest of our countries. [Imedashvili] Are you not concerned about a potential meeting with Zhirinovskiy? [Rcheulishvili] I am not burning with desire to meet with him, but this possibility cannot be precluded. Zhirinovskiy's fascist statements are unpleasant; however, he alone does not make policy in the Duma. I believe that his real role has been somewhat exaggerated. We will not refuse to meet with Zhirinovskiy and representatives of his faction. We will speak to all who have been elected to the Duma by the Russian people. [Imedashvili] In which faction do you anticipate finding allies? [Rcheulishvili] Of course, we have more in common with the democratic forces. Mostly we are interested in the 12 December bloc. It has not yet taken shape as a faction, but it is a very promising group of professionals and specialists. We expect support on the part of Russia's Choice and other factions. We count on healthy forces which understand that for Georgia, Russia will always be a great partner and neighbor, despite temporary difficulties and disagreements.
