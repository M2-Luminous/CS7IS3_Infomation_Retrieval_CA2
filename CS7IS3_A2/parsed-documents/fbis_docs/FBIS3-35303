These clashes resulted in the death of four Republican Guards personnel in the Baghdad International Fair area. These clashes came on the heels of sweeping arrests and the confiscation of some $2 million from the ranks of foreign currency dealers. AL-BILAD has also learned that foot patrols have been deployed in areas suspected of being used for foreign currency dealings. Stringent instructions have been issued to the Iraqi customs officials along the borders in the Tirbil area, asking them to institute several measures, including body searches of departing travelers. They were ordered to search for and confiscate any kind of currencies, and to refer to court anyone found in possession of undeclared currencies. The Iraqi customs officials were also instructed to search incoming and outgoing vehicles and confiscate anything that looks to be excess luggage, even if it is cigarettes, personal effects, and leather jackets, in particular. The Iraqi border officials were also instructed to enforce certain measures regarding Arab travelers leaving Iraq. Foremost among these measures is that Arab residents who want to leave Iraq must obtain departure permits from the Arab Citizens Affairs Department, regardless of the time they have spent in Iraq, even if it is only 24 hours. This supersedes an earlier regulation which stipulated that only those who stayed in Iraq for one month or longer were required to obtain departure permits. Also, all Iraqi hotels of the first, second, and third classes have been ordered to obtain boarding charges from Arabs in dollars. This regulation applied only to first and second class hotels in the past.
