The research group produced the high-speed collision of a bullet with the carbon molecules to create an ultra-high pressure and ultra-high temperature state. Although the research project is only at its initial stage, the synthesized material is sufficiently pure to be used for electronic materials. Thus, the method appears to be promising as a new synthesis method for artificial diamonds. For the synthesis, the group fired an approximately 2-cm-diameter, 2-cm-long bullet toward a tungsten vessel containing C60 micropowder. The collision impact momentarily created a state of ultra-high pressure and ultra-high temperature, and diamonds were synthesized. Moreover, the group tried to rapidly cool the system after the synthesis to prevent deformation due to residual heat. Thus, highly heat-releasing gold was used to sandwich C60 inside the reaction vessel in order to be able to cool the product at a rate of 10 billion degrees per second. In the experiment, the group sandwiched 0.01 g of C60 particles with diameters ranging from 20 to 30 � (1 � is 1/1,000-th mm) between two 0.2mm-thick gold sheets, and this was placed in the vessel. A metal-tipped polyethylene bullet was made to strike that vessel, and a state of 500,000 atm and 2,000�C was created. In a time span of 0.3 �sec, C60 was converted into a 10-�-thick film. Under an optical microscope, the film was found to consist of approximately 90 percent colorless, transparent material and 10 percent intact, black C60. The size of the colorless, transparent material was 0.1mm at maximum. When studied with X-ray, carbon atoms were connected by the diamond bonding, although the overall structure consisted of amorphous diamonds with a distorted, special structure. The transparent material was harder than sapphire. Assistant Professor Kondo conjectures: ``It is likely that C60 was compressed under the ultra-high pressure to become diamonds.'' Previously, amorphous diamonds had an amorphous structure because of hydrogen contained in the crystalline structure. The newly synthesized material did not contain any hydrogen, but had carbon atoms arranged densely and uniformly. Thus, it is said to be sufficiently pure to be used for electronic and optical materials.
