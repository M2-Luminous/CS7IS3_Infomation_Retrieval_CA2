FR940513-2-00156 FR940513-2-00079 (b) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. DTC requests accelerated effectiveness for the proposed rule change pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act so that the proposed rule change can be implemented as soon as possible. Recently, the Commission adopted Rule 15c6&hyph;1 under the Act which, effective June 1, 1995, establishes three business days as the standard settlement timeframe for broker-dealers. 3 The proposed rule change, particularly the interactive capability of the ID system, will facilitate three business day settlement. Accelerated effectiveness of the proposed rule change will enable ID system users to become accustomed to the ID system well in advance of conversion to a three business day settlement cycle. 3 For a detailed description and discussion of the conversion to a three business day settlement cycle, refer to Securities and Exchange Commission Release Nos. 33&hyph;7022, 34&hyph;33023, and IC&hyph;19768 (October 13, 1993), 58 FR 52891 [File No. S7&hyph;5&hyph;93] (order adopting Commission Rule 15c6&hyph;1).
