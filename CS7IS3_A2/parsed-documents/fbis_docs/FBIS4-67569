This is not an economic move but a purposeful political action in order to save themselves from the harmful anthropogenic effects of the waste. The West sees Russia as the preferred candidate for a world garbage dump, Valeriy Timofeyev, representative of the Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service, said today at a meeting of the inter-departmental commission for ecological safety of the Russian Security Council. Judging by the report made by Aleksey Poryadin, first deputy minister for the protection of environment and natural resources, there are causes for concern. Russia produces annually about 7,000 million tonnes of waste, of which only 2,000 million (28 percent) are then used in the national economy. To date, 1,600 million tonnes of toxic waste have accumulated in the country. The situation that has come about in Russia with the formation, use, de- activation, storage, and burying of waste results in irreversible damage to the natural environment and poses a real threat to the health of Russian people. Russia already has "waste storages" that can cause ecological catastrophes, but despite this, the import of foreign toxic substances to this country continues. There is an increasingly clear tendency to conclude deals on importing and recycling dangerous waste under the guise of foreign economic projects on recycling raw materials to extract valuable substances or on giving humanitarian aid.
