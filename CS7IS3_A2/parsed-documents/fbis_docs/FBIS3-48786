With the approaching deadline, however, Japan-U.S. economic framework talks remain deadlocked. Growing economic friction between Japan and the United States will be more injurious than beneficial not only to the two countries, but to the entire world. We hope that the two countries will view the situation calmly and continue to make maximum efforts to address the bilateral trade imbalance. Treasury Secretary Bentsen, who was on a tour of Asian nations, abruptly stopped in Japan at President Clinton's request, and his surprise visit to Japan reflected deep concern the United States has over the deadlock in the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. Treasury Secretary Bentsen met separately with Prime Minister Hosokawa and Finance Minister Fujii on 23 January. During the meetings, he asked the Japanese Government to work for fruitful trade agreements and take aggressive fiscal measures to expand domestic demand. Speaking at a news conference, he hinted at the possibility of reviewing the basis for the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, saying, "If agreements hammered out at the economic framework are inadequate, it would be better not to hold such talks." At the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, both sides have agreed to treat government procurement, insurance, and automobile-auto parts as priority sectors and they have worked to reach agreements on the priority sectors by 11 February when Japan-U.S. summit talks are held. The United States still asks for setting numerical targets as an objective criteria to measure how wide the Japanese market is open. Treasury Secretary Bentsen confirmed the U.S. request in his statement. In response, Japan has persistently refused to accept the U.S. demand for setting the numerical targets since last autumn when the first round of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks was held, arguing that "setting such numerical targets will lead to managed trade." The Japan-U.S. economic framework talks have made almost little progress from the "beginning." It is hard to understand the method of setting numerical targets one by one in advance in order to promote market opening. Asian and European nations are guarding against the possibility of Japan and the United States tying up to shut third nations out of the Japanese market. Setting targets for the expansion of the trade of individual items is a matter to be judged independently by enterprises. A government should not step into that matter. Prominent American economists have sent their letters to leaders of Japan and the Untied States, arguing against setting such numerical targets. Perhaps, they have been motivated by the above rationale. As for access by individual sectors to the Japanese market, how about assessing Japan's imports six months or a year after it takes bold measures to stimulate its economy? The United States has stuck to its demand for setting the numerical targets because of a "successful example" in the Japan- U.S. Semiconductor Agreement under which Japan is said to have committed itself to a 20 percent of market share. If Japan is in recession, its enterprises would be unable to meet such numerical targets. This foolish arrangement should not be repeated. What is most important in order to avert a showdown between Japan and the United States over individual sectors is for Japan to speedily decide on stimulus measures. If Japan further delays taking the stimulus measures, it would undermine its international trustworthiness. To that end, it should carry out political reform at the earliest date. Prime Minister Hosokawa should display his leadership in and make decisions on cutting the income tax prior to raising the consumption tax, compiling a budget for fiscal 1994 with priority given to the improved livelihood of people, taking monetary measures and tax incentives to spur land transactions and enforcing deregulation in ways that it generates immediate effects. The prime minister should make urgent efforts to spread a transparent tender system not only for public works projects, but for government procurement. Japan should remove barriers to its market, while trying to recover its economy steadily whereas the United States should strengthen efforts to develop and manufacture goods that are salable on the Japanese market. The two countries should keep this principle in mind.
