In an exclusive interview with INTERFAX on Tuesday [24 May], he said that the situation would not reach the critical point. Asked whether Crimea might go back on its decision to restore the 1992 Constitution on dual citizenship and formal relations with Ukraine, Meshkov remarked that the decision had been taken by Crimea's parliament rather than president. Consequently, it is for Crimean legislators to decide how to respond to the ultimatum by Kiev, which has given Simferopol ten days to reconsider the decision. He recalled that he had asked Crimean lawmakers to postpone debates on the revision of the constitution. Queried whether Crimea expected help from Russia, Meshkov replied, "It would be enough to warn against the use of force in efforts to solve our problems." In his words, the Crimean leadership has been constantly in touch with Moscow on the issue. However, he evaded answer to a question on what precisely "Moscow tells" him. Asked about a solution to the Black Sea Fleet's problem, President Meshkov replied, "It has become more obvious that it is quite complex to come to grips with the problem without us. From the start of the talks on the issue Russia has negotiated from a reasonable and balanced position, suggesting that Crimea would take part in these negotiations or at least send its observers there." Ukraine seeks to force Crimea out of Ukraine, which was explicit when General Radetskyy (defense minister -- IF) barred the Crimean president from the talks on the Black Sea Navy in Simferopol, "He clearly deals with us as an adversary," Meshkov said.
