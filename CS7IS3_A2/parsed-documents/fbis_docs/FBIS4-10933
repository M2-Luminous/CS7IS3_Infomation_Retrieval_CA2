He got his job thanks to Carlos Menem, although he hastens to explain, "I am not servile." The new trade union leader also claims that 90 percent of labor organizations agree with the Menem model. Regarding the Radicals, he says he holds Cesar Jaroslavsky and Jesus Rodriguez in great esteem. And he confesses that he wears a suit and tie instead of the traditional windbreaker of the trade unions, out of "respect" for his interlocutors. [Rios] Why does everyone ask if Carlos Menem got you your job as head of the CGT? [Cassia] I know that people are saying that, but my conscience is clear. I was elected by the workers. It is true that I am a friend of Menem, and it is also true that the president may prefer one leader over another. But my friendship with Menem has nothing to do with the roles that everyone must play. [Rios] But you cannot deny that Menem's nod toward your candidacy gave you a certain edge over other candidates for the leadership of the CGT. [Cassia] Maybe the president likes this style of leadership that is coming to the CGT. But I am not servile. The CGT will operate completely independently of whatever maneuvering the government does. [Rios] What role did Diego Ibanez play to help you achieve the highest rank in the CGT? [Cassia] He is happy, because he devoted all of his good will to bringing this about. I am sitting here thanks to Diego's magnanimity, since he stepped aside from the union leadership. But to go from there to say that my comrade Ibanez interceded with the president to make me secretary general of the CGT is a lie. [Rios] Nonetheless, it is not difficult to imagine that Diego Ibanez's presence on the presidential staff makes Menem's office more accessible.... [Cassia] Of course, on the occasions when we need him to help us with something, Diego is always willing. But we also have direct mechanisms at our disposal for talking to the president. [Rios] Some sources say that Eduardo Bauza did not want you to be leader of the CGT because at one point you were one of the driving forces behind Jose Octavio Bordon's political aspirations. Is that true? [Cassia] I have great affection for Bauza, so that story strikes me as mindless speculation. We started working with Bordon before 1983 on a new internal line, and we were elected national deputies. But today, Bordon knows that we want Menem to be reelected and that he must choose his advisers more carefully to avoid political blunders. [Rios] Apparently you have friends only in politics or in the labor movement.... [Cassia] Well, I want to be everyone's friend. Even among the Radicals, I hold Cesar Jaroslavsky and Jesus Rodriguez, among others, in great esteem. But I also have many enemies in the field of ideas, and I always invite them to debate with me. That is why I am proposing a CGT with open doors. [Rios] Are you a businessman-unionist? [Cassia] No, I am a unionist who began working when Government Oil Deposits (YPF) was first founded. I have no businesses. Of course, if you consider that the leader of a union that set up businesses for the workers to take charge of is a businessman, then I am a businessman. But I feel that the word has a different meaning. [Rios] But there is no doubt that you, always impeccably dressed in a suit and tie, have the "look" of a businessman. Do you not like windbreakers? [Cassia] Everyone is free to dress the way he likes (laughs). I tend to wear a suit and tie out of respect for my interlocutors. I do not do so for the sake of elegance or attractiveness. [Rios] As far as the CGT is concerned, is it good or bad for you that many people do not really know who you are? [Cassia] I do not know, I have always liked to keep a low profile. I do not like to be a publicity hound. One thing I am certain of is that the best way to help the CGT will be for us leaders to get in step with the times and bring the labor movement back into the leading role it should have in society. [Rios] Cassia, you talk about supporting the model, but it does not appear to give the trade unions a starring role. [Cassia] The government knows full well that the changes were made possible by the workers' efforts. Now it is time for business to pay its fair share. Business cannot expect to just earn profits and live like kings. [Rios] In fact, some trade unionists are accused of living like kings.... [Cassia] I am not aware of that. That is a defamation campaign against the union leadership. [Box, p 10] "It Is Not My Style To Threaten Strikes" A member of the "friendship club" of unionists who support the government, and now the incoming secretary general of the CGT, Antonio "Coco" Cassia has held the reins of the United Trade Union of State Petroleum Workers (SUPE) since 1982 [as published], when the veteran Diego Ibanez delegated authority over the organization to become a full-time adviser to Carlos Menem. Back then, Cassia was already a natural member of the oil workers union hierarchy, fully involved in the transformation of YPF that resulted in the firing of some 30,000 workers. In view of that situation, Cassia and company engineered the creation of approximately 200 cooperatives and small businesses that were built on the money obtained from severance packages. - YPF Adjustment: "Of the $10 billion paid on the foreign debt, nearly $8 billion came from the petroleum sector. We contributed to the country, not to a government. Today, YPF has 8,000 actual employees and another 9,000 who were laid off but are in these business ventures." - Labor Flexibility: "I did not assume the leadership of the CGT to remain silent on labor reform. The proposal, as it stands now, favors only business. Any labor legislation will have to provide guarantees of investment, and we will not allow the workers' demands to be relegated to supplementary documents." - Social Programs: "We have commissioned a very serious survey that reveals that 70 percent of the system's beneficiaries want the unions to continue managing social programs, and they reject deregulation." - Unemployment: "The day we announce a drastic measure is the day we will carry it out. People are sick of hearing that there will be a strike, and then it is canceled. It is not my style to threaten strikes and not carry them out."
