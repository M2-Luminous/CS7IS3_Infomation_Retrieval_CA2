This enforced measure was approved at a closed session of the Federation Council. The upper chamber of the Russian parliament will continue seeking ways to settle the Ossetian-Ingush conflict. The sides themselves have viewed the extension of the regime with understanding, but without approval. Today we are publishing an interview with Vladimir Lozov, head of the Interim Administration, in which he hints that the skepticism of the parties to the conflict is nonetheless unfounded. [Gilyuk] Vladimir Demyanovich, what is your view of the current situation in the state of emergency area? [Lozov] It is still extremely complex. This is because -- in the view of the Ossetian and the Ingush sides, with which I can agree there has still been no political assessment of the armed conflict. The facts are borne out by the results of sociological studies conducted by the Interim Administration. Some 80 percent of Ossetians and 20 percent of the Ingush advocate publishing such an assessment. What is more, the factors that gave rise to the conflict have not been eliminated. [Gilyuk] Can you tell us what they are? [Lozov] In first place I would cite the Ingush Republic leadership's continuing claims to part of the territory of North Ossetia's Prigorodnyy Rayon. As for the Ossetian side, it has still not adopted a decision distancing itself from the idea that it is impossible to cohabit with the Ingush. What is more, a huge arsenal of weapons has been stockpiled in this region. And, as you know, these weapons are being used. Nor is there a unified regional policy on fighting crime. There is no well-organized cooperation between these republics' law-enforcement structures. The socioeconomic and demographic situation in the region is tricky. Tens of thousands of innocent citizens have lost their homes.... [Gilyuk] What steps must be taken to implement the Russian president's edict of 13 December last year and the accords reached in the city of Nalchik? [Lozov] In our view it is first necessary to formulate coordinated measures to implement the provisions of the edict and the protocol adopted at the meeting of North Caucasus republic leaders in Nalchik. They have not yet been elaborated. Even then they have, they will need to be implemented. [Gilyuk] What has the Interim Administration done to this end? [Lozov] We have succeeded in stabilizing the situation: The number of provocations and terrorist manifestations has dropped. We have incorporated our own view of how to settle the conflict in a number of proposals now being considered by Ingushetia and North Ossetia. Provision is being made to organize and hold talks with a view to working out coordinated practical steps to improve the situation in the region, confiscate unauthorized weapons -- the use of which is poorly monitored by local law-enforcement organs -- and detect and suppress the activity of extremist and nationalist individuals and groups which are trying to hobble the emergent process of rapprochement and the longed-for reconciliation of the two republics' peoples. It is planned to carry out a series of measures aimed at resolving the social and economic questions involved in bringing back, resettling, and looking after refugees and enforced migrants on the two republics' territory. [Gilyuk] Apart from the above plans, has the Interim Administration made any progress or achieved any concrete results in its activity? [Lozov] Yes. But first I must talk about the material and financial "injections" from the Russian Federation Government. In the last year direct spending alone to stabilize the situation in the state of emergency area has cost the Russian budget over 30 billion rubles, and remarkably, Russian subsidies make up the overwhelming proportion of both sides' budgets. We conducted an inventory of all the facilities in four population centers. A total of 2,389 homes and 63 social facilities were surveyed. To show you the scale of the tragedy and the amount of work that lies ahead let me tell you that only 915 of the 2,389 homes remained intact and 33 of the 63 social and consumer facilities had been destroyed or damaged. [Gilyuk] Vladimir Demyanovich, what must be done primarily to begin the process of bringing back refugees and enforced migrants? [Lozov] I am convinced that the process of bringing back enforced migrants must go hand in hand with moves to reconcile the inhabitants. A meeting of the two republics' presidents with a view to coordinating and formulating practical steps pertaining to the whole question of solving refugees' problems and other issues in the Kislovodsk agreements would be an extremely important political step ensuring that favorable conditions are created for the edict to be fulfilled. I want to stress that without political will and wisdom from the two leaders, backed up by the republics' organs of government and socionational movements, it will be impossible to reconcile the peoples and on that basis to bring people back and look after them.
