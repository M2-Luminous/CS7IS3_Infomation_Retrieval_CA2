These remarks have made the South Korean frontline military units become alert to North Korea's movements. Yi Yang-ho, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, attended a meeting of security-related ministries chaired by President Kim Yong-sam on 21 March. In the meeting President Kim Yong-sam ordered them to assume a full defensive posture against North Korea. Although there is no sign of unusual military movements by North Korea along the Military Demarcation Line, including its large-scale military mobilization exercise, voices denouncing South Korea through loudspeakers have been further intensified. According to the military operational plans of each Army unit, our officers and soldiers have intensified their awareness of North Korea, have continued to conduct battalion-level military exercises, and have fully maintained a military defensive posture. When President Kim Yong-sam begins his foreign trips on 24 March, the South Korean Armed Forces will assume the emergency defensive posture as was done in the past. Therefore, the South Korean Armed Forces will be more acutely strained than ever before. This atmosphere is more clearly disclosed by the holding of situational meetings by each Army division on the front line, which were held for the first time since the North Korean delegation made such provocative remarks.
