FR941007-0-00060 FR941007-0-00016 Section 4360(a) of OBRA '90 specifies that, in order to be eligible for a grant under this program, the State must have a Federally-approved Medicare supplemental regulatory program under section 1882 of the Social Security Act (the Act) (42 USC 1395ss). Section 1882 addresses the certification of Medicare supplemental health insurance policies. In general, section 1882(b) provides that, if a State establishes, under State law, a regulatory program that applies the standards and requirements that the Secretary would apply to Medicare supplemental health insurance policies under section 1882(c) and that meets certain other criteria, those Medicare supplemental policies issued by the State are deemed to meet the standards and requirements that the Secretary would, herself, apply. Thus, in order to be eligible for an ICA grant a State must operate a regulatory program that we determine meets the criteria of section 1882(b) of the Act. Section 4360(b) of OBRA '90 specifies that, in submitting an application for an ICA grant, the State must submit a plan for a State-wide ICA program. It also specifies the minimum information that the program must provide to Medicare beneficiaries. Grant funding is available to States for projects to plan, implement, operate, and/or enhance a variety of ICA activities. States may request grant funds to develop new health insurance ICA programs or to enhance existing health insurance ICA programs that meet the requirements specified in section 4360 of OBRA '90. Section 4360(a) requires us to publish regulations to establish a minimum level of funding for a health insurance ICA grant. Subject to congressional appropriations, in accordance with the requirements of section 4360 of OBRA '90, we will announce the availability of funding for health insurance ICA grants. Solicitation and grant application packages will be mailed to the Governor (or his or her designee) of each eligible State. The closing date for receipt of applications will be approximately 60 days thereafter. Awards for health insurance ICA grants will be made before October 1 of the year in which the solicitation is made. ICA grants will be administered in accordance with the provisions of: 42 CFR part 403, subpart E; 45 CFR part 74, (which concerns administration of grants) as specified by ยง74.4(a)(2); 45 CFR part 92 (which concerns uniform administrative requirements for grants and cooperative agreements to State and local governments); the terms of the solicitation; and the terms of the notice of grant award. II. Provisions of this Final Rule With Comment Period On August 26, 1992, we published an interim final rule with comment period (57 FR 38616) that established a minimum level of funding for health insurance ICA grants made for fiscal years 1992 and 1993. Those provisions are contained at 42 CFR part 403, subpart E. In general, this final rule amends those provisions in order to establish a basis in regulations for continuation funding beyond FY 1993. It also eliminates the program of supplemental coordinated care grants. The provisions of this final rule with comment period are discussed below. A. Eligibility for Grants Based on sections 4360 (a) and (b) of OBRA '90, this rule specifies, in ยง403.501, that, in order to be eligible for a health insurance ICA grant, the State must_
