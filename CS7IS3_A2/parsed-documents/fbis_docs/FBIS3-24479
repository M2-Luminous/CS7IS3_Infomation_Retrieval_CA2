The need for studying trace metal content in crudes is important from the geochemical, metal ore, technological, economic, and ecological aspects. In the present work the distribution of trace elements in various crudes of the paleocenozoic incrustation of the Afghan-Tadzhik basin are discussed in conjunction with an evaluation of their metal content. Abnormally high concentrations of a number of trace elements, significantly exceeding the Clarke contents of the same elements in clayey deposits, are indicated. Trace element enrichment of the crudes is largely due to hypergenic transformation processes, since ore-bearing concentrations of trace elements are related to high viscosity, heavy, asphaltic crudes. The crudes of the Afghan-Tadzhik basin may serve as an alternative source of such metals as vanadium, nickel, copper, chromium, cobalt, and possibly others. Figure 1; references 10 (Russian).
