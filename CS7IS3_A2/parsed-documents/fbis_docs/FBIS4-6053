He indicated a bright outlook, saying: "I have the impression that progress will be made in bilateral negotiations. We should see some kind of results in the future." However, he failed to comment on such points as the specific period of return of the airfield and how the issue is being handled in bilateral talks. About a recent U.S. military aircraft mishap, municipal government authorities from areas surrounding Kadena Air Base have demanded public disclosure of outcome of investigations into the cause of the accident. In this regard, Mondale kept his comments short, saying: "As the ambassador, I am hoping that a disclosure will be made." He thus indicated the matter would be left for further consideration by authorities concerned, including the military. The ambassador departed Okinawa after the news conference. On the U.S. military base issues, Mondale told reporters: "Since this is my first visit to Okinawa, I cannot answer in detail." He then stressed: "The United States and Japan are continuing to make efforts toward improving the situation, including such problems as aircraft noise." On the concentration of U.S. military bases on Okinawa, Mondale said: "The scale of military bases and activities here remain the sole responsibility of the United States." However, he added: "As a signatory of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, the United States bears a serious responsibility to defend Japan and the surrounding area." He thus reiterated the traditional U.S. stance, stressing the importance of U.S. military presence to respond to possible tension in the Asian region and making other similar references. Although the ambassador failed to make in-depth comments on the issue of the scaling down of U.S. military bases on Okinawa, he did comment on the issue of the return of Yomitan auxiliary airfield, which was discussed at last month's Japan-U.S. security talks. Mondale said: "Although it will require persistence, some kind of results should appear in the future." He thus gave a strong impression the airfield would be returned. U.S. Consul General for Okinawa Richard Christenson, who was present at the news conference, said: "Negotiations are being continued between the United States and Japan, but it will take more time."
