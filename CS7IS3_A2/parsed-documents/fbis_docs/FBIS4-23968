[passage omitted] In a last-ditch attempt to win RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] support for its initiative, last night France sent Jean-Michel Marlaud, the evacuated ambassador to Kigali, back to Rwanda. This triggered a race against the clock, since a favorable vote from the UN Security Council, which in principle should be taken for granted, can scarcely be envisaged if the Rwandan rebels continue to want to fight the "humanitarian protection force." It is true that France has requested an offensive mandate allowing it "to impose peace by forceful means," in accordance with Chapter 7 of the UN Charter. However, after the bloody failure of the Americans in Somalia, what country would send its men into another "humanitarian war?" Moreover, since they are planning to enter Rwanda from Zaire, it is hard to envisage the French soldiers entering the hideouts of the "government" forces with the acclamation of the authors of the genocide wielding clubs, machetes, and nailed boards. These militias believe, as do the RPF, that the French have come to "help" them once again. Hindered by this "image problem," the French chiefs-of-staff are trying to obtain, for the Senegalese or Italian troops who are ready to participate, the right to pass through rebel-held territory, entering via Uganda. A military source in Paris explained yesterday evening: "For the Italians, we will be stressing their Catholicism and the many evangelization missions...," although he admitted that "this is far from cut and dried." By making a clear distinction between humanitarian aid and the envisaged "military-humanitarian" mission, the RPF nonetheless authorized the transit of 30 tonnes of emergency supplies sent by France from Uganda. Despite the "French military threat," the Rwandan rebels have even promised to keep this humanitarian corridor open "for regular convoys." A French official yesterday explained: "We have sidelined the leading extremists of our former policy, which was totally pro-Hutu," quoting the name of General Huchon at the Cooperation Ministry. "However, by intervening in the west of Rwanda and making the government-held zone, where much of the population has taken refuge, a safe area, we will create a kind of Hutuland which would otherwise be militarily condemned. It is clearly a political maneuver, and, in the wake of the Tutu genocide, one that will be completely unacceptable to the RPF." Already, in his article printed last Tuesday in LIBERATION, [Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe had stressed "the need for a restart of political dialogue, irrespective of the situation on the ground." Where the massacres were concerned, he also demanded that those responsible for "these genocides" -- in the plural -- be brought to trial...
