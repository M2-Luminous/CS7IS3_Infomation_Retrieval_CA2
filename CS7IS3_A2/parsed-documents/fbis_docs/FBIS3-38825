The task, if carried out, will fall on NATO, which is to discuss air strikes at Wednesday's [9 February] meeting. Antonio Esteves Martins reports from Brussels. [Martins] Following five hours of difficult discussions, the EU's only demand was an end to the siege on Sarajevo. The twelve foreign ministers, who do not rule out air strikes against Serb positions besieging Sarajevo, have left the final decision to the extraordinary meeting of the North Atlantic Council. This decision hardly hides the difficulties and the difference of opinion between the French, who advocate air strikes, and the British who oppose any type of military action. [Begin recording] [Portuguese Foreign Minister Durao Barroso] The objective cannot be merely revenge, or punishment. It is a show of force resulting from our indignation at what appeared to us to be a highly condemnable act of violence. It is within this context that a decision will have to be taken in close consultation with our allies and bearing in mind, above all, the opinion of those who have soldiers and considerable forces on the ground. [end recording] [Martins] In other words, an ultimatum was not issued today as the French wanted, but the use of force was not ruled out. Therefore, the message emerging from here could be seen by the Bosnian Serbs as a sign of weakness. [Begin recording] [Barroso] We are conscious that this position may appear in some way condescending, but I should recall that we have always said that this conflict was not an easy one, and when a problem is not easy then there are no easy solutions either. [end recording] [passage omitted]
