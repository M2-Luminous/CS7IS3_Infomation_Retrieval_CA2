The theme of "Land Day" this year is "land and market." As an element of production simultaneously boasting the duel properties of resource and asset, land is of particularly vital significance to social and economic development in China. Over the past few years, along with the establishment and development of a socialist market economic structure, and impelled by the land use structural reform, China's land market has grown out of nothing and has gradually taken shape. In some key cities of the developed regions, its development has been even faster. Land, having been sluggish for a long time, began to be enlivened as an important element of production, and the right to use it began its compensatory flow as a special commodity between owner and user and among users. The proportion of land transferred through the market rather than administrative allocation is increasingly larger. The formation and development of the land market with compensatory use of land as its core content has played a vigorous role of promotion in China in such aspects as effecting rational allocation of land resources, increasing government financial revenues, accelerating urban construction, developing secondary and tertiary industries, improving the investment environment, absorbing foreign capital, and so on. The formation and development of the land market is the product of China's economic structural reform on the one hand, and has energetically pushed forward other related in-depth reforms on the other. For example, the achievements attained in the structural reforms in planning, banking, housing, and farm land, as well as in the establishment of a modern enterprise system and the invigoration of large and medium-sized state enterprises, for which the entire people, from top to bottom, have shown great concern, are all closely related to the reform of the land use system and the construction and cultivation of the land market. The newly emerging land market in China has become part and parcel of the socialist market economic structure. In the meantime, we should also soberly note that the time for reforming China's land use system is short, and the problems left over from the old land use system are numerous. The land market is still in a growing and shaping stage, so it is immature and has yet to be standardized. Therefore, it is unavoidable that some problems exist, though they should not be neglected. Take, for example, the phenomena of giving overlapping approval of land and of approving land ultra vires in violation of the law, which have emerged in some localities in large multitude. Market transparency is low, administrative interventions are excessively numerous, and there is a tendency of unstandardized development in the land market. A considerable portion of organizations and individuals engaging in land development and operation have not conducted normal market trading activities in accordance with laws and regulations. On the other hand, they have been keen on speculation in land and projects in order to reap exorbitant profits, which has stimulated the speculative activities in land and intervened in the normal order of the land market. In addition, the land supply plan has not been carried out conscientiously, the land taxation system has yet to be straightened out, the building of the law regarding the land market is in urgent need of augmentation, and the unified management structure of land should be further enhanced. The above problems indicate that while positively pushing forward and cultivating the land market, we should also make necessary preparations in structure, policy, and law in order to positively and properly cultivate the land market. Only by so doing can the building of the land market in China advance to a healthy and smooth orbit. With regard to the problems existing in the development of the land market, the party Central Committee and State Council have taken them very seriously, have issued to lower levels a series of relevant policies and documents since the latter half of 1992, and have taken the standardization of the land market as a major aspect of macroeconomic regulation and control. After nearly a year of rectification of these problems the land market has been standardized to some extent. In spite of this, some deep-rooted problems in the development of the land market still have to be resolved through the in-depth reform of the land use system and the cultivation and standardization of the land market. An important issue at present is the necessity to work hard to expedite the building of a socialist land market system and to form a standardized and perfect land market as quickly as possible. In addition, it is necessary to further increase the intensity of allocating land resources by way of the market mechanism, increase the proportion of land supplied via the modes of selling by tender and auction, and tighten the management of land which was allocated previously; to bring into full play the role of regulation and control in planning, banking, taxation, and other means, and put into effect the macroeconomic regulation and control of the land market; and to intensify the management of land prices, perfect the land price assessment system, improve and amplify the land registration system as quickly as possible, and institute a sound legal system in the land market. Moreover, it is necessary to further reinforce the in-depth structural reform of land management in a bid to suit the requirements of the ever-growing land market construction. Governments at all levels and pertinent functional departments should pay serious attention to and coordinate with one another closely in performing the above tasks well, so that China's land market will head for maturity at an early date on an open, fair, just, orderly, and standardized basis.
