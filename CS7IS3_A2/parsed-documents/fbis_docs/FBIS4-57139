The term "rondero" is used indiscriminately to describe two very different phenomena. Gradually, beginning with TV images of peasants, men and women, receiving shot guns, as well as the martial bearing evidenced in military parades, there is a tendency to identify the ronderos as armed peasants prepared to confront terrorists. This distorts the reality. The northern rondas appeared in 1976 at the initiative of the peasants themselves, to combat cattle theft, and they subsequently broadened their activities to include the resolution of internal disputes. They became an effective, although informal, administrator of peasant justice. Furthermore, they were formed within the democratic spirit of combating the arbitrariness and corruption expressed by the binomial police-judge that had always been prejudicial to their interests. At times they became a valuable instrument for the mobilization of the peasantry against hoarding and price increases of products from the cities. There are currently 3,500 rondas, concentrated mostly in the department of Cajamarca and the provinces of Ayabaca, Huancabamba, and Morropon in the department of Piura. On the other hand, the "armed rondas" of the south-central part of the country, known as "antisubversive civil defense," began to appear in 1983 as a consequence of the need for defense against attacks by Shining Path's platoons and columns. From the beginning, either voluntarily or due to pressure from the Armed Forces, they had a military organization and purpose. They were obliged to become specialists in defensive "patrolling" or the pursuit of Shining Path platoons and columns. In practice, they learned the tactics of ambush and counterambush. In 1988 they spread out from Ayacucho--particularly from the Apurimac river valley where they became powerful--to Huancavelica and Satipo province, covering a large area where Shining Path had established itself strategically. During the same period a similar process occurred in the Tulumayo valley, in Concepcion province in the department of Junin, which succeeded in stopping Shining Path and putting it on the defensive in the countryside. These armed peasant organizations were legally recognized in 1991 and placed under the Armed Forces Joint Command, giving them the title of Self-Defense Committees. Inexplicably, a supreme decree in January 1993 also imposed military norms and controls on the northern rondas. This serious error should be corrected as soon as possible.
