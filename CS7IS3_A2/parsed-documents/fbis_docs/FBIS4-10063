Although many refused to comment, others expressed surprised at the report because they had met with the president that morning and he did not say anything to them. Congressmen also referred to criticism by several Hondurans who are accusing the government of using the situation as a smokescreen to cover up the economic measures, noting that if that were the case, it would be very irresponsible. Rafael Pineda Ponce, National Congress first vice president, called the act condemnable "because no one has the right to take the life of any citizen, much less the president." In his opinion, the state security organizations should conduct the investigation because their constitutional mission is to guarantee the Hondurans' lives and property. If the idea was to distract people to stop them from criticizing the rising fuel and milk prices, that would be really irresponsible because the country is ready to make a social pact among all political, social, and economic forces. "The country does not belong to the Reina administration or anyone in particular. It belongs to everyone, from the most arrogant and haughty to the humblest citizens," he added. Liberal Alberto Orellana said he was surprised by the report and deplores the incident. "Whether we like it or not, Reina is the democratically elected president and we must condemn such a situation," he said. He did not rule out the possibility that the thwarted attack was a result of the people's desperation over spiraling costs and dire poverty. "We can think of so many things, things that someone starving might do, but hopefully it is nothing like that, only a false alarm," he added. Roberto Micheletti, secretary general [of the Liberal Party Central Executive Council], said he was surprised by the report and termed the situation loathsome. "If it is confirmed, I hope the responsible parties will be turned over to the courts and sentenced to the full extent of the law because this country elected its leaders democratically and we want to live in peace," he stated. When asked about accusations that the incident could be a smokescreen, he said "if that were the case, it is wrong and undignified. To show such disrespect for the president's life, to cover up a situation that we Hondurans are experiencing, is wrong and reproachable," he said. Liberal wing head Santiago David Amador condemned any attack against the life of a human being, in this case the president of the Republic. He said he is waiting for a report from the Armed Forces and asked God "to enlighten the minds and attitudes that bring disgrace to the people." He stated he is satisfied with the intelligence service reports and ruled out the possibility that the report was made to hide the country's real situation. "No way, one thing cannot be compared to another. One is an economic issue, and the other is a human life," he said. Nationalist Jorge Zelaya termed the report dubious because "it is strange military intelligence did not issue it, just as they did not issue the report when there was an attack against former President Roberto Suazo Cordova. Strangely enough, the report comes from the Government Ministry when it happens that economic decisions have been made and measures taken at the same time," he said. Cesar Castellanos, chief of the nationalist wing, said there is some doubt because Honduran and Nicaraguan military authorities have been at odds over the reports they have given. "I would like to wait a little longer and learn about the investigations because I have found a series of contradictions and facts that are disconcerting. It has been 15 days and nobody has been arrested and there is no specific investigation," he noted. He added that the statements being made clearly show the military authorities were not properly informed and now they are trying to say that they knew about something when they really did not.
