FR940810-1-00045 FR940810-1-00009 The IRS definition of ``adjusted gross income'' on IRS Form 1040 has the largest number of inclusions and a very small number of adjustments. Adjusted gross income can be verified by calling employers and assistance agencies, as well as by reviewing actual tax returns (that, although they may not be submitted to the IRS at the same time as the assistance was provided, can provide a validity check for the income reported by the beneficiary then). The IRS definition is very likely to be familiar to grantee and HUD staff, and to most beneficiaries. While it is not designed to calculate family or household income (including dependents), it can easily be adapted. For some beneficiaries, calculating all the inclusions (such as business income or loss) may be difficult. With few exclusions to consider, the definition should be moderately easy to explain and administer. A further advantage of the IRS definition is that agencies can easily take advantage of inexpensive off-the-shelf software to automate and document its use. This definition also does not attribute income to ownership of non-income-producing assets. This definition is likely to be the easiest to administer for special economic development activities in cases in which the assisted business is collecting income information. Most of these businesses will not be familiar with any federal income definition other than that of the IRS. In this rule, the Department is proposing that a recipient be allowed to select and use the Section 8, Census, or IRS Adjusted Gross Income definition for each of its CDBG activity types. (A grantee could also elect to use one definition for all its activity types.) When the CDBG activity is homeowner rehabilitation, the net value of the primary residence of the beneficiary may be excluded from Net Family Assets where the recipient is using the Section 8 definition. As noted, all CDBG entitlement recipients would be required to use one of the three definitions for each activity. For administrative reasons, the Department recommends, but does not propose to require, use of the modified Section 8 definition for housing and housing-related activities, especially those that are also assisted by other HUD programs (such as HOME or HOPE or Section 8). Also, the Department is aware that grantees may follow somewhat different standards when computing relocation payments. This rule would not change the requirements at §570.506(b) regarding records to be maintained when information on income by family size is required. That is, the grantee could still elect to keep records to show either that 1) the person assisted qualified under another assistance program with income qualification standards at least as restrictive as the CDBG definitions, 2) a copy of a verifiable certification (based on one of the three proposed definitions) from the assisted person was obtained, or 3) the person was referred from an agency that determined the individual's income status and maintains appropriate documentation. One further note: this rule does not propose to require recipients to use a particular standard procedure for determining the amount of benefit to be provided, such as that used in HUD's housing programs for determining a family's contribution toward rent. This rule only specifies what components must be included in the calculation of income. Each recipient remains free to determine the level of benefit, such as the amount of rehabilitation subsidy, it considers to be necessary and reasonable for each CDBG-assisted activity. Calculating the Planning and Administration Limitation This proposed rule includes changes at §570.200(g). The language at §570.200(g) on the 20 percent limitation on expenditures for planning and administration for entitlement recipients would be revised to establish the specific, exclusive method for calculation of this limitation. While the vast majority of entitlement recipients have followed the guidelines in the current rules for calculating expenditures without regard to the source year of funds used to pay for such costs, some recipients have continued to claim compliance based on individual source years. Recipients would no longer be allowed to demonstrate compliance by apportioning planning and administrative expenses to each source year of CDBG funds. The Department has determined that it is no longer advisable to allow entitlement recipients to meet this requirement on a ``source year'' basis for the following reasons: a) The Grantee Performance Report (GPR), HUD's principal tool for determining compliance with the 20 percent limitation, does not track expenditures on a source year basis; and, b) the Department has concluded that the allocation of expenditures for program administration against individual activities is inherently arbitrary, and thus is likely to result in an inaccurate measure of how much of the total expenditures for administration in a given year applies to any individual activity. For example, a recipient may have spent $100,000 administering an ongoing rehabilitation loan program in FY 1992. The money used to fund the loans in FY 1992 included grant funds received in FY 1992 and previous years, and program income from repayments of loans received over multiple years. To make the calculations necessary to allocate the $100,000 expenditure for program administration on a source year basis, the recipient must assign each dollar spent for making loans that year to a source year. Such assignment is a cumbersome, difficult task fraught with the potential for error. With this proposed regulation, HUD would assure the uniformity of the procedures used by all entitlements, and further ensure that the administrative and planning limitation will be calculated in the most efficient way. Prohibition of Income Payments The prohibition against income payments at §570.207(b)(4) in the current rule was principally intended to keep CDBG funds from providing ongoing cash payments directly to individuals to provide for their subsistence. For example, this would include making monthly payments to an individual to allow that individual to pay for housing, food, clothes, day care, or utilities. However, the Department has determined that the current provision goes too far beyond that objective. The proposed redefinition at §570.207(b)(4) reflects this determination. The Department has further determined that, although downpayment assistance is listed as an example of an income payment in the current rule, a one-time payment for downpayment assistance should not be classified as an income payment for these purposes. Therefore, under this proposed rule downpayment assistance to individual homebuyers would be provided with CDBG in one of three ways: (1) under the Direct Homeownership provision of the National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA) (currently due to terminate in October, 1994); (2) under §570.202(b)(1) to assist acquisition for the purpose of rehabilitation; or (3) under §570.201(e) as an eligible public service activity. The Department has also determined that loans to individuals to provide for their subsistence are not ongoing cash payments and therefore proposes that they be considered eligible public services rather than income payments. A conforming change is also being proposed in §570.201(e).
