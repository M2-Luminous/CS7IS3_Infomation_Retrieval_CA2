This pushed into the background the resolution of the nature of relations between Russia and NATO, although the issue has remained unclear. Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski stressed in his speech on Friday that Poland is "aware of the need for solid partnership between NATO and Russia," within and beyond the Partnership for Peace, but he warned that this should not lead to a "marginalizing of the smaller states, undermining their trust in NATO." He also gave assurances that countries such as Poland "want to join NATO not as frontline states but as factors promoting further cooperation." [passage omitted]
