We cannot know what the future might bring." In reply to questions by a group of reporters, Aliyev said the route of the oil pipeline will be finalized only after the signing of a protocol with the foreign firms in Baku. In firmly rejecting the claims that he is Moscow's man, Aliyev said such accusations are lies disseminated by Elchibey and his supporters with whom the Turkish press sympathizes. Bulent Ecevit, the leader of Democratic Left Party, visited Aliyev. In a statement after the meeting, Ecevit said it is highly important for Nakhichevan and Azerbaijan to be connected. He added that Turkey's stance on the issue has been insufficient and passive.
