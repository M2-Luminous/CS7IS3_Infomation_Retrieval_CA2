In a conversation with the U.S. general, the first deputy prime minister noted that the CIS countries have not become really independent since gaining political independence. In the Caucasus, Tajikistan, and Moldova, Russia is forced to conduct peacekeeping missions. Moreover, it hopes for assistance in these operations from the North Atlantic alliance. The NATO commander in chief agreed with the first deputy prime minister's assessment of the situation in CIS trouble spots, and stressed that NATO is undergoing a period of transformation from a military bloc into a peacekeeping one. However, it is in no haste to participate in such operations. George Joulwan proposed to Oleg Soskovets that joint Russian-NATO exercises be held in any European country of Russia's choice and at a time convenient to it. Russia agrees in principle. The details will evidently be discussed tomorrow at George Joulwan's meeting with [Defense Minister] Pavel Grachev.
