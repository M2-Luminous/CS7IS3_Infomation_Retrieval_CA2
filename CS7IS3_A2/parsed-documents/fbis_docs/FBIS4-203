His call on the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola, FAPLA, for become engaged in more fighting, has enraged the people. Reports say that the MPLA-PT foreign minister does not believe in the Lusaka peace talks. He showed similar spirit during the negotiations in Estoril, which led to the signing of the fragile Bicesse Accord. A source in Lunda Sul Province said yesterday that Venancio de Moura's remarks in Saurimo are in line with the Luanda regime's warmongering plans for this year as announced by Jose Eduardo dos Santos in his New Year message.
