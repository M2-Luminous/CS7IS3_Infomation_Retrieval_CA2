Barely days have passed since the dispute he caused by his out-of-the-blue announcement on the national welfare tax has subsided. Now the government and ruling parties are being shaken over the cabinet reshuffle hassle. In the past, we have often pointed out that Prime Minister Hosokawa, his government, and the ruling parties are taking the current economic conditions too easily and are being laggard in taking measures. While economic conditions are the worst since the end of World War II, economic friction between Japan and the United States is becoming more serious. Now that the political reform bills -- which were the most important pending issue -- have been passed, it is now time for the government to tackle economic issues which have been left behind. To do so, the government needs to hurry and pass the third 1993 supplementary budget, and then deliberate the 1994 budget; and to do everything to implement deregulation and administrative reforms. In view of the given conditions, it is clear how precipitate and unnatural the idea of a cabinet reshuffle at this time is. If the purpose of Prime Minister Hosokawa's cabinet reshuffle is to remove Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura, with whom some reports say Hosokawa has not been getting along well recently, then the justification for a reshuffle is very weak. It is not even worthwhile. Maybe, Prime Minister Hosokawa is overconfident about his high public popularity rate. The reason why he was named top leader was because the public impression of him as the face of the coalition was good and because his clean image -- which is different from existing politicians -- was considered as a good cap on the "political reform government." The political power game and intraparty circumstances of the coalition parties also played a role. In the beginning, the prime minister had to go slow. After the rice market liberalization and political reform bills issues were taken care of and put behind him, he became confident about running the political scene -- we can see that. Furthermore, in the course of working on the pending issues, the man with whom he consulted no doubt changed from Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura to Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] General Secretary Ichiro Ozawa. There was a difference of opinion between Prime Minister Hosokawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura regarding the key questions of formulating the 1994 budget within 1993 and instituting a national welfare tax. But, where the two questions are concerned, Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura, who wanted the budget to be formulated by the end of 1993 and opposed the national welfare tax idea as being too abrupt, was after all more rational in his thinking. The prime minister caused political chaos over the two issues and thus showed the nation and the world he lacked political leadership. His political reponsibility for such follies is great. A conscientious politician would take some kind of responsibility for this. Indeed, the man who should be criticized is the prime minister himself. A leader should have the capacity to lend his ear to criticism and the advice of his housekeeper, the chief cabinet secretary, as well. If the cabinet reshuffle is meant to establish and solidify a basis for a long-lasting government now that the political reform bills have been passed, what the prime minister must do first is present the people with the policy issues he wants to tackle, including how they will be carried out. The "political reform government" should change its name if all it wants to do is decide important matters with only a handful of coalition leaders behind closed doors. If Hosokawa wants to carry out a cabinet reshuffle, he must clearly explain why he needs to do so. And, it is only commonsense to question whether now is the appropriate time to do so, with the 1994 budget needing to be passed. Now is the time to do everything to resolve economic issues rather than reshuffle the cabinet.
