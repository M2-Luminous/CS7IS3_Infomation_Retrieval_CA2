I am the representative of the smallest country in the region, which, like others, continues in its successful political and economic transformation process, and which, as a new country, has recently established its principal democratic institutions. We neighbor with all of the Visegrad Group countries, and we are good neighbors not only around this table. We endeavor to cooperate in all important areas. Issues of security, which we have today discussed with our distinguished host President Clinton, are among the most important. The Slovak Republic accept the Partnership For Peace project as an expression of a qualitative change, and at the same time an evolutionary process on the road to a full membership in the North Atlantic Alliance. The Slovak Republic understands its wish to be part of NATO and its system of values as an act of utmost political importance, which has the support of our entire democratic political spectrum. We wish to create conditions, as soon as possible, for the signing of the agreement within the framework of the Partnership For Peace initiative, which will put a definite end to our efforts to confirm our orientation. We strongly believe that it will be understood the same way by the member states of the Alliance. We wish not only to confirm our aspirations, but also to prove our preparedness to participate actively in its projects and missions through our concrete cooperation within the Partnership For Peace initiative. I wish to emphasize that the Slovak Republic is not aspiring to be a part of the Alliance because it feels militarily threatened. We have no enemies in today's Europe. We simply have negative historical experiences. We don't want to see history repeat itself in any manner. For this reason we endeavor to anchor ourselves firmly within the structure of democratic states, which is capable of effectively defending democratic values, shared also by our citizens. This endeavor and the commitments stemming from it will also facilitate the complex transformational process that our society is carrying out at the moment. The North Atlantic Alliance carried out the fateful struggle for democracy in a bi-polar world with success and honor. We have no doubts that it will confront the present challenges in the same way. One of these challenges is to find a partnership relation with the changing Russia and Ukraine in a manner that would strengthen not only European, but also global security. The specifics of the European power coordinates and their relation with the global processes require, in our opinion, an active presence of the United States of America in our continent. We are pleased that the United states is confirming its commitments to Europe. We are aware that the Partnership For Peace project, in its implementation stage, will create models for cooperation between the Alliance and the individual countries which will probably not be identical. The partial differences should not, however, become an impulse for the creation of a competitive environment, which we consider natural in economics, but risky in security issues. The Alliance should, in our opinion, approach the principle security issues systematically and through bold decisions that take into account a broader geopolitical area. We know that the creation of stable, democratic relations on the international scene and the strengthening of security require an active contribution of all, not only the most influential participants. The Slovak Republic, too, wants to contribute to the European stability, mainly through good relations with its neighbors. The Slovak Republic takes this opportunity to stress once again its preparedness to further the cooperation with its neighbors on this basis. Once again, I want to express our appreciation of President Clinton's initiative, which made this meeting possible, and at the same time express hope that it will become a strong impulse for us in further coordination and mutual cooperation.
