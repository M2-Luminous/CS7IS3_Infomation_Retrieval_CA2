Carlos Clement was selected as the candidate for the first vice presidency, and Maria "Marisin" Villalaz de Arias was selected to be the second vice presidential candidate. A resolution from the party's political commission indicates that Solidarity meets the necessary conditions and has the necessary strength to head a presidential slate as a result of its image, active membership, discipline, organization, prestige, determination, and consensus to accomplish the unity and progress of the Panamanian people. The resolution states: "Solidarity has been taken into account by other important political forces, which have contacted the party to gain its support with the intention of participating in the next election process." Lewis Galindo's nomination was announced yesterday at one of the party's main political centers located in the Obarrio neighborhood, after a lengthy meeting between the party's main leaders. Samuel Lewis Galindo, a principal member of the National Brewery board of directors, expressed appreciation for the nomination and promised he will head a civilized political campaign aimed at eliminating hatred and uniting the Panamanian family. "Neither I nor my party will sow hatred. Today, more than ever, we must make a joint effort to help solve the numerous problems that are devouring our community's underpriviliged groups," he pointed out. [passage omitted] Yesterday, the presidential candidate stated that Panamanians are tired of disputes and conflicts which lead nowhere. "We are the party that will save the country from chaos and hate mongers who would rather have individual confrontation instead of striving for useful things," Lewis Galindo restated. He said that under the motto "leadership, honesty, and work," Solidarity gathers Panamanians from all social levels to give answers to a society that feels unprotected at this time. First vice president candidate Carlos Clement was the public works minister at one time. He is an architect specializing in urban development. He is also one of the party's founders and is currently party treasurer. Second vice president nominee Dr. Marisin Villalaz de Arias was director of the National Medical Association. She was active during the civic struggle against Manuel Antonio Noriega's dictatorship. She was a Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement candidate for legislator for the 8-9 Circuit during the 1989 elections. Abraham Martinez, Solidarity party political affairs secretary, told LA PRENSA that the slate headed by Samuel Lewis Galindo will be recommended to the national directorate during the national convention. Martinez also said Fernando Manfredo decided to abstain from participating on the slate in order to, as he put it, support any new alliances the party may enter. The political affairs secretary holds that Solidarity is the party with the most number of followers and greatest drawing power. "We are working on specifics. On Tuesday 10 January [date as published] we will completely sweep through the San Miguelito District," he concludes.
