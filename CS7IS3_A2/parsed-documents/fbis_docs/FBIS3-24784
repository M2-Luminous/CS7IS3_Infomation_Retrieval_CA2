The dossier on police, which was the first point on the agenda on political issues, was concluded yesterday at the end of [words indistinct]. The two delegations agreed on the composition of the new corporation and its judicial facet, as well as the modes of its formation. Now that the police issue has been concluded, there is hope that Angola will at last have a police force that serves the people. When the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] and the government meet again in Lusaka today, they will discuss national reconciliation. This very extensive issue may take some time for a consensus to be reached, but, as stated by a diplomatic source linked to UNITA, the Angolans will have to be reconciled. The Angolan peace talks began in November 1993 under the mediation of Malian national Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative of the UN secretary general in Angola, and in the presence of the troika of observers, with the United States and Portugal playing a decisive role. Russia's position is ambiguous and partial since it is still supplying the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party with arms for war. Angolans hope that the sides will reach a general peace accord as soon as possible so that they may reconstruct their country.
