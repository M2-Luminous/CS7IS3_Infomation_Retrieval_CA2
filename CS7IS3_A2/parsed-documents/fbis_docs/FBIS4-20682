The treatment performance of this system is getting good results in treated water quality, because the facility can remove not only the musty odor substance (2-methyl isoborneol), but can also reduce the Anionic surfactants, Ammonia nitrogen and Trihalomethane formation potential consistently and effectively. In the year since the facility was introduced, the musty odor has been removed from purified water, according to our expectations, at the Kanamachi Purification Plant. Introduction The Tokyo Metropolitan Government Bureau of Waterworks supplies purified water to about 12 million citizens in Tokyo. The total distributed amount per year was 1,783,310,000 cubic meters in fiscal 1992 and this year the maximum distributed amount per day was 5,780,000 cubic meters. The Bureau has 11 purification plants including Kanamachi, Asaka, Higashi-murayama and others. The total purification capacity is 6,959,500 cubic meters per day (cf. Table 1). The raw water is obtained from three river systems as follows, the Tone River (80 percent), the Tama River (17 percent), and the Sagami River (3 percent). Table 1.

It has a daily purification capacity of 1,600,000 cubic meters -- that is about 23 percent of the Bureau's total purification capacity. This plant supplies purified water to about 2,500,000 citizens. In recent years, at the Kanamachi purification plant, the pollution of raw water has occurred due to urbanization of the Edo River valley (cf. Figure 1). Figure 1. Fiscal Change of Raw Water Quality (Kanamachi P.P.) In particular since 1972, the Kanamachi purification plant had been faced with the problem of the musty odor of the purified water in the summer season. As the result of an investigation, it was proved that the musty odor source substance is 2-Methyl isoborneol (2-MIB). So since 1984, we have coped with the musty odor problem with a powdered activated carbon adsorption treatment. But, the variation of 2-MIB concentration in raw water is so remarkable that the powdered activated carbon adsorption treatment did not prove sufficiently effective in musty odor removal (cf. Figure 2). So, in August 1989, the Bureau started the construction of an advanced water purification facility, which is a combination system of ozonation and biological activated carbon (BAC) treatment to remove musty odor more effectively and consistently in the Kanamachi purification plant. As the first phase, an advanced water purification facility with the daily purification capacity of 260,000 cubic meters -- that is about one-sixth of the total daily purification capacity and is about one-fourth of the average daily distribution amount -- was established on June 25, 1992. We are now supplying the advanced purified water by mixing uniformly with water purified by the conventional processes. Figure 2. A Case of Relation Between 2-MIB Conc. in Raw The advanced water purification facility removes musty odor efficiently and also is effective in producing safer and tastier water, because it reduces Ammonia-Nitrogen (NH[.sub]3[/]-N), Anionic surfactants and Trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP). This facility's design and construction was based on the results of investigations and experiments conducted at the pilot plant for six years from 1984. As this facility is the first commercially operating plant for the Bureau, we are continuing various investigations and experiments to verify the results of experiments with the pilot plant and to get data and practical knowledge for the application and introduction of future phases and new projects. Meanwhile, we would like to give a summary of the advanced water purification facility and the quality of the water purified with this facility. The Summary of the Advanced Water Purification Facility and Its Operational Condition The advanced water purification facility in the Kanamachi purification plant consists of ozonation and BAC treatment and is installed between the sedimentation and the filtration processes. The treatment process is as follows: Settled water is directed to the advanced water purification facility after coagulo-sedimentation without pre-chlorination. At this time, odor components and others are decomposed effectively by the strong oxidizing power of ozone and removed by activated carbon adsorption and biological oxidation with microorganisms. Next, the treated water is chlorinated (middle stage chlorination) and conveyed to the rapid sand filters. The purified water is distributed to users after disinfection with post-chlorination and pH adjusting. Figure 3. Flow Chart of Advanced Water Purification The ozone contact basins (5 basins) are up-and-down flow type with three stage chambers. The effective depth of water is 6.0 m, the contact time is 12 minutes, and the maximum ozone feeding rate is 3 mg-ozone/l (ppm). The each contact basin have a retaining chamber (retention time: 6 min). [as published] The ozone feeding rate varies due to the ozonized air feeding ratio in each chamber of the contact basin. The ozonized air feeding rate is three-sixths of the total feeding in the first chamber of the contact basin. In the second chamber, it is two-sixths, and it is one-sixth in the third chamber. The ozone feeding rate is controlled to keep the dissolved ozone concentration constant -- that is 0.2 ppm in treated water at exit of the retaining chamber. Generally, the ozone feeding rate is around 1 ppm, but it is changed according to the water quality (cf. Figure 4). Figure 4. Ozone Contact Basin The activated carbon adsorption facility consists of 12 basins, and the effective filter area is 100 square meters. The granular activated carbon used here is made of coal. The effective size is 1.2mm, the uniformity coefficient is 1.3, the bed depth is 2.5 m, and the linear velocity is 250 m per day (the empty bed contact time is about 15 minutes). The backwashing is carried out once every three to four days. The BAC filter is washed with air and water for four minutes, and then washed with water for 10 minutes (cf. Figure 5). Figure 5. A Backwashing Program of the BAC Adsorption Basin Treatment Performance (1) 2-Methyl isoborneol (2-MIB) In 1992, the condition of the Edo River was good because of the high level of precipitation from June to the middle of July -- the end of the rainy season. For this reason, 2-MIB in raw water showed a comparatively low value which was 65 ng/l at maximum value in July. The maximum value of 2-MIB in raw water rose up to 77 ng/l in August, and 140 ng/l in September, because there had been very little rain after the end of the rainy season. However, even though the 2-MIB concentration in raw water changed significantly, the removal of 2-MIB was carried out completely. About 20 percent of the 2-MIB is removed by coagulo-sedimentation and all of the rest is done by the combination of ozonation and BAC adsorption (cf. Figure 6). The maximum load of 2-MIB in the advanced water purification facility has been 120 ng/l. At that time 2-MIB was 7 ng/l in the ozone treated water and it was all removed all in the BAC treated water. Figure 6. 2-MIB Conc. and Removal Rate Against Raw Water (2) Anionic surfactants (MBAS: Methylene Blue Active Substances) The concentration of MBAS in raw water became comparatively higher in winter. It is assumed that the dilution rate is lower due to the decrease of the river flow and the biological decomposition activity in the river is lower due to the decrease of water temperature. The monthly MBAS average in fiscal 1992 gradually became higher. For example: 0.09 mg/l in November, 0.16 mg/l in December, and 0.21 mg/l in January. The maximum value was 0.52 mg/l in January. However, the water temperature was low (average water temperature was 6.4ï¿½C in January 1993), the MBAS removal rate of BAC treated water against raw water was about 40 percent, and the treated water maintained a low concentration extremely well (cf. Figure 7). Figure 7. MBAS Conc. and Removal Rate Against Raw Water in (3) Extinction coefficient at 260 nm (UV260) It is said that the created quantity of trihalomethane is affected by the existence of organic substances which have unsaturated bond. Therefore, we measured UV260 value to supplement THMFP data and to make a representative index of organic substances. Each one-third of UV260 value of raw water were decreased by the coagulo-sedimentation treatment and the ozonation treatment respectively. The UV260 value was very low after BAC adsorption treatment (cf. Figure 8). Figure 8. Extinction Coefficient at 260 nm off Process Water Although in early passage the UV260 value of BAC treated water tended higher gradually, the rate soon become stable. It is supposed that this indicates the decline of the adsorption capacity of the granular activated carbon and that the BAC treatment performance becomes stable because of the oxydizing effect of microorganisms. (4) Trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) The removal rate of THMFP by the advanced water purification treatment was nearly 100 percent at the first passage, because the activated carbon was fresh. But, after that the removal rate decreased gradually and it has been consistently at about a little over 60 percent since about six months after the first passage (treated water quantity is 15,000 times as much as the activated carbon quantity). The phenomenon that THMFP increases in ozonation did not appear in our investigation, in which the ozone feeding rate was changed from 0.5 to 2.0 ppm (cf. Figures 9 and 10). Figure 9. Transition of THMFP Removal in Advanced Figure 10. THMFP in Process Water; ozone dosage is varied. (5) The NH[.sub]3[/]-N removal and biological activity in the BAC NH[.sub]3[/]-N can not be removed by ozonation treatment, but it can be decomposed during BAC treatment by the microorganisms which grow on the granular activated carbon. After the first passage, the NH[.sub]3[/]-N removal rate gradually rose in the activated carbon adsorption basin, and in about two weeks it reached 100 percent (cf. Figure 11). It was assumed that in about two weeks in summer, the function of the BAC would be as indicated (cf. in Figure 11 -- the test passage term was before June 24). The NH[.sub]3[/]-N removal maintained a good rate. Also in winter, NH[.sub]3[/]-N was removed completely (cf. Table 2). Considering other analysis results -- such as the decrease of the dissolved oxygen and the heterotrophic bacteria colony counts -- it is supposed that the biological activity in the BAC layer was also very active even under low water temperature.

One result is shown in Figures 12 and 13. Figure 12. 2-MIB Removal in the Ozone Contact Basin Under Figure 13. Dissolved Ozone in Contact Basin Under Several Conclusion The advanced water purification facility is consistently getting good results in regards to 2-MIB, which is the principal subject material to be removed; as well as with anionic surfactants, THMFP and NH[.sub]3[/]-N. We have insured ``safer and tastier'' which has no musty odor by operating the advanced water purification facility for one-fourth of the total amount and carrying out the powdered activated carbon treatment for the other three-fourths. In future, we would like to analyze a number of questions such as: the optimum ozone feeding rate; the time to the breakpoint of granular activated carbon; the suitable washing method of the BAC adsorption bed and the characteristic change of the activated carbon. In addition we would like to make use of the results for the proper operation of the facility and further advanced water purification process introduction.
