A spokesman for the NIC said only 150,000 people would be allowed on to the lawns of the Union Buildings, and it was hoped that strict crowd control would prevent a spillover of people into residential areas. The spokesman said separate events were planned for venues outside Pretoria to prevent a huge influx of people. An international soccer match was planned for the FNB [First National Bank] Stadium near Johannesburg. It was hoped the new president would be able to address people at other venues later in the day, the spokesman said. Security arrangements for the inauguration, which would be attended by at least 50 heads of state or their representatives, had been going well. Heavy security force deployment around the Union Buildings would contain the crowd to the lawn below the amphitheatre, where the ceremony would take place, the spokesman said. Various assembly points would be set up in Pretoria where people would receive security screening before being given tickets to attend the inauguration. They would be bussed from the assembly points to the Union Buildings. The Arcadia suburb would be closed off to traffic. Sources on the security planning committee of the NIC however, were less optimistic about crowd numbers. A source said an unprecedented number of security force members would roll into Pretoria to prevent the ceremony from turning into bloody chaos. He said a contingency plan was going ahead for up to 1 million people expected to converge on Pretoria. A source on the Joint Security Committee said several thousand security force members would be deployed around the Union Buildings, but they would not be able to prevent carnage if things went wrong. In an effort to dilute the crowd at the Union Buildings, talks were also under way to install huge television screens at several stadiums where people could follow the inauguration. These included Loftus Versfeld, Centurion Park, Ellis Park and the FNB Stadium. The security plans included: - Security forces, both uniformed and plainclothed, would be brought in from other regions to control the crowd. - VIPs would be housed in only a few hotels to ease security and travel arrangements. - Permanent and roving roadblocks would be set up on access routes to check for weapons. - Random checks on individuals for firearms would be done throughout the day. - The police and defence force would establish a joint operation centre from which security would be co-ordinated.
