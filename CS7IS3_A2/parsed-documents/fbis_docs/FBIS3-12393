With this air strike, NATO resorted to its first true military operation since forming after World War II. The second Security Council resolution on Bosnia-Herzegovina has been implemented. During the past two years, the UN Security Council has issued 19 resolutions on Bosnia and until yesterday's air strike, only the resolution on the arms embargo, which was limited to the Muslims, was being implemented. The fist question that comes to mind is: Why were most of the Security Council resolutions on Bosnia not implemented and why was the resolution banning flights by hostile planes over Bosnia implemented only yesterday, over a year after it was approved? Political analysts believe that the implementation or the suspension of the Security Council resolutions on Bosnia stemmed primarily from the political recklessness of international powers and their agreements backstage. Basically, this issue can be studied within the context of the cooperation and rivalry between the Western countries and Russia. The approval of the Security Council resolutions on the Bosnian crisis and the implementation or violation of these resolutions form the most important pillar in the West's cooperation with Russia. The flood of Russian arms to Serbia and the dispatch of similar Western arms to Croatia--despite the international sanctions--are examples of how the resolution on the arms embargo was violated by the belligerent sides in the Bosnian crisis, with mutual connivance by the West and Russia. The arms embargo on the Muslims, which was pursued under the strong control of the West and Russia, is another example of this cooperation, which shows how the world powers have a uniform political inclination in their hostility toward the oppressed Muslims in Bosnia. This cooperation between the West and Russia recently adopted the character of a political transaction. Russia's political support for the Serbs after the NATO ultimatum and its preventing the NATO air strike against the Serbs' heavy gun bases were among the concessions that the West granted to Moscow so that Russia's President Yeltsin could use these for domestic consumption against his rivals. Yesterday's support by Russia for the NATO air strike on the Serb fighters is a concession that Russia is giving to the West. Although Russia supports the Serbs, it cannot agree with their impudence in violating the resolution on the no-fly zone and in their air strike on two Muslim-inhabited cities, especially when Moscow voted for this resolution. Next to the cooperation between the West and Russia in the former Yugoslavia, there is also rivalry between the two, which has recently become more visible. Russia's powerful entry onto the scene toward the end of the period specified in NATO's ultimatum two weeks ago, gathering the hostile side's heavy guns from around Sarajevo, and Moscow's overt support for the Bosnian Serbs form one of the clearest examples of the rivalry between Russia and the West in the Balkans. It recalls the Cold War era's bloc system. The U.S. proposal to form a type of confederation with the Republic of Croatia on the one side and the Bosnian Muslims and Croats on the other and the two sides' [as heard] call on Washington to examine the situation are considered to form a reciprocal step by the West, which is trying to place the Bosnian Muslims within an irreversible new framework and under the umbrella of Western support and political influence. Political analysts believe that while cooperation and rivalry rule relations between the West and Russia in the Bosnian crisis, the recent NATO air strike on the Serb fighters took place with another objective in mind that is not opposed by Russia either. Overshadowing the savage act by the Zionist forces in the massacre at the Abrahamite shrine may be the main objective behind NATO's delayed attack on the Serb planes. The Zionist regime's thoughtless act has sparked off dangerous repercussions for the West's interests in the Islamic world and the West is trying to resort to another commotion in a bid to distract the world of Islam from Tel Aviv's horrific crime.
