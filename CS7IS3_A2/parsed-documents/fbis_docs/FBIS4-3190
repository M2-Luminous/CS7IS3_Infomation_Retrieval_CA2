FBIS4-3190 "drchi075_d_94005" FBIS-CHI-94-075 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 Northeast Asia Daily Says DPRK Never To Take Military Action First Daily Says DPRK Never To Take Military Action First OW1904055494 Beijing XINHUA in English 0538 GMT 19 Apr 94 OW1904055494 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, April 19 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) "will never take any military actions first" as its weapons are defensive, said an editorial carried by the official newspaper NODONG SINMUN today. The DPRK's peace-loving position and policy are "generally recognized by the international community," said the editorial, affirming that the fundamental mission of the DPRK armed forces is to "defend state sovereignty and security" and is totally "of a defensive nature." The U.S. charge that the DPRK would first launch military actions is an insult to the DPRK's peace-loving policies and also an attempt to slander the defensive nature of the DPRK's armed forces, said the editorial. It said that the U.S. charge was aimed at justifying its own military adventures. Criticizing the U.S. and South Korea for having been gradually increasing military threats to the DPRK, the editorial said that the DPRK people and army would not bow to any powers and are now closely following U.S. military moves. On Monday, two U.S. Navy transport ships carrying six Patriot missile batteries arrived in the southeastern port of Pusan in South Korea and the missiles are expected to be deployed at military bases in South Korea by April 29. The DPRK has strongly opposed the deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea, saying that the missiles are to be used for offensive purposes. A row erupted earlier this month between the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the DPRK over the inspection of the latter's nuclear sites. The Vienna-based IAEA claimed that Pyongyang rejected full inspection while the DPRK said that it had met the IAEA's demands.
