The collegium does not, however, know if any of the other accused in the State Committee for the State of Emergency [SCSE] trial have communicated similar wishes. As a TASS-CRIME correspondent learned, the formal accusation of high treason levelled at Varennikov and the other accused continues to remain in force, despite the amnesty, in so far as the procuracy general of the Russian Federation has not withdrawn it and, after protesting against the decision of Judge Ukolov at the Presidium of Russia's Supreme Court, has sought to bring the criminal case back to the military collegium for a final decision to be made. At present, the "SCSE case" is "being examined" by Viktor Yaskin, military collegium judge of the Russian Federation and major general of the judiciary. By law, the continuation or cessation of legal proceedings depends on his decision alone. Since Varennikov has rejected the amnesty, there is a strong possibility that legal proceedings will be continued against him personally (this does not apply to those of the accused who declare their acceptance of the amnesty).
