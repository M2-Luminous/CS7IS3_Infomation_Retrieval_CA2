They have worked out a detailed report and proposals based on their grass-roots investigations for the provincial government. Since last year the provincial CPPCC members have given their suggestions and opinions to the Qinghai government on developing socialist market forces, finding and exploiting natural resources, promoting agriculture and animal husbandry, and invigorating major state enterprises. Based on a proposal by three provincial CPPCC members for gold panning by peasants in poverty-stricken areas, the provincial government announced a regulation on gold panning by collectives. By the end of last year this northwest province's CPPCC committee had gathered 85 proposals from its members, 74 of which have already been transfered to related departments. The provincial CPPCC heads have taken the lead in investigations of grass-roots units. A provincial CPPCC group led by its committee chairman Han Yingxuan made a study tour of the Haixi Autonomous Prefecture of the Mongolian and Tibetan nationalities. The tour concentrated on investigating the development of salt resources and ways to raise the added value of local-made products. The CPPCC members also play a role in attracting overseas investment to the province, as some of them have relatives and friends abroad.
