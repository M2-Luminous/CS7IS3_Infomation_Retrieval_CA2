During the same period the natural growth rate increased from 11.61 per thousand to 15.68 per thousand. The rural population birth rate increased from 18.43 per thousand to 22.97 per thousand and the natural growth rate from 12.04 per thousand to 15.97 per thousand during this period. This had a huge impact on population control in China. First impact: Economic. With the rise of market economy in the villages, the rural economy will take off quickly. And the villagers' misunderstanding of family planning cadres' work will increase further as will the difficulties of that work. Moreover, the growth of the rural economy will weaken the effectiveness of economic penalties for excessive births. The wealthy do not fear penalties, and even less do the poor, thereby rendering almost nil the control function of economic penalties. Second impact: Regional disparities will increase further. With the development of the market economy, economic disparities between the coastal and inland regions will increase further. Unbalanced attitudes brought about by poverty and prosperity will be exacerbated, and difficulties controlling the population in impoverished areas will also increase. The vicious circle of "the poorer the more births, the more births the poorer" will be further exacerbated. Third impact: Administrative control functions will be further weakened. Administrative means are a major aspect of population control in China, and the growth of the market economy will weaken these administrative control mechanisms. This weakening is especially evident in rural areas. The establishment of the responsibility system in rural households was the first instance of the weakening of administrative control functions, and the establishment of the market economy will be the second. Fourth impact: On population planning. Population planning is formulated from top to bottom, as the Central Committee draws up the overall plan, which is then broken down to provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, and then further broken down to prefectures, cities, and counties, and then directly to the township, town, and village. Within the structure of the market economy there is also a market population, namely a market for population demand and for productivity. Thus, with population childbirth there exists the birth of markets (which is determined by the demand of the population market). Thus when drafting a population plan, we must consider the market demand of the population and proceed from bottom to top. When market demand is great, the plan can be appropriately relaxed, and when market demand is small, it can be appropriately tightened.
