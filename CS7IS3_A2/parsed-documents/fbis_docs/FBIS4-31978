Defense and safety are two vital functions in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which has decided to establish and organize a professional, powerful, well-equipped, and efficient military force. In other words, we would like to develop a military force that will be able to avert an aggression against our country and that is capable of defending our territorial integrity, freedom, and independence in case of an aggression," Pavle Bulatovic, the federal defense minister, said in his first interview for VOJSKA. [VOJSKA] To what extent is the defense concept being manifested? [Bulatovic] It is clear that a military force and a defense system in general depend on the financial possibilities of the country, but also, vice versa, the power of a country depends on the capabilities of its military force, which should defend it, thus enabling it to prosper in freedom. The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia unified its defense system, and this concept is being consistently materialized in the republics of our federation. In other words, the republican defense ministries have practically been abolished and the Federal Ministry constituted. Defense is a portfolio in the Federal Government. There are problems with the materialization of our defense concept, but they cannot affect the defense system as defined by the Constitution. It is clear that the federal state had to define what kind of a military force it wanted and how big it should be, and it did so. We have to bear in mind that a powerful military force is the aim we want to achieve. This aim cannot be achieved overnight. Especially not because we are trying to develop our army under the conditions of a war and economic sanctions, which means with very little financial means. The Federal Government and the Federal Defense Ministry do not have any additional funds that would make it possible to speed up the organization of the army, so that the only approach, which must be applied consistently at all command levels, is to be rational and set priorities. Our multiparty system requires us to reach a consensus in all important issues, especially in the field of national defense. This must be binding for all parties, regardless of their political programs. Conflicts between political parties must not affect the defense system. [VOJSKA] The Yugoslav Army must not be accused of the disintegration of Yugoslavia any longer. [Bulatovic] The question of who caused the disintegration of Yugoslavia is very complex. Nobody has treated this issue seriously yet. This is necessary, though. It is more than obvious that the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [SFRY] was a fragile structure since it collapsed at the first nationalist attacks and influences from abroad. The former Yugoslav People's Army is unfoundedly accused of the disintegration of Yugoslavia. Seen from the point of view of history, the army has always defended freedom in this area, and politics has always chosen the state it wanted. In my opinion, the Yugoslav People's Army could have done only two things -- either to execute the orders given by its supreme command, the SFRY Presidency, or to stage a coup. The military leadership chose the correct solution; everything else is speculation since we cannot know whether Yugoslavia would have collapse also in the case of a coup, whether more or less blood would have been shed.... We must not allow wrong assessments made by individuals from the former Yugoslav People's Army to be ascribed to the Yugoslav Army. The phenomenon of treason has always been present in this area, but always as an act committed by an individual, not as collective hypocrisy. [VOJSKA] The defense of Yugoslavia is a right and duty of all our citizens. Still, some do not want to fulfill this obligation. [Bulatovic] This is a big and complex problem. It is necessary that the state is accepted and respected by all of its citizens if we want them to accept its defense as their duty. Unfortunately, there are still people who have not accepted the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as their state. Would the use of repressive measures mean that they accept our state, its leadership and policy, or will it only be the implementation of laws? It is not only necessary to find rational political solutions to controversial matters, but also to apply legal regulations. There must be no quarrels about certain questions, especially about the territorial integrity of Serbia, Montenegro, and Yugoslavia in general. No negotiations are possible about this topic, neither in Yugoslavia, nor abroad, since this state is the result of historical processes and desperate struggles for freedom. Nobody has the right to argue about the blood shed in this area. [VOJSKA] What is the destiny of peace in the Balkans, and who will, in your opinion, decide about it? [Bulatovic] Major powers are following their interests and are creating the spheres of their interests in the Balkans. It is clear who does not want peace; the Serbs in Yugoslavia and in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina certainly do want it. I would like to remind you that the aim of the aggressors in the two world wars was to exterminate the Serbian and the Montenegrin population, but they were not successful. What was not achieved then is beingdone in a much more perfidious way now -- by waging a low-intensity war against us, without spreading into war conflicts. The Serbian and Montenegrin people have to defend their freedom decisively, as they have done during the course of history. They have no other choice. Many assessments have already been made, but I would like to remind you of the words uttered by Mr. Jovan Cvijic that the Serbs are guilty only because they built their house in the middle of the road. The house has to be defended because it is obviously an impediment to the interests of major powers. They do not want to allow us to live peacefully in our house. [VOJSKA] The required high professionalism of the army collides with the modest financial means Yugoslavia can invest in it. What is done in order to find a solution to this contradiction? [Bulatovic] There is really a striking discrepancy between our wishes and our financial power. This problem is often discussed at the Federal Defense Ministry and in sessions of the Supreme Defense Council. There is understanding in military commands and units that financial means are restricted and that priorities have to be set. By additional efforts of army members, it is possible to perform key tasks and keep the combat readiness of our defense system on the required level. The recovery of country's economy is encouraging, so we can hope that more means will be devoted to the defense system soon. [VOJSKA] When will the organization of the Federal Defense Ministry be adopted? [Bulatovic] We have not completed the organization of our Ministry yet. We are intensely working on it, however. There are still some questions that have to be solved. After that, we shall present the scheme of our organization to the Federal Government for adoption. This will happen soon. [VOJSKA] The protection of civilians has been taken over by the Federal Defense Ministry, too. What problems accompany this procedure? [Bulatovic] The tasks that had been performed by the republican ministries before the new Law on Defense was adopted were taken over by the Federal Defense Ministry at the end of last year. It was not a simple operation, since a completely new defense type had to be developed. We did not only take over these tasks from the republican ministries, we also employed their employees in charge of defense tasks. I can tell you that radical changes are foreseen in this field. There is a lot of work, but I believe that we shall be able to manage it. [VOJSKA] You have stressed on several occasions that it is necessary to transform the military industry. What are the concrete measures you have proposed? [Bulatovic] As you know, approximately 48 percent of capital assets of the former military industry have remained on the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Forty-six percent of the former employees have also remained. We have inherited almost all the scientists and researchers and other respectable personnel, as well as laboratory resources. In cooperation with the Army of Yugoslavia General Staff, the Ministry has successfully organized the manufacturing process of priority weapons and military equipment. It is only natural that the present financial possibilities dictate our behavior in this extremely important field. The Federal Defense Ministry will make use of its military industry facilities according to the criteria of economic feasibility. In other words, it will act according to market economic principles wherever this is possible. Since the market economy has been introduced, it is necessary to reorganize the military economy. The Yugoslav Army cannot invest in new facilities and technologies in order to develop complex combat and non-combat systems. It can only buy certain products from the "list" of the existing equipment in various units and commands. One of the reasons we have not completed the process of military industry transformation is that the respective federal laws are late, too. The new law on companies will give the institutional framework for a more efficient organization and transformation of the military industry that will be adapted to the economic system of the country and to the needs of the Yugoslav Army. [VOJSKA] Does this mean that the chances for a quicker technical modernization of the Yugoslav Army are getting better? [Bulatovic] The Yugoslav Army must be equipped with modern and efficient weapons and technology. This is also the aim of the transformation, but we have to be aware of the reality of our military and political situation. Technical modernization includes the introduction of efficient combat means, modern rocket systems and optoelectonic means, radio systems protected from surveillance, wiretapping, and disturbances, modern means for fire control etc. Our experts have assured us that the existing combat means can be modernized and developed. Certain complex means will have to be bought abroad. Research and development and manufacturing facilities will be adapted to the already adopted plans for technical modernization. [VOJSKA] Let us go back to the difficult problem of finances.... [Bulatovic] This is a really difficult question because we only have means to cover the most necessary things and it is difficult to set priorities under the present circumstances. We must not allow our basic defense functions to be affected, and, on the other hand, we must not allow young personnel to leave. In cooperation with the Federal Government and the Supreme Defense Council we shall do everything in order to prevent this. [VOJSKA] One of your biggest problems is apartments for your employees.... [Bulatovic] It is well known that there are 25,000 applications for apartments that have to be solved, 17,500 of them were filed by people who have no apartment at all. So far we have succeeded in temporarily accommodating 3,000 Yugoslav Army members with 10,000 family members in military facilities. These people came to Yugoslavia from the breakaway republics. A radical change in the search for solutions in this field will not be possible without considerable financial help from society. Together with the General Staff, we have prepared a special program according to which 10,000 apartments should be built for the Yugoslav Army by the year 2000, but it is still not sure whether this will materialize or not. It is only certain that we shall have 2,000 apartments for our personnel next year. There are numerous other initiatives, but their materialization depends on funds. [VOJSKA] The Yugoslav Army members who have not become Yugoslav citizens would like to know what their status is. [Bulatovic] It has been precisely defined by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that the members of the Yugoslav Army can only be Yugoslav citizens. There is the same regulation everywhere in the world. The question of Yugoslav citizenship for those people will be solved according to the federal law on citizenship, which has to be adopted. I hope that the bill of law will soon enter the parliamentary procedure. [VOJSKA] We are approaching 16 June -- the Day of the Yugoslav Army. The traditions of both the Serbian and the Montenegrin Armies are rich and long.... [Bulatovic] Our peoples have always cherished the idea of freedom, we have always supported defense politics, politics of peace. We are powerful as far as our willpower and decisiveness are concerned. June 16 was chosen as the Day of the Yugoslav Army, so that we are approaching its first anniversary. We must not assume, however, that history began on 16 June, or 27 April, or on some other day. We have to avoid mistakes that have been made since 1945, because during this time it was almost degrading to mention Kajmakcalan, Cer, Mojkovac, Kolubara, Skadar, or army commanders Misic, Stepa, Putnik, Bojovic, Janko Vukotic, from whom we could have learned a lot, not only as far as tactics and strategy are concerned, but also as far as the relation toward soldiers and the state are concerned -- with adaptations to modern times, of course. Nor must we forget the experiences of World War II, especially from the resistance movement against Fascism. I am convinced that commanders, soldiers, and other professional members of our army, as well as all those who are contributing to the development of our defense system, work toward a reliable defense system for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Finally, I would like to congratulate all Yugoslav Army members and the employees of the Federal Defense Ministry on the first Yugoslav Army anniversary. [Box, p 7] Who Are Barbarians? Five hundred years ago we printed our first book in Obod, the "Oktoih." This was our contribution to world culture. Our first book is only a little younger than the United States, whose propaganda machine is now accusing us of being barbarians and monsters who should be wiped off the the face of the Earth for the benefit of humankind. A nation exists, however, not only based on its biological existence, but also in the light of its contribution to civilization. I would like to remind you of a dialogue between the army commander Drasko and the principal of the Republic of Venice in "Gorski vijenac," a work by P.P. Njegos that shows that accusations, but not by the Serbian and Montenegrin people, have a long tradition. The principal is interested in the "Bosnjaci [population of historic Bosnia-Herzegovina] and Arbanasi [population of historic Albania]" and asks Drasko: "If they catch a Montenegrin, either dead or alive, will they eat him up, or what will they do with him?" Drasko answers: "How would they eat him up, for God's sake, a man cannot eat a man!" It is obvious who would like to change the roles now....
