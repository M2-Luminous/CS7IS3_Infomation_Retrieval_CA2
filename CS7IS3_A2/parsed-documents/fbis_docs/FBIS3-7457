Their hearts are filled with the death-defying resolution to dedicate their lives without hesitation to the party and the leader, the motherland and the people. A graphic example of this is the iron will and faith of the young people who rose up like a mountain last year to defend the nation's sovereignty and the country's supreme interest. In March last year when a touch-and-go crisis in which a war might break out any moment was created due to the anti-DPRK campaign of the enemy, the world watched the Korean peninsula. A semi-war state was declared to the whole nation, entire people and the whole army and a statement of the DPRK Government on the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) was published. The young men and women who always accept the determination of the Workers' Party of Korea as their will turned out as one man to defend the motherland, the place for their living. Young people numbering 1,500,000 volunteered to the Korean People's Army in a few days. We do not want war but not beg for peace. [sentence as received] If the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets light the fuse of a new war indiscreetly, the five million young men and women will become rifles and bombs and strike an annihilating blow at the enemy. This was the determination of the Korean young people and it remains unchanged. The people are convinced of all victories, looking at their features. In the proud chronicle of the Korean revolution that has advanced towards victory through a bloody road there are many known and unknown young heroes who devoted their lives for the party and the leader, the motherland and the people. Kim Hyok who composed and disseminated the first revolutionary song of praise "Star of Korea", Kim Chin, the first one in the world who silenced the enemy's pillbox with his body in the 1930s, and Yi Su-pok, Kang Ho-yong, An Yong-ae and Cho Sun-ok who laid down their lives in defending the soil of the fatherland in the grim fatherland liberation war were all youths in their teens and twenties. The socialist cause of Korea which was pioneered and faithfully inherited by the first and second generations of the revolution is now being unswervingly carried forward today by the young men and women of the third and fourth generations. The young people deeply conscious of their duty for the times are registering remarkable achievements in the construction of a socialist independent national economy. In recent years, they have splendidly completed scores of large-scale construction projects such as the Pyongyang-Kaesong express highway, the 800 km-long waterways on the west coast, streetcar rails in Pyongyang and dwelling houses for 30,000 families. The construction of the world's leading West Sea barrage with three locks and 36 sluices cutting across an 8 km section of the wild sea, the vast construction and electrification of railways including the Hyesan-Manpo Youth line and the Wiyon-Motka line, the construction of the modern may day stadium and a number of public buildings in the capital were projects of monumental edifices undertaken by young people. Korea remains unshaken in any roar of thunder because it has the young men and women who burn with love for the motherland and hatred for the enemy bent on encroaching upon the nation's sovereignty.
