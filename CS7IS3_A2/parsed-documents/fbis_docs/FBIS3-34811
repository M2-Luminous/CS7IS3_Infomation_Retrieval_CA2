On the sidelines of the visit, TISHRIN held a lengthy interview with Urbain in which he responded to the editor's questions on Syrian-Belgian relations and prospects for developing them. [passage omitted] Urbain said: I would like to note that my visit to Syria came a bit later than scheduled. The visit was supposed to take place at the end of last year, but we had to postpone it until the beginning of this year due to my heavy schedule. The visit seeks to bolster bilateral relations and increase cooperation to serve common interests. We will analyze and evaluate the current status of bilateral relations and see how they have been developing, especialzly now that there is peace process in the region. Urbain added: I believe that although the level of bilateral relations is not great, it is constant. Our exports to Syria totaled $100 million. Our exports included food products, minerals, and chemical substances. Meanwhile, our imports from Syria totaled $12 million. Foremost among these imports were textiles and oil. I would like to note that proceeding from this fact and in light of the positive developments in the Syrian economy--especially after the issuance of a law to promote investment--and the growing role of the private sector, Belgian businessmen and project owners are willing to establish cooperation relations with Syria. We, in the Belgian-Luxembourg union [as published], support Belgian companies' participation in joint projects with Syria. On the level of cooperation between the two governments, Urbain said: We are highly concerned with the priorities of the Syrian authorities in terms of what Belgium can offer as far as implementing infrastructure projects, including electricity projects. We will soon sign an agreement for technical, economic, and technological cooperation. I would like to note that the signing of the agreement has been delayed for purely technical reasons, especially on Luxembourg's part. We seek to sign an agreement between Syria and the Belgian-Luxembourg union to encourage and protect investments on both sides. I believe there is a need to sign such an agreement. Urbain continued: Belgium is a member of the European Union [EU]. Cooperation between Syria and the EU is the framework that defines Belgium's relations with Syria. Syria and the EU have signed several agreements. In 1977, a third protocol for technical and financial cooperation, amounting to 146 million European Currency Units [ECU], was signed with the EC. In 1992, a fourth protocol, amounting to 158 ECU's, was signed. The protocol includes technical and financial aid to support the Syrian Government's efforts in the energy and health sectors, as well as other infrastructure projects. It also includes grants to prepare and train cadres. On prospects for promoting future relations between the two countries, Urbain said: I believe that trade relations are a question of needs and requirements. We are ready to help Syria export more commodities to the EU states. The EU is a very large market with a population of over 340 million. It is important to promote relations between the two countries and to provide an appropriate atmosphere for that purpose. The nonexistence of Belgian investments in Syria is linked to this issue. Therefore, I raised the need for signing a bilateral agreement to protect and encourage investment. He added: There are broad investment fields in Syria. The Syrian Government's measures are useful. I hope that these measures will be enforced. We hope the peace process will reflect positively on the regional states. I would like to point out that the EU called for the implementation of UN Resolutions 242 and 338 on the Middle East. It also supported the principle of land for peace. Urbain continued: The international interest in peace in the region and the international community's will to establish peace in the Middle East have been greatly boosted by the outcome of the very important meeting between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton in Geneva. That meeting gave peace efforts a new momentum. Before moving to discuss the problems facing some Belgian cabinet members, Urbain stressed that Belgium will present specific proposals to bolster cooperation between the financial and monetary institutions in both countries. He expressed the Belgian Government's readiness to organize seminars in Belgium in cooperation with Syria to explain many economic issues about Syria and to increase the Syrian exports to the EU.
