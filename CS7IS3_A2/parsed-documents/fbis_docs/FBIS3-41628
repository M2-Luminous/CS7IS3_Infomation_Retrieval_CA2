It called for halting the damage caused to Azerbaijan's plant life and forests as a result of the Armenian occupationist war. The appeal said: The Transcaucasus plays an important role in the ecological balance of the world. However, the region is faced with the danger of destruction and ruin. The ecological balance has been disrupted in the Transcaucasus and serious damage has been caused to the soil structure, forests, and plant life in the region as a result of air raids and the use of heavy artillery and rockets in the war Armenia wages against Azerbaijan. Several rare varieties of plants have become extinct. They were unique to the region. In addition, rare varieties of animals, which are also unique to the region, are threatened. The appeal later said the following: The rare forests in the region are being destroyed. Other important natural resources, including forest reserves, are also threatened. Many of the areas reserved for forests have been turned into battlefields. Consequently, the damage Azerbaijan has suffered totals more than $1 billion. Combat is taking place in 260 hectares of afforested areas. The aggressors cut down the trees and transport them to Armenia during their military operations in those areas. The world is helpless to protect the vitally important forests in the region, which are a source of oxygen and fresh air. The war Armenia has been waging against Azerbaijan has caused serious damage to our republic's natural resources. In general, this is a serious loss for humanity. That behavior has been described by the convention on war victims, the protocol added to that convention, and the 1978 convention, which condemns as an international crime military and other measures against natural resources. Any country that resorts to such behavior is guilty of committing a crime against the international community and the country it attacks. In view of that, Armenia must pay compensation for the damage it has caused to Azerbaijan. Furthermore, in accordance with the norms of international law, that republic must be held responsible for repairing the damage it has caused to the region. The appeal concluded: That behavior, which has remained unobstructed, constitutes a crime not only against Azerbaijan but also against the entire world. Therefore, we urge you to direct the necessary pressure on the aggressor to end the war. We also urge you to bring a court action against the aggressor. The existing situation requires an urgent and undelayed intervention by the international community.
