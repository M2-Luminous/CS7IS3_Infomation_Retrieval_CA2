The Russian president has demanded that the Bosnian Serbs immediately withdraw their forces from the besieged city, allow the peacemaking forces to enter, and lift the blockade on the UN personnel. Yeltsin confirmed his proposal to hold a meeting of the leaders of Russia, the United States, France, and Britain to elaborate a common position. Moscow has put forward such an initiative in the past but the West responded coolly to it. This time the reaction was different -- the Europeans welcomed Yeltsin's proposal and U.S. President Bill Clinton called it "worthy of serious discussion." A few hours after the Russian president's statement the Bosnian Serbs agreed to release the captured UN peacemakers and allow the blue helmets to enter Gorazde -- but only on the left bank of the Drina River. As for the right bank, which had been captured by the Serbs during recent fighting, they have no intention of leaving there, as Radovan Karadzic has unambiguously stated. Meanwhile, Yeltsin has demanded the withdrawal of Serb forces from all Gorazde's territory without dividing it into right and left banks. The Russian authorities dedicated the morning of 20 April to the elaboration of a clear and coordinated position on Bosnia. According to information from reliable sources on Smolensk Square, there are serious differences of opinion in the president's entourage. Not everyone agrees with the Foreign Ministry's position, which considers further contacts with the Bosnian Serb leadership pointless. It is understood that it was largely due to the efforts of the "pro-Serb lobby" that the original text of Yeltsin's statement, prepared by the Foreign Ministry and couched in extremely harsh tones, was ultimately changed. The reference to aggression and genocide by the Serbs disappeared, as did the assertion that "compulsion to peace" (for which read: military measures) is the only way of rectfiying the situation. Even in its final form, however, the document leaves no doubt about the direction in which the Russian approach is evolving. Even the State Duma, which is well known for its virtually unconditional support for the Serbs, showed restraint this time and did not adopt a resolution on the results of the morning session dedicated to the situation in the Balkans. In order to clarify the situation it was decided to send a delegation to Belgrade consisting of the leaders of various parliamentary factions. The announcement of the recall of the Russian ambassador in Belgrade for consultations, which appeared in the press, has not been confirmed. "No decision has been made on that score," a high-ranking Russian diplomat said. And he added, highly significantly: "Yet." The Foreign Ministry pins the main hopes for a way out of the Bosnian deadlock on the holding of the summit meeting proposed by Yeltsin. "The permanent members of the UN Security Council must present a united front," Galina Sidorova, Kozyrev's political adviser, believes. "It is necessary to elaborate a joint position and implement it resolutely. It is time to review the concept of `special interests' and `special influence,' in Russia's case on the Serbs, in the U.S. case on the Muslims,, in Germany's case on the Croats, and so on.... As practice has shown, each of the warring sides has tried to prove to its theoretical allies that it is right and enlist their full support. As a result, differences of opinion have surfaced between the great powers, the united front was splitting up, but meanwhile the war went on."
