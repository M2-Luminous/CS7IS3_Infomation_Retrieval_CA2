FR940721-2-00109 FR940721-2-00065 A. Adequate Under the draft policy, ``adequate'' would focus on those elements of a State program that are necessary to provide a level of protection of the public health and safety within the State that is equivalent to, or greater than, that provided by the NRC regulatory program for its licensees. The requirements for ``adequate'' would not require that NRC regulations or other program elements be incorporated in an essentially identical manner. Under the adequate provision, States would also be allowed to establish requirements through measures other than regulations, such as license conditions. B. Compatibility The ``compatibility'' requirement would focus on those elements of a State program which would be required to be essentially identical with the NRC regulatory framework in order to achieve a larger national interest beyond that required for adequate protection of the public health and safety within the State. The draft policy establishes four criteria 1 that the NRC would use to determine which elements of the NRC regulatory program, including specific NRC regulations, that the State would be required to incorporate in an essentially identical manner into its regulatory program. The dose limits and radiation-protection related release limits in 10 CFR Part 20 and 10 CFR Part 61 applicable to all licensees, or any subsequent amendments thereto, or other NRC regulations which are required to be essentially identical for compatibility purposes will automatically be required to be identical. 2 States will not have the flexibility to deviate from the program elements that the Commission requires for compatibility. 1 The compatibility criteria are specified in Section III.D, below. 2 In issuing this Draft Policy Statement for comment, the Commission is revisiting its earlier decision to review compatibility of Agreement State programs in the low level radioactive waste area on a case-by-case basis. The Commission based its earlier decision on a belief that such case-by-case consideration could best address the special circumstances that confront Agreement States in that area. Using the case-by-case approach, the Commission has determined that the low level radioactive waste regulations of Pennsylvania and Illinois are compatible. C. Compatibility and Adequacy Determination of Agreement States The staff has developed a management directive for the use of common performance indicators in review of the Agreement States and regional materials program. The development of the common performance indicators for the evaluation of Agreement States and the NRC regional offices will be directly related to adequacy requirements for Agreement State programs, and consequently, will need to be closely coordinated with the staff efforts to define the elements of an adequate State program. In January 1994, the staff provided to the Commission a paper further describing the use of common performance indicators in NRC region and Agreement State reviews. The staff is currently implementing a pilot program on the common performance indicators program. The current proposed common performance indicators program contemplates using a Management Review Board (MRB) to make the decision on the adequacy of existing Agreement State programs. The initial adequacy determination of a proposed new Agreement State program will be made by the Office of State Programs, rather than the MRB, because the adequacy of a proposed new program is not dependent on effectiveness of actual program implementation. The staff plans to follow this same split of responsibilities for the compatibility determination of an Agreement State program, with the MRB making the compatibility determinations for existing Agreement State programs, and the Office of State Programs making the initial compatibility determinations for proposed new programs. The initial adequacy and compatibility determinations for proposed new Agreement State programs are reviewed and approved by the Commission. Indicators of compatibility will also be developed by the staff.
