In January imports added up to $1.5321 billion while exports exceeded $946 million. The figures released by the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INDEC) of the Finance Ministry shows that the trend that began in the middle of last year has increased. Economic Programming Secretary Juan Llach announced these figures during a news conference. He said the trade deficit increased during January because of climatic problems that affected export- quality agricultural products and postponed agricultural exports. Llach stressed the importance of the growth in capital goods imports, which increased by 98.8 percent compared to the same month last year. Llach said that the figures also show an increase in investments, which is positive for the economy. According to the INDEC report, the purchase of fuels increased by 140.6 percent, the purchase of intermediate goods by 26.4 percent, spare parts and accessories for capital goods by 36.5 percent, consumer items by 23 percent, and passenger vehicles by 46.5 percent. The figures confirm that Brazil is the main purchaser of Argentine exports, with a total of $188.9 million. The United States comes second with $108 million. The United States, in turn, heads the list of countries that sell to Argentina. Argentina imported a total of $410 million worth of goods from the United States. Brazil is second on the list, selling for a total of $285.4 million worth to Argentina. The United States, Brazil, Germany ($113.4 million), and Italy ($102.6 million) account for 59 percent of the country's total imports during January. Argentina's trade exchange (exports plus imports) with its three Common Market of the South (Mercosur) partners -- Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay -- reached $615.1 million in January, or 23.8 percent of the country's total, and a 29.8 percent increase compared to the figures registered in January of 1993. The exchange with the United States, Mexico, and Canada -- the three NAFTA partners -- also increased by 61.3 percent, reaching a total of $554.3 million during January. The export of Argentine products to NAFTA member countries increased by 31.1 percent during January compared with the same period of 1993, while imports from the United States, Mexico, and Canada increased by 72.6 percent.
