Ho Hyo-pil, vice director of the secretariat [title as received] of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, said that the decision followed a request by the IAEA. He said that it reflected the DPRK's magnanimity and served to prove the transparency of its declared peaceful purpose of nuclear development. The two IAEA inspectors arrived in Pyongyang on May 17 to carry out checks at the Yongbyon radiochemical laboratory. On June 13, the DPRK announced its withdrawal from the IAEA, the world's nuclear watchdog body, and refused any further IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities from that date. This followed an IAEA decision on June 10 to impose sanctions against the DPRK. At a press conference today, Ho distributed a memorandum, prepared by the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, which accused South Korea of stockpiling plutonium in secrecy and itself being engaged in the development of nuclear armaments. The statement included a strong protest against what was described as the IAEA's "injustice" and "double standards" over the nuclear issues of the South and North sides of Korea.
