FR940426-1-00086 FR940426-1-00008 For episodes in which the long-range transport is from the southwest to the northeast in the OTR, States northeast of New York and Connecticut would not contribute to nonattainment in any severe nonattainment area. Under these circumstances, the LEV program in such States would not assist any downwind areas in reaching attainment by the deadlines specified in the Act. However, past episodes have shown that high concentrations in the severe areas do not always occur only when the wind blows from the southwest. When the wind blows in the opposite direction from these States into severe areas to the south, the LEV program in these States could assist the severe areas in reaching attainment. EPA requests comment on whether it would be appropriate to geographically limit any approval of the recommended LEV program. EPA is also considering whether it has discretion to take into account whether the LEV program is necessary for areas to maintain the ozone NAAQS after achieving attainment. Particularly in the case of motor vehicle standards, whose benefits require time for the fleet to turn over, taking the OTR's maintenance needs into account could significantly affect the analysis. The OTC, in its response to comments, noted that LEV is a significant factor in achieving maintenance requirements. Section 184(c)(1) specifies on its face that the OTC may develop recommendations for additional control measures if the OTC determines such measures are ``necessary to bring any area in such region into attainment by the dates provided by this subpart.'' Identical language appears in section 184(c)(2) to describe EPA's obligation in reviewing the need for the control measures in the recommendations and a third time in section 184(c)(4) to describe EPA's obligation to explain why any control measures in the recommendation are not necessary. This language, omitting any reference to maintenance, unless unintentional, might suggest that Congress designed section 184(c) as a tool to reach attainment alone, and not to ensure maintenance thereafter. Congress explicitly addressed maintenance in connection with ozone transport under section 110(a)(2)(D). As discussed above, if EPA approves the OTC recommendation, under section 184(c)(5) it is to find SIPs inadequate under section 110(a)(2)(D). That latter provision specifies that SIPs are to contain adequate provisions to prohibit emissions that will ``contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance by, any other State'' with respect to any primary or secondary NAAQS. To be sure, States continue to have an obligation in any case to comply with the requirement in section 110(a)(2)(D) to prevent emissions that will interfere with maintenance by any other State. But the omission of any reference to maintenance in section 184 may indicate that Congress did not intend it to be a proper basis for OTC recommendations. 17 17 One might argue that the need to bring any area in the OTR into timely attainment inherently carries with it the need to bring such areas ``back'' into attainment if they attain and subsequently relapse into nonattainment again. The difficulty with such a view, however, is that it seems at odds with the distinction_clearly delineated elsewhere in the Act_between attainment and maintenance. Section 176A(a) governs the establishment of transport regions, and additions or removals of areas from such regions. Section 176A(b) governs the establishment of transport commissions for such regions, the representation on and voting of a commission, and a commission's obligations to assess transport, strategies for addressing it, and to: Recommend to the Administrator such measures as the Commission determines to be necessary to ensure that the plans for the relevant States meet the requirements of section [110(a)(2)(D)]. A commission under section 176A therefore appears obligated to consider compliance with section 110(a)(2)(D) in its entirety, including compliance with the requirement to prohibit interference with maintenance by other States. Section 176A(c) governs requests from the commission to EPA, providing simply that the commission ``established under subsection (b) may request the Administrator to issue a finding under section [110(k)(5)] that the [SIP] for one or more of the States in the transport region is substantially inadequate to meet the requirements of section [110(a)(2)(D)].'' That subsection also governs EPA's obligation to approve, disapprove, or partially approve and disapprove a commission's request within 18 months and to issue a finding of SIP inadequacy under section 110(k)(5) at the time of any approval. Under section 176A(c), again, the commission's authority to request a finding of inadequacy appears to extend to all requirements of section 110(a)(2)(D), including the obligations relating to maintenance.
