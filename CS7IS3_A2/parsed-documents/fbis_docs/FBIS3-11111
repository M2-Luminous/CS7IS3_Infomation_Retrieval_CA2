But customs officials confiscated a mislabeled package which was found to contain 500 Taurus revolvers from Brazil bound for Iran. The Portuguese security service, concerned over the role as a distribution point for weapons to the world, decided to shed some light on the subject. The first to mention the subject was Eduardo Damaso of the daily PUBLICO, who long ago began tracking weapons deals from Latin America, via Portugal, to Eastern countries. It is now public knowledge that Brazil uses Portugal as an transit point in the sale of weapons through the Barcarena Gunpowder Company, which denies knowledge of the content. The company maintains that the shipment "contained 300 barrels and triggers sold as spare parts" and asserted that "this is not war materiel." Airport customs, which has kept the package for the past three months, asserts that it contains revolvers. It is charging $200 per day storage. The Barcarena Gunpowder Company explains that it was "tricked" because it thought there were no direct flights between Brazil and Iran. The Portuguese media has reported the arrival of Iranians in Portugal, coinciding with the visit of CIA Director James Woolsey. Damaso reports on meetings between Iranians and other foreigners in Portuguese hotels to settle deals involving war materiel. The Brazilian consulate and the embassy in Portugal deny knowing anything about the weapons stored at the airport. Brazilian military attache Colonel Chuquer commented that Taurus is a private company and that "the United States, for example, is one of its best clients."
