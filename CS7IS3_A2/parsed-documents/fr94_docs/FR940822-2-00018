ACTION: Notice of noncompetitive financial assistance award. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy, Richland Operations Office, announces that pursuant to Paragraph B of 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(D), it intends to issue a noncompetitive grant award to the Oregon Health Sciences University. The award is planned for one (1) year project cycle, consisting of a twelve month budget period, from September 5, 1994 through August 31, 1995. The budget is estimated at $4,393,000. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Patrick O'Donnell, U.S. Department of Energy, Richland Operations Office, P.O. Box 550, Richland, Washington 99352, Telephone: (509) 376&hyph;2004. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Grant Award Number: DE&hyph;FG06&hyph;94ER61918. Scope of Project: The proposed financial assistance award is a grant to the University to fund a Health and Environmental Research Program. Activities will include models of advanced information communication research for regional health and environmental research. The University is currently performing activities related to those proposed. The Biomedical Information Communications Center has undertaken preliminary work in the development of an electronic health research information network. The public benefit derived from this research will be greatly enhanced with the financial support from the Department of Energy. It has been determined that a grant instrument is appropriate since the Department of Energy anticipates limited direct involvement with the program. Dated: August 8, 1994. P.E.
