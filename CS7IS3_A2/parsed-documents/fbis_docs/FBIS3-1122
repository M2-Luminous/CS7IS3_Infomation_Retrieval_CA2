Mr. Mmelelo said what King Goodwill Zwelithini had proclaimed was the right of the kingdom of kwaZulu to freely determine its relationship with the rest of South Africa. He said King Goodwill had demanded that the kingdom be recognized as it had existed in 1934. This area included kwaZulu, Natal, and parts of the eastern Transvaal, and had extended south to the Umzimvubu River. The king would probably decide within the next few days on whether kwaZulu would have federal or international relations with South Africa. If he chose the latter, it would mean that the kingdom would become an independent state.
