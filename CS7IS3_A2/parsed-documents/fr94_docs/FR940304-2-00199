FR940304-2-00199 FR940304-2-00114 Indirect Costs The total dollar amount of the indirect costs proposed in an application under this program must not exceed the indirect cost rate negotiated and approved by a cognizant Federal agency prior to the proposed effective date of the award or one hundred per cent (100%) of the total proposed direct costs dollar amount in the application, whichever is less. Application Forms and Kit Standard Forms 424, Application for Federal Assistance; 424A, Budget Information_Non-Construction Programs; and 424B, Assurances_Non-Construction Programs, (Rev 4&hyph;88), shall be used in applying for financial assistance. The forms used in the Application are subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act, and have been cleared by the Office of Management and Budget under Control Numbers 0348&hyph;0043, 0348&hyph;0044, and 0348&hyph;0040. Application kits may be obtained by writing to the address listed in the ADDRESSES section above. Project Funding Priorities Funding under the TIIAP will be awarded to support projects that most effectively enhance economic opportunity, the provision of education, culture, health care, public information, library, public safety, social services, or other efforts to meet public needs; and that support the further development of a nationwide, high-speed, interactive infrastructure, incorporating the widest variety of information technologies. The number of proposals that will receive funding in each of the two categories will depend, in large measure, on the total number of applications that NTIA receives. Because the aggregate funding level of individual grants cannot be determined in advance, applicants must justify the amounts requested. NTIA anticipates that approximately sixty per cent (60%) of the funds appropriated for this grant program will be devoted to demonstration projects, with approximately forty per cent (40%) of the funds devoted to planning grants for states, local governments, regional entities, and non-profit entities. Details of funding priorities within these categories are as follows: Priority in Category One_Demonstration Projects A priority for demonstration project grants is that the project develop a model that others can follow. An important element of this model is a plan for disseminating the knowledge gained as a result of carrying out the project. In NTIA's view, this nation's telecommunications infrastructure should reinforce the values of American democracy, and the TIIAP should support projects that empower citizens, promote equal opportunity, protect individuals' rights, and strengthen democratic institutions. Therefore, within the context of this category, all applications in the public interest are candidates for support; however, principal consideration will be given to telecommunications and information applications that promote economic opportunity and the effective provision of education, health care, public safety, libraries, community information services, creation of information empowerment zones, and other approaches that foster public participation in the political process and civic life. Priorities in Category Two_Planning Grants Statewide, Regional, and National Planning Grants Priority consideration will be given to projects whose impact will be statewide, regional (multi-state), or national. A component of this category will be support for states to engage in comprehensive telecommunications infrastructure planning, particularly those states that have not yet developed detailed strategies for their respective information infrastructures. NTIA will also consider, but with a lower priority, applications from states that have developed comprehensive plans, but seek further improvement in these plans. NTIA also encourages proposals from multi-state consortia, as well as from organizations, or coalitions of organizations, for regional or national telecommunications infrastructure planning. Local and Intrastate Planning Grants NTIA will deem most competitive those projects that clearly and demonstrably further the goals of this program at a community, county, or multi-county level. While the focus of this subcategory is local, NTIA encourages collaborations among counties, communities, and public and private organizations at the local or regional level, as well as coordination with state agencies involved with telecommunications infrastructure planning and implementation. Evaluation Criteria A. General Criteria As a network of networks, the telecommunications component of the National Information Infrastructure will never be a single entity. In fact, telecommunications networks and systems in the United States have been growing and evolving for more than a century. This trend will continue (and supporting it is a primary policy goal of the NII initiative), driven by technological innovation, market forces, and the elaboration of increasingly sophisticated and varied information delivery systems throughout the world. Applicants should be aware of this trend, and configure their proposed projects to take advantage of existing and emerging standards for interoperability. The success of any grant program depends upon its ability to fund only those projects that are well thought out and comprehensively planned. Therefore, no funds will be expended under this program unless the project demonstrates the most economic and efficient use of scarce Federal resources. Other general criteria that all applicants should address are:
