Speaking at a meeting with his constituents near the Sokolnikiy metro station, northeast of Moscow, on Saturday, Zhirinovskiy praised the party faction in the parliament for supporting the resolution on amnesty which has released the leaders of the October 1993 revolt in Moscow from prison. He also said that two months of his party's activity in the parliament have resulted in "certain changes" in Russia's foreign policy with regard to Serbs. He expressed the confidence that "the revived military-industrial complex of Russia can bring the country fantastic profits through selling weapons on the world market." The only thing Russia needs is "to learn how to trade" properly, he added.
