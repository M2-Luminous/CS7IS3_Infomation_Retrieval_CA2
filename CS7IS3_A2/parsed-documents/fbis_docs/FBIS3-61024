Our readers expressed the desire to learn more details about the status, functions and powers of this constitutional entity established on the basis of the Russian Federation Law "On Security." The conversation with Security Council Deputy Secretary Valeriy Manilov began with a traditional request. [SYN OTECHESTVA] Valeriy Leonidovich, we would like to hear explanations from the horse's mouth, as they say. [Manilov] To put it briefly, the Security Council essentially is a collegial, consultative entity which prepares the President's decisions in the security area. [SYN OTECHESTVA] You called the council a collegial entity. What is its makeup? [Manilov] The council presently includes 14 of the state's top officials. Three are permanent members by position: the President, who heads the Security Council; Chairman of the Council of Ministers, the Government of Russia; and the Security Council secretary. Among the 11 members appointed by the President are the ministers of Economy, Defense, Security, Internal Affairs, Justice, Ecology and Natural Resources, Health, and Finance; Chairman of Goskomfederatsii [State Committee of Federation]; and the Director of the Foreign Intelligence Service. In jointly deciding vital issues for the country under the President's direction, they coordinate and unite the efforts of ministries, departments, establishments and organizations in developing and implementing policy and strategy and ensuring state, economic, social, defense, information, ecologic and other kinds of security. [SYN OTECHESTVA] But Security Council sessions probably are preceded by some kind of preparatory work? [Manilov] Of course, an enormous amount. In the most general terms we are speaking of a comprehensive systems analysis of the development of the domestic and international situation and a forecast of its possible changes. A broad range of scientific, research and information-analysis structures are involved in such an analysis, and the capabilities of ministries, departments, and public organizations are used. It is on such an integrated basis that--let's put it this way--warnings of existing and potential threats to Russia's security are developed and proposals for reacting to them and recommendations for preventing emergency situations, overcoming their consequences, and ensuring stability and law and order in the country are formulated. [SYN OTECHESTVA] Isn't the former Politburo's "hand" apparent here? [Manilov] I know that such an analogy, concocted by someone for who knows whose need, begins circulating in the media from time to time. Despite the seeming significance, it is--excuse me for saying so--hollow. Do you know why it is absolutely illegitimate to compare the Security Council with the Politburo? This seems rudimentary, but unfortunately one has to repeat it. The Security Council has a fundamentally different mentality, if one can speak about some kind of mentality at all as applied to the Politburo. The Security Council is a constitutional entity. Its status, functions, and powers are clearly and precisely spelled out by law. And like its staff and its working entities, the interdepartmental commissions, it operates strictly within the framework of the law, on the basis of the statute approved by the President and of other legislative instruments in the security area. Its decisions are formalized by presidential edicts. They are public and open to society to the maximum possible extent. Judge for yourself whether or not substitution, duplication, let alone usurpation of the prerogatives and powers of any authoritative structures whatsoever are possible with this. No. I repeat once again: the Security Council, in which top officials of our state who are personally responsible for organizing its life and activity in the most important directions are represented, synthesizes their political will, their political wisdom, and their professional experience and knowledge into a unified national policy. [SYN OTECHESTVA] Nevertheless, the Security Council has coordinating and monitoring functions? [Manilov] This question touches on a very sensitive area, so I would like you to set forth my response to it with extreme precision. First. The Security Council does not engage in executive-administrative activity. As they say, this is the purview of the government, ministries, committees and departments. Second. The Security Council has no management functions. In accordance with the law, it develops proposals for coordinating the work of executive authorities in the process of implementing decisions made in the security area. Third. Take heed that such coordination is organized not by functions (this is the prerogative of the government), but by objectives, i.e., not at an executive level, but at a political level. And this specifically is what ensures strategic coordination of operations and the development and implementation of a unified security policy. Fourth. One other level of coordination is envisaged by legislative instruments. It relates to the development and implementation of federal programs for ensuring Russia's security. That is how matters stand with coordination. As for monitoring, it is carried out by the Security Council secretary and staff with respect to implementation of Security Council decisions and presidential edicts in security matters. [SYN OTECHESTVA] In your opinion, what is the important thing in ensuring national security? [Manilov] Generally speaking, there are no unimportant, secondary directions and spheres here. I would include problems of ensuring economic, defense, ecologic and information security and security in the foreign policy area among the basic, principal ones. Only their agreed upon, coordinated, mutually correlated resolution can be effective. No department can cope with them alone. Take ecologic security. The state of affairs here is assuming a threatening nature in many regions, including Moscow. What kind of air are we breathing? What kind of water are we drinking? Will its reserves suffice for long? What kind of "habitat" are we leaving for our children? Will it be possible to live in it? You can continue the list of questions. They must be answered today. Tomorrow already may be too late. It is the same with public security, for we are speaking essentially about creating conditions for a life that is normal and, I would say, free of fear, and about forming mechanisms for the functioning of a rule-of-law state and a civilian society. And public health protection? Is it really possible to underestimate those enormous, fully real, tangible threats about which demographic statistics of recent time literally shout? Or information security, a concept which we did not employ at all until recently. But we are speaking about something very serious. Take just one facet of the problem--our people's moral and psychological mentality. To what values--aesthetic, moral, historical, military-patriotic, cultural--is it devoted? Is it permissible to substitute for these values, alter them in an offhand way, and break the character of the people? For often the information flows which bring a cult of violence, spiritual impoverishment and primitive sex down on Russians are targeted specifically at this. This is national property which must neither be squandered nor crowded out by something alien and borrowed. [SYN OTECHESTVA] Is it possible to say at least a few words about defense security? [Manilov] Today new threats to vital interests of Russia and its allies have come to replace previous ones, which, by the way, still have not been overcome completely. A classification of them is given in the "Basic Provisions of Russian Military Doctrine" developed by the Security Council and adopted in early November. These threats must be parried. And with all the adherence to the priority of peaceful means, this is impossible to do without the presence of a defense potential adequate to Russia's place and role as a great power in the modern world. Our Armed Forces are the concentrated, realized part of this potential. Their mobility, strength level, outfitting, state of supply, and combat readiness are a national concern. This concern has two principal points of application--material and spiritual. Speaking in a generalized way, the former consists of weapons and the latter is the readiness to defend the homeland. Together they provide defense security. [SYN OTECHESTVA] Evidently the Security Council staff also is structured taking into account the broad spectrum of council tasks? [Manilov] You are correct. The structure of the Security Council staff has two main units--information analysis and coordination. They adjust close, daily interworking with federal authorities and management entities and with federation components for analyzing and forecasting the situation development, developing proposals and recommendations in the security area, and preparing and implementing federal programs. One more unit presently is being created--a system of interdepartmental commissions. These are basic working entities of the Security Council with which the staff operates side by side. There are ten. They are called upon to study and prepare fundamental proposals on security in appropriate spheres, coordinated at the ministerial and departmental level. The staff now is being formed. It is a complex stage, for, as you know, affairs are organized by humans. The main requirements placed on those who come here to work are professionalism, decency, and dedication to the job of new Russian statehood. The supertask is to establish a harmonious, hard-working collective and an atmosphere of comradeship and responsibility. [SYN OTECHESTVA] The Security Council approved the "Basic Provisions of Russian Federation Military Doctrine." Today this document is the focus of attention of politicians, political scientists, analysts, sociologists and the military here in our country and abroad. What could you say about this document? [Manilov] First of all, it is a national document. Secondly, it is Russian in spirit and content. Thirdly, it is realistic. Fourthly, it is timely. Fifthly, it is legal. It would be possible to continue, but it would appear the important thing lies elsewhere, in the fact that by adopting the "Basic Provisions of Military Doctrine" at such a difficult, highly dramatic point in its development, Russia clearly and firmly declared adherence to principles of democracy, humanism, nonuse of force, and nonintervention in affairs of other states; a clear vision of prospects for the country's reform; and a firm resolve to protect its interests, the interests of Russia. Of course, military doctrine is a topic for a separate conversation. [SYN OTECHESTVA] We hope it will take place. You mentioned Russia's interests. We spoke somehow timidly and diffidently about this previously. [Manilov] True. Even worse, at times we passed over it in silence altogether. But the fact is, vital Russian interests--above all the country's territorial integrity, sovereignty, economic independence, preservation of natural resources and all national property, and spiritual originality--are on the one hand an objective reality and on the other hand an objective need for normal development of the individual, society and the state. And in this sense--pardon me for the unintended tautology--any system, including a national security system, is vital to that extent to which it meets the Motherland's vital interests.
