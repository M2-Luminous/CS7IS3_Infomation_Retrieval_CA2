In a statement issued today, the command said that PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat's retreat from demanding international protection for the Palestinians, the dismantlement of settlements in the occupied Arab territories, and evacuation of settlers is a new violation of the Palestinian national consensus that negotiations with Israel should be stopped. In its statement, the command said that it renews its call for 'Arafat's resignation as a necessary step to learn lessons from the Israeli massacre and to maintain Palestinians' national rights.
