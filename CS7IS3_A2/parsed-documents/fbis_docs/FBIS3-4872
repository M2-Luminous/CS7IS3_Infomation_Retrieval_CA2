We have undertaken a study on the current conditions and problems within the industry in the four areas of recent friction--automobiles and auto parts, communications equipment, semiconductors, and supercomputers--and on the possibility of resolving these problems. Growing Uneasiness About the Future On the evening of 18 February, the Japan Automobile Dealers Association threw a party in Tokyo. The topic naturally turned to Japan-U.S. issues. Tatsuro Toyota, president of Toyota Motor Corporation, remarked: "Japan needs to make efforts to open up its market, but what about the high yen that has gone far too high?" Hiroyuki Yoshino, vice president of Honda Motor Company, said: "We must not become emotional. We must deal with this situation in a calm manner." The auto industry praises the Japanese Government for rejecting numerical targets, but without a lead to resolving the friction, there are growing voices of uneasiness about the future as well. The areas in which the United States demands to have numerical targets set on automobiles and auto parts are the purchase of auto parts and the expanded sale of U.S.-made vehicles in the Japanese market. Both entail the basic problem of "being linked to managed trade." Besides, the given situation of the industry is that existing business conditions being so bad, it is simply "impossible to expand the quantity of imports," according to an officer from Nissan Motor Company. Another major auto company officer asked: "The Japanese companies put in so much effort and went through unspeakable tribulations when they first began operating in the United States. Are U.S. manufacturers serious about developing markets in Japan?" U.S. Mistrust in Keiretsu What the United States wants for auto part procurements is for Japan's voluntary plan to "buy $19 billion worth of U.S.-made goods in 1994" as announced in January 1992 to be extended in duration and expanded in quantity. The $19 billion comprises $15 billion in local procurements by Japanese-affiliated plants in the United States, and $4 billion in imports to Japan. Purchases in 1990 which were used as the basis of calculation were $9.1 billion. The growth since then has been 16 percent in 1991, 29 percent in 1992, and 11 percent in the first half of 1993. The United States demands growth be raised by 10 to 30 percent in 1995, and then retain that rate thereafter. Toyoshi Kume, chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, while speaking in a meeting of the Joint Steering Committee of the Japanese-U.S. Businessmen's Conference held shortly after the Japan-U.S. summit stated: "In view of the current conditions of the Japanese economy, it will be difficult to fulfill the targets." Tazo Yokoyama, executive director of Mitsubishi Motors Corporation, noted: "The economic conditions are different from those when (then) President Bush was in Japan in January 1992." Japan's automobile production dropped from 13.50 million units in 1990 to 10.22 million units in 1993. Given such conditions, a staff official of the Japanese Automobile Manufacturers Association said: "Importing auto parts can mean life or death for Japanese parts manufacturers." Total sales for the parts industry are said to total about 18 trillion yen a year. The $4 billion (about 400 billion yen) asked to be imported into Japan comes to 2 percent of total domestic sales, and is comparable to the annual sales of Aishin Precision Machinery Company, Japan's second largest manufacturer (whose yearly sales up to the first quarter of 1994 are expected to total 465 billion yen). Concerning local procurements, the views of the U.S. private sector are somewhat different from those shown by the U.S. Government. Joseph Gorman, chairman of the major U.S. parts manufacturer TRW, declared: "Our company has no complaints about Japan with respect to business. Over the past two to three years, U.S. parts manufacturers have gone into a relationship of cooperating with Japanese auto manufacturers from the design stage on, and sales of parts for use in local production of automobiles have risen sharply since last year." Nonetheless, within the United States there remains a feeling of mistrust. A top executive of a U.S. parts manufacturer said: "Japanese auto manufacturers might return to the practice of buying parts primarily from keiretsu companies once the numerical targets are removed." Voices Urge "Buying 100,000 Units a Year" Regarding imports of finished vehicles, the United States has not officially presented any numbers in the negotiation, but in the U.S. industry there are voices saying Japan should buy at least 100,000 units a year. According to a survey done by the Japan Automobile Importers Association, total sales for all U.S. Big Three vehicles sold in Japan in 1993 totaled only 19,300 units. Toyota has announced a plan to sell 20,000 units of General Motors compact cars beginning in 1996. Nissan-affiliated dealers are due to finish by year's end the groundwork to be able to sell 3,000 to 4,500 units of Ford passenger cars. The Big Three themselves are beginning to take the Japanese market seriously, for instance by announcing plans to introduce right-hand drive cars. But as one influential Toyota-affiliated dealer said, there are persistent complaints of "their service system being inadequate." It will not be easy to accomplish the target of 100,000 units. In a news conference on 21 February Keishin Kato, chairman of the Automobile Dealers Association, said: "It would be wrong for the association to advise member dealers to accept U.S.-made automobiles." He thus declared the association will allow dealers to decide on whether to handle U.S.-made vehicles. The association is determined to firmly reject any numerical targets. But Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international trade and industry, is himself hopeful the industry will make efforts toward importation, stating: "I welcome the private sector taking measures voluntarily to expand imports." More or less in response to this, and while the government was in process of negotiating, the auto industry studied formulating the industry's own programs for international cooperation. Now it has become difficult for the industry to come up with any measures. A Toyota official said: "It is meaningless to adopt such measures now when government-to-government negotiations have broken down." The industry's own voluntary cooperation plan, which accepts no administrative guidance, and hence no numerical targets, remains a subject to be studied. But the industry insists "the study should be done on a business basis by all means," and it is unclear whether a compromise can be reached with the United States.
