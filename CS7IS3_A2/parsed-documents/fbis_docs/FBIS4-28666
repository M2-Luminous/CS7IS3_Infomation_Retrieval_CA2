Addressing the JNP's national convention, Hosokawa said the party should "play a pioneering role in the second stage of political realignment even with a resolution to dissolve the party for the sake of reform." Hosokawa also vowed the party's utmost efforts to bring the Social Democratic Party (SDP) back to the ruling coalition as part of efforts to jointly tackle a number of issues of immediate concern. "If the SDP decides to join hands with us, we will not spare any effort to lay the groundwork for its return to the coalition," said Hosokawa, who resigned the premiership in April to take the blame for his alleged financial improprieties. The national gathering, the first since the JNP set up shop in May 1992, brought together over 70 members of both houses of the Diet and representatives from local chapters of the party. At the convention, the JNP approved its action plan for 1994 in which the party promised to seek the dissolution of the parliamentary group Kaishin, of which the JNP is a member, while groping for a strong political power base with other parties. The SDP, now the second-largest opposition force, walked out of the coalition in April in protest against the formation of Kaishin by other coalition partners without the SDP. The SDP's departure forced Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to form the first minority government since 1955. The JNP also approved the new leadership under Hosokawa. Satsuki Eda, former leader of the United Social Democratic Party, a minor political force that disbanded in May, and Yuriko Koike were elected the party's deputies, while Masuo Matsuoka was retained as representative secretary general. At a news conference held after the party meeting, Hosokawa spoke of the need for coalition parties to take a united front in achieving administrative and economic reforms by setting aside key policy differences. "We are now in a state of emergency," he said. "We must ride out the stormy weather at sea." Hosokawa expressed hope the Diet testimony by his former aide Masatoshi Miyama will help dispel allegations that he received 100 million yen in illegal donations from a scandal-tainted trucking firm. Hosokawa says the money was a loan he repaid later. He also said he will testify before the Diet himself if the legislature decides to summon him as a sworn witness. Miyama is to testify under oath on the money scandal at the House of Representatives budget committee on Wednesday. Hosokawa has repeatedly denied charges that the money was an illicit political contribution, saying he accepted the 100 million yen from the Sagawa Kyubin group in 1982 and had repaid it with interest by 1991.
