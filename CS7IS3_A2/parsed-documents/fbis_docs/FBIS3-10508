The spirit behind the GATT Uruguay Round agreement is that all problems should be resolved multilaterally. One of the Uruguay Round's major achievements was the decision to strengthen the multilateral system as an advanced way of resolving controversies." On 4 March, Amorim held a working meeting with his Venezuelan counterpart, Angel Burelli Rivas, in La Guaira, a city located near Caracas, to negotiate the signing of an economic complementation agreement between their two countries. Although Venezuela has no substantive trade problems with the United States -- as Burelli Rivas told GAZETA -- the Venezuelan press gave wide coverage to the new measure announced by President Bill Clinton. The Venezuelan media believe the Super 301 will give Clinton special powers to pressure Japan into opening its market to U.S. products. In the opinion of Burelli Rivas, the Super 301 could bring problems to the United States within the GATT Uruguay Round agreement.
