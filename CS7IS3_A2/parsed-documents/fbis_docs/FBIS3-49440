Although we continue to have a critical stance vis-a-vis some NATO moves, we do not conceal our satisfaction at the fact that the "Sixteen" in Brussels have advocated negotiations -- something we have been in favor of from the very beginning, Krajisnik added. He pointed out that the Serb side will continue to reject any planned resolutions that might imperil the strategic interests of the Serbian people. Commenting on the possibility of the withdrawal of the "blue helmets" from the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, Krajisnik said that UN forces ought to remain until peace is achieved. He added that the Serbs will not protest if the peace-keeping forces withdraw, because, he added, they have not been protecting the Serbs in any case, but the Muslims. He recalled that it was with this protection that the Muslims had armed themselves. Peace could be achieved more easily and quickly, according to Krajisnik, if such support were withheld from the Muslims.
