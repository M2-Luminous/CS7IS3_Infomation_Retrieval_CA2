To judge by speeches and talks both in and out of the meeting, many developing countries expected and supported such an agreement, and the creation of a World Trade Organization (WTO) designed to structure a better global economic order. On the other hand, they also have reservations and even worries about the conclusion of the Uruguay-Round trade talks. An opening international economic environment and a complete set of international trade regulations are necessary for a developing country to improve its economy. As one representative from a developing country said, "the future of the global economy and the prosperity of developing countries will depend on the opening-up of the international trade system." This GATT agreement achieved a wide range of market-entry promises, stressing the principle of freedom in international trade and improving multilateral trade regulations. This achievement has been welcomed and basically supported by developing countries. They believe that by this agreement, which has strengthened multilateral trade regulations and will establish a mechanism to solve possible trade disputes, developing countries will be less discriminated against. Representatives from developing countries also pointed out that the implementation of the Uruguay-Round agreement and the establishment of a world trade organization to replace GATT will inaugurate a new phase in world trade, bringing greater cooperation, more investment, more employment and faster economic growth. At the same time, some representatives from developing countries hold the opinion that the final outcome of the talks doesn't attach enough importance to profits of developing countries, and that the clauses related to market-entry are still insufficient. They said that this final agreement does not match concessions made by developing countries during the talks, and could even be harmful to a few debtor countries. They also expressed their worry about clauses on society in general, especially those concerning the rights of workers. "The rights of workers should be certainly protected, but it shouldn't be used as an excuse to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries," said one representative. They also worry that clauses on society may be contained in the guiding principles of a world trade organization. Although there were many reservations and concerns about the final outcome of the Uruguay-Round talks and the establishment of a world trade organization, most developing countries still place great hope in such an organization, which is expected to emerge in the near future. Many people from developing countries expected that a world trade organization will bring them equal and ample opportunities to participate, and will give substantial assistance to the least developed countries on special and favorable principles. They hope the organization will promote the establishment of a fairer new international economic order and take efficient measures to guarantee the competitive capacity of developing countries and further improve their ability to enter international markets. Only because a large number of developing countries supported the Uruguay-Round agreement and the establishment of a world trade organization was it possible for ministers from more than 120 countries to sign the world's largest trade deal.
