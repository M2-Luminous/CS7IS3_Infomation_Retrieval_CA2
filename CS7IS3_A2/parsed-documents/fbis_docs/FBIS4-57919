In an interview with PRENSA LATINA, Santamaria recalled important events that have taken place in the past few hours as part of the joint efforts by the two Latin American countries. Yesterday, Camilo Penalosa, Colombia's deputy minister of economic development, ended a visit to Cuba in which he led a group of businessmen interested in investing in the island. There was also the arrival of the Colombian training ship, Arc Gloria, which brought a message of friendship to the Cuban people. The Colombian and Cuban Civil Aeronautics Directorates have also signed an agreement allowing for prompt establishment of regular flights, linking their capitals and other cities in the two countries. Commenting on the businessmen's visit, Santamaria explained that this was a positive step in joint business ventures and that it had exceeded expectations, as face-to-face meetings were held with people who want to invest in Cuba. He said the businessmen identified specific points of cooperation. As part of the next phase of the talks, they arranged for a new meeting to be held soon in Bogota with ranking Cuban and Colombian officials in order to reach specific agreements. He said the visitors exchanged views on prospects for Cuba's economy and its future, as well as on new methods of foreign investment approved by the Cuban state. The diplomat said this type of visit creates a continuity that gives Colombians direct knowledge of the opportunities that exist in Cuba to establish ventures beneficial to both countries. The topic of the aeronautics agreement recently signed was broached with enthusiasm by Santamaria, who described this as the principal object of the diplomatic mission's work in view of its economic importance. This is done on the basis of a real market because there are clear prospects for scheduling several weekly flights between the capitals and other cities in Cuba and Colombia, as evidenced by the increase in tourist flights this year, he noted. The ambassador noted how increased travel between the two countries, not only of tourists but also of businessmen and respective government officials, will help strengthen bilateral relations between the two countries. This important agreement was reached thanks to Cuba's constructive attitude, which can expect of us all the loyalty expected of a brother country, he said. Santamaria referred to the negotiations on expanding the partial agreement, which would represent a significant increase in commercial bilateral ties. To this end, the Colombian Government is now consulting with the private sector on tariff issues, which would affect over 800 products included in the expansion and which were the object of prior agreements during the last meeting in Havana. We hope to sign the respective document between the Cuban and Colombian Foreign Trade Ministries this coming June or July, based on the work that has been carried out and the technical meetings that have been held, the ambassador concluded.
