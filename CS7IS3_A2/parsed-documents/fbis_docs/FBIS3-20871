Oreb: "Zagreb News Conference by Croatian Electric Power Industry: Dalmatia Without Electric Woes"] [Text] Work on completing the 110-kilovolt "island link" through Melina-Krk-Rab-Pag to Zadar is progressing according to plan, and completion of the so-called zero phase is expected in July; construction of the thermoelectric power plant in Dujmovaca, near Split, is also on schedule, and the first generator, with 26 megawatts of power, will be synchronized to the network on the 17th of this month. Zagreb--Extensive work is expected in Dalmatia and Istria on reviving and reconstructing the electric power network, which is both in ruins and in disrepair. This was noted at a press conference by the Croatian Electric Power Industry [HEP], at which a new program for revitalizing electric power installations in the coastal region of Croatia was presented. The "Plan to Develop the Electric Power Network of Underwater Cables of the Adriatic Islands" provides for an investment of 126,234,875 German marks [DM] over the coming six-month period to replace damaged electric power links among the Adriatic islands, and to lay new ones. On the list of priorities are 35-kilovolt cables between Peljesac and Korcula, Peljesac and Mljet, Korcula and Lastovo, Vis and Hvar, Brac and Solta, Zadar and Dugi Otok, and Losinj and Silba, together with a 35/10-kilovolt Losinj 2 transformer station; there are also plans to overhaul the electric supply system in the part of Split-Dalmatia Zupanija that is the farthest behind in development (Vis, Solta, and Drvenik Veliki). Discussing the work of the electric power system in Dalmatia, which is still part of the "island regime," HEP general director Eng. Damir Begovic emphasized that electric power links in the south of the country are in extremely poor condition due to poor maintenance and inadequate investment, and that the presented reconstruction program is the basis for developing the tourist economy. Eng. Begovic informed the journalists that negotiations are under way on acquiring the first equipment necessary to begin revitalizing the medium-voltage network on the islands, in which DM14 million will be invested. It is expected that a contract with the German suppliers, under the "sponsorship" of the HERMES underwriter, will be signed in April of this year. Discussing the current electric power situation in the country, Eng. Begovic said that despite the division in the electric power systems of southern and northern Croatia, there will be no major problems in supplying electric power. A reliable supply of electricity in Dalmatia is guaranteed by the 120 megawatts of installed output at diesel and gas plants set up as intervention measures. Work on completing the 110-kilovolt "island link" through Melina-Krk-Rab-Pag to Zadar is progressing according to plan, and completion of the so-called zero phase is expected in July of this year. Construction of the thermoelectric power plant in Dujmovaca, near Split, is also on schedule, and the first generator, with 26 megawatts of power, will be synchronized to the network on the 17th of this month. Because of the war and the shortage of investment resources, the electric power situation in the rest of Croatia, especially in Slavonia, also requires intervention. Electric power installations are in disrepair, so that the HEP is missing out on 200 megawatts of output because there is no money for maximum utilization of the existing systems. The HEP has indicated that it will be forced to continually import electric power from Western European countries until it is possible to invest in repairs to the "Rijeka" and "Plomin I" thermoelectric plants and to other important electric power installations. Moreover, the financial situation at HEP is burdened by old debts "worth" DM200 million. On the other hand, demand by debtors, especially industries that are unable to pay existing debts for the supply of electric power, are continually on the rise and currently amount to around DM170 million. Of that amount, DM20 million is owed by health care institutions, waterworks, and other protected consumers. The worst situation is in Dalmatia, which because of its isolation in terms of trade and energy is in a very difficult position, so that problems with recovering debts are also great. The journalists were also informed of the beginning of the HEP transformation process, which will take place gradually and is expected to take five years. It is expected that the HEP will be privatized based on the "Ina" [Petroleum Refining and Sales Enterprise] model, while it is expected that this public enterprise will be listed as a joint-stock company in June of this year. One of the principles for restructuring the HEP, which is being conducted by the Office of the Government of the Republic of Croatia for the Economy and the Restructuring of Public Enterprises, is consideration for the zupanija structure.
