(KUNA) -- An authoritative source from the Foreign Ministry today denied a report published by the London-based AL-HAYAH on the existence of Algerian good offices to clear the atmosphere between Kuwait and Iraq, on an alleged meeting between Kuwaiti and Iraqi delegations at an Arab embassy, and on a linkage between these allegations and [Foreign Minister] Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jabir's current tour of sisterly Arab states in North Africa. In a statement to KUNA, the source also expressed Kuwait's rejection of any linkage between Shaykh Sabah's tour with the message sent by the president of the Iraqi regime to the Algerian head of state. The source said that "while Kuwait denies the report published by the London-based AL-HAYAH, it would like to emphasize that Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad's tour of sisterly Arab states aims to bolster relations between Kuwait and these states. It also falls within Kuwait's policy of aiming to consolidate ties between Arab brothers to strengthen the Arab stance." The source also indicated that Kuwait's relations with Iraq are governed by the UN resolutions that Iraq must adhere to instead of pursuing blatant attempts to flout them and refusing to implement them. In today's edition, AL-HAYAH published a report which it attributed to a source close to the Algerian Foreign Ministry who stated that "Algerian endeavors are being made to clear the atmosphere among Arab brothers." The paper reported that the source "did not rule out the possibility of Algerian mediation between Kuwait and Iraq." The paper added that reliable sources had disclosed to AL-HAYAH that "a Kuwaiti delegation has held a meeting with an Iraqi delegation at an Arab embassy."
