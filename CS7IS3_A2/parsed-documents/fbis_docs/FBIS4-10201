As is already known, the Global Plan was formulated by the Defense Ministry a few months after the unfortunate 4 February and 27 November 1992 incidents. The objective of this plan was -- and continues to be -- to improve the military's standard of living, enhance benefit quality, strengthen the programs that would finance the plan, and widen the coverage and design new programs to protect the entire FAN [National Armed Forces] population. These specific objectives, however, according to the military source, will not be implemented because of the serious fiscal deficit that is hampering the Armed Forces' capital requirements. During the administration of then Defense Minister General Ivan Dario Jimenez Sanchez, the plan was encouraged in order to meet the general objective of offering welfare and security to FAN military and civilian personnel. The plan itself was designed by taking into account issues like health, housing, recreation, socioeconomic support, social security, sports, education, and culture and to include other related issues that would ensure as many "benefits as possible" to all FAN personnel. At any rate, under the administration of Gen. Angel Rafael Montero Revette it has become necessary to reschedule the plan. The fiscal deficit would seem to be the stumbling block to welfare and social security benefits since it unfortunately hampers several of the programs which had been allocated until 1995, the date selected to implement the plan. The Defense Ministry spokesman indicated that after analyzing the socioeconomic situation of military personnel, including those civilians working for the military, it was concluded that the FAN personnel's social securuty and welfare in general is inadequate. This is especially true in health care, housing, and recreation, where there is a need for more money. In principle, the plan stipulated the need for 18 billion bolivares. This amount would be divided as follows: 37 percent to health issues, 40 percent to housing, and 9 percent to recreation. On the other hand, the plan would be divided into three parts based on how it would be financed: A Global Investment Plan to be implemented by means of additional financial investments procured through a Public Credit Law and a contingency budget prompted by the aforementioned Investment Plan, the financing of which would be done through ordinary budget stipulations. In addition, financially quantifiable measures are clearly needed in order to reinforce decisions made in the two previous plans. The military spokesman concludes by indicating that the strategies of the Global Plan, which have so far been more theoretical than practical, are aimed at achieving the implementation of the welfare and social security system, accomplishing and consolidating the development of social policies through legal, institutional, and financial mechanisms and procedures in order to provide administrative consistency and coherence to the social programs. It also seeks to encourage the active participation of all social sectors, draft systematic and balanced programs to continuously improve health care, housing, education, culture and recreation, sports, social welfare, as well as socioeconomic support.
