The general, questioned on a possible U.S. military intervention in Haiti to allow the return of President Aristide, said it would be a gross mistake. For the Army commander in chief, the solution to the crisis should come through dialogue. Regarding those who attempt to reach Florida by boat, Gen. Cedras indicated they are economic refugees. Rothschild Francois filed a report: [Begin recording] [Francois] The first subject touched on with Gen. Cedras on Sunday 8 May on NBC was the situation of the boat people. To the Army chief, those Haitians who go to sea are economic refugees. They go searching for greater economic welfare and the American dream, he added. The general pointed out that under the administration of President Aristide, in April 1991, 400 Haitian boat people were able to reach Florida's coasts. Clearly, to the first in command of the military institution, the economic situation is responsible for the refugees. Questioned on the proposal made by some sectors of the United States who favor a military invasion of Haiti to restore President Aristide to power, Gen. Raoul Cedras asserted that such a decision would be a gross mistake and indicated that for him, the solution to the crisis would come through dialogue: [Cedras in French, with passage-by-passage translation into English] You know that Haiti is a very small country. One can always ensure trial of strength [?over night, over right]. I personally think that a military invasion would be a gross mistake. [Unidentified reporter in English] Would you resist such an invasion, or would you escape? [Cedras] It is not the Army which is [word indistinct]. It concerns a country, a country which must be indemnified, a country which has its laws, its rights. You are asking me if I would escape. I would tell you that personally, I do not have any importance. The nation's highest interests order me to support dialogue to reach a solution to the crisis. [Francois] On the thorny question regarding his resignation as head of the Army, and his willingness to respect the agreements made on Governors Island, Gen. Cedras explains, and we quote: The problem has always been wrongly posed. People focus more, he says, on the superficial points included in the agreement. For me, the Governors Island agreement is a global plan which would allow for reconciliation among Haitians. I was quoting the Army commander in chief. If the parliament passes the amnesty law, would you be ready to resign as head of the military institution and allow the return of President Aristide to Haiti? [Cedras] At this point in the situation, everyone in Haiti and abroad should favor dialogue as the only way for us to reach a satisfactory conclusion. [Unidentified reporter] General, that does not really answer my question. Would you be willing to accept an amnesty law and step aside for President Aristide? [Cedras] I am telling you that, when, in the Governors Island agreement, we considered the amnesty law, it was based on a global plan. Now, we are talking about the amnesty law. What about the other measures? What about those who did not respect their word? [Francois] During his interview on 8 May with NBC, Gen. Cedras condemned the sanctions, saying they should have been a means not a policy. He hopes the international community will reconsider before the total embargo takes effect in less than two weeks. Gen. Cedras, who was questioned by NBC from the Teleco [telephone company] Building, asked U.S. President Bill Clinton to review his policy toward our country. [end recording]
