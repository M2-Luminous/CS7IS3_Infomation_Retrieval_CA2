The provincial commanders in Zhalah [northern Iraq and western Iran], Botan [region around Hakkari], and Amed [region around Diyarbakir] have already been replaced. The only area in which changes will not be made is Dersim [region around Tunceli], one of the eight provinces. KURD-A will issue a statement once the commanders in the remaining provinces are also replaced. It has been reported that soon after the replacement of the provincial commanders, the PKK will make a "call for peace" on the eve of local elections. The PKK has thus far replaced the commanders in three provinces. Numan Celik replaced Osman Ocalan [brother of Abdullah Ocalan] in Zhalah. Murat Karayilan was appointed to Botan. "Munzur" replaced Semdin Sakik in Amed. From among the replaced provincial commanders, only Munzur is "more moderate" compared to the commander he replaced. Doctor Baran, the commander of Dersim Province, remains in his post. It was reported that PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan gave the following reason for these changes: "Younger provincial commanders are being appointed. A rejuvenation operation has started inside PKK."
