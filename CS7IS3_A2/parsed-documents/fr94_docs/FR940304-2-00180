FR940304-2-00180 FR940304-2-00098 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [Docket No. 93&hyph;29; Notice 2] Am-Safe, Inc.; Grant of Petition for Determination of Inconsequential Noncompliance Am-Safe, Inc. (Am-Safe) of Phoenix, Arizona, determined that some of its replacement seat belt assemblies fail to comply with 49 CFR 571.209, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 209, ``Seat Belt Assemblies,'' and filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR part 573, ``Defect and Noncompliance Reports.'' Am-Safe also petitioned to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1381 et seq. ) on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. Notice of receipt of the petition was published on April 29, 1993, and an opportunity afforded for comment (58 FR 26032). This notice grants that petition. Between January 1985 and the date it filed its petition, Am-Safe produced and distributed approximately 100,000 replacement seat belts which did not include the installation and maintenance instructions required by Standard No. 209. Paragraph S4.1(k) of Standard No. 209, requires that: A seat belt assembly or retractor shall be accompanied by an instruction sheet providing sufficient information for installing the assembly in a motor vehicle except for a seat belt assembly installed in a motor vehicle by an automobile manufacturer. The installation instructions shall state whether the assembly is for universal installation or for installation only in specifically stated motor vehicles *␣*␣*␣. In addition, section S.4.1(1) requires that: A seat belt assembly or retractor shall be accompanied by written instructions for the proper use of the assembly, stressing particularly the importance of wearing the assembly snugly and properly located on the body, and on the maintenance of the assembly and periodic inspection of all components. The instructions shall show the proper manner of threading webbing in the hardware of seat belt assemblies in which the webbing is not permanently fastened. Am-Safe supported its petition for inconsequential noncompliance with the following: No Evidence of Incorrectly Installed Seat Belts [Am-Safe believes] the simplistic mounting design of these seat belts make [sic] it improbable that any incorrect installations exist. Am-Safe, Inc. is unaware of any suggestions or allegations, in regards to motor vehicle safety, concerning seat belts that were incorrectly installed. [Am-Safe Sophisticated Part Numbering System Seat belts are identified by a nine or ten digit part number. A typical seat belt part number is 502293&hyph;401&hyph;6. The 502293 defines the basic belt configuration such as a retractable or nonretractable lap belt. The &hyph;401 specifies the dimensions of [the] web and component cover lengths. The &hyph;6 is the color code when applicable. Permanently affixed labels have pertinent information to ensure the proper seat belt is ordered for replacement. This label includes the part number, manufacturing date, and name and phone number of the manufacturer. This accurate numbering system can be confidently used for proper seat belt replacement. Simple Installation Procedures The seat belts in question are attached to the vehicle anchorage holes with existing mounting hardware. These assemblies require only one bolt for attachment of the buckle half and one bolt for the attachment of the connector half. The accomplish the installation of a replacement seat belt, the existing seat belt must first be removed from the vehicle. These steps are then reversed for proper installation of the replacement seat belt. The majority of these replacements are performed by individuals acquainted with seat belt installation, i.e.; seat manufacturers, transit but operators, and associated companies [which] perform seat belt installation on a regular basis. In addition, the design and construction characteristics of these seat belts reflect universal practices of operation and maintenance procedures. Conclusion There is no evidence that any of the subject seat belts are incorrectly installed. These seat belts have been installed and are currently in service without incident making a recall impractical. The complex part numbering system used by Am-Safe, Inc. leaves little chance for error when ordering a replacement seat belt. In the majority of cases, installation was performed by companies with experienced [personnel] familiar with correct procedures. [In i]nstances where seat belts are knowingly distributed to the general public, Am-Safe, Inc. has always supplied appropriate instructions. [As a] result of this noncompliance, Am-Safe, Inc. now includes these instructions with all seat belts unless otherwise instructed by the vehicle manufactures. In conclusion, Am-Safe, Inc. believes that lack of instructions for seat belts that are currently in service is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. No comments were received on the petition. With respect to the failure to provide installation instructions, the petitioner has argued that its parts ordering and shipping procedures ensure that the correct replacement parts are received by the dealer. Installation of the belts is a simple procedure, requiring only one bolt for the attachment of the buckle half and one bolt for the attachment of the connector half. These restraints are typically installed by persons who perform replacements on a regular basis. After reviewing these arguments, NHTSA concurs with them.
