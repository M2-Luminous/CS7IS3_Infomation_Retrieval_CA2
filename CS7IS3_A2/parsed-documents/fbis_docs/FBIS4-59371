['Aziz] It is an insult not only to the Iraqi administration but also the Iraqi people. The UN officials wish to distribute foodstuffs and pharmaceutical drugs in Iraq even though they know that foodstuffs are already being distributed in our country. They just wish to impose that condition. [Batur] How has the Saddam administration been able to remain on its feet despite the pressure to which it has been subjected for so many years? ['Aziz] This shows the healthy relations between the Iraqi people and administration. Otherwise, no administration would have survived that pressure. The CIA has drawn up plans and designs against the administration. However, the government has remained on its feet... [ellipsis as published] [Batur] Has the CIA tried to have Saddam Husayn ousted? ['Aziz] That has been disclosed by the U.S. officials themselves. It is not an Iraqi claim. They supported the opposition groups in Iraq with $30-$40 million. However, they got nothing from it. [Batur] Do you think a democratic process could be a way out for Iraq? ['Aziz] We have our own standards of democratization. We cannot adopt liberal standards similar to those in the United States and Western Europe. Iraq existed for thousands of years before the United States appeared in the international arena. It decides for itself what it wishes to do. It has decided to keep its present administration. [Batur] Will Iraq not disintegrate if the present state of affairs is allowed to continue? ['Aziz] No, it will not. It was said in 1990, 1991, and 1992 that the disintegration of Iraq was only a matter of minutes away. Predictions were made that our country would break up within six months and the administration would be ousted. However, it has not disintegrated, nor will it. We have remained on our feet for 6,000 years. [Batur] Is it true that an effort is being made to establish a Kurdish State in northern Iraq? The framework of that state will be established in due time... ['Aziz] No, I do not think so. There is no potential for the establishment of a Kurdish state. The present state of affairs is an artificial situation created by the United States. We reached an agreement with the Kurdish leaders in 1991. They were ready to sign it. [Batur] Was it only Democratic Party Leader of Kurdistan Mas'ud Barzani who was ready? Was Patriotic Union of Kurdistan Leader Jalal Talabani also prepared to sign it? ['Aziz] Barzani was prepared to do so. However, Talabani changes his mind every two hours. Barzani said that he needed a few weeks to secure the support of the people. He was immediately summoned to Washington and London. The U.S. and British Administrations instructed him not to sign that agreement. Actually, the agreement was a democratic accord. It would have served both sides' interests. However, Washington and London obstructed it. [Batur] Was it the objective of establishing a Kurdish State that caused the failure of that agreement? ['Aziz] No, it was not. However, they were convinced that the agreement would strengthen the Saddam Administration. That is why they blocked it. Nevertheless, they did not support the establishment of a Kurdish State. The Kurds were used in the past, and they are still being used. They were used as a trump card to weaken the Iraqi Government in the 1970's. The U.S. officials are again using the Kurdish problem card against the Iraqi administration at the present time. [Batur] The Kurds continue to fear Baghdad... ['Aziz] Why are they afraid? [Batur] Well, they were attacked in the past. ['Aziz] Why should they be attacked--that is, unless they attack the Iraqi administration first? Several factions in the political parties headed by Talabani and Barzani cooperated with Iran and were attacked for that reason. They opposed Iraq when the United States and its Western allies were at war with our country. They are receiving material aid from Washington and London to use against their own people right now. However, the majority of the Kurdish people do not support the Kurdish leaders' policies.
