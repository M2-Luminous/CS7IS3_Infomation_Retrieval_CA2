A small number of these enterprises would have their primary listings in New York. In addition, feasibility studies on listing shares of some state-owned enterprises on the London Stock Exchange or in southeast Asian markets, such as Singapore, are also being conducted. At a promotion hosted by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Professor Liu Hongru revealed that in 1994, China's securities business will undergo its greatest changes. This year, over 100 companies will list their shares on the stock exchange, raising a total of 5.5 billion yuan. He said that the two existing stock exchanges in China are located in Shenzhen and Shanghai, both of which are in the southern part of the country. This limits their capacity. The authorities are now considering the establishment of another stock exchange in the north of the country. As for the future prospects of the securities markets in Shanghai and Hong Kong, Liu said that there are many differences between Shanghai and Hong Kong. Hong Kong is a financial center in which international investors had great confidence. After 1997, the "one country, two systems" policy will enable Hong Kong to maintain its current status. China attaches great importance to Hong Kong's bridging role. Professor Liu Hongru is visiting Britain at the invitation of the British Government. During his visit, he will meet with British officials from the Foreign Office, the Treasury, the Department of Trade and Industry, and the stock exchange. He said that China should learn from Britain's finance industry. When asked whether the Sino-British dispute over Hong Kong's political arrangements would affect Sino-British economic and trade cooperation and the performances of H-shares in Hong Kong, he said that the number of Chinese enterprises listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange would increase from nine to 20 this year, and the Hang Seng Index had topped 10,000 points. These facts gave the answer. Liu Hongru also talked about China's macro-control measures. He said that in 1994, measures to prohibit real estate companies from listing on stock exchanges would be relaxed, but only those engaged in renovating old urban areas and constructing houses for ordinary residents would be allowed to list. Companies engaged in real estate speculation would still be forbidden to list. At present, six state-owned Chinese enterprises are listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and another three are arranging listings. Lee Yik-kwong, chairman of the Hong Kong Joint Exchange, said that the three Chinese enterprises would be listed in February or March.
