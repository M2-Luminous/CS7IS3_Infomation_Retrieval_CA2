Bronovets, G.A. Sverchkova, Belarussian Advanced Physicians Training Institute; UDC 615.243.4-02:612.321:616.33-002.44] [Abstract] Increasing uses of dalargin--an opioid peptide and synthetic counterpart of Leu-enkephalin--for treatment of stomach and duodenum disorders and a lack of studies of dalargin's effect on the acidogenic function of the stomach in stomach and duodenum ulcer patients prompted an examination of 54 such patients (40 men and 14 women) with stomach (11) and duodenum (43) ulcer. The largest group was made by 18-39 year old (31 patients). All patients were divided into two groups: in the first (8 patients), 0.5 mg of dalargin was administered intravenously and in the second, 1 mg was administered to 46 patients; the acidogenic function was examined by pH-metry. An analysis shows that no significant changes occurred in the first group after a single dalargin injection or after a two-week treatment course. In the second group, dalargin injection inhibited the acidogenic function some 3-4 min later in duodenum ulcer patients; this function remained inhibited for 30-40 min. In the case of a treatment course, dalargin stimulates the alkalizing function of the antral stomach section and, to a lesser extent, suppresses the acidogenic function of the stomach body and fundus.
