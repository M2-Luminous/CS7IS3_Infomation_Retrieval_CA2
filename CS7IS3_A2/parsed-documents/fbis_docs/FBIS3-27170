He added: "I am satisfied with their response. President Yeltsin is at this moment speaking over the phone to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and extensive phone calls are being made to other ministries." "There is now a growing mood to seize the momentum and end the war," Kozyrev said further. Kozyrev stressed that it is important for Russia to encourage the Serbs keep to the agreement and for the U.S. and other nations to persuade the opposing sides not to try and exploit the Serbian withdrawal but use the situation as the chance for opening peace talks. He added that it was now most important for joint efforts to be made to bring the warring sides to a real peace compromise. Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said yesterday that the Serbs had agreed to withdraw heavy weapons from around Sarajevo after Russia pledged to provide 400 troops in the area. "We do think that the war in Sarajevo is finally over," Karadzic said in the city of Pale, close to Sarajevo. NATO is threatening the Bosnian Serbs with air strikes unless they neutralize or remove heavy guns around Sarajevo by midnight on Sunday. After a meeting in Athens with German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, Kozyrev told reporters last night that the Serbs had agreed to pull back all heavy artillery following an appeal by Russian President Yeltsin and his pledge to send Russian peacekeeping troops to the area. Kinkel and Kozyrev are here to attend the crucial EU troika meeting this morning with their Greek and Belgian counterparts Karolos Papoulias and Willy Claes, to discuss the Bosnian crisis. U.S. Special Envoy to the former Yugoslavia Charles Redman, who arrived yesterday unexpectedly in Athens, will also attend the meeting.
