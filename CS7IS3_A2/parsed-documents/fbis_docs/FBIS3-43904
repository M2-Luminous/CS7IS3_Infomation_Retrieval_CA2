Correspondents in the Zambian capital say that the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] has made concessions, in the wake of the government's refusal to disband the Riot Police, also known as ninjas. News agencies with representatives in Luanda are citing an article carried by the JORNAL DE ANGOLA newspaper today saying that the talks are deadlocked and that prospects for an accord are rather dim. What is more, those news agencies report that the Angolan Government and UNITA teams have not achieved any consensus over the general principles that will guide the formation of the future national police force. Joao van Dunem, a BBC Portuguese Service reporter, interviewed UNITA Information Secretary Jorge Valentim this afternoon and he affirmed that consensus has already been reached on the general principles that will govern the formation of the future police force. Dr. Jorge Valentim added that only the specifics of that matter are being discussed now. [Begin recording] [Valentim] The talks are going very well. After we had defined the general principles of the legal framework governing the creation and operation of the police force in a legal state, we moved on to discuss specific principles. UNITA has presented a document containing more than 18 points and it has to do with specific principles which also concern the Riot Police. Our approach was creative, imaginative, and realistic. It is our view that, in any legal state, the national police has certain special functions. Now, we have policemen, said to be riot policemen or whatever other name they may have been given, who are acting within the context of a legal framework. [Dunem] That means, then, that the legal framework has been defined in full and that the government and UNITA have reached consensus? [Valentim] There is already (?common) ground. The framework has been defined, even with regard to UNITA's participation: the way the police force will operate, who does what, when the police force should intervene, and what its limits are. All that has been defined. We can tell you that, contrary to what has been reported by some international circles, things are moving forward. The only problem is that legal work is rather picky and sensitive work and we were not helped by the fact that such legal work had not been done before. So, it has taken a while but now there are concrete results. [Dunem] That means, then, that the Lusaka peace talks are now focusing on specific principles? [Valentim] Absolutely. We are discussing specific principles and also regulations. Since when does a riot police force abandon its barracks to intervene in social affairs that should be the responsibility of political and administrative authorities? Such a police force should only intervene, and then in accordance with the law, once it has become clear that the normal police force does not have the means to restore order, after which they must promptly return to their barracks. Those are things that were not enshrined in the law. [Dunem] Dr. Valentim: at the weekend, Savimbi signed a communique which observers have perceived to be a clear declaration of war. That communique says that, unless the international community recognizes the (?flaws) in the September 1992 elections and the concessions that have been made by UNITA, the Lusaka peace talks are just a waste of time. What did Dr. Savimbi mean by that? [Valentim] Well, I would like to say that a correct interpretation of UNITA President Dr. Savimbi's thoughts will show that this was in response to a situation seen from within: there is ever growing tension in the country because of the movements of government forces. The UNITA president was just urging the international community to exert greater pressure to prevent warmongering (?moves) in the country. UNITA believes in the talks but, by the same token, the international community must not just fold its arms in the face of Angola's increasingly serious situation. [Dunem] Just to conclude, Dr. Valentim, I would like to cite another passage from that communique: quote, we, in UNITA, are not pacifists, unquote. What is that supposed to mean? [Valentim] That means that the government is attacking many UNITA positions. If UNITA is forced to defend itself so it can survive, then UNITA will not fold its arms. [end recording]
