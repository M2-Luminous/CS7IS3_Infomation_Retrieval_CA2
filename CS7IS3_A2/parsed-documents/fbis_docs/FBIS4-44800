Also, the company is finally offering a comprehensive gamut of products. Whether wishful thinking or well-founded optimism, Hans-Dieter Wiedig, head of the Siemens Nixdorf board of directors, claims to see light at the end of the tunnel. "In terms of our operating balance, we should reach the break-even point this year and show actual profits next year." Because of restructuring costs, new losses will be posted for the current year. But top-level SNI officials apparently hope to put all the red ink behind them by next year. Of course, they predicted a year ago, incorrectly, that the 1992 deficit would be cut in half in 1993. Today, however, the product line is at last complete, and SNI has begun acting and thinking like a company with an identity of its own, rather than just a juxtaposition of Siemens and Nixdorf. In the first 5 months of the fiscal year, turnover was down by 6 percent over last year at the same time, but volume of outstanding orders is 2 percent greater than at the end of the last fiscal year, and "profits have improved over the same period a year ago." Its PCs are increasingly successful, with orders up 87 percent from first quarter, over and above the 40-percent increase in number of units produced last year. SNI had already introduced new offerings at Cebit (see LMI No. 576 of 11 February). But some clients, departing from the mainstream, have shown interest in the RM200, a "RISC" [reduced instruction set computer] PC built around a 100-MHz R4600 processor (a variant of the R4400) but with original architecture. The bus is on a slave card, thus allowing for choice between ISA [Industry Standard Architecture] and EISA [Enhanced ISA] buses connected to two expansion connectors (one ISA and one ISA/VESA [Video Electronics Standards Association], or two EISA/VESA). This machine, designed and manufactured at Plaisir, in the Paris region, will be available in July. The price (excluding taxes) is in the same range as a well-configured Pentium, a high-end Power Mac, or an Alpha PC: about 40,000 French francs [Fr] for an ISA 16-500 version with 15-inch screen, and somewhere near Fr54,000 for an EISA 32-500 version. The first RM200 will be delivered with Sinix [SNI's version of Unix]. From a technical standpoint, the machine runs perfectly under Windows NT (indeed, SNI executives say it runs NT applications 70 percent faster than a Pentium 66), but SNI believes there is virtually no demand for NT on RM200-type machines designed to support client applications. SNI France has just announced the departure of Kurt Hollederer from his position as general manager in charge of operations. He is returning to Germany to oversee implementation and coordination of international consolidation plans and will be working directly under Robert Hoogstraten, a member of the board of directors.
