Oleksy said that democratic parliaments as the representatives of societies bring nations closer together via their contacts." He also invited diplomats to a Sejm debate devoted to Polish foreign policy, which will take place on May 12. Oleksy pointed out that the Polish "parliament, in its international activity, is an important part of the state's foreign policy and at the same time it implements this policy." Oleksy stressed that the processes of market and democratic reforms in Poland will be continued irrevocably and added that there is a political agreement on this matter. "Poland has chosen a decisive Euro-Atlantic course in which she sees its strategic security and interests," stated Oleksy and added that this, however, does not lead to the restriction of Poland's strivings for building good relations with extra-European countries." Dean of the diplomatc corps Papal Nuncio Archbishop Jozef Kowalczyk wished that parliamentarians adopt a constitution which would meet the expectations of the entire modern society ... and which would grow to be an inspiration for other generations and people, as the May 3rd contitution had once been."
