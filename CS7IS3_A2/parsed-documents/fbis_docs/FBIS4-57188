We have learned that you are one of the candidates for the office of president for the six-year term between 1994-2000. We believe you know what brought on the just struggle of the Zapatists and the 11 basic points we have presented as necessary for Mexicans in our country to once again be human beings: homes, land, work, bread, health, education, independence, liberty, democracy, justice, and peace. We wish to know what you think of the EZLN's demands and hear what you will do to comply with these demands should you be elected president of the republic. The EZLN will meet with any of the candidates for the Presidency who wish to meet with us. All we ask is that you publicly declare that you and your party are receiving nothing from us for this visit, that you have not paid us, in money or in specie, and that you will enter, remain, and leave our territory at your own risk. Should you accept this invitation, we ask that you reply through one of the members of your campaign group, stating date and place. For all. Liberty! Democracy! Justice! From the mountains in the southeastern sector of Mexico. Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Committee-EZLN General Command.
