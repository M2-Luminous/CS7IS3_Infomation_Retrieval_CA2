Upon his return to Aden, brother Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas delivered a statement to the Yemeni news agency, SABA, in which he said: The sigining of the accord document for building the Yemeni state represented a good and important step along the road for overpassing the political, economic, and social crisis which our country is living. We were looking during the signing of the accord document in the Jordanian capital, Amman, that this will reflect itself positively, particularly on the level of the military situation. But, contrary to this, we were appalled with regrettable incidents which Abyan Governorate witnessed and which took the lives of a number of the sons of our armed forces and which led to the raising of the level of tension to a level not precedented before. He added, saying: We denounce this action which we did not expect from the brothers following the signing of the accord document. We renew the emphasis for our absolute refusal to be dragged into such acts. In the same time, we have confidence in our people's capability of refusing and curbing these acts. We emphasize in this context that there is no way out of the situation for Yemen except through dialogue and the commitment towards this document.
