After touring the Kurdzhali region for four days, Ahmed Dogan declared that the DPS central leadership and its electorate share a common view concerning the cabinet's fate. The DPS supports a left-of-center model for the economy, if the social cost of the transition is determined. It will be difficult for the cabinet to fall, he said, and if any of the other parliamentary groups receive a mandate to form a cabinet, none of them will be able to form either a one-party or coalition government. Dogan said that the alternative of a caretaker cabinet is dangerous; according to him, such a cabinet could only operate for 2 to 6 months and would supplant the parliamentary form of government, delay the agreement on the foreign debt, and lead to hyperinflation.
