And it is adopting preferential policies for those service industries who take on the unemployed, said Vice Labour Minister Zhu Jiazhen. At a national labour and wage conference on Saturday, Zhu said the government would encourage the setting up of labour service companies that absorb idle workers. Set up by State-owned firms or private businesses, labour service companies will be exempted from taxes and given priority in obtaining bank loans and materials if 60 percent of their jobs are given to the jobless or those who have been temporarily laid-off. The urban unemployed are registered in cities and issued with certificates to help them seek re-employment. To give these labour-intensive businesses more autonomy, the ministry will experiment with a shareholding system, said Zhu. Previously, the decisionmaking powers of these labour service companies lay with the enterprises which set them up. The companies were thus prevented from using their own initiatives in their development. And in addition to their wages, the employees in the firms will be paid bonuses according to the profits earned by the company, the vice minister said. "One of the best ways to control unemployment is to give full play to the service industries irrespective of their ownership," said Zhu. Up till now, most labour service companies are run by State-owned enterprises. The Ministry of Labour hopes to hold the unemployment rate to 3 percent this year. Last year's 2.6 percent was up from 2.4 percent in 1992. Urban unemployment is expected to top 5 million this year. There were 4.1 million city dwellers out of work by the end of last year. During the first quarter of the year, inflation hit 20.1 percent, resulting in an increase in the level of unemployment in Chinese cities. This trend is worrying the government. Another reason for the growth in the numbers of jobless is that the current economic readjustment has forced unprofitable State-owned enterprises to cut staff levels to raise efficiency. Many State-owned firms are now in the red because of poor management, price hikes of production materials, and the new tax system which calculates more expenditures into costs. To reduce the unemployment rate, the Labour Ministry has initiated a training programme in the hope of putting more unemployed into new jobs. Instead of providing only financial relief to those out of work, the project aims to improve the quality of the workers with further training giving them more flexibility in their hunt for new jobs. The Labour Ministry is also trying to include the urban employment index in the overall state economic plan, said Wang Dongyan, in charge of planning and wages at the Labour Ministry.
