The first such units have already been developed and are "aloft," and the second generation is under development. That field is one of the fields in which Russian firms still have undisputed preeminence, which has enabled them to enter the American market with their advances and begin collaboration with American science centers and firms. The vice-president of the science center Kurchatov Institute, Academician Nikolay Ponomarev-Stepnoy, who just returned this week from the United States, told KOMMERSANT DAILY that President Clinton's administration continues to support that collaboration. Commenting here on the situation is KOMMERSANT DAILY reviewer Sergey Morgachev and expert Vladislav Golubev. Technology Of the two types of space nuclear power unit under study since the 1960s (see the sidebar at end of article), specialists (both Russian and U.S.) now prefer small nuclear reactors. Russian firms that have been on that road from the very beginning have, at this point, achieved a 10-year lead over their American competitors, who have been investing their money primarily in work involving radioisotope generators. Back in the times of the USSR, two groups of developers of space nuclear reactors came about in Russia, and they developed two models -- the Topaz and the Yenisey (which is now depicted in the external market as the Topaz-2). Those units are roughly equivalent in their main parameters, although they have certain design features that differ. There are no American or other foreign units like them. Topaz: designed by the state enterprise Krasnaya Zvezda (in Moscow); conceptual work and some tests performed by the Physics and Power Engineering Institute (in Obninsk). Yenisey: designed by the Central Design Bureau of Machine Building (in St. Petersburg); conceptual work and some tests performed by the Russian science center Kurchatov Institute. The NPO Luch (in Podolsk), which is involved in fuel cells, is participating in the work being done by both groups. It's natural that those two groups of companies are competitors --only the Topazes have gone aloft into space up to this point (in 1987 and 1988), as have the Krasnaya Zvezda units that preceded them. But the collaboration with the United States, which has already produced commercial results, has so far centered on the Yenisey. At the same time, there is also interaction between the two "teams." At present, studies of the new models of the nuclear units are being done jointly. Russian firms also enjoy a large advantage in work being done in the field of nuclear engines for space vehicles. That work, which was being done intensely in the USSR in the '60s and '70s, is continuing now, albeit on a much smaller scale. Low-thrust jet engines, which can be used for maneuvering vehicles in orbit, already exist in actuality in the form of experimental models. Russian organizations now involved (or once involved) in the field of nuclear engines for space vehicles: the science center Kurchatov Institute (Moscow), NPO Energiya (Kaliningrad), Scientific Research Institute of Thermal Processes (Moscow), the Design Bureau of Chemical Machine Building (Voronezh), the Physics and Power Engineering Institute (Obninsk), NPO Luch (Podolsk), the Scientific Research Design Institute of Power Engineering (Moscow). Some of the work has been done at the Semipalatinsk testing grounds (Combined expedition of NPO Luch, the Scientific Research Institute of Thermal Processes, and the Kurchatov Institute); at present, the status of the facilities at the testing grounds is the subject of talks between Russia and Kazakhstan. Commerce The good sense of a collaboration with the United States on nuclear power units and nuclear engines for space is evident. For the Russian firms, it represents the receipt of the first tens of millions of dollars and the prospect of larger contracts. For the American agencies, it represents an opportunity to cut spending on military and civilian space programs (the program under discussion now for the creation of a new nuclear reactor could cost nearly $1 billion; the program associated with a mission to Mars, $200 billion). For American firms, it represents an opportunity to reduce the costs of operations, which would enable them to "breach" their government funding. There's also interest on the part of potential commercial users of nuclear energy sources for space (the Motorola company). The U.S. administration, which is treating space programs with a good deal of reserve, has still not made a decision about the full-scale funding of the program for the nuclear power unit, and certainly not about the Mars program or the nuclear engines for it -- even though in NASA circles and American aerospace firms right now, people are trying to move the idea of a mission to Mars, which only recently was considered totally science fiction, to a practical plane. At the same time, however, a number of companies (such as Space Power, Rockwell International, General Atomic, Aeroget, General Electric, Westinghouse, Grumman, Thermo Electron, Rasor Associates, Teledyne, TRW, Martin Marietta, and POD Associates) are conducting research in both areas. Russian firms are being brought in on the work on nuclear power units through the firm International Energy Technologies (INERTEC). The INERTEC company was set up, on the Russian side, by the science center Kurchatov Institute (Moscow), the Central Design Bureau of Machine Building (St. Petersburg), NPO Luch (Podolsk), and the Scientific Research Institute of Thermal Processes (Moscow) and, on the U.S. side, by the International Scientific Products (ISP) firm. In turn, ISP was created by four American science centers (including the well-known Los Alamos Labs and Phillips). At present, several contracts exist between the Russian firms and ISP. In the context of one of them, two Yenisey (Topaz-2) reactors are at a laboratory center of Phillips, where ISP specialists are conducting stand tests of them. The units were delivered to the United States without a fuel charge, for temporary use and on the condition that the right of property belongs to the Russian firms, with no transfer to the United States of technology or right to open the units. According to that contract, the Russian firms received $13 million (funding was by the U.S. Department of Defense); under discussion is the delivery for temporary use of four more units, which could bring in an additional $20 million (the customer could be a different agency). In another contract, several series of tests are being conducted on a stand belonging to the Institute of Nuclear Reactors of the Kurchatov Institute center. The final point of that stage consists of flight tests of the Yenisey and several maneuvering engines -- including those developed by the Scientific Research Institute of Thermal Processes and the Kurchatov Institute -- on an experimental satellite that is to be launched some time in 1995-1996. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Launches of Space Vehicles With Nuclear Power-Supply Units | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Country |Number of launches |Year of last launch | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Radioisotope generators | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |USSR-Russia |4 |1969 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |U.S. |22 |1977 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Nuclear reactors | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |USSR-Russia |35 |1988 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |U.S. |1 |1965 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- If things get as far as the opening in the United States of a full-scale program on a nuclear power unit, the Russian contracting parties have some big opportunities to take part in that program, and the amount covered by the contracts could be on the order of as much as $100 million. At present, in yet another contract, Russian firms that are members of INERTEC are participating in preliminary studies of a reactor of higher power (see the table below).

[Sidebar] - Nuclear power-supply units for space vehicles are either radioisotope generators or small nuclear reactors. Work on them and other units began in the USSR and the United States in the '60s. The first such units had a very low limit of the power that was actually achievable (on the order of 5 kW), which is why at present the key direction being taken is the "reactor" direction. Units that produce 6 kW have already been developed, and research is under way to develop new units that produce as much as 100 kW. At 25 kW and above, reactor units have an advantage over all other energy sources in a key area -- ratio of power to mass, with a very large service life (the duration of operation). Nuclear reactors are especially effective for orbital vehicles with large energy requirements and for nonorbital flight. - Nuclear engines for space vehicles have been under development in Russia and the United States since the '60s, but the work was gradually cut back in connection with the successful development of chemical engines. Both in Russia and in the United States, there are experimental models of orbital maneuvering engines in which nuclear energy is converted into electrical energy for ionization, heat up, and acceleration of the working medium. The concepts of a nuclear "sustainer" engine with direct heat up of the working medium in the reactor or with conversion of the energy to electrical energy are being studied. It is felt that for use in interplanetary flight -- to Mars, for example -- engine power will have to be 10-100 MW.
