The conference, which was opened at the Muscat Intercontinental Hotel this morning, is attended by 42 states, in addition to the Sultanate of Oman, and three international organizations -- the United Nations, the European Union, and the World Bank. At the beginning of the four-day meeting, His Excellency Yusuf Bin-'Alawi Bin-'Abdallah delivered a speech in which he said: As the Sultanate of Oman today hosts the meeting of the water resources group within the multilateral talks of the Middle East peace conference, it strongly expresses its firm conviction of the importance of continuing the march of peace. His excellency added that the sultanate's support for the peace process in the Middle East is based on a longstanding conviction that resolving the Middle East problem and its crux, the Palestinian cause, can only be achieved through direct dialogue and serious talks among the involved parties. His excellency stressed that the convening of this meeting reflects the concern of the participant states in continuing their support and their valuable contribution to support the peace process. At the same time, he added, the meeting is an opportunity for the delegations to continue their constructive discussion, which they began in previous meetings, regarding water problems in the Middle East. His excellency the minister of state for foreign affairs said: The multilateral track of the peace process concentrates on the details. We, in the water group, however, aim at preserving the scarce sources of water resources and concentrate on the importance of developing and creating new techniques in the service of water. We must realize that the work done by the water resources group is one of the most important factors of cooperation among the Middle East countries for many essential reasons, the most important of which is the limited water resources in the region. Therefore, the plans for social and economic development require that all Middle Eastern countries agree on policies to manage water resources and distribution and to secure stable water supplies. His excellency said: In light of this, the Sultanate of Oman carried out a comprehensive survey to learn about the standards reached by water desalination research and technology in the world, which it was charged with by the committee during the Beijing meeting, to lay down options to reduce the financial burdens resulting from water desalination. His excellency said: The document, which will be presented to you and which was the production of this survey, represents a distinguished technical achievement by a group specialized experts and is the result of positive common work thanks to the valuable cooperation demonstrated by your countries. He added: On this occasion, we would like to express our heartfelt appreciation to those experts and to all those countries who contributed to the success of this study, which has come up with specific proposals and recommendations which will be detailed by the Omani delegation participating in this meeting. The minister of state for foreign affairs expressed hope that this effort will be a successful beginning for serious scientific research to develop water desalination technology so that it will be used in ways that will have positive effects on the economic development in the Middle East. His excellency noted that such an achievement will also largely contribute to curbing the danger of potential conflict over water resources. He added that this trend requires constructive collective cooperation, especially with advanced industrialized countries that have genuine experience in this regard. His excellency said: We have passed the stage in which we considered the mere holding of a meeting between us an achievement. We are aware of the fact that these very important multilateral meetings should be in harmony with what is achieved in the bilateral tracks of the peace talks by laying down sound foundations for tangible cooperation over mutual interests and common views regarding the issues of the region, which are the main topics of the multilateral talks. His Excellency Yusuf Bin-'Alawi Bin-'Abdallah stressed that participants from the region know full well that we have made a progress in this peace process and reached the threshold of a new stage that requires initiatives aimed at building bridges and achieving interconnection among the partners of peace. Therefore, the multilateral working groups and committees should work to reinforce their role and efficiency to support the bilateral track of the peace process and to continue to lay down practical plans and views that will achieve common benefits for all parties in an atmosphere of peace and stability.
