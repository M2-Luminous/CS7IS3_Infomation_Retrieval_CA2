These courts were mandated by the United Nations convention on drugs about six years ago. Barring West Bengal and Maharashtra--no other states had set up these courts. Recently, the Gujarat government under the late Chimanbhai Patel had openly opposed the idea of special courts at the meeting of the Western Zonal Council of which the Union home minister, Mr S.B. Chavan, is the chairman. This is despite the fact that Gujarat has the longest international border with Pakistan and also a long coastline. The centrally-sponsored scheme has been taken up following requests from many countries that cases of their nationals who are in Indian prisons due to drug-related cases be cleared as soon as possible, according to reliable sources. The delay in clearing these cases also creates human rights problems, the Union home ministry is believed to have noted. (Some countries under the European Economic Community are believed to have requested the Indian government that their nationals in Indian prisons be allowed treatment by private physicians to be selected by their embassies.) According to official sources, the maximum number of imprisoned foreigners are in Maharashtra where the number of pending drug-related cases is a staggering 15,564. The state had set up 17 special courts but only seven are in operation due to financial constraints. Meanwhile, drug traffickers, terrorists and other smugglers have started turning to the western region following the sealing of the Indo-Pak border in Rajasthan and Punjab and "stringent vigil on the Jammu front," according to home ministry sources. In fact, at the last Western Zonal Council meeting, Mr Chavan is believed to have told the then Gujarat chief minister, Mr Patel, that these elements had started turning to the border in Gujarat as the borders in Punjab and Rajasthan were being strictly sealed. "The number of pending cases did not give any idea of the magnitude of the problem... It was common knowledge that in Bombay and other cities these drugs are easily available in the markets, schools, colleges and hostels.... This matter should not be treated in a routine manner," Mr Chavan is learnt to have observed, adding that so far only the peddlers were being arrested but the big offenders were left scot-free.
