The parliament adopted this decision on Wednesday after a programme statement by the candidate to the post of prime minister. Masol, specifically, said he believes "Ukraine must continue developing as an independent democratic rule-of-law state. The strengthening of its sovereignity and preservation of territorial integrity should be common concern". Masol believes "Ukraine needs equal and friendly relations with countries of the CIS and above all with Russia in order to preserve its own independence". Masol holds that to overcome the crisis it is necessary to step up the pace of economic reform, transfer to market relations and ensure equality of all forms of property. The government should ease taxation on entrepreneurial structures engaged in production and processing of farm produce, in the construction industry and in communal services. Masol believes that support by credits, banking services on easy terms and ensurance against commercial risks should be offered to these areas. He said that the main purpose now is not to levy exorbitant taxes and drawing up an unrealistic basis but to ease taxation and envigorate the economy, enabling work collectives to work calmly and people to receive their earnings. Masol believes taxes should not exceed 17 percent of profits. He said there are two approaches to land privatisation. Land can be rented for the construction of various social facilities for 49 years, also to foreign investors, or else land can be offered for long-term use with the right of inheritance. Masol expressed the conviction that it takes the effort of all branches of power to solve all problems.
