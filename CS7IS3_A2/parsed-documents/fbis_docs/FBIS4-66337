This network provides instantaneous (0.5 s) synchronous transmission of stock and economic information from the SSE to over 1000 small satellite earth stations nationwide, many of them hundreds and thousands of km distant from the SSE. The network has also been successfully used for newspaper fax transmission: in only 20 minutes, the network system can provide errorless transmission of an 8-page issue of WEN HUI BAO to nine regional printing plants nationwide. This service has been in operation for 6 months without any errors. The satellite used to relay these services is located at an altitude of 36,000 km.
