FR940413-0-00043 FR940413-0-00012 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Coast Guard 33 CFR Part 150 [CGD 93&hyph;080] RIN 2115&hyph;AE69 Louisiana Offshore Oil Port: Expansion of Deepwater Port Safety Zone Boundaries AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is expanding the boundaries of the safety zone for the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP). A deepwater port safety zone constitutes an area within which the erection of structures of mobile drilling operations for the exploration for or extraction of oil or gas is prohibited. Expanding the safety zone will enlarge the approach to the terminal portion of the safety zone and provide more unobstructed maneuvering room for vessels arriving and departing from LOOP. This will reduce the risk of a marine casualty and consequent pollution. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 13, 1994. ADDRESSES: Unless otherwise indicated, documents referenced in this preamble are available for inspection or copying at the Office of the Executive Secretary, Marine Safety Council (G&hyph;LRA/3406), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street, SW., room 3406, Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001 between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The telephone number is (202) 267&hyph;1477. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lieutenant Jonathan Burton, Office of Marine Environmental Protection (G&hyph;MEP), (202) 267&hyph;0426. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Drafting Information The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Lieutenant Commander Walter (Bud) Hunt, Project Manager, and Jacqueline Sullivan, Project Counsel, Oil Pollution Act (OPA 90) Staff, (G&hyph;MS&hyph;1). Regulatory History On February 17, 1994, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) entitled ``Louisiana Offshore Oil Port: Expansion of Deepwater Port Safety Zone Boundaries'' in the Federal Register (59 FR 8096). The Coast Guard received eight letters commenting on the proposal. A public hearing was not requested, and one was not held. Background and Purpose The Deepwater Port Act of 1974 (33 U.S.C. 1501 et seq .) requires the Secretary of Transportation to designate a zone of appropriate size around and including any deepwater port for the purpose of navigational safety and to protect the marine environment. This responsibility was delegated to the Coast Guard in 49 CFR 1.46(s). A deepwater port safety zone is designed to promote safety of life and property, marine environmental protection, and navigational safety at any deepwater port and adjacent waters. No installations, structures, or uses that are incompatible with port operations are permitted in a deepwater port safety zone. 33 CFR part 150 establishes the geographic boundaries of the safety zone for the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP) in Annex A and provides for the modification of safety zone boundaries as experience is gained in deepwater port operations. The LOOP Safety Zone was first established on December 29, 1980 (45 FR 85644). On January 16, 1984, LOOP submitted to the Coast Guard a request for a waiver of the requirements of 33 CFR 150.337(a), which prohibits a tanker from entering or departing a safety zone by other than a designated safety fairway. LOOP submitted to the Coast Guard chart 11359 and indicated two uncharted areas adjacent to the safety zone which they referred to as excursion zones. LOOP requested that vessels calling at the deepwater port be provided with additional maneuvering room by allowing use of these excursion zones when departing or entering the LOOP safety zone. Deviations from the safety fairway into these zones came to be known as ``excursions.'' On February 20, 1987, the Coast Guard granted for 1 year a waiver of the requirements that tankers enter and leave the safety zone by the safety fairway. Since then, the Coast Guard has renewed the waiver on an annual basis.
