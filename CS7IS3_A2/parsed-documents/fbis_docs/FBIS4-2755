[Liu, seated and reading from a script] The current situation with regard to the protection of intellectual property rights in China is an issue in which many people in the international community are quite interested. We are holding this news conference today to brief you on the protection of the right to the exclusive use of trademarks registered by foreign companies in China, which constitutes one aspect of the protection of intellectual property rights. My colleagues and I are very happy to exchange our views with you correspondents on this issue. We hope that you will give full and extensive publicity internationally to the progress China has made in protecting intellectual property rights so that countries of the world will have a better understanding of intellectual property rights protection in China and dispel some people's misunderstandings. This will be conducive to the development of China's economic cooperation, trade, and friendly cooperative ties with foreign countries. The structure of China's intellectual property rights organs is different from that of other countries. Trademarks, patents, and copyrights are under the jurisdiction of, respectively, the State Administration of Industry and Commerce, the State Patent Office, and the State Copyright Administration. As the competent law-enforcement administrative department of the state in charge of trademarks, the State Administration of Industry and Commerce has the dual responsibility of trademark registration and administration. The SAIC protects, in accordance with the law, the right to the exclusive use of trademarks registered by domestic and foreign companies, and it has made universally acknowledged progress. In particular, its work in protecting the exclusive right to trademarks registered by foreign companies in China has won praise from international intellectual property rights protection quarters and from many foreign enterprises. As everybody knows, since China started implementing the policy of reform and opening up to the outside world, it has steadily amplified and improved laws concerning the protection of registered trademarks with a view to bringing them, step by step, into line with international practices. Today, we have by and large caught up with the international level. The Chinese Government has taken a firm position and has implemented effective measures in protecting the exclusive right of trademarks registered by foreign companies. In regard to protecting the right to the exclusive use of registered trademarks, the SAIC is unique in the world in that it is in charge of both the registration and protection of trademarks. This is an arrangement with distinctive Chinese characteristics. In recent years, many enterprises have applied for trademark registration in China. Seventy countries and regions had registered 59,466 trademarks in China as of the end of 1993; there have been sharp increases in the number of trademark registration applications year after year. In protecting foreign companies' right to the exclusive use of their trademarks, administrative departments for industry and commerce have devoted major efforts to investigations in the past few years and have uncovered many cases involving trademark violations. On behalf of the SAIC, I would like to express our appreciation to our friends in press circles at home and abroad for their support of our work. It is our sincere wish to increase exchanges with friends in press circles at home and abroad. We hope that you will give wider coverage to the protection of registered trademarks in China. We are happy to assist you in your coverage. [Announcer] Answering a question on what measures China has taken in protecting the right to the exclusive use of trademarks, Liu Minxue said: [Liu] I would like to answer this question in three parts. First, the amended trademark law increases the penalty for the infringement and counterfeiting of trademarks. In terms of a pecuniary penalty, the amended trademark law provides that a fine of not more than 50 percent of the illegal volume of business or not more than five times the illegal profit gained from the infringement can be imposed. In addition to that, supplementary provisions on punishing offenses concerning registered trademark violations adopted by the National People's Congress have increased the jail terms for offenses related to trademarks from three to seven years. Second, in addition to the party whose rights have been infringed upon, one can lodge a charge concerning the infringement with administrative departments for industry and commerce, and these departments can also directly investigate trademark violations on the market. There are over 600,000 personnel in administrative departments for industry and commerce across the country. We are entirely capable of doing a better job in this regard in the marketplace. Third, one of the distinctive characteristic of China's trademark administration is the double-track system, which places equal emphasis on administrative management and judicial management. In other words, in addition to administrative departments for industry and commerce which are empowered to directly investigate and punish trademark counterfeiting and other violations, China's judicial organs -- courts, that is -- can also accept trademark cases. [Announcer] Speaking of the importance attached to the implementation of the trademark law, Liu Minxue said: [Liu] As I just said, we investigate and uncover a large number of trademark violations every year, and we have so many personnel. These facts demonstrate the following two points: One is that China's legal system in regard to trademarks is being constantly improved. The situation is improving in that we have more and more rules to follow in dealing with all forms of trademark infringement and unethical competition in the marketplace. Because there are guidelines to follow on how to deal with violations, we have been able to uncover and handle more cases. The other thing is that we have placed greater emphasis on this work. As you can see, the state takes the crackdown -- the crackdown on the counterfeiting infringement in particular -- very seriously. We have also cracked down hard to protect the interests of businesses and especially consumers. Administrative departments for industry and commerce are implementing work in this area on a priority basis. Besides, we amended and improved the trademark law and formulated relevant measures with an eye on bringing them into line with international practices. [Announcer] Answering a question on what China will do to increase the people's awareness of trademarks, Liu Minxue said: [Liu] We would like very much to raise the overall awareness of trademarks among the people, especially among business managers and traders. We have done a great deal of work in this regard. For example, we launch at least a couple of large-scale publicity campaigns on the trademark law each year. As for enterprises, we run study classes and sponsor activities and meetings on [word indistinct] and trademark policy so that enterprises know how to use the trademark law to protect themselves. The awareness of trademarks is improving. [Announcer] Answering a question on whether China has special regulations on the protection of the right to the exclusive use of trademarks registered by foreign companies, Liu Minxue said: [Liu] China is a member of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property. We are firmly committed to the obligations provided in the Paris convention. There is an exception in procedure -- that is, when a foreigner or foreign enterprise applies for trademark registration or lodges a charge of infringement, it shall entrust it to a trademark agency designated by the SAIC or the trademark bureau [organization as heard] to act on its behalf in accordance with the provisions of the Chinese trademark law. [Announcer] Answering a question on how China will handle the scramble for famous trademark registration, Bai Dahua said: [Bai] We have a specific legal interpretation regarding the scramble for famous trademark registration. According to China's trademark law, whoever registers a trademark first owns the trademark. However, there is one exception regarding protection of famous trademarks. The second provision of the sixth article of the Paris Convention, which is designed to protect industrial property rights, stipulates that special measures should be taken to protect famous trademarks. This only applies to established, well-known trademarks. Only when another person or enterprise tries to register these famous trademarks can we call it a scramble for famous trademark registration. Generally, if this happens we will take measures to protect the famous trademarks in question according to the Paris Convention if the trademark owners present proof of registration issued by a competent administrative organ of the country where the trademarks were originally registered. In other words, we will deny the registration of trademarks requested by others. [Announcer] Answering a question about enterprises violating the trademark law or infringing on others' trademark rights, Bai Dahua responded: [Bai] In China, infringement of others' trademark rights is limited not just to Chinese enterprises infringing on other Chinese enterprises' trademark rights; some foreign enterprises have also infringed on Chinese enterprises' trademark rights. Of course, some Chinese enterprises have infringed on foreign enterprises' trademark rights. Liu explained this. According to the principle of (?fair) treatment stipulated in the Paris Convention, we handle such cases in a fair manner. Some infringements of trademark rights in China are attributable to foreign companies; there are many examples of this. Similarly, some countries have violated their own trademark laws to infringe upon the rights of Chinese trademarks registered in their countries. For instance, some countries have gone so far as to allow the use of the word China or Chinese as trademarks even though the trademark laws of the great majority of countries stipulate that the name, national flag, emblem, and flags and emblems of the armed forces of that country must not be used as trademarks. [Announcer] Answering a question on how China handles foreign-related trademark cases, Bai Dahua said: [Bai] Regarding the first part of the question, since the PRC Trademark Law was enforced, we have dealt with approximately 130,000 cases involving infringement of trademark rights and counterfeit trademarks. Of these cases, about 3,000 involved foreign companies. Regarding fines and compensation, they are two separate categories. According to the law, if an enterprise or individual has infringed on others' trademark rights, which is a violation of the law, a court or industry and commerce administration department is authorized to act on its own to impose an administrative fine on the enterprise or individual. But reasonable compensation can be given according to the law only if the owners of the trademarks in question submit a compensation demand. Legislation and enforcement of a country's trademark laws develop step by step. In other words, legislation of trademark laws will continue to be improved, and the degree of enforcement of trademark laws will increase daily. Therefore, if foreign enterprises or individuals voice dissatisfaction over the way China protects exclusive trademark rights, that is normal. This will help us improve our protection of exclusive trademark rights. Of course, there have been cases involving opposite situations; some enterprises have shown great satisfaction over the way in which Chinese administrative organs or judicial authorities protect their exclusive trademark rights. For instance, the cases which include the silk banner awards and photos provide in the booklets everyone of you has, are examples that some enterprises have expressed satisfaction over the way we protect exclusive trademark rights.
