After the talks broke down as a result of side issues that Britain created, Chris Patten brazenly submitted to the Hong Kong Legislative Council [Legco] his "political reform bill," which goes against the three principles [adherence to the Sino-British Joint Declaration, convergence with the Basic Law of the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), and the observance of the agreements and understanding reached by China and Britain]. According to the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, Britain's administration in Hong Kong will end on 30 June 1997, the political framework of the British Hong Kong Government will also terminate at that time, and the three-tiered frameworks created in the 1994-95 elections will also be dissolved. This is inevitable for China to reexercise its sovereignty over Hong Kong and bring the British rule there to an end, and it will be an important step that China will take to execute the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law and to carry out the "one country, two systems" principle. Hong Kong's three-tiered political structure made up by its district boards and two municipal councils as well as by the Legco is a major issue relevant to Hong Kong's smooth transition in 1997. According to the Sino-British Joint Declaration, during Hong Kong's latter transitional period, all measures taken to ensure its smooth transition in 1997 should be examined and discussed by China and Britain. However, refusing to consult China on this major issue, Britain incessantly schemed to "make transitional arrangements on its own" in an attempt to keep China out from participating in transitional affairs. This move itself has violated the Sino- British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. If Hong Kong's three- tiered framework should end on 30 June 1997, China cannot be totally uninvolved with the issue; but because there is the issue of the transition of members of the three-tiered council to the post-1997 period, China and Britain have held 17 rounds of talks on the 1994- 95 elections in Hong Kong. Now that Britain has undermined the talks and there is no through train to speak off, the three-tiered framework has to be overturned and rebuilt. This is to say that the three-tiered framework of the British Hong Kong Government will end on 30 June 1997, and the Chinese Government will rebuild the political framework of the HKSAR in accordance with the Basic Law and the relevant decisions of the National People's Congress on 1 July 1997. The British side has been hoping that by forming a group during the 1994-95 election, the new HKSAR Government in 1997 would have no other choice but to swallow the bitter fruit created by Britain so that people acceptable to Britain can continue to control the future HKSAR Government and Legco, and Britain's ruling power can continue in Hong Kong. Now they are infuriated, knowing that their wishful thinking is just an illusion. So they have counterattacked, claiming that "the Basic Law will be violated if the tenure of the three-tiered council members cannot straddle 1997," and that "China has expanded the kitchen" and "threatened members of the three-tiered council." But like the proverbial donkey in ancient Guizhou, it has exhausted its tricks. The outcome has gone against its wishes, the life of colonialism will soon end, and Britain will eventually gain nothing in this respect. When Britain's ruling power in Hong Kong terminates on 30 June 1997, all the political structures of the British Hong Kong Government there, including the Legco, the district boards, and the municipal councils, will have to wither away on their own on 1 July 1997. Britain will have no right whatsoever to meddle in our business and make unilateral arrangements for Hong Kong's political structure after 1997. The Basic Law has embodied the sovereignty which China will reexercise over Hong Kong, and when China does what has been prescribed in the Basic Law, it simply is not "expanding the kitchen" as certain people have clamored in saying. As for the claim that China has "threatened members of the three-tiered council," that is even more absurd. Even if China and Britain have reached an agreement through consultations, whether members of the Hong Kong Legco can go on to become Legco members of the HKSAR after 1997 will still have to be confirmed by the Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR. Because Britain has refused to cooperate with China and has acted on its own, it is totally justified that the three- tiered structure and the term of the council members must be discontinued after 1997. We must say that because the Basic Law embodies and codifies the "one country, two systems" principle into law, abolishing all laws which contravene the Basic Law and all organs created by these laws is an act which firmly safeguards the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law as well as the principles governing "one country, two systems," "the administration of Hong Kong by Hong Kong people," and the "high degree of autonomy." Any mudslinging, attack, rumormongering, or distortion cannot stop the Britain's colonial rule from collapsing and the political doom of the pro-British and anti-China elements. "One thousand sails are passing by the sunken ship, and 10,000 trees are sprouting in front of the sick wood." The day when China reexercises its sovereignty over Hong Kong will be the time when the principle of "one country, two systems" will be formally carried out. One important requirement is that we must make genuine efforts to safeguard China's national sovereignty and territorial integrity so that this principle can be implemented in Hong Kong. This is a responsibility that cannot be shirked by any Chinese countrymen. Acting as the masters of their own country, all Hong Kong citizens who are patriotic and who love Hong Kong will be concerned with Hong Kong's smooth transition, they will actively participate in all preparations for the transfer of political power in 1997, and, with a new spiritual outlook, they will also greet the day when China reexercises its sovereignty over Hong Kong.
