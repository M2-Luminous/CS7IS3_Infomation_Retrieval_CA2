Zakrzewski added that the president signed Borowski's resignation "in accordance with the procedures." "According to the president, what happened is the internal matter of the coalition and the government; the matter of observing the agreements and following the procedure of changes in the cabinet. The president has nothing to do with it, and he can only accept the changes, and this is what he did," Zakrzewski said.
