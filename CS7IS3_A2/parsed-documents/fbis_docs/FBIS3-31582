Today the Targu Jiu Court of Justice admitted the request forwarded to it by the aforementioned public corporation and declared illegal the strike held between 14-18 February [by the Lignitul Mining Trade Union Federation members] in the square of the Gorj County Prefect's Office. The court of justice established that its ruling may be appealed within 48 hours. Following that decision Mr. Nicolae Mihu, the chairman of the Lignitul Mining Trade Union Federation stated that he will appeal the sentence and that the strike will continue despite the fact that it is considered illegal. The halting of the strike depends on who will be the members of the government commission [to be sent to inquire about the causes of the strike] and the beginning of the investigations to find the irregularities at the brown coal public corporation. Within a few minutes a news conference is scheduled to begin at the Gorj County Prefect's Office headquarters, which is to be attended by Gorj County Prefect Gheorghe Caralicea-Marculescu and the representatives of the Targu Jiu Brown Coal Public Corporation. Our correspondent accredited to Victoria Palace [government headquarters] learned from sources at the Ministry of Industry that this morning four general directors of the aforementioned ministry left for Targu Jiu to examine, in the light of the written complaints sent to the ministry by the Lignitul Mining Trade Union Federation, the activity of the administration board of the brown coal public corporation . They will also discuss the issues raised by that trade union federation in connection with the collective labor contract.
