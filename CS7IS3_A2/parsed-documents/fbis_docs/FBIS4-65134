Mikhailidhis said any further delay in the circulation of the report endangers the credibility of the procedure. He noted that our side has no objection if others want to continue persuading the Turkish side to accept the UN document of 21 March. The foreign minister added: Our side, however, objects to interventions in the circulation of the report and actions that will question the image and the credibility of the procedure. The confidence-building measures issue acted as a catalyst to show foreigners that Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot side have no political will for any solution. Mikhailidhis stressed that Cyprus' closeness to Europe will continue despite threats by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas, who is obviously concerned that Cyprus' course toward Europe will proceed. The foreign minister said that by abandoning the confidence-building measures to discuss the substance of the Cyprus issue, we are essentially opening the door for Denktas to escape from the difficult position he is in. He added that if the UN secretary general's efforts fail, we will ask the Security Council to adopt alternative ways to implement the resolutions on Cyprus.
