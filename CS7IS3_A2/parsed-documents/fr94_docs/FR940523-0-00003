FR940523-0-00003 FR940523-0-00002 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Federal Grain Inspection Service 7 CFR Part 68 Regulations and Standards for Inspection and Certification of Certain Agricultural Commodities and Their Products AGENCY: Federal Grain Inspection Service, USDA. 1 1 The authority to exercise the functions of the Secretary of Agriculture contained in the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1621&hyph;1627), concerning inspection and standardization activities related to grain and similar commodities and products thereof has been delegated to the Administrator, Federal Grain Inspection Service (7 U.S.C. 75a; 7 CFR 68.5). ACTION. Confirmation of regulations. SUMMARY: The Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) has reviewed subpart A of the part 68 regulations under the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, as amended (Act). Pursuant to this review, FGIS has determined that no change will be made to these regulations. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: George Wollam, FGIS, USDA, room 0624 South Building, P.O. Box 96454, Washington, DC, 20090&hyph;6454; FAX (202) 720&hyph;4628; telephone (202) 720&hyph;0292. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: An advance notice of proposed rulemaking requesting public comment on subpart A of the part 68 regulations under the Act was published in the Federal Register on August 27, 1993, (58 FR 45295). FGIS solicited data, views, and arguments concerning the need for revising these regulations, the potential for improvement, and language clarity. FGIS also requested comments on several issues identified by interested parties. The objective of this review was to ensure that the regulations continue to serve the needs of the marketplace to the greatest extent possible. Within the 90-day comment period that ended on November 26, 1993, only one written comment was received. This comment, submitted by the Rice Millers' Association (RMA), asked FGIS to postpone proposing any rulemaking action that would ``allow requests for divided-lot certificates to be made for up to 1 year from the outstanding certificate date and, at the discretion of the Service, after the identity of the commodity has been lost'' pending further review of the potential impact of much action. FGIS appreciates RMA's concern and will study this issue further. No changes will be proposed at this time. Based on the information available, FGIS has determined that subpart A of the part 68 regulations under the Act are meeting the needs of the industry and no changes are necessary at this time. Authority: Secs. 202&hyph;208, 60 Stat. 1087, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1621 et seq. ). Dated: May 12, 1994. David R. Shipman, Acting Administrator.
