All these measures are well received by the vast numbers of peasants, and have also created opportunities for changing the current rural situation in which agricultural development is relatively lagging and rural reform confronts many difficulties. The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is an agricultural and stock-raising province. In line with instructions of the party Central Committee and the State Council, the party committee and government of the autonomous region have always regarded it as a guiding ideology for the rural work to care about the life of peasants, promote agriculture, improve conditions in rural areas, and consolidate the position of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy. In the wake of the national conference on rural work called by the central authorities last year, and in the light of both Ningxia's realistic conditions and the new situations and new changes that have cropped up in rural work, we have put into practice a series of measures to strengthen rural work and to deepen rural reform. They are chiefly the following: 1. The autonomous region has set up a leading group on rural work with a view to strengthening comprehensive coordination of rural work. 2. We have called a conference on rural work, at which an agricultural development plan featuring "one stress, three changes" was formulated. In other words, this plan aims, "by placing the stress on increasing the income of peasants, to change the traditional rural economy into a modern rural economy that is based on agriculture and guided by the secondary and tertiary industries, change the planned economic structure into a socialist market economic structure, and transform the old urban-rural relations and the dualistic structure under which urban and rural areas are divided and ruled into a new structure which tends to integrate urban with rural areas and narrow the gap between the two, thus accelerating economic development of rural areas." 3. We have paid close attention to implementation of measures on increasing both production and income. For instance, guided by the demands of the market and under the prerequisite of maintaining stable growth in grain production, we have exerted great efforts to develop easily marketed cash crops, such as wheat and side crops, and increased the capital input into agriculture, respectively attaining a growth of 13.1 and over 23 percent over the previous year in budgetary funds for aiding agriculture and in the total amount of agricultural loans newly granted by banks. Moreover, we have paid close attention to first-stage preparations for the Daliushu Water Conservancy and Hydroelectric Key Project on the Huang He, the Yanhuan Water Positioning and Pumping Project which has a great bearing on three provinces and regions of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia, diversion works which channel the water of the Huang He into the Hetao area, projects of comprehensive agricultural development in the Hetao area, and a number of other key agricultural projects, including those of aiding the poor and improving the environment of poor areas that are currently carried out in three counties on the loess plateau. 4. Regarding it as one of the assessment criteria of their work, we have urged all units, trades, and industries across the autonomous region to implement aforementioned aid-the-agriculture measures through various channels, such as providing rural areas with joint and unit-to-unit support on specific projects. 5. By reforming the work evaluation system, we have further clarified to prefectures, cities, and counties, as well as rural cadres, the targets and tasks of agriculture and rural economic development, and urged them to focus their work on increasing the income of peasants. All these measures have yielded remarkable results: We have successfully aroused the enthusiasm of the vast numbers of peasants, and helped them firmly establish the concept of stabilizing agriculture, developing the economy, and becoming rich by various means. In our opinion, however, the fundamental way to solve problems of a deeper level in rural areas is to further push forward economic structural reform in rural areas. The reason the agricultural development plan of "one stress, three changes" is considered the key to rural economic structural reform is that it keeps to the general orientation of changing the old economic structure into a socialist market economic structure and it represents the fundamental way for us to develop agriculture and transform the mode and structure of rural production. A comprehensive review of the process of rural reform in the past decade and longer has showed that although the contracted responsibility system with remuneration linked to output did immensely arouse the enthusiasm of peasants at the beginning of reform, thus laying a solid foundation for comprehensive progress, there has not been a fundamental change to both the traditional unitary mode of rural production and the socialized structure under which urban and rural areas are divided and ruled in different ways. What is more, with the deepening of reform, especially after the socialist market economic structure is established, traditional agriculture and the dualistic urban-rural structure have proved bigger obstacles to rural development. This is a problem prevailing across the country. For example, the residence registration and management system is a typical product of the dualistic urban-rural structure under the traditional planned economic structure. Facts have shown that by strictly restricting population flow between urban and rural areas, this system has not only tied peasants of the older generation to land, but also forced farmland that cannot be expanded indefinitely to bear more and more new rural laborers, resulting in waste of resources and declines in productivity. Such practice runs counter to the law of the market economy. In view of such a situation and in line with the relevant guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, we have vigorously conducted experiments with the residence registration and management system of small cities and townships, thus opening up a new path for freeing rural labor forces, which is warmly welcomed by peasants. As a matter of fact, Comrade Deng Xiaoping expounded the issue long ago: "Eighty percent of China's population are peasants. If the peasants lack enthusiasm in production, our country will have no hope of becoming stronger.... In my opinion, the only way for us to take now is to mobilize the enthusiasm of peasants, increase output of agricultural products by a large margin, and transfer rural productive forces in large numbers to newly built townships and towns and newly established medium and small enterprises. We cannot always tie peasants to their small pieces of land, for that practice promises no hope." It seems that we have no alternative but to admit that to help peasants become rich, we first have to reduce their numbers. If we say that the adoption of the contracted responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration linked to output is the first major change experienced by China's rural development, then it will prove a second major change to break with the dualistic urban-rural structure and to establish a modern agricultural production structure in line with the requirements of the socialist market economic structure.
