Under the resolution, the most important task of the State Duma is to ensure legislative support for the development of the Russian Federation in order to create an integral and stable democratic country with due respect for human rights, efficient economy, and which persistently realises principles of federal relations and ensures the rights of nations and nationalities. The government of the Russian Federation is entrusted to work out measures for overcoming the socio-economic crisis in the country. Lawmakers pointed out that the State Duma should continue its work to prevent further decline in Russia's industry and agriculture and create an efficient socially-oriented system of the industrial complex aimed at the constructive revival of the industrial and agricultural potential. In accordance with main provisions of the presidential message and sharing his concern over the situation in the country and stemming from lawmakers' commitments and electors' wishes, the State Duma intends to prepare and work out the most important laws aimed at taking the country out of crisis and stabilising its economy, carrying out the reform of budgetary, taxation, credit and financial system and protecting domestic manufacturers. Priority should be given to federal constitutional laws, federal laws in the sphere of franchise and civil rights, the right to work and housing, judicial reform and human rights. Proceeding from the fact that the insolvency crisis and overdue wages pose a special threat, fraught with serious social upheaval, the State Duma decided to turn to the president and the government with a proposal that this problem be resolved without delay and in the shortest possible time.
