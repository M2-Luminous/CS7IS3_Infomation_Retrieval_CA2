For this situation to explode, however, it was helped along by complicity which was all the more fearsome since it was "innocent." President Habyarimana's regime was nothing other than fascism. It had the same qualities: It concentrated on development just like Mussolini's draining the Pontine Marshes and Hitler's building freeways. It clearly had the same faults: A single-party dictatorship, a frenzied cult of personality, and nationalist exaltation, since it was understood that only Hutus are true Rwandans, because the Tutsis were supposed to have come from Egypt; and moreover, only Hutus from the north were real Hutus, since those from the south were too associated with Tutsi blood and culture. During those years, the Europeans, Belgians in particular, but also the French, could find nothing to complain about. Yet, the missionaries, volunteer workers, and politicians had either experienced World War II, or else learned at school that fascism and systematic exclusion led straight to the "catastrophe" that was the Jews' Holocaust. They know this so well that none of them today would dare describe Jews as being miserly, dirty people with hooked noses, which was the typical caricature before the war. Nevertheless, we often heard our compatriots, not all of them (!), involved in Rwanda blandly explain that "the Tutsis are intelligent and treacherous while the Hutus are dolts but nice," meaning that it made sense for the former, who were dangerous, to be subjected to discrimination, so that the latter, semi-innocent group could flourish. The truth is that you come across imbeciles in power when they find themselves in power for no other reason than their ethnic, regional, or political origin, whether we are talking about the Tutsis in yesterday's Burundi, or Hutus in Rwanda. Not only do they not need to be competent to take power but if they are intelligent, are they not being "ridiculous" if they study, since their future is guaranteed. The majority of our missionaries, our many volunteer workers, and our politicians has long turned a blind eye to Rwandan fascism, thus adopting a "respectable" racism and preferring to believe that General Habyarimana ran "the Switzerland of Africa." In the fall of 1993, the extremist Hutu radio station, Radio Mille Collines, began broadcasting. They teach us at schools that fascism plus radio equals a dangerously explosive cocktail. However, the gentleness of the Rwandan hills must blur school memories. We had to wait until December 1993 and the arrival of the first Belgian blue helmets, who were immediately targeted by Hutu extremists because they had come to help enforce the Arusha peace agreements, before many Europeans opened their eyes and realized that the anti-Tutsi and antiopposition campaign was no more tolerable than the anti-Belgian campaigns of the extremists. Too late.
