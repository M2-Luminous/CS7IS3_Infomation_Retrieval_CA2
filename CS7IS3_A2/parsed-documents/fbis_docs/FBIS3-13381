But they denied a local radio report that a grenade exploded overnight Sunday 200 meters (yards) from the British embassy in the residential hills of Rabiyah, overlooking Beirut. A spokesman for the embassy refused to comment on the report. The dawn attack targetted the Shahbaz restaurant in Burj Hammud, a popular neighborhood in Beirut's Christian northern suburbs. Police said the grenade caused slight damage but that the restaurant was empty at the time. It was not immediately clear if the attack was politically motivated or the result of a personal dispute. A series of bombings in recent weeks has heightened fears of a resumption of terror attacks in Lebanon, where Pope John Paul II is due to visit in May. Lebanon's Christian community feels it is the target of these attacks, which the government said were aimed at destabilising security in Lebanon. The Lebanese army has stepped up patrols and security checks around churches, mosques and schools after a bomb ripped through a church during Sunday mass on February 27, killing nine people and wounding 55 others. Last week a six-kilogram (13-pound) gift-wrapped bomb was defused on the doorstep of the French cultural center in the port city of Juniyah, in Lebanon's Christian heartland.
