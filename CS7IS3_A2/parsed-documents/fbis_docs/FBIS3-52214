At the talks, the Pakistani delegation will be led by the foreign secretary, Dr. Shaharyar M. Khan. The Indian side will be led by its foreign secretary, J.N. Dixit. The Indian foreign secretary arrived in Islamabad last night with a four-member delegation to participate in the talks. Speaking to newsmen at the airport, Mr. Dixit said Kashmir is an outstanding issue between Pakistan and India and both sides will seriously discuss it in view of its significance. Replying to queries of newsmen, he said there might be differences in the perceptions of the two countries. They, however, will make efforts to understand each other's points of view and to narrow down differences on the Kashmir issue. Asked whether there will be a discussion on the issue of holding a plebiscite in Kashmir, Dixit said both sides can raise questions according to their stand on the issue. When he was asked whether both sides will exchange views on resolving the Kashmir issue along the lines of autonomy granted to the Palestinians in the Gaza territory, the Indian foreign secretary said it depends upon the nations concerned. If they learn lessons and experiences from history, it will be better for them. Mr. Dixit refused to say whether he has brought a new proposal for the seventh round of talks. He said there is no program to involve Kashmiri representatives at the current round of talks. Foreign Secretary Shaharyar M. Khan, who will lead the Pakistani delegation, said Pakistan is glad that India agreed to hold talks on all aspects of the Kashmir issue. He said both sides will consider the issue with seriousness. He expressed the hope that there would be progress at the talks between the two sides. Radio Pakistan's diplomatic representative says Pakistan and India expressed their readiness to resume secretary-level talks to discuss all outstanding issues, including all aspects of the Kashmir issue, last November. The previous round of talks was held in New Delhi in August 1992. Pakistan is expected to urge India to honor the aspirations of the Kashmiri people and pave the way for a plebiscite in the area to find out their opinion in accordance with the UN Security Council. It is expected that Dixit will also call on President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari and Foreign Minister Asif Ahmad Ali.
