This is the question that I would like to ask to all demonstrators." He added, "Should we tolerate that 750,000 young people are unemployed, or should we do something about it?" He insisted that "we have to solve this problem, and we will solve it," adding "the question is not so much whether we stick to the CIP; the question is: what is the formula to give jobs to youngsters." Nicolas Sarkozy continued: "We suggest this formula; nobody is suggesting another one. If it produces results, if it reduces youth unemployment, we will have done something useful for France." According to the minister, "all traditional measures have failed." And he asked: "Why do you want us to stop this experiment for electoral reasons? And what if the French think it better to experiment than to fail?"
