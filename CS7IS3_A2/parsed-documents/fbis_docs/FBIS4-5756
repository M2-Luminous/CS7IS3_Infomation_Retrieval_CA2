FBIS4-5756 "dreas071_d_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-071 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 South Korea IAEA Chief Cited on Need To Inspect DPRK IAEA Chief Cited on Need To Inspect DPRK SK1304085894 Seoul KBS-1 Radio Network in Korean 0800 GMT 13 Apr 94 SK1304085894 Seoul KBS-1 Radio Network Korean BFN [From YONHAP, in Tokyo] [Text] Hans Blix, International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] director-general, stressed that an additional inspection of the radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon, which North Korea has been refusing, is urgent and that IAEA inspectors should be present at the experimental reactor that has an output of 5,000 kw when its fuel is replaced. Director-general Blix, now visiting Japan, held a news conference on 13 April and said that as the inspection of the radiochemical laboratory, which is believed to be a facility for extraction of plutonium, was not carried out, it cannot be determined if this facility has been used since February 1993. He pointed out that it will become a very serious problem if this situation continues for a long time. Director-general Blix revealed that the project for building a second production line in the radiochemical laboratory is presently under way, and that this project will be completed before long. Director-general Blix stressed that North Korea claimed that the fuel was loaded in the experimental reactor for the first time and that plutonium was not extracted from the fuel used in this reactor. An on-the-spot investigation of the reactor by the inspectors is necessary to verify this claim. Director-general Blix pointed out that in the event that North Korea continues refusing comprehensive inspection of its nuclear facilities, there is the possibility that the IAEA will demand that the UN Security Council take stronger steps and measures.
