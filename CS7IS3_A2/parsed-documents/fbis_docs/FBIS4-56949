National Renewal President Andres Allamand accused him of being "ambiguous" and "lacking coherence" in a harsh speech to mark the seventh anniversary of the party, which is considered the most moderate of the Chilean right. Allamand also criticized Interior Minister German Correa. Allamand said the current administration, which was inaugurated on 11 March, is "dragging its feet." He said it lacks coherence, as reflected in the change of priorities of the announced policies in which institutional reforms have overtaken social reforms. He said the government has not sent Congress any legal initiatives for solving the problems of poverty, education, and health. He called on Frei to take "clear and personal" command. He added that those "in charge" are the leaders of the political parties of the government coalition which comprises the Christian Democrats, the Socialists, and the Social Democrats. Allamand said the call asking the opposition to play a role is incoherent, because the interior minister [German Correa] made "unfortunate comments," saying that the charges of corruption by the opposition stain the Chilean image abroad. In a harsh attack on Correa, who has become the target of the criticism of the right, Allamand recalled that the majority of Correa's Socialist friends in Spain are either "detained, at large, or writing their resignations." He added that attitudes like that of Minister Correa in Chile open "the doors to generalized corruption" -- just like in Spain. Allamand called on his party to free itself from the past and to preserve the unity of the "Union for Chile" rightist alliance, which also includes the Independent Democratic Union and the Center-Center Union. Allamand offered his party's help to the government in solving the problems of poverty, health, and education but discarded any support for moves that seek "to destroy the basis of the institutions." The government is studying a package of bills that it will send to Congress that seek to eliminate from the Constitution -- which was approved by the military regime of General Augusto Pinochet -- what has been called "the authoritarian remnants of the system." These remnants include a clause that prevent the commanders of the Armed Forces from being removed, a clause that appoints senators without elections, and a clause to perpetuate the proportional representation electoral system.
