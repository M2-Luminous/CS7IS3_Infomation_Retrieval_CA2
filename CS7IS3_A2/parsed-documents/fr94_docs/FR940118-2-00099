FR940118-2-00099 FR940118-2-00060 The Commission has carefully reviewed the Amex's proposed rule changes and concludes that the proposed changes are consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, with sections 6(b)(5), 6(b)(8), 11(b), and 11A(a)(1) of the Act. 8 The Commission supports the Amex's efforts to continue to review the form and substance of market trading regulation in response to changes in market structure. The Commission believes that it is important to market quality that the Exchange have a regulatory program that is tailored to the current market structure. The Commission believes that the proposed rule changes will be helpful in updating the Amex market structure and trading rules and will further the purposes of the Act. 9 The Commission's detailed discussion regarding the significant changes proposed by the Amex follows. 8 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5), 78f(b)(8), 78k(b), and 78k&hyph;1(a)(1) (1988). 9 The texts of the actual Exchange rules to be amended and complete descriptions of the proposed amendments are set forth in the Exchange's original filing and in Amendments No. 1, 2 and 3 thereto, all of which are available for inspection at the Commission and at the principal office of the NYSE. The Amex proposes to amend several rules so that they correctly identify exchange procedures or facilities. The Commission believes that these rule changes are appropriate and logical revisions to the Amex Rules. 10 10 The Exchange proposes the following such changes: Rule 2_Visitors: Currently, this rule refers to the admission of visitors to the ``Gallery'' and the ``Trading Floor.'' The Commission agrees that since the ``Gallery'' has been non-existent for many years, reference to it should be deleted. Rules 6 and 550_Execution of Bonds on Exchange and Secondary Distributions: Currently, these rules refer to the ``Rulings and Inquiries Department'' as the department at the Amex to be contacted relative to those rules. Such department no longer exists (``Rulings'' and ``Inquiries'' are separate departments). The Commission therefore agrees that the reference should be changed to the ``Rulings Department.'' Rule 7_Short Sales: Commentary .01 is a reprint of Exchange Act Rule 10a&hyph;1. The Exchange states that the reprint is an outdated version of the Commission rule and should be revised. Amendment No. 3 proposed minor language changes to conform the reprint of Exchange Act Rule 10a&hyph;1, which is contained in Commentary .01 of the rule, to its official format. The Commission believes that the proposed amendment makes appropriate conforming changes and should therefore be approved. Rule 22_Authority of Floor Officials: This rule contains a cross reference which lists seventeen rules upon which Floor Officials may rule. Currently, however, there are at least three other rules relating to the duties and powers of floor officials which are not included in the list, and with future rule revisions, additional rules will provide for Floor Official involvement. Rather than attempt to provide an all-inclusive list, the Amex proposes that the cross reference in Rule 22 be deleted. The Commission believes that the proposed changes are appropriate and should therefore be approved. Rule 134_Cash and Seller's Option Transactions: This rule requires Floor Official oversight for two transactions that are not ``regular way''_``cash'' and ``seller's option'' transactions. Although ``next day'' transactions are also not ``regular way'' transactions, they are not included in the rule. The Exchange states that this appears to have been an oversight at the time Rule 124 was revised to permit ``any additional settlement periods as the Exchange may from time to time determine.'' Therefore, the Commission agrees that ``next day'' transactions should be referred to in Rule 134. Rule 178_Responsibility of Specialist: This rule establishes the liability for losses in those situations where a member firm has not received a report from the specialist on an order that was executed or should have been executed. The Exchange states that time-frames cited in the current rule are no longer appropriate in view of the time limits set forth in Rule 719 regarding ``Next Day Comparison of Exchange Transactions.'' The Commission agrees that Rule 178 should therefore be revised to conform its time limits to Rule 719. Rule 179_Orders in Rights: Because this rule also applies to warrants, the title of this rule should be redesignated as ``Orders in Rights and Warrants.'' The Commission agrees that this change is appropriate. Rules 419 and 420_Statements of Accounts and Mailing Statements: Commentaries to both rules refer to ``Membership Compliance Division.'' The Exchange states that the correct title of that division is ``Compliance and Surveillance Division'' and the commentaries to both rules should be revised to reflect that title. The Commission agrees that these changes are appropriate. Rule 560 (i)_Special Offerings and Special Bids: Paragraph (i) incorporates the provisions of former Article VI, which governed floor brokerage commissions, into Rule 560. The Exchange states that Paragraph (i), however, should be deleted since Article VI, to which it relates, was rescinded in 1976. The Commission agrees that this change is appropriate.
