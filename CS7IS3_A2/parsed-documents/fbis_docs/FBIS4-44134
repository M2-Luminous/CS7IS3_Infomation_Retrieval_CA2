What is the latest situation? [Sanberk] We went there to bring closer together the basis of the UN Security Council resolutions and the common ground established during our previous visit to Baghdad. This time, the Iraqi officials, mainly Tariq 'Aziz, moved closer toward certain points of the general framework drawn up by the United Nations. In other words, we were able to bring the issue inside that framework as much as possible. There were two main problems: One was the need to make a contribution to the UN compensation fund; the second was the trust fund. This time, the Iraqi officials declared that they agree to contribute to both funds. In this way, two important difficulties were overcome. Preparations will now be made in New York for a draft resolution. [Yilmaz] Can you tell us when the pipeline will be flushed? [Sanberk] It would be wrong to give a date, because it may not happen on that date. We believe it will happen within a short period of time, because the major difficulties have been overcome. Do not forget that all the difficulties, however, have not been overcome yet. It may take one month; it may take more. It is impossible to say at this time.
