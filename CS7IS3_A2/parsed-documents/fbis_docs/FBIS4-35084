The agreements, published in the Federation's official gazette, state that the resolutions signed by the foreign and finance secretaries will be implemented beginning tomorrow. The first document states that the measure is in accordance with 1993 UN Resolution No. 864, which applies sanctions against the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA. The international organization's resolution bans the sale and supply of weapons, material, oil, oil derivatives, vehicles, or military equipment to UNITA, whether these products are produced in the country or abroad. The agreement also states that the ports of Luanda, Lobito, and Namibe and the Luanda, Katumbela, Malongo, and Cabinda airports are exempted. The second agreement also published in the official gazette states that Mexico will abide by the 1993 UN Resolution No. 883, which bans the supply of oil refining and oil transportation equipment to Libya. On 11 November 1993, the UN Security Council also decided to freeze all of Libya's financial assets abroad, including investments, deeds, and dividends. In that same document, the international forum agreed to leave out funds derived from oil, natural gas, or basic farming products that were exported after the resolution entered into effect. It was expected that if by 1 December 1993 Libya did not turn over to the United States or Great Britain the people suspected of placing a bomb in an airplane, which killed 270 persons, the airline's worldwide offices would be closed.
