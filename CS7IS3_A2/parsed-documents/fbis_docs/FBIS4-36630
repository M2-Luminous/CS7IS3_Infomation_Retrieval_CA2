What role are you playing? [Al-Tufayli] As a citizen of this country, I have a right to express my opinion. I like our clear rights to be respected. Acting on this premise, I don't believe in imposed regimes. The al-Ta'if Accord is a formula for a regime on which the Lebanese people were not consulted. Therefore, I reject this regime. Accordingly, anything that stems from this regime is illegitimate because the Lebanese people have not decided on it. Therefore, I am an opponent of the regime. Furthermore, I don't believe anyone has the right to reconcile with the Zionist entity, which is an oppressor and usurper. The Lebanese regime is wrong in trying to reconcile with the Zionist enemy. [passage omitted] [AL-DIYAR] What are your specific differences with the Lebanese regime? [Al-Tufayli] I oppose the regime's many executive and procedural actions. I cannot accept a regime that does not stem from the will of the Lebanese or a majority of them. A referendum must be held on any formula proposed to the people. If the people accept this formula, then they will be responsible for their decision. The Chamber of Deputies--which was appointed or elected--was elected on the basis of a formula which the people did not approve. The formula determined the Chamber, the Chamber did not devise the formula. A formula which is not presented to the people is not respected, and must not be respected by anyone. [AL-DIYAR] Does this mean you are not pleased with the Chamber of Deputies? [Al-Tufayli] The nature of Lebanese officials is essentially bad. This is very regrettable. I am not revealing something new. The officials in Lebanon, regardless of their positions, do not care about the Lebanese people's interests and views. All Lebanese officials are interested in is pleasing the party in power. For example, in the past the French had the power and Lebanese officials were anxious to know whether the French were pleased with them. Today the same thing is happening with the Syrian brothers. If the Syrians are pleased, there is no problem even if the Lebanese people curse these officials. This is not the work of honest officials. These officials are irresponsible. Hypocrisy is the hallmark of past and current Lebanese officials. With such a mentality, we cannot say the people govern in Lebanon. The people do not govern at all. From a reading of the situation, we emerge with the conclusion that the majority of the people are not pleased with the formula or with the officials. If some of them are pleased, it is for personal reasons or out of fear. [passage omitted] [AL-DIYAR] You have spoken about the Syrian role. What about the Iranian role in Lebanon? [Al-Tufayli] The Iranian role is not political. Regardless of their abilities or inabilities, the Iranians have not interfered in political affairs. The Iranians have two roles. The first role is to support the resistance, transfer military expertise to it, and back it financially so it can buy weapons and other things. The second role is in helping the people dig water wells and rebuild destroyed houses, assisting the poor, and other social activities. That is all what they have been doing. [AL-DIYAR] But they have interfered on some issues? [Al-Tufayli] I don't believe the Syrians consult the Iranians. The decision is ultimately a Syrian one. The work the Syrians are doing in Lebanon is Syria's responsibility even if others consult it. [AL-DIYAR] How are your relations with the Syrians and Iranians? [Al-Tufayli] Good; there are no problems. [AL-DIYAR] Are there contacts? [Al-Tufayli] Contacts are held according to need. I am usually frank with the Syrians and Iranians. They know this. Therefore, the relations are stable and there are no problems. [AL-DIYAR] How are your relations with Hizballah and what are the points of disagreement with it? [Al-Tufayli] In fact, there were two viewpoints regarding the [parliamentary] elections. I don't like to participate in activities I don't believe in. Since I did not believe in the formula adopted for the elections, I told my brothers: I will not join in this political venture. However, I am at your service in other matters. [passage omitted] [AL-DIYAR] What information does al-Hajj al-Dirani have on pilot Ron Arad? [Al-Tufayli] In my capacity as a former Hizballah secretary general, I know details about Hizballah. Therefore, I can say that Ron Arad is not being held by Hizballah or the Iranians. The proof is that at some point in the past Hizballah and the Iranians carried out a serious search for Arad. This means he is not being held by them. [AL-DIYAR] Can we identify the party that might be holding Arad? [Al-Tufayli] Some people say the Syrians are holding him. However, the Syrians have not only denied this, they have also carried out a search for him. Therefore, it is probable that Arad died or was killed. Arad disappeared about the time of the aggression against Maydun. For example, some of his guards might have reacted and killed him in a moment of anger. There is no proof of this; I am just trying to explain the riddle. If he had returned to Palestine, they would have announced this. No one in Palestine has claimed that he is alive or dead. There is no reason for anyone to hide him. Therefore, there is a high probability that he died or was killed. [passage omitted]
