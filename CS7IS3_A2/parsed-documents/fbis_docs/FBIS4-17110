Who Is Keen To See Russian-Ukrainian Relations Balkanized"] [Text] Following the meeting of CIS heads of state 15 April, the presidents of Russia and Ukraine were able yet again and for the umpteenth time to reach agreement on settling the conflict over the Black Sea Fleet. Leonid Kravchuk informed journalists that it had been decided to divide the fleet up in the ratio 15:85 in Russia's favor. However, on 16 April it became clear that this agreement would be very hard to implement. As Ukrainian Defense Minister General Radetskyy explained to the mass media in Moscow, the correct formula was not the one approved by the countries' two presidents but a quite different one indeed: The fleet is to be divided in the ratio 50:50. Of the 50 percent allocated to Russia, 15 percent is to remain Ukrainian property which Ukraine is subsequently prepared to sell to Russia. The defense minister also explained Leonid Kravchuk's remark about Russia's henceforth getting the chance to use Sevastopol as a naval base, but on a lease basis. During his talks with Pavel Grachev, Radetskyy proposed basing the Russian part of the Black Sea Fleet at two other naval bases in Crimea rather than Sevastopol. Such a radical rereading of this heated issue raises doubt about whether the fleet will finally be divided up in the next 10 days as Leonid Kravchuk has promised and whether the problem will then cease to be a bone of contention between Russia and Ukraine. Some people and some forces in Ukraine are evidently very keen not only to see the Black Sea Fleet issue remain on the agenda of relations between our two countries, but also to see these relations permanently deteriorate if need be. In fact, on at least four occasions already (at Yalta, Mukhalatka, Massandra, and Zavidovo) the two countries' presidents have reached a final agreement on resolving the problem of the Black Sea Fleet. And every single time people and forces in the Ukrainian Supreme Council, Ministry of Defense, and state and political structures have started to whip up the problem of Ukraine's national independence, and using this obfuscation they conceal the agreements that have been reached or reject them out of hand, not even balking at the prospect of placing general relations between our two countries on the brink of military conflict. All the indications are that for some time now these forces have ascribed no importance whatsoever to their president's signature on agreements which would lead to an improvement in relations between the two largest Slav states. And these forces, apparently, have nothing except their desire for power. But in order to keep themselves afloat, they are extolling the notorious bugbear of nationalism. And this argument still works. There are people who are still prepared to believe that all Ukraine's misfortunes can be blamed on their northern neighbor. And people whose own interests are extremely far removed from Ukraine's genuine interests are shamelessly striving to reap political dividends on the basis of this enduring faith. Unfortunately, there is still a possibility that Russian-Ukrainian relations will become Balkanized. Therefore we can only see one way of ensuring that relations between our two fraternal states do not turn into extreme forms of confrontation, namely restraint and a calm reaction to the outbursts of the nationalists, who have donned the garb of defenders of genuine Ukrainian national interests. On a historical scale, time is on the side of the restoration of close economic, cultural, and political ties between our peoples.
