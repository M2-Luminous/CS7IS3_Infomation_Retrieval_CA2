Dear compatriots. Guests present in this hall. Frankly speaking, I was not preparing any throne speech for today. What I want is just to share my thoughts and contemplations following this thing that has just occurred, after you have entrusted me to lead the top power body in Ukraine, the top legislative body. The feelings that I now am filled with, if formulated in one word, can be expressed by the word responsibility -- a burden of huge responsibility for what I am supposed to do in order to make the work of the Supreme Council productive and to the benefit the working people, the overwhelming majority of the population of Ukraine. At the same time I understand that this is your responsibility as well, because having cast your votes in my favor you put your trust not only in me, but you also put your trust in the fact that your hopes would come true, as far as the organization of work is concerned, as far as defending those principles which let you receive the people's deputy mandates are concerned. Nevertheless, I hope that we shall manage to demonstrate in the Supreme Council building a possibility of society's consolidation and accord for the sake of overcoming that extremely difficult situation our state finds itself in today. Being aware of the fact that different methods and different arguments are used during the debate and having taken part in these debates for four years now, I understand that not all the arguments could be agreed to. And I saw where they were substantiated and where they were not quite substantiated. For example, I have long shown sincere respect for my colleague Mykhaylo Kosiv. I know that he referred to Taras Hryhorovych [Shevchenko -- 19th century Ukrainian poet] because, as a matter of fact, he had nothing else to refer to, because I know that he loves Shevchenko, but there is no monopoly for this love. I believe that everyone has the right to this love. I also love Shevchenko, the same way as he does, and I know that nonetheless, I quoted literally what Taras Hryhorovych was saying. If anyone has doubts, open Holodnyy Yar [Cold Ravine] in the Kobzar. If necessary, I can further quote what is written there but it is not this that matters. Nevertheless, I want us to step over something which can disunite us. Because we are different, this is true. We are different people of different convictions. The only thing which unites us is Ukraine. Before the voting and earlier, and afterwards as well, people were coming up to me and asking: What kind of state will it be? What shall we build? I referred those who never read, for example, some political declarations by different political forces, including the one which supported me during the election The first thesis of principle written there is Ukraine's independence and the building of the Ukrainian state. I understand that the building of the Ukrainian state should not apply pressure on the needs and interests of either a separate individual or a working collective. People should feel free in a free state. This should be backed up by both a strong legal basis and an economic basis; both social and cultural issues should be solved. All this can be done if we show in real terms that we can work together, that there is unity in our lofty collective. And I hope that we shall come to agreement despite the contradictions which do exist, which is only natural. Because such is society and this is natural for any society. I believe that without wasting much time on the formation of the Supreme Council structures, we must immediately get down to the formation of the government. And I would like to share my thoughts with you in this connection. We should not wait for the re-election of the president or even the entire procedure. People are waiting for specific actions today. And I am convinced that if we fail to find a candidate for premier who would be supported by the Supreme Council, I am convinced that the Supreme Council will support one in several months time, when the election takes place, if it does. Because, true, the executive structure should be formed today to be at the top of the entire executive branch, because there is no other way out today. Besides, we should coordinate certain norms of the already existing law and work out new ones so that we could link all the executive power in the state, so that both at the village council and at the Supreme Council we could feel that a single mechanism is working and that it is working for the lofty goal of building a (?united) state capable of defending itself and its interests in the world community. And undoubtedly when I am speaking about consolidation of the Supreme Council deputies I understand that there should be consolidation of the top power structures in the state as well. There can be different approaches, but different approaches have value when they are truly reasonable and when they lead to consolidating society and achieving those interests which will today satisfy the needs of a specific individual -- a citizen of Ukraine -- in real terms. And in connection with this, it seems to me that there is a possibility today to bring together the people in the authority structures -- in the president's team, in the government which we shall form, and in the Supreme Council -- and, despite everything, to work in one direction, so that there would be no contradictions which do not benefit society and the state whatsoever. I believe that even yesterday's speeches by the contenders and their discussion testify to the fact that our Supreme Council has sufficient potential. We shall increase it later on, when those deputies which the Supreme Council is evidently lacking -- and we feel this -- are elected at by-elections. We do need a stable Supreme Council which would conduct its course regardless of the upheavals which may occur in society. And I believe that we can work out programs toward that end which would ensure Ukraine's breakthrough in the implementation of those priorities which we feel we have today. Yesterday and today they were correct to mention these priorities as far as the economy is concerned -- the development of the agroindustrial complex and the solution to the power engineering problems. But above all -- I again refer to this issue -- probably the very sense of the work by the Supreme Council chairman is, as I see it, first and foremost, accord, consolidation, patience, tolerance, and the belief that we shall build a better life. But we shall build it only if all of us together, everywhere and everyone, no matter where our country's citizen works -- either as an industrial or agricultural worker, a farmer, or a deputy to the Supreme Council -- it is necessary for us to work for one goal. And then, I think, all that we have been dreaming about during the election campaign and, probably, in the last days, will come true. I wish this to happen and believe me, every constructive opinion, every reasonable opinion which sounds in this hall will go through my conscience, through my heart, and I am convinced that this will promote consolidation and the constructive nature of our work, of our responsible activity. I am very much grateful to all of you. And, no matter what is the course of events, later on I will always remember that these people in this hall entrusted me with huge responsibility and pinned their hopes on me, the hopes of the Ukrainian people. Thank you.
