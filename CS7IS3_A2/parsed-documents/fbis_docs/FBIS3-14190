The shelling late Wednesday close to the Kurdish checkpoint of Chamchamal on the road from the government-controlled town of Karkuk to Kurdish-held al-Sulaymaniyah caused no casualties, they said. Kurdish district commander Khidir Sine said 6O tanks had been brought forward to the line since Tuesday, while an Iraqi helicopter flew within 300 metres (yards) of the demarcation line. Iraqi forces are now less than 500 metres (yards) from the checkpoint. A 300-kilometre (180-mile) stretch of the demarcation line between Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq and the rest of the country lies south of the 36th parallel, above which the Kurds are protected by allied warplanes. Iraq has since the start of March built up troops and arms on the other side of the line, according to the Kurds. But a senior officer who deserted from the Iraqi Army, declining to be named, said the soldiers along the demarcation line were "not in a fit state to attack the Kurds." Their morale is low and the army's situation "desolate," according to the officer. While ruling out a large-scale attack, Kurdish officials and representatives of foreign organisations said the army could launch limited raids south of the 36th parallel.
