The specialists who decoded the so-called "black boxes" at a Paris laboratory allegedly returned to the idea that the A-310 crash near the city of Mezhdurechensk was caused by an act of terrorism. They have rejected the hypothesis that the aircraft depressurized during the flight.... Your ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA correspondent spoke over the telephone with Ivan Mashkivskiy, head of the Russian Federation Main Inspectorate for Civil Aviation Flight Safety and deputy director of the Air Transport Department, who is in charge of the technical commission studying the cause of the tragedy, and asked him to comment on the information that he has received. [Ignatyev] Ivan Yefremovich, you have evidently already done some work to find out the causes and circumstances behind the crash and can probably shed some light on the situation. [Mashkivskiy] Our commission has indeed conducted a preliminary investigation at the crash site. But we first took the engines, some aircraft components, all the computer equipment, computers, fragments, and parts of the fuselage to Novokuznetsk Airport and laid them out in a definite order on the airfield. Specialists carefully inspected everything and drew some conclusions. [Ignatyev] Can you confirm that the disaster was caused by an act of terrorism? [Mashkivskiy] Let me be blunt and say that we have not found confirmation of that. The only thing that I can say now is that the aircraft hit the ground in a flying position [v poletnom polozhenii]. That is, all the flaps were retracted, the landing gear was in the appropriate position, the engines were running until the last moment [rabotali do kontsa], and the plane was banking at an angle of 30 degrees. We also have other information. But it is too early to talk about that. We will receive the decoding of the special instruments -- the "black boxes" -- in a few days and we will check the information that we receive from Paris against our own information and only then produce our final findings. In a word, there is still a great deal of work to be done to find out the real cause of the accident. [Ignatyev] Is any work under way at the scene of the crash? [Mashkivskiy] No. We had to stop all the searches 30 March because flooding cut off our route to the crash site. Rescue personnel and other services managed to remove the fuselage and parts of the aircraft in good time. Relatives of the dead have been allowed to visit the scene of the tragedy. They were taken there by helicopter. The whole area is strewn with flowers.... [Mashkivskiy ends] A civil memorial service for the crew of the A-310 who perished in the disaster was held yesterday in Moscow at Sheremetyevo Airport. The crew's remains were brought from Novokuznetsk. Relatives of the foreign passengers who died in the tragedy have flown to Moscow. They have to identify the bodies.
