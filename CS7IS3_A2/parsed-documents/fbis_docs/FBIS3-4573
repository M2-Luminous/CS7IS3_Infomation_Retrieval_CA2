"It is a problem for us to continue lengthy discussions like this," Hata said, referring to Hosokawa's planned reshuffle expected to center on removing Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura from that post. Hata, also deputy prime minister, was speaking at a press conference in Matsumoto, central Japan, near his electoral constituency. "It should be done as early as possible if Prime Minister Hosokawa judges it necessary at any cost," said Hata, head of Shinseito (Japan renewal party), a key ruling party that along with the Buddhist-backed Komeito [Clean Government Party] supports a cabinet shake-up. Hosokawa's shake-up plan has hit a snag since early February, facing opposition from three of the seven ruling coalition parties -- the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) and Sakigake (Harbinger). Hata's remarks came amid worries in the coalition that a prolonged crack over a reshuffle might adversely affect government efforts to address domestic and foreign policy matters, particularly a trade friction with the United States, coalition sources said. In an earlier speech Sunday, Hata said that politics will remain stagnant and that Hosokawa should be brave to move "either one, two or 10" cabinet members if necessary. Hata denied an intention of replacing Takemura as chief cabinet secretary, saying duties for a party leader and for the top government spokesman will necessarily be incompatible. Hata criticized the SDPJ, the DSP and Sakigake for their moves toward uniting social democrats and liberals into a joint front. "Can we maintain the coalition if we are split into two groups?" he asked, noting a new election system for the House of Representatives. The next general election is almost certain to be fought under the political reform legislation package, enacted last month, which introduces 300 single-seat constituencies plus 200 seats chosen through proportional representation. The present 511-seat lower house was elected through 129 multiseat districts to which two to six seats are allocated. Many mass media surveys have predicted a victory for coalition parties against the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) if they are united, but a loss if they separately field candidates in the next general election. Shinseito and Komeito, which are considered as the coalition's propelling groups, have called for establishing a two-party system under the political reform legislation, while the SDPJ, DSP and Sakigake oppose an immediate two-party system and favor a "moderate multiparty system." Hosokawa, head of the Japan New Party (JNP), at first voiced support for the moderate multiparty system. But earlier this month he instructed top JNP aides to consider uniting the seven coalition parties into one against the LDP to prepare for the next general election. Labor leader Akira Yamagishi, whose Rengo labor organization provides the main base of support for the SDPJ and DSP, says he expects there will be three main parties in the future -- the LDP, a new conservative party, and a nonconservative one.
