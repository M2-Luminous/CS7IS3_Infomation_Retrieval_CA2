FR940819-2-00115 FR940819-2-00068 DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Employment and Training Administration [TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,694] Fort Vancouver Plywood, Vancouver, WA; Notice of Revised Determination on Reconsideration On July 15, 1994, the Department issued an Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration for workers and former workers of the subject firm. The notice was published in the Federal Register on July 26, 1994 (59 FR 37993). Investigation findings show that the subject firm is an employee-owned company operating as a cooperative which produces softwood plywood. New findings on reconsideration show a substantial decline in employment in fiscal year (FY) 1994 compared to FY 1993. Sales and production declines occurred in FY 1994 compared to FY 1993. The subject firms's fiscal year runs from July 1 to June 30. U.S. aggregate imports of soft plywood increased substantially in 1993 compared to 1992. On reconsideration, the Department conducted a survey of Fort Vancouver Plywood's customers to determine whether the ``contributed importantly'' test of Group Eligibility Requirements of the Trade Act was met. The Department's survey shows that customers accounting for a major portion of the subject firm's sales decline in FY 1994 increased their imported purchases of plywood while decreasing their purchases from the subject firm. Conclusion After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reconsideration, it is concluded that workers and former workers of Fort Vancouver Plywood in Vancouver, Washington were adversely affected by increased imports of articles that are like or directly competitive with the softwood plywood produced at the subject firm. In accordance with the provisions of the Act, I make the following revised determination for workers of Fort Vancouver Plywood in Vancouver, Washington. ``All workers of Fort Vancouver Plywood in Vancouver, Washington who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after March 18, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.'' Signed at Washington, DC, this 10th day of August 1994. James D. Van Erden, Administrator, Office of Work-Based Learning.
