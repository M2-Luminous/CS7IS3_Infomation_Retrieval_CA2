The injured person himself made this disclosure. The military-police operation began after those planes had flown over the settlement of La Brecha for 15 minutes. The agents seized four small trucks with treads, and without license plates, and 30 empty aviation fuel tanks, each with a 50-liter capacity. A report provided by the 18th Cavalry Regiment's headquarters in San Miguel Zapotitlan and the State Judicial Police base in this municipality observes: "The community residents were alarmed when they noticed the planes flying over them, expecting them to crash. For this reason, they notified the police." It adds that efforts were promptly coordinated between military forces and police agents; meanwhile, the two aircraft, with unidentified registrations, landed. Seven minutes later, bursts of machine gunfire were heard in an area adjoining that settlement. The report states that the security brigades surrounded the area but, upon reaching the site, found only the body of one person showing AK-47 caliber bullet wounds in the abdomen, and another individual seriously injured. The area is still cordoned off. The report concludes by noting that the body was taken to the PGR offices, and the wounded person is at a clinic, in serious condition and under heavy guard.
