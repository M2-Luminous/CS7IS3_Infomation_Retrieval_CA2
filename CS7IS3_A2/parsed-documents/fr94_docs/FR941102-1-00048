Goodrich Co., 3925 Embassy Parkway, Akron, OH 44313-1799, submitted pesticide petition (PP) 4E4298 to EPA requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) (21 U.S.C. 346a(e)), propose to amend 40 CFR part 180 by establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer (CAS Reg. No. 27756-15-6) when used as an inert ingredient (emulsifier, suspending agent, or rheology modifier) in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops, or to raw agricultural commodities after harvest, or to animals. Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own): solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading, and dispersing agents; propellents in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term ``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active. Subsequent to the publication of the proposal of B. F. Goodrich's request on February 25, 1994 (59 FR 9165), the Agency received a comment from the requestor (B. F. Goodrich) objecting to the proposed rule's requirement of a 1,250,000 minimum number-average molecular weight for the copolymer, stating that it was inconsistent with the October 28, 1992 final rule and would ``* * * place an unnecessary burden on both Industry and the Agency to list the same copolymer every time there is a desire to use a high molecular weight polymer not meeting a 1,250,000 requirement.'' The referenced final rule (57 FR 48736) established an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer under 40 CFR 180.1001(d), for use on growing crops, without containing a molecular weight limitation. The commentor stated that it was not their intention to limit the tolerance exemption for acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer to a minimum number average molecular weight of 1,250,000 in the proposed rule and sought to eliminate the molecular weight limitation. The Agency agrees that an apparent inconsistency exists. The basis for the February 25, 1994, proposed rule was conformance to the criteria described in 40 CFR 723.250, which requires a reference to a minimum molecular weight. The previously established tolerance exemption under 40 CFR 180.1001(d) also relied on the fact that acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer conformed to 40 CFR 723.250; however, a minimum number-average molecular weight was inadvertently omitted from that rule. Additional information was requested to be submitted by the petitioner to support the use of a new minimum-number average molecular weight for acrylic acid stearyl methacrylate copolymer which would still conform to 40 CFR 723.250. The requested information was provided, and the Agency is hereby proposing that the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer specify the minimum number-average molecular weight as 2,500. EPA is deleting the entry for this chemical under 40 CFR 180.1001(d) because the requested expansion to section 180.1001(c) incorporates uses on growing crops as well as raw agricultural commodities. The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. As part of the EPA policy statement on inert ingredients published in the Federal Register of April 22, 1987 (52 FR 13305), the Agency set forth a list of studies which would generally be used to evaluate the risks posed by the presence of an inert ingredient in a pesticide formulation. However, where it can be determined without that data that the inert ingredient will present minimal or no risk, the Agency generally does not require some or all of the listed studies to rule on the proposed tolerance or exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for an inert ingredient. The Agency has decided that no data, in addition to that described below, for acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer will need to be submitted. The rationale for this decision is described below. In the case of certain chemical substances that are defined as ``polymers,'' the Agency has established a set of criteria which identify categories of polymers that present low risk. These criteria (described in 40 CFR 723.250) identify polymers that are relatively unreactive and stable compared to other chemical substances as well as polymers that typically are not readily absorbed. These properties generally limit a polymer's ability to cause adverse effects. In addition, these criteria exclude polymers about which little is known. The Agency believes that polymers meeting the criteria noted above will present minimal or no risk. Acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer conforms to the definition of a polymer given in 40 CFR 723.250(b) (11) and meets the following criteria that are used to identify low-risk polymers: 1. The minimum number-average molecular weight of the acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer is 2,500. Substances with molecular weights greater than 400 generally are not absorbed through the intact skin, and substances with molecular weights greater than 1,000 generally are not absorbed through the intact gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Chemicals not absorbed through skin or GI tract generally are incapable of eliciting a toxic response. 2. Acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer is not a cationic polymer, nor is it reasonably anticipated to become a cationic polymer in a natural aquatic environment. 3. Acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer does not contain less than 32.0 percent by weight of the atomic element carbon. 4. Acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer contains as an integral part of its composition the atomic elements carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen. 5. Acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer does not contain as an integral part of its composition, except as impurities, any elements other than those listed in 40 CFR 723.250(d)(3)(ii). 6. Acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer is not a biopolymer, a synthetic equivalent of a biopolymer, or a derivative or a modification of a biopolymer that is substantially intact. 7. Acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer is not manufactured from reactants containing, other than impurities, halogen atoms or cyano groups. 8. Acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer does not contain a reactive functional group that is intended, or reasonably anticipated, to undergo further reaction. 9. Acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer is not designed, or reasonably anticipated, to substantially degrade, decompose, or depolymerize. Based on the information above and review of its use, EPA has found that, when used in accordance with good agricultural practice, this ingredient is useful and a tolerance is not necessary to protect the public health. Therefore, EPA proposes that the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance be established as set forth below. Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide, under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended, that contains any of the ingredients listed herein, may request within 30 days after the publication of this document in the Federal Register that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the FFDCA. Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation indicating the document control number [OPP-300364]. All written comments filed in response to this petition will be available in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the address given above, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 2 of Executive Order 12866. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have an economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950). List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 180 Environments Protection, Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Pesticides and pests, Recording and recordkeeping requirements. Dated: September 26, 1994. Stephen L. Johnson, Director, Registration Division, Office of Pesticide Programs. Therefore, it is proposed that 40 CFR part 180 be amended as follows: PART 180_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for part 180 continues to read as follows: Authority: 21 U.S.C. 346a and 371. 2. In §180.1001, paragraphs (c) and (e) are amended in the tables therein by adding and alphabetically inserting the inert ingredient, and paragraph (d) is amended in the table therein by removing the entry for acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer (CAS Reg.
