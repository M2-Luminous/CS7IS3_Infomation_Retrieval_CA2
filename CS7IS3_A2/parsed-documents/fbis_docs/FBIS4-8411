The government draws attention to the already looming risk of this act leading to the very brink of a conflict of cataclysmic proportions and maintains that there is no need to emphasize the fact that the United Nations has undermined the relatively reasonable logic of the hitherto peace process by taking this action. Apart from the necessary measures, derived from its powers and taken in keeping with the latest situation, the government has also decided to acquaint in detail the international public with the consequences of the bombardment of the Serb positions around Gorazde. In this context, the ministry for foreign affairs of the Srpska republic will inform Russia, Germany, China, Japan, and India in particular about the NATO aggression and demand of these countries to condemn this aggression and support the peace process. Taking into account all the elements of the civil war, a formula for peace in ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina must recognize the right to self- determination of all three peoples, including their right to have their own state, the lifting of sanctions against Yugoslavia and the Serbian people in general, a lasting cessation of hostilities, the disengagement of the warring parties under the supervision of the United Nations and territorial demarcation, the statement says.
