FR940803-1-00054 FR940803-1-00011 Federal Highway Administration 49 CFR Part 393 [FHWA Docket No. MC&hyph;94&hyph;9] RIN 2125&hyph;AD37 Parts and Accessories Necessary For Safe Operation; Automatic Brake Adjusters and Brake Adjustment Indicators AGENCY: Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: The FHWA is proposing to require the use of automatic brake adjusters (ABAs) on hydraulically-braked commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) and air-braked CMVs manufactured on or after October 20, 1993, and October 20, 1994, respectively. The FHWA is also proposing a requirement for brake adjustment indicators on air-braked CMVs with external adjustment mechanisms manufactured on or after October 20, 1994. This rulemaking is intended to: Insure that the operational standards for brakes in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) are consistent with the manufacturing standards in the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSSs) numbers 105 and 121, which now require the installation of automatic brake adjusters and adjustment indicators on certain CMVs manufactured on or after these dates; and improve the safety of operation of CMVs by reducing the incidence of brakes that are out of adjustment. In addition, the FHWA requests information concerning the possibility of requiring these devices to be retrofitted to CMVs placed in operation prior to the effective dates of the recent amendments to FMVSS Nos. 105 and 121. DATES: Comments must be received on or before October 3, 1994.
