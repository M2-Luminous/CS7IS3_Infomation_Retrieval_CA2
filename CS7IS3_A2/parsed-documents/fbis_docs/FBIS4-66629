This is the week's question. But this question is not the real issue that is presently being forcefully raised in numerous Egyptian circles. If Qatar has preceded Egypt and has actually agreed to export gas to Israel--executive steps are being taken currently behind the scenes in this regard--then this is a purely Qatari affair and it has no connection whatsoever with the Egyptian issue. The Egyptian issue centers initially on the question of whether Egypt has any surplus natural gas to export abroad, and secondly on the question of exporting to Israel just like any other country. The answer to this question will lead us to the answer to the week's question, which we will put aside until the end of this report. To begin, there is no disagreement that natural gas is a main component of energy now. Rather, all expectations are that in the coming phase, natural gas will play the main role in meeting the energy demand that is growing as a result of increased development rates. Moreover, natural gas will, as petroleum experts say, be the driving force in the energy field. This is insofar as the international situation is concerned. As for Egypt, energy concerns will focus on natural gas following the discovery of more gas reserves and the increased use of gas to replace liquid petroleum derivatives for numerous purposes, the latest of which is the use of gas [as fuel] for buses. Moreover, this increased use of gas will alleviate the pressure on oil consumption. Oil finds and reserves are not increasing at the same pace as natural gas finds and reserves. Petroleum Minister Hamdi al-Banbi's asserts that Egypt's natural gas reserves amounted to 21 trillion cubic feet on 1 January 1994, whereas confirmed reserves totaled 12 trillion cubic feet last year. The petroleum minister added that the total reserve from which gas is pumped into the national gas network does not exceed 8.6 trillion cubic feet. But with the tendency to replace oil derivatives with gas, it is necessary to increase this reserve in order to meet domestic demand and to allocate the surplus for export. It is not expected that discovered gas fields will be developed and ready for use before the lapse of five years at least. In this period, the foreign firms that have discovered these fields are expected to spend $5 million to make these fields ready to pump gas and to be connected with the national gas pipeline network. On a related issue, Petroleum Minister Hamdi al-Banbi has said that these reserves have to be increased in order to meet the increase in demand for natural gas, estimated at 5 percent annually. It is expected that the consumption rate will exceed one trillion cubic feet annually by the year 1997. This means that it is necessary to secure gas supplies amounting to 1.3 trillion cubic feet annually. Growing Consumption After discussing the anticipated reserves and recent [estimates] of the potential use of natural gas, we shift to the figures of the Petroleum Authority on the role of natural gas in Egypt's energy system. Engineer Muhammad Tawilah, the Petroleum Authority vice chairman for natural gas affairs, points out that gas consumption in 1980-81 was roughly 1.9 million tons, representing 14 percent of the total domestic consumption of oil derivatives, which totaled 13.3 million tons. In 1992-93, gas consumption amounted to 8.2 million tons, representing 31 percent of the total domestic consumption of oil derivatives, which totaled 26.6 million tons. Since gas production started, Egypt has consumed a gas volume equaling 715 million barrels of crude oil, meaning that Egypt has saved a volume of crude oil, valued at $13 billion. The cost of development, of building the gas treatment facilities and the transportation and distribution network, and of operating the gas network amounted to $2.5 billion by the end of 1993. Engineer Muhammad Tawilah has said that several sectors have begun to use gas instead of oil. The electricity sector tops the list of gas consumers with 64 percent [of the consumption], followed by the nitrogenous fertilizer plants with 15 percent, and the construction and ceramics sector with 5 percent, and, finally, home use which does not exceed 1 percent. Generally, the economic value of replacing liquid fuel with gas in various sectors since gas use was begun, until June 1993 amounts to $11 billion. This is for consumption. As for production, the figures show, according to the Petroleum Authority vice chairman, that gas production rose from 85 billion cubic feet in 1980/81 to 377 billion cubic feet in 1992/93. The delta and Mediterranean fields, Abu-Madi, Shamalah, and Abu-Qir fields contribute 53 percent of the total natural gas production. The Western Desert fields of Badr-al-Din, Abu-Sinan, and Abu-al-Gharadiq contribute 34 percent and the Suez Gulf fields produce 13 percent. A number of projects are being implementation and will enter the production phase soon, such as the Trans-Gulf Gas Project, the project to extract butane gas in al-'Amiriyah, and the marine compressors project at Abu-Qir. All these areas fall within the bounds of the confirmed reserve, which amounted to 12 trillion cubic feet last year. But with the discovered new finds, the reserves have risen to 21 trillion cubic feet. Thus, there are now new fields in several areas that need to be developed. Self-Sufficiency! In light of all these figures, the question that arises is: has Egypt achieved self-sufficiency in gas? Engineer Muhammad Tawilah has said, "To date, the domestic market hasn't reached the point of gas saturation. It still needs more. Assuming that the new reserves, estimated at 9 trillion cubic feet--a figure confirmed at the beginning of January 1994--are not developed, there will be a shortfall ranging from 620 [number as published] million to 300 million cubic feet daily in the short run, until 1998/99. The shortfall will then resurface after the year 2000 and will grow to reach 1.3 billion cubic feet daily by the year 2009/10. "But in case the new reserves--estimated at 9 trillion cubic feet, raising the confirmed reserve to 21 trillion cubic feet--are developed, then a gas surplus will begin to appear in Egypt, beginning at about 200 million cubic feet daily by 1998/99 and rising to 1.4 billion cubic feet daily by the year 2010. These reserves have been calculated on the basis of achieving self-sufficiency and of meeting the needs of power stations and of plants located close to the unified gas network. As for delivering gas to Chema Aswan and to the other parts of Upper Egypt, it isn't economical, because huge investments will be needed to lay down gas pipelines. Who will shoulder these costs? "These surpluses have also been determined without taking into account any expected new finds in this period. As for self-sufficiency, the criterion is based on economically meeting the needs of the consumers who are close to the network." To Europe and Israel Within the bounds of this information, it is expected that there will be a natural gas surplus of close to 200 million cubic feet in the final year of this century, increasing to 1.4 billion cubic feet by the year 2010. Accordingly, the question is: where will this natural gas surplus go? If the answer is, of course, that it has to be exported to the outside world, then to what region will it be exported? Petroleum experts say that according to economic feasibility, to market economy, and to supply and demand in particular, the surplus will go to southern Europe, because this region will absorb large quantities of gas in the first decade of the next century. It is well known that most European countries, excluding France, have suspended programs to produce electricity from nuclear energy. In light of the environmental restraints and controls have increased the cost of coal-operated power plants, natural gas will be the natural alternative for electricity production. Accordingly, expectations indicate that demand for natural gas in the southern European countries will rise to 6.3 trillion cubic feet [annually] by the year 2010, whereas gas supply from the current sources, namely from the commonwealth countries, Norway, the Netherlands, and Algeria will amount to 4.2 trillion cubic feet [annually] in the same year, i.e., 2010. This means that the shortfall will amount to nearly two trillion cubic feet. To export the gas surplus to the southern European countries, Israel has to be the station through which the pipeline transits. Three Reasons A preparatory question is demanded for this answer before we answer the question of the week, namely the question of whether Egypt will export natural gas to Israel. This preparatory question asks: why does the Egyptian pipeline have to go through Israel? The answer is that there are several reasons that make this selection beneficial to the Egyptian market: First, the natural gas finds are not as big as those discovered in the Arab Gulf states and Algeria. Therefore, the pipeline has to pass through dry lands in order to reduce construction cost. Consequently, the pipeline has to go to Europe through either Israel or Turkey. If the finds were very big, the pipeline could go across the Mediterranean Sea, where the cost would be high because of deep water. This alternative is not available to Egypt. Second, extending a natural gas pipeline to Europe through dry lands will enable the pipeline to pass through more than one country. Consequently, natural gas can be sold to these countries, namely Turkey, Israel, Jordan, and the state of Palestine. Third, in any case, Egypt will not be the only Arab country that will be supplying gas to a gas pipeline going to Europe through Israel. Some Arab Gulf countries will also supply such a pipeline. To build this pipeline from Qatar to Israel, the pipeline has to go through Saudi territory. Two days ago, Israel Radio attributed to Israeli Energy Minister Moshe Shahal the statement that a pipeline to deliver natural gas from Arab countries to Israel--meaning the Israeli-Qatari accord--will be constructed sooner than expected. Regarding this last point, the idea of constructing a gas pipeline from Qatar across Saudi Arabia to Egypt's Mediterranean coast, from whence to export gas by tankers to Europe after building liquefying plants--this idea was raised previously. But it has not seen the light to date. Diverse Strategy This is insofar as Egypt and Qatar are concerned. But what about Israel? To put it more precisely, what is Israel's strategy for acquiring natural gas? According to available information, the Israeli strategy is to acquire natural gas as a clean fuel to replace some liquid oil derivatives that are polluting Israel's environment. Israel's strategy is to obtain the natural gas it needs from Egypt and the Arab Gulf states by way of Qatar, from which a pipeline will be constructed, passing through Israel and Turkey to Europe. Moreover, Israel is thinking of obtaining natural gas from a third Arab country. This strategy can only become a practical reality in the context of peace in the Middle East. Within this context, Israel is eager to diversify its natural gas sources rather than rely on the monopoly of a single country, especially since the indications are that there will be increased use of natural gas to desalinate sea water in the future. To underline the idea that Israel will be a transit station for the Egyptian and Qatari gas pipelines to Europe, [one should note that] Israel's gas demand will amount to 1.4 billion cubic feet daily by the year 2010. This volume is smaller than the volume that will be pumped from Egypt and Qatar by then. Therefore, the main export activity will be to the European countries. So, why does Israel want natural gas from Egypt? As already noted, the pipeline has to be extended to Europe through dry land. Moreover, if a pipeline is built from Port Said to Israel, Egypt will not shoulder the cost, which will amount to $300 million. Here, we ask the Ministry of Petroleum why it does not consider setting up a joint company between the Petroleum Authority and foreign firms that produce gas in Egypt to finance and operate this pipeline. This will be a better situation for Egypt. Expectations suggest that Israel's demand for Egyptian natural gas will amount to 250 million cubic feet daily. This is a small amount equaling the consumption of two power plants. It is well known that this is not the first time Egypt has dealt with Israel in the oil area. The fact is that Israel has been purchasing Egyptian oil for 15 years at international prices. Therefore, the Ministry of Petroleum sees no difference between exporting crude oil or natural gas as long as Israel observes Egyptian rules and regulations. Moreover, Egypt will sell gas to Israel at the international price prevailing at the time of export, without any exceptions. Furthermore, Egypt cannot compel foreign partners not to export their share of the natural gas to Israel. If this project is carried out, Egypt will benefit from the installations and will export its natural gas at a lower cost. In a related development, Excelsior [name illegible], an Israeli firm located in al-Ramlah, has held contacts with firms in the region in preparation for implementing in Israel complementary projects that will emanate from extending gas pipelines from the Arab Gulf countries and Egypt. Another aspect is that Egypt has set its sight on enabling the newborn state of Palestine to benefit from its natural gas, considering that Israel can secure gas from various sources, whereas it will be difficult for any country to supply the state of Palestine with gas. Another side of the picture is summed up in this question: why is Egypt considering natural gas export? Oil experts assert that as soon as the Ministry of Petroleum announces the export of gas to any country, the announcement will attract international firms to prospect in areas where gas is likely to exist in the delta, in the deep waters of the Mediterranean Sea, and in the Western Desert. The reason why firms will show interest is that they make their calculations on the basis of market volume. If the market is confined to Egypt, international firms will feel less secure. But if there are other markets to absorb the gas, firms will come to work with a feeling of total security. It is to be noted that Europe is heading for increased gas use. Consequently, gas prices will rise in the future. The other point is that it is extremely important to export natural gas in order to bolster Egyptian exports and the general budget. It is evident to date that the natural gas pipeline is scheduled to extend from Egypt to Israel by 1998. But this schedule is tied to several considerations: First, completing the establishment of peace in the Middle East. Second, that Egypt will not conclude any accord with Israel unless the Egyptian Ministry of Petroleum concludes agreements with international firms to develop the current finds, requiring nearly $5 billion. This is the answer to the week's question of whether Egypt will export natural gas to Israel.
