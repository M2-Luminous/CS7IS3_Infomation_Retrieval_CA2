Nabila Khraifia: [Khraifia] [passage omitted] President 'Arafat sent Abu al-'Ala [Ahmad Quray], economy minister in the Palestinian authority, to Washington to ask for urgent financial aid to ensure the running of the self-rule institutions. That was announced in Tunis by a Palestinian official who refused to reveal his identity. He also pointed out that the lack of money was the main reason for postponing President 'Arafat's trip to the self-rule areas and the installment of the Palestinian government in Jericho. The same source pointed out that the donor countries had proposed to offer the PLO last week $ 10 million dollar of the $ 24 million which they promised on 10 June last, and had raised it to $18 million dollar after President Yasir 'Arafat had rejected it.
