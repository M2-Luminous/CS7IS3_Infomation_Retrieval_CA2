There has been a great deal of speculation about the contents of the missive, but Ambassador Jose Patricio clarifies the issue. [Begin recording] [Patricio] There has been a great deal of speculation about the letter. The letter has not yet been delivered, and even the spokesman is not where our president is right now. So, the news media should wait for the unfolding of events instead of fabricating facts. [Unidentified correspondent] So, the letter has definitely not been delivered to the Angolan head of state. [Patricio] No. As far as I know, the letter will be delivered by Ambassador Paul Hare, President Bill Clinton's special envoy, to President Jose Eduardo dos Santos during the course of the week. [Correspondent] Other media reports say in his letter the U.S. president asks the government to give the governorship of Huambo Province and the Ministry of Public Works to UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]. Is that true? [Patricio] That is mere speculation. The contents of the letter are still secret. [end recording]
