However, can anti-forgery identification really prevent the counterfeiting of products? A few years back when markets were inundated with forgeries of famous-brand goods and shoddy products, the concerned department and victimized enterprises backed products designed with anti-forgery identification as an effective way of checking counterfeiting activities. Around 1990, Qingdao's Meiqi Laser Holographic Image Company and other enterprises were the first to import laser holographic image production lines from abroad. Since then, packages of famous-brand products such as "Zhangguang 101" hair tonic, "Sun" rice crust, and "Sanjiu" gastric medicine have been treated with laser holographic anti-forgery identification to prevent counterfeiting. The initial results of anti-forgery identification were great. In 1991, the State Bureau of Technology Supervision issued a document popularizing anti-forgery technology on famous-brand products. Nonetheless, counterfeit manufacturers did not disappear. They have used anti-forgery identification as "certificates of identity" on forged products. As a result, the use of anti-forgery identification has entered a weird cycle: On the one hand, in order to prevent counterfeiting, more and more enterprises manufacturing famous-brand products have started to use, or have continually changed, their anti-forgery identification. On the other, counterfeit manufacturers have closely followed famous-brand manufacturers in using or changing anti-forgery identification. Thus, the demand for anti-forgery identification has grown abnormally. It is understood that so far there are nearly 1,000 enterprises engaged in research and development of anti-forgery technologies or in the production of goods with anti-forgery identification, as well as a dozen anti-forgery technologies including laser holographic imagery, fluorescent ink, magnetic ink, alteration-proof ink, temperature-changing ink, and special plate printing. Of these, some 70 enterprises are engaged in the production of laser holographic anti-forgery goods, with a production capacity far exceeding demand. These enterprises, which are scattered all over the country, are run by collective, private, or individual sectors as well as by joint ventures. In the absence of a strict and unified management, the scope of supplying some products is arbitrarily decided by enterprises, thus defeating the purpose of using anti-forgery identification. Meanwhile, due to the lack of unified national standards, some anti-forgery ink products are technology-deficient. As their chemical composition can be easily deciphered, they have become the targets of counterfeiters. According to a briefing by an official of the State Bureau of Technology Supervision, of the forgery and shoddy products seized by technology supervision departments in various localities, a considerable portion were forged "famous-brand products" using anti- forgery identification. In addition to fraud against consumers, these forged and shoddy products have caused grave economic losses to famous-brand manufacturers and damaged their credibility. The manufacturer of "Sun" rice crust has spent nearly 10 million yuan changing anti-forgery identification on four occasions, but still has failed to thwart harassment by counterfeiters. The sales volume of "Sun" rice crust has recently dropped to less than a quarter of that three years ago. In view of the fairly large production scale of anti-forgery products in China, concerned government departments should establish a special administrative organization, and should formulate national standards and administrative measures and rules related to anti- forgery technology and products. They should exercise strict supervision and management by implementing a system of fixed locations for the development and production of anti-forgery technologies. While issuing production licenses and quality certificates, it is necessary to examine the qualifications of users of anti-forgery technologies.
