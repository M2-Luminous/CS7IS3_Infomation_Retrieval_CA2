This announcement was made today by the agent from the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office, Juan Carlos Mendoza Arguelles. The prosecutor refused to go into detail on the investigation, or to disclose the identities of the persons interrogated. However, it was established that they include the warden, Genaro Agustin Sepulveda Lopez; the deputy director, whose identity was concealed; and the security commanders, Fernando Gonzalez Hernandez, Guadalupe Guadarrama, and Fernando Miramontes. The prison officials are not officially detained, but it was indicated that, if they prove responsible for the escape, arrest warrants might be issued against them. Meanwhile, at the Prisons Directorate in Ciudad Victoria, its head, Francisco Castellanos de la Garza, refused to be interviewed to provide information on the escape. The authorities have not yet established how and when the drug trafficker managed to escape without being seen by the guard personnel. Ayala Garcia's disappearance was not announced until Monday afternoon, when the roll was called. He was serving a 17-year sentence imposed by the seventh district judge, Juan Bonilla Pizano, for crimes against health.
