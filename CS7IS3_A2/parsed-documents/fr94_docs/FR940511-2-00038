FR940511-2-00038 FR940511-2-00027 Nevada Operations Office; Award of a Grant, Noncompetitive Financial Assistance AGENCY: Department of Energy (DOE), Nevada Operations Office. ACTION: Notice of noncompetitive financial assistance. SUMMARY: DOE announces that pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules, 10 CFR 600.14(e)(1), it intends to award a noncompetitive financial assistance grant to the state of Nevada, Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (NDCNR), for providing environmental oversight and monitoring initiatives, which will ensure the DOE Nevada Operations Office compliance with applicable federal, state, and local environmental requirements. This grant will implement an agreement with the NDCNR to improve the accountability of DOE in the area of environmental protection. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The state of Nevada, NDCNR, will provide independent validation of environmental compliance data, establish environmental cleanup schedules, and provide a mechanism for assisting DOE to prioritize its cleanup activities. The state of Nevada will assume a more substantive role in overseeing DOE's compliance with state environmental laws, and to help assure the citizens of Nevada that DOE operations do not constitute a health hazard. Eligibility for the award of this grant is being limited to the state of Nevada because the applicant is a unit of government, and the activity to be supported is related to performance of a governmental function within the subject's jurisdiction, thereby precluding DOE provision of support to another entity. The term of this grant is five years and will commence July 1, 1994, and end June 30, 1999. The total estimated cost of this award is $4 million.
