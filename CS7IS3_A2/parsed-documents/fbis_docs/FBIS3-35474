In a statement to MENA, Sa'id Kamal demanded that the Israeli Government immediately adopt a resolution removing the settlements and withdrawing the settlers so that the peace operation might follow its sound and natural course. He said he doubts the efficacy of negotiating under the circumstances. Kamal explained that the Palestinian proposal to place the West Bank and Gaza under international protection has been proven sound. Hasan 'Usfur, deputy chairman of the Security Affairs Committee in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on implementing autonomy in Gaza and Jericho, condemned the massacre. He stressed that the Israeli settlers' new crime reveals the inherent brutality of those who reside illegally in the occupied territories. 'Usfur added that their actions contradict the most obvious legal principles and offer new proof that the peace process is not an easy issue but is a complicated operation that requires extreme efforts to maintain it. The Palestinian official remarked that the new crime illustrates to Rabin's government the danger that the continuing presence of the settlers poses for the peace process. He said that if Israel wants to preserve the peace process, it must first end the new barbarism of these people, who are no longer a danger to the Palestinians alone, but to the entire peace operation. They are thus a danger to Rabin's government. 'Usfur concluded his remarks by noting that this new criminal act demonstrates the Palestinian negotiators' sound logic when they considered the dangers represented by such people and told the Israeli negotiators that security is a mutual concern, not a demand made by one party.
