A vote for the NP was in fact a vote for the African National Congress [ANC], Dr Hartzenberg said in a statement. The NP, in alliance with the African National Congress, had through secret deals and memoranda of understanding concocted a "draconian" constitution. "They who first let loose the communist monster and later notoriously capitulated before it, who could not control the ANC while they had all the government instruments at their disposal, now ask our people to support them as they enter the opposition benches." This reminded one of the tale of the child who had murdered its parents and pleaded with the court for extenuating circumstances because he was now an orphan, Dr Hartzenberg said.
