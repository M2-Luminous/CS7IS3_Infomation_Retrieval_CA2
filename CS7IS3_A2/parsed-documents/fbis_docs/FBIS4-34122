The Foreign Ministry [Minrex] summoned the heads of the foreign missions and briefed them on the current situation regarding the presence of three groups that forced their way a few days ago into the residence of the Belgian ambassador and the German Embassy, as well as the Chilean consulate. Minrex Spokesman Miguel Alonso later told the local and foreign media that according to Cuba the firmness by all the sides affected by these incident favors a possible prompt solution. Nine people, including a woman and a child, participated in the most recent illegal entry, which occurred at the Chilean Consulate. Alonso explained the Cuban Government has reiterated to the ambassadors its decision to help resolve the problem caused by the occupants of their respective buildings. He ruled out any legal action against those who voluntarily leave. Those transgressions cannot replace the country's current normal procedure to travel abroad, nor is it acceptable to try to force an ambassador into granting a visa, he added. During the meeting, Cuba reaffirmed that in accordance with international agreements, it respects the sanctity of embassies and offers protection to all missions accredited in this Caribbean nation.
