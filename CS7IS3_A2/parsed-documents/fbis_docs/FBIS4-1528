FBIS4-1528 "drchi062_h_94001" FBIS-CHI-94-062 Daily Report 31 Mar 1994 West Europe Foreign Scientists Interviewed on Nuclear Cooperation Foreign Scientists Interviewed on Nuclear Cooperation OW3103114394 Beijing XINHUA in English 1117 GMT 31 Mar 94 OW3103114394 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Beijing, March 31 (XINHUA) -- The European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) has cooperated successfully with China, Professor C.H. Llewellyn Smith, director general of Cern, said in an interview with XINHUA here today. CERN, set up in 1954, is the world's biggest organization for basic research on particle physics. Nineteen countries participate in CERN, with 5,000 staff members and 500 scientists from outside the participant countries. Prof. Smith said CERN has attracted scientists from around the globe, and its research is of great significance. At present, half of the world's high-energy physicists are listed in CERN. He said CERN has cooperated with China for more than 10 years, and about 80 Chinese scientists are doing research in CERN today. Smith said, "We very much welcome Chinese scientists to join CERN. They bring with them wisdom and products. We are looking forward to further cooperation with China, including cooperation in new experiments and construction of new accelerators." He said CERN's success is the result of close cooperation between scientists from different countries. Chinese scientists have contributed a lot to the L3 [expansion unknown] experiment chaired by famous physicist Prof. Samuel C.C. Ting, Smith added. Prof. Ting, a Nobel laureate in physics, told XINHUA that his joint work with Chinese scientists dates back to 1977, after which time 10 to 20 Chinese scientists were sent to work with him annually. He said that the Chinese scientists had made important contributions in the fields of theory and digital analysis. He said Chinese scientists collaborated in the design and construction of Laboratory L3 in 1982. They undertook the building and experiments on the BGO crystal, a time- and energy-consuming task. Due to their efforts, the first mass quantity of BGO crystal, 12 tons, was reaped. As for CERN-China cooperation promoting China's research in high energy physics, Smith said that the cooperation provided Chinese scientists with opportunities to explore physical origins on the front line of physical structure research while exposing them to a lot of high technologies, concerning superconduction, high frequencies, high vacuums and computer networking, thus training them well in these aspects.
