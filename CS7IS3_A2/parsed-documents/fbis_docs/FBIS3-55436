Under examination was the republic's draft budget for the current year, which had been sent earlier for finalizing. It was noted that a complex situation had developed in the credit and financial sphere. A lot of difficulties have been experienced with ensuring revenue for the budget. However, a 1994 draft budget gives us hope that its implementation will change the republic's socio-economic life for the better. First of all, it is based on the national currency. Secondly, it has taken into account recommendations of international financial organizations, such as the IMF and the World Bank. Thirdly, it pursues a tough policy which is dictated by the needs of market economy. At the same time, we should support the less well off sections of society. Social support should be targeted and preserved. It was decided to submit the draft budget for consideration by the president of the republic. The government's report on the main issues of a program for systematic and economic transformations for 1994 was also approved by the session. This report will be submitted for consideration by the Paris meeting of the IMF consultative group on 14 January.
