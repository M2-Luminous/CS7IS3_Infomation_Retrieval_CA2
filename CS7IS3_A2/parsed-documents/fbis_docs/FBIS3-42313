A 24-year-old right-wing extremist has been arrested in connection with the series of letter bomb attacks. [see Terrorism Reports dated 15, 24, and 28 December 1993 for incident reporting] Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak confirmed this today. He did not want to disclose any details on the man's role. [passage omitted] Reportedly, the recently-arrested man is part of the leadership of the terrorist group called Extraparliamentary Opposition Loyal to the People, with which Peter Binder and Franz Radl Jr are also affiliated. These two right-wing extremists have been imprisoned for many weeks. Loeschnak says that they are supposedly behind the wave of terrorism. By the way, the interior minister also talks for the first time of concrete proof against the suspects, not mere circumstantial evidence. At any rate, right-wing extremism in Austria has altogether become more violent. This is also shown by the criminal statistics presented by the Interior Ministry, which, however, in general indicates a gratifying reversal of the trend. After years of increasing crime rates, the figures for 1993 show, for the first time, a slight decrease. The number of crimes and criminal offenses is just under 500,000, as compared to 502,000 the year before. [passage omitted]
