Edouard Balladur: [Begin Balladur recording] Since yesterday, we have been able to see that our firm stand, which we had called for, and which was initiated by our country and our diplomacy, has been a success. At the moment we speak, we can say that it was a success. This does not necessarily mean that everything has been solved, and many problems remain to be solved. Nevertheless, our assessment of the situation at this stage shows that the alliance's decision, acting within an international mandate, has, for the most part, been respected. Is this a definitive situation, is it a lasting situation? The future will tell, but it is our duty to [words indistinct]. Our attention now turns to the follow-up to this action from the point of view of a lasting solution to the problems of Bosnia- Herzegovina. This first of all means a solution of the situation in Sarajevo, with the restoration of free movement, the lifting of the siege, and the international administration of the city, which seems to many to be the only way of providing a lasting solution to the problem. Second, it means the solution of the problems facing a number of other towns or regions in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which have been designated as safe areas, and which sometimes have not been safe areas, and where the situation remains unchanged. Finally, it means a solution of the overall problem of Bosnia, in other words progress towards a lasting peace. You know that the European Union has drawn up a plan. This plan is on the table. It is not a rigid plan, it can still be debated, and we are quite prepared to discuss it with our partners within whatever framework or organization. What is essential is that, thanks to this action, we can gradually move towards a solution of the situation in Bosnia. [end recording].
