Saumelkh, candidate of agricultural sciences, Kustanay Scientific Production Association; UDC 633.111.1''321'':631.526.32] [Abstract] The spring wheat variety Karabalykskaya 85 was developed at the Karabalyk Agricultural Test Station at the Kustanay Agricultural Scientific Research Institute by the method of individual seed selection from the hybrid population Cesium 51 x Saratovskaya 39. It has been regionalized in the Chelyabinsk Oblast since 1991. Karabalykskaya 85 is of the variety lutescens. Its glume is shaped like an elongated egg with pronounced venation, and its tooth is short, straight, and blunt. Its grain is oval, glassy, and of a semiglassy consistency, and 1,000 grains weigh 32-36 g. It is a medium-maturing variety that ripens at the same time as Saratovskaya 39. It has average resistance to damping-off and has a rather high potential productivity that averages 3.46 metric tons/hectare, which is 0.31 metric tons/hectare higher than the standard. The results of commercial tests of Karabalykskaya 85 at various sovkhozes were fairly good: At the Petropavlovsk sovkhoz in the Upper Ural Rayon of the Saratov Oblast, its grain yield was twice that of Saratovskaya 29. Its brown rust resistance is close to that of the standard, its susceptibility to root rot is somewhat lower than that of other regionalized varieties, and it is resistant to smut. The processing qualities of the grain of Karabalykskaya 85 are high and meet the requirements set for hard wheat grain. Karabalykskaya 85 should be sowed at the optimum time for given soil/climate zones at a rate of 4.0-5.0 million seeds/hectare. The soft spring wheat variety Erythrospermum 35 was developed by a team at the Karabalyk Agricultural Test station at the Kustanay Agricultural Scientific Research Center and Kazakh Grain Farming Scientific Research Institute by the method of individual selection from the hybrid population Erythrospermum 29/70-19 x Lutescens 26/67-211. It has been regionalized in the Kustanay, Kokchetav, Karaganda, and Dzhezkazgan oblasts since 1991. It is of the variety erythrospermum. Its spike is of average length and compactness, and its glume is shaped like an elongated oval with marked venation. The tooth of the glume is of average length, straight, and sharp. The grain is red, semielongated, and over average size (1,000 grains weigh 34-40 g). Erythrospermum 35 is a medium-maturing variety that matures 6-8 days later than the standard Saratovskaya 29. It has average resistance to damping-off. In comparative variety tests, Erythrospermum 35 outyielded the standard by 0.65 metric tons/hectare at an average level of 3.3 metric tons/hectare (the maximum yield of 5.4 metric tons/hectare was achieved in 1985). It also demonstrated good results in commercial tests (a yield of 0.67 metric tons/hectare, which was twice as high as the yield of Saratovskaya 29). Erythrospermum 35 is highly resistant to damping-off both under natural conditions and against the background of an artificial infection. During the years of the study, its rate of susceptibility to this disease did not exceed 6-8 percent, while the susceptibility of Saratovskaya 29 was between 34 and 63 percent. Erythrospermum 35 is about as susceptible to rust as Saratovskaya 29, but its grain is more resistant to sprouting than the standard varieties, and it is less susceptible to root rot than other regionalized varieties. It should be sowed late (after 25 May) at a rate of 4-5 million seeds/hectare.
