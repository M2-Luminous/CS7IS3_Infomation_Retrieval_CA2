The fund limits contributions to 1,000 dollars per person and bars donations from corporations, unions and political action committees, White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers told the White House news briefing this afternoon. "The President will be faced with potentially large legal bills and it's in the best interest of the country for the President to have those bills paid," Myers said. Clinton's legal bills may top two million U.S. dollars a year to deal with mounting legal problems including a sexual harassment suit and a federal investigation of the failed Whitewater Development Corporation in the late 1980s, which the Clintons half owned. At a news briefing at the Washington office of the Sullivan and Cromwell law firm, which will handle Clinton's legal defense fund, the trustees said creating the fund was essential because the legal bills facing the Clintons could be "enormous." Estimates put the costs of legal bills at one million to two million U.S. dollars a year or more. However, the Clintons' 1993 income was just about 293,000 U.S. dollars. The couple's net worth is estimated at no more than 1.6 million U.S. dollars, according to financial disclosure forms. The trustees who will organize the fund-raising effort include Republicans as well as Democrats and they will be headed by the Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, president emeritus of a university, and Nicholas Katzenbach, a former U.S. attorney general. No previous U.S. president has had to face the enormous personal legal expenses confronting President Clinton because of current legal proceedings based on events that allegedly occurred well before he took office, Hesburgh and Katzenbach said in a joint statement. "We believe it is in the public interest to assist the President in meeting a financial burden that could otherwise distract him from performing his public responsibilities," they said in the statement. The trust was established with a 2,000-dollar contribution by the Clintons. All donations will be considered gifts, not income, and the Clintons will incur no tax obligation because of them. The contributions are not deductible for income tax purposes. When all legal issues have been concluded and the trust is terminated, any unused money will be paid to the Clintons, who have agreed to donate it to charity or turn it over to the federal government, according to the lawyers and trustees who briefed reporters. The organizers of the fund said the names and addresses of the donors and amounts donated will be made public every six months.
