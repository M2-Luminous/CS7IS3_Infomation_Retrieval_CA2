According to the deputy prime minister, the Czechs could not be blamed for this state of affairs. On the contrary, the blame was attached to the former Slovak Government, which was not well prepared for negotiations that led to the conclusion of the agreements. Vladimir Dlouhy, Czech minister of industry and trade, had this to say to Czech Radio on the subject: [Begin Dlouhy recording] I would need to know her comments in total. My opinion is, however, that the customs union is advantageous for both sides because it has opened up markets for us more than if we did not have one. I would not like to enter into a discussion about the payment agreement--which, according to press reports, was also contained in the comments made by the deputy prime minister--but, regarding the customs union, I am 100-percent certain that it is advantageous for both sides.
