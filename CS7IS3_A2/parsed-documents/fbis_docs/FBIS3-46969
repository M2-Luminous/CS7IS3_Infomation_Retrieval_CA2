"Our reform and change will now have to take place in the areas where the people's lives are directly involved," President Kim said Friday while presiding over a meeting of cabinet ministers and leaders of civic groups at Chongwadae. "We have succeeded in laying down a broad framework for reform through the disclosures of personal assets of public officials and real-name financial transaction system," Kim said. "From now on, reform will have to be carried out on a broader scale, based on the foundation we laid last year," he said. Reform for the citizens' daily lives, the president explained, should be aimed at establishing a community of an advanced nation, where its efficiency and productivity is maximized and where the people are generally satisfied with their lives. Kim, speaking at New Year's press conference Thursday, laid down the action outline for his administration: "The government must be able to visibly reduce all forms of inconvenience to citizens with a spirit of service. It must also seek out and help people in need." It was obviously a step forward for President Kim, who must have realized that he could not go on receiving popular support of the people by just continuing his campaign to wipe out corruption and official irregularities. His administration has to work for positive results that could immediately be felt by the people. "Reform for living," Kim told Friday's meeting, "is directly connected with the welfare of the people." The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang, his cabinet, heads of government agencies, provincial governors and leaders of large private social organizations. What President Kim was saying was that since he completed diagonosis of "the Korean disease" in the first year of his administration, he has to start curing it through a brave and determined series of operations. His administration has to work to offer its people a safer, cleaner environment to live, an environment for pleasant living. President also wants to build a much more orderly and honest society and help the people change their way of thinking and give them a proper and correct sense of values in life. "We cannot join the ranks of advanced nations," Kim said, "unless we have got rid of large man-made disasters, waste disposal problems, crime and violence, drugs and juvenile crimes, conspicuous and wasteful spendings on luxurious things, traffic congestion and collective selfishness. All citizens should come to realize that law and order are meaningful only when they are observed by them, and freedom and individual rights can be enjoyed only after they have carried out their duty and responsibility," he said.
