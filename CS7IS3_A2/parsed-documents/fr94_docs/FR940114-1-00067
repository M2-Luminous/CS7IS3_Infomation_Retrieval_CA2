FR940114-1-00067 FR940114-1-00014 The requirement at FAR 19.702(a)(1) for submission of a subcontracting plan by only the apparently successful offeror does not apply to GSA negotiated solicitations when the contract is expected to exceed $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction). Except for acquisitions of leasehold interests in real property using expedited procedures and those offering minimal subcontracting opportunities, negotiated solicitations shall require submission with the initial offer of a subcontracting plan in the format described in FAR 52.219&hyph;9 by all offerors that are not small business concerns. Where price is the basis for award, such as multiple award schedule contracts, the plan will be evaluated and negotiated along with price. In solicitations requiring technical and management proposals, the subcontracting plan will be included as an evaluation factor or subfactor and negotiated concurrently with the technical, management, and price proposals. 519.705&hyph;4, 519.705&hyph;6, 519.706, and 519.706&hyph;70 [Removed] 4. Section 519.705&hyph;4, 519.705&hyph;6, 519.706, and 519.706&hyph;70 are removed. 5. Section 519.708 is revised to read as follows: 519.708 Solicitation provisions and contract clauses. (a) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 552.219&hyph;72, Notice to Offerors of Subcontracting Plan Requirements, on the cover page of the solicitation if the contract amount is expected to exceed $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction) except for: (1) Acquisitions set aside for small business; (2) Solicitations for personal services; (3) Solicitations for work to be performed outside any state, territory, or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; and (4) Acquisitions of leasehold interests in real property using expedited procedures. (b) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 552.219&hyph;73, Preparation, Submission, and Negotiation of Subcontracting Plans, in negotiated solicitations if the contract amount is expected to exceed $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction) except for: (1) Acquisitions set aside for small business; (2) Solicitations for personal services; (3) Solicitations for work to be performed outside any state, territory, or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; (4) Acquisitions of leasehold interests in real property using expedited procedures; and (5) Solicitations where, in the judgment of the contracting officer, subcontracting opportunities are minimal. (c) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 552.219&hyph;74, Goals for Subcontracting Plan, in sealed bid solicitations if the contract amount is expected to exceed $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction) except for: (1) Acquisitions set aside for small business; (2) Solicitations for personal services; (3) Solicitations for work to be performed outside any state, territory, or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The basic provision should be used when the contracting officer is able to realistically establish target goals. Alternate I should be used when the contracting officer cannot establish realistic target goals.
