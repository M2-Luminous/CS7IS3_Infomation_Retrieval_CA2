Comparison of Proposed BAFs and Potential Final BAFs for Human Health and Wildlife Criteria Bioaccumulation factors for the 20 human health and 4 wildlife criteria in Tables 3 and 4 of the proposed Guidance have been recalculated incorporating the modifications to the BAF methodology discussed above. The BAFs for these chemicals are compared with the proposed BAFs in Tables 3 and 4 of this Notice. In addition, if the changes under consideration in this Notice are incorporated into the final Guidance, the BAF for 1,2,4-Trichlorobenzene would increase from 836 to 1,570. This is significant because 1,2,4-Trichlorobenzene could then be classified as a Bioaccumulative Chemical of Concern (BCC), chemicals with BAFs greater than 1000, which could require special provisions for control as discussed in the proposed Guidance. As in the proposed Guidance, the human health BAFs are calculated using trophic level 4 and assuming a lipid content in fish of 5 percent. The wildlife BAFs are calculated using trophic level 3 or 4 as appropriate for the wildlife species and assuming a lipid content in fish of 7.9 percent. The derivation of the BAFs for the 20 human health criteria, the 4 wildlife criteria, and 1,2,4- Trichlorobenzene are included in the Technical Support Document for Bioaccumulation Factors, July 1994. EPA requests comments on: (1) The BAFs derived using the modifications to the BAF methodology; and (2) the addition of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene to the list of BCCs.
