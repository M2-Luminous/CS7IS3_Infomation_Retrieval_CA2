At the crucial point when the villagers were ready to light the fuse, local public security men opened fire to prevent an explosion occurring. It was learned that on the afternoon of 4 January, villagers from Chentang village, Xiaojinkou town, and the Huicheng district of suburban Huizhou had a dispute with personnel from the Huizhou Administrative Zone government over the issue of the local government taking over rural land for its use. Some 20 villagers from Huicheng district armed with hunting rifles, knives, and two boxes of explosives took a car from the Huizhou urban area to the Jinji administrative district to ask the local government for some 10 miilion yuan in compensation. When three policemen on patrol went to stop them, the angry villagers beat up the three policemen, one of whom was wounded in the head and hospitalized for medical treatment. The 20-odd villagers threatened to return the following day, and demanded administrative committee personnel get the money ready, otherwise, they would level the administrative zone with explosives. Then the villagers left by car. When the Huicheng Administrative Zone government heard the report, it promptly organized the police to deal with any contingencies. Around 1800 the next day, four of the aforesaid villagers arrived at the administrative committee office building carrying hunting rifles and explosives and demanding cash. The Huicheng district work group for improving the social order of Xiaojinkou substation immediately sent 14 public security men to the scene by car. Seeing this, the villagers got their explosives ready quickly, lit cigarettes, and were ready to light the fuse, while threatening to perish together with the public security men in a very tense atmosphere. The local public security men ordered the villagers to put down the explosives, while evacuating citizens; at the same time, they opened fire as a warning. Nevertheless, the villagers with explosives had already pointed their lit cigarettes at the fuse. At this critical moment, local security men opened fire and wounded the villager holding the explosives. At the same time, two other security men dashed up and seized the explosives in the villager's hands, thus succeeding in halting the occurrence of an explosion.
