"We will abstain from using force, unless of course another party launches armed provocations," Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko told AFP. On Friday Crimean deputies voted to restore a 1992 constitution, a move tantamount to a declaration of independence. Ukrainian lawmakers retaliated late Friday, giving the pro-Russian Crimean assembly 10 days to reverse its decision and "conform with the laws and constitution of Ukraine." "I think we will have enough strength, will and self-restraint to find a settlement" to the crisis, Zlenko told AFP. "We will take all the measures based on international law to assure the territorial integrity of the state," he added.
