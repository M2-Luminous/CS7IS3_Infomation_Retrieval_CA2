"This transfer," he said at Friday's [31 December] ceremony, "elicits mixed feelings," because it is not easy to leave the love of your past 40 years. Taking his leave of the Navy, Venturoni took stock of his two years at the top, citing the many tasks -- from Somalia to Albania and the surveillance in the Adriatic still under way -- that have provided useful confirmation of the service's promptness and efficiency but that have also highlighted the need to enhance its amphibian capability. Despite the increased activity and the reduction of resources, Venturoni said, the level of efficiency has been very high, and, confident of being able to maintain it, the Navy has adhered to a number of international cooperation programs such as that for the Italo-Franco-British frigate. "But in the longer term," he stressed, "it will be essential to bring resources into line with requirements if we want to avoid not only failing to meet objectives of efficiency but even irreversibly jeopardizing our operational mechanism." Admiral Mariani highlighted the importance of the valuable legacy of history, attitude, and traditions which Navy personnel both guard and share. "Within society," he said, "there is a strong demand for principles, following the failure of the ethics of success. There are expectations of honesty, of a spirit of service, of dedication to the common good." But Mariani added that another obligation is that to do your job properly -- which will not be easy in view of the limited resources available. It will therefore be necessary to take all possible measures to make the Navy more "economical," developing the skills of its personnel, who remain the cornerstone of the system, in order to have sailors "who are not only capable of standing international comparison but who can constitute a professional reference point for other navies." The tasks facing the Navy, and that it is already carrying out, Mariani continued, are to stabilize the Mediterranean and to work for peace in the international field. Hitherto the Navy has been able to perform them well because it had good ships -- "the result of far-sighted decisions made 20 years earlier. Now many of them are on the decline." So our ships are becoming fewer and older, while financial resources are inadequate, thus preventing the necessary investments. Therefore, "if we want the Navy to be able to continue to perform its tasks efficiently, we must promptly draw up a long-term plan based on reliable hypotheses of availability of financial resources," as happened with the Navy Law of 1974. "It will not be easy to achieve a similar objective at a time of economic crisis," he said. It will therefore be necessary to create broad consensus around the Navy, to make it understood that it "is part of everyone's heritage, and that we are merely its custodians."
