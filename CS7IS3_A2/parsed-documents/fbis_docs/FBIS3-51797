During the regular period of sessions of the National Assembly of the People's Government, it was established that only 31 percent of Cuban state enterprises are profitable and that subsidies totaled 4.6 billion pesos--that is, 73 percent more than in 1989--during 1993. Despite the fact that external factors are negatively affecting the island, it is a fact that efficiency must increase at all levels, and financial discipline must improve. The subsidies to which some unprofitable enterprises became accustomed have an unfavorable effect on labor productivity and labor discipline [words indistinct], because in Cuba there is a very flexible labor legislation that does not contemplate different remunerations concerning each individual's contribution for a same profession. Things will change this year, at least as far as subsidies are concerned, if we observe the statements made by Finance Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez, who explained recently that to grant subsidies, the financial situation of organizations and enterprises will be examined. The entities showing deficits will be forced more than ever to collect their accounts receivable, prior to requesting subsidies from the state budget. Up until last September the business sector had 2.8 billion pesos in accounts receivable, a factor that results in difficulties and the ensuing diversion of resources. Authorities and Cuban unions are certain the irregularities in the collections and payments [words indistinct] enterprises generate discipline and [words indistinct]. As part of the people's democracy inherent to the indigenous social product, the unions will decide once more, however, [words indistinct] this time, it consists of overseeing in situ how the payments imbalance among enterprises are resolved. Cuban workers [words indistinct] the battle of all society to reduce and eradicate unprofitability of a group of entities [words indistinct].
