[Al-Mallah] Israel is still procrastinating. I cannot see it being serious in the negotiations, particularly on the Syrian track. Israel dallies in the negotiations with Syria. I am therefore not very optimistic about progress in the negotiations on the Syrian track, but Syria is serious about the peace process in accordance with the basis on which we participated in the Madrid conference. President Hafiz al-Asad emphasized at the Geneva summit that Syria is ready for full and comprehensive peace in return for full withdrawal and that peace is Syria's strategic option. Syria is serious about that. [Humaydi] After the Oslo agreement and the developments on the Jordanian track, how do you view Arab coordination? [Al-Mallah] Regrettably, coordination is not at the required level. There should have been full and effective coordination between all parties concerned with the peace process. There can be no doubt that the present Arab situation is not reassuring. [Humaydi] In your view, what effect does this have on the Syrian track? [Al-Mallah] Any separate agreement would ultimately affect the entire peace process but Syria has fixed principles in its dealings. No separate agreement between Jordan and Israel would affect the Syrian position because that position is clear. Syria wants full withdrawal in return for full peace. I do not believe a Jordanian-Israeli agreement would change anything as far as negotiations between Syria and Israel are concerned. [passage omitted]
