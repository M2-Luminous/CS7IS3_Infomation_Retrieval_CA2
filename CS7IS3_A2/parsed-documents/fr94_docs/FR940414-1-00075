FR940414-1-00075 FR940414-1-00010 Second, to estimate secondary employment impacts, EPA used a worst-case regional impact multiplier from the Regional Input-Output Modeling System developed by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) within the Department of Commerce. BEA publishes state-level employment multipliers by industry classifications. For this analysis, EPA used the highest state-level employment multiplier applicable to the Chemical and Petroleum Refining Industry, the 2-digit BEA industry that is most likely to include facilities engaged in PFPR business. The highest total employment impact multiplier reported by BEA is for the state of Texas and has a value of 9.20. Third, EPA assumed that all of the direct impact employment losses that are not directly accounted for by the affected sample observations would occur at the known locations of the affected sample facilities in proportion to sample facility weights. Thus, all of the facilities that are represented by an affected sample facility, and their associated employment losses, are assumed to occur at the same location as the affected sample facility. This assumption regarding the locational distribution of facility impacts is also expected to overstate employment losses in each metropolitan statistical area (MSA), because the non-sample facility impacts would likely be distributed among other MSAs that are unknown. Using these highly unrealistic conservative assumptions, EPA found that Option 3/S is unlikely to result in significant employment impacts at the community level. Specifically, the largest weighted aggregate employment impact under this analysis is associated with an MSA in the state of Minnesota. The estimated sample facility-based employment loss in the MSA is 37.2 FTEs. The sample weight associated with this facility is 4.9, meaning that, in the impact analysis, the facility represents itself plus 3.9 other facilities in the underlying PFPR facility population whose locations may not be estimated. Applying the sample weight brings the primary employment impact to 181.0. Further, applying the industry impact multiplier for Texas of 9.20 brings the weighted aggregate employment impact to 1,665.2 full-time equivalent employment positions. This unrealistically high value exceeds all the other simulated MSA-level impacts by nearly a factor of three. Although this value also yields the highest percentage loss in MSA employment, at 0.1181 percent, it is still less than one-eighth of the one percent significant impact threshold (see Table 10). The next highest percentage employment impacts are 0.0738 percent, in Missouri, and 0.0656 percent, in Texas, or approximately 1/14th and 1/15th of the one percent impact threshold, respectively. Even using highly unrealistic assumptions, this analysis finds that Option 3/S would not likely cause a significant loss of employment in any affected MSA.
