The decision was made at a meeting of working-level officials from relevant government offices. It was presided over by Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong. The meeting did not set the time of China trip liberalization, but an informed source said the time would possibly be two months later, the end of March. "At the meeting, attendees agreed to liberalize South Koreans' travels to China at the soonest early date and left the determining of the time to the Foreign Ministry," an official said. He added that to facilitate free trips to China, there should first be some security precautionary measures such as steps to keep people from illegally entering North Korea by way of China. "Given the time needed to prepare such steps, we believe travels to China could be liberalized toward the end of March," he said. Presently, a person wishing to visit China, Cuba, Laos or Cambodia should obtain an invitation from an organization or firm of the country he likes to visit and then obtain a government permit to go.
