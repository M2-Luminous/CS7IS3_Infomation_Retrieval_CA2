With seven months remaining before the institutionalization of the Common Market of the South (Mercosur), Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero recently defended the Brazilian role as a "global trader," and argued that "the regional level is less attractive" for the country. He said integration into the Southern Cone is still a priority for Itamaraty "as long as it promotes an open regional organization with a liberalizing outlook." According to Denot Medeiros, the Brazilian under secretary for integration, Brazil has adopted "a dose of pragmatism and realism" in its foreign policy. He defines the various areas of Brazilian foreign trade policy as "concentric circles." Mercosur fits within the South American Free Trade Area (SAFTA), which in turn fits within hemispheric integration. Medeiros noted, however, that Brazil is "neither interested in, nor capable" of now joining the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Medeiros assigned the same degree of priority to both SAFTA and Mercosur, a position which is different from that conveyed by Rubens Barbosa, who was in charge of integration until late last year. Barbosa said "Mercosur continues to be the priority for Brazilian foreign trade policy" and that, despite reflecting a very significant idea both politically and economically, SAFTA should be left for the next government. "A growing priority is being assigned to Mercosur," Barbosa said. Professor Paulo Casella, the creator of a course on economic integration law at Sao Paulo University, has identified the first signs of change in Itamaraty's policy, and criticized the lack of consistency. He said: "No program may be left entirely to political intiative because politics is extremely volatile." He added that there is "a risk of wasting many years of effort." The revision in Brazilian foreign trade policy has taken place following the Uruuguay Round of the GATT talks, that is, since GATT approved a global trade policy. The reduction of import duties reduced the significance of regionalization. In Casella's opinion, "Mercosur is in no way a straitjacket." The American Chamber of Commerce, which consists of more than 800 affiliated companies, does not view NAFTA as a stumbling block for the Brazilian global strategy, either. "One can move on all fronts at the same time," argues journalist Brian Nicholson, who wrote an editorial commentary entitled "Today the World; Tomorrow NAFTA?" published recently in a bulletin of the Chamber. Ricupero said the diversification of Brazilian foreign trade has been "impressive." Brazilian trade can be broken down as follows: 26 percent with Europe, 24 percent with Latin America, 20 percent with the United States, and 16 percent with Japan and Asia. He noted that there are 200 significant export items. Medeiros said "the idea that multilateralism and regionalism are incompatible is false." He noted, however, that this is true as long as there is "a liberalizing regionalism."
