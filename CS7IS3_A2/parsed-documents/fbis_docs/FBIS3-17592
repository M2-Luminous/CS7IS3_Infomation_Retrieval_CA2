[Correspondent] About 1,000 Liberal Democrats of the north-west gathered in the St. Petersburg Hotel, opposite the Aurora on its permanent mooring. Some rows were full of naval officers. [passage omitted] Zhirinovskiy was very optimistic about the prospects for his party in Petersburg. [video shows correspondent interviewing Vladimir Zhirinovskiy] [Begin recording] [Correspondent] How strong is support for you here in St. Petersburg, and what sort of structure do you intend to set up here? [Zhirinovskiy] Well, the second thing... [pauses] this is the main assistance for our party in Russia. We have paid a lot of attention to Petersburg and the oblast, and today we are holding a conference of representatives of [word indistinct] organizations, we are appointing a new leadership. [end recording] [Correspondent] The Liberal Democrats, it seems, are taking the region seriously. Zhirinovskiy's people have met in St. Petersburg at the most critical moment, when it is still unclear whether the St. Petersburg city assembly elections will be acknowledged as valid. If the elections were to be recognized as valid, the Liberal Democrats would not get a single seat in the city Duma, and over half the seats would go to democratically-oriented blocs.
