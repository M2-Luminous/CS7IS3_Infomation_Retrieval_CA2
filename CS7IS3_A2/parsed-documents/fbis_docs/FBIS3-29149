[passage omitted on exchange rates] Some dealers reported the Bank of Japan was selling the yen to shore up the falling dollar. The dollar's plunge follows the overnight trend in New York, where the U.S. currency plummeted to 101.10 yen at one point, nearing the record low in New York of 100.85 yen set on August 17. Dealers said market participants are betting on the yen rising further as the U.S. Government is likely to seek a stronger yen as a means of redressing the chronic trade imbalance between Japan and the United States. Expectations of a stronger yen emerged after Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton failed to resolve a trade row at their weekend summit in Washington. Dealers said comments by Laura Tyson, chairwoman of the U.S. Council of Economic Advisers, also helped spark the dollar-selling.
