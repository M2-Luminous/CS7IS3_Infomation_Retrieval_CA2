[Chiapas], 5 May -- Tense and anxious cattle owners, tradesmen, and businessmen have asked presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo to strive for a vigorous legal recovery that will allow peace negotiations to end the "painful path" that let impunity reign over justice. Although the presidential candidate acknowledged that the conflict "has placed injustice above justice," he praised the resumption of the negotiations between the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN), whom he called for the first time by its real name, and Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis. Zedillo's proselytizing campaign in Chiapas was used to support the gubernatorial candidate of the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party], Eduardo Robledo Rincon. The security surrounding the candidates was low-profile. They visited a radio station in Tapachula and attended a rally along with fellow PRI members. Later, he attended a feast at the Montecarlos Room of the Flamboyant Hotel. A communique signed by Manuel Camacho Solis and Bishop Samuel Ruiz was made public in San Cristobal de las Casas, which is less than three hours from Tuxtla. The communique announced that the negotiations will resume. The cattle owners were expecting a strong response to their demands. Alberto Marin, president of the Northern Zone Cattle Owners Union, told reporters that cattle owners will hand Ernesto Zedillo a document stating that nothing tangible has been done so far to honor the commitments made during the 16 May [as published] meeting with the Army chief to solve the problem of 150,000 hectares in the municipalities of Altamirano, Ocosingo, and Margaritas. The cattle owner leader said: "Nothing has been done." He added that economic losses in the region affected by the armed conflict amount to 300 billion old pesos [currency as published]. He added that it is still a delicate situation and that 30 percent of the state's livestock owners are virtually idle, a situation that sooner or later will prompt the import of not only meat and milk but also corn. These comments flew from one table to another as the meal in honor of Ernesto Zedillo was being served. The cattle owners could barely taste the chicken breast with vegetables that was being served. The claims of those who are on the other side of the Chiapas conflict were harsh. Gonzalo Lopez Camacho, president of the Center Zone Cattle Owners Union, noted Zedillo's views on lack of security and said that Chiapas cattle owners have travelled a painful road full of offal, assaults, kidnappings, and robberies. This situation requires agreements that, in addition to reaching peace, "will fairly recognize the efforts made by the state's productive sectors" to ensure the forces hampering production will wane. The cattle owners representative supported Eduardo Robledo's candidacy. He said Robledo will reestablish the rights of the Chiapas residents without controversies or violence. He insisted, however, that the despoiling attempts against the patrimony of many Chiapas residents are in the hands of "intellectually deprived individuals who are currently hiding behind impunity." Francisco Gutierrez, leader of the National Association of the Processing Industry, made a rough estimate of underdevelopment in Chiapas, to which he added the expectations of movements that sow division and violence. He strongly criticized the federal government for its mismanagement of the state developmental process and insisted industrialists need security for their families and assets. Tradesmen leader Walter Leon said they are tired of hearing promises and are no longer willing to live with the dream that Chiapas residents are potentially rich although they live poorly. The Chiapas production sectors waited until Zedillo spoke. They showed no sign of being overwhelmingly jubilant. He said: "I know that the conflict has unfortunately piled injustice upon injustice. I hope tolerance, dialogue, and reconciliation will prevail to ensure that the final results of the negotiations will fairly meet legitimate demands. The agreements must also be fair to ensure that those who obey the laws, but whose personal lineage and patrimonial integrity have been affected, will be respected." Zedillo then talked about the upcoming resumption of the peace negotiations and pointed out that the institutions have shown determination to reach an agreement to enjoy a lasting peace once again. He added: "As a candidate today and as president tomorrow, I am determined to honor all the commitments that our patriotic President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will make in the name of peace." Very early in Tapachula and through the XEKQ radio station, Ernesto Zedillo sent a message to the EZLN and said: "We want peace to be signed and will honor the commitments made during the process to ensure that Chiapas residents and all Mexicans will learn that peace is the road to follow." Some observers who are closely following the Zedillo campaign said he sounded different from the PRI candidate because he was heard through the local sound system sometimes saying "Shapas" and "Shapas residents." Perhaps, there was something wrong with the sound system. The PRI ceremony had a second meaning in Tapachula: to see Zedillo supporting Eduardo Robledo. Amid rattling noises and cheerful slogans such as "You are on the right track, Zedillo; you are on the right track," Chiapas PRI President Gerardo Pensamiento delivered a speech different from those he usually makes. At the beginning of the speech, he said: "You are among Chiapas friends, who are asking you not to make more commitments; we are merely asking you for what we have already been promised but which have never been honored." At the Tapachulas Country Club, the delivery of caps and t-shirts commanded the attention of the attendees for a long time. Security agents drove reporters away. When ordered to, two agents virtually flew to the dais to switch the microphones that Zedillo would use. Igor [not further identified] led a horde of reporters who wanted to make sure they would have access to the pro-Zedillo ceremony, but a Staff agent stopped him and they verbally abused each other. Those Tapachula residents who witnessed the incident said: "If this is what they do to the media, what will they do to us?" Zedillo and Robledo embraced, and their followers filled the square. Robledo stressed that Chiapas demands a political proposal that will not blame anyone or seek revenge. He said: "I came here to defend those colors that have already been whitened; the colors of personal resentment are among them."
