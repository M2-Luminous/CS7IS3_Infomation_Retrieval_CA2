In addition, the sources said, representatives of the agency and the Russian Defense Ministry will meet in Tokyo in early February for a second round of official consultations on security matters following a similar meeting in Moscow in June 1992. The working-level talks with China, which will be attended by defense officials and ranking members of the Self-Defense Forces and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, are the first since the visit of China's defense minister in 1984. Following a trip to China by then Defense Agency Chief Yuko Kurihara in 1987, regular working-level defense talks were envisaged, but the plans were suspended after Beijing's military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators at the Tiananmen Square in June 1989. Tokyo, however, decided to go ahead with the original project after Washington and Beijing resumed defense talks with the visit of a senior Pentagon official to China last autumn, the sources said. The defense talks come at a time of allegations that China's long-time ally North Korea is pursuing a nuclear weapons development program. "Through dialogue with other countries such as China and Russia, we aim not only at fostering mutual understanding, but also at making sure that Japan has a say concerning North Korea's alleged nuclear development," a Defense Agency source said. The talks also reflect the agency's efforts to launch a broader security dialogue with Asian neighbors to revise outdated Cold War defense patterns, the sources said. Defense consultations with Russia will therefore focus on security guarantees and be upgraded to section chief level, the sources said. In line with more active military exchanges to build trust in the Asia-Pacific region, Japan will see the first ever visit by an incumbent South Korean defense minister at the end of March, the sources said.
