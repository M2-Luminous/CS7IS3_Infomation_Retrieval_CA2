Following the appointment of a special coordinator, the State Department issued a notice enforcing the use of The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia for Skopje. Foivos Karzis has the following report: [Begin Foivos Karsis recording] The State Department notice actually prohibits its officials from mentioning Skopje using the name of Macedonia under the pretext of brevity or simplification. The Greek Government is obviously satisfied with this development, since it sees this as a continuation of a positive climate that prevails in Washington, such as the appointment of Mr. Matthew Nimetz as the State Department's special envoy. [end recording] Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou also made a statement on the importance of the State Department notice to our correspondent Nina Asimakopoulou. [Begin recording] [Papandreou] The significance is that our country's sensitivity toward this problem is recognized in the most official way by the United States. If one combines this with President Clinton's latest announcement that he would not establish diplomatic relations with the FYROM until Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou visits the United States, and with the announcement that Mr. Nimetz has been appointed U.S. special envoy, then we can see the U.S. political will to contribute positively toward the efforts for a just solution to this problem. [Asimakopoulou] Do you believe that the Greek Government's measures have brought about results? [Papandreou] I believe that they have received the message that Greece considers this issue a very serious one, as we have been indicating for months during our contacts and discussions. This has been achieved not only by the Greek Government, but citizens of the United States have also played a significant role. [end recording] The government spokesman also described the U.S. State Department decision as positive and noted that similar developments also took place in Australia, where the government decided that, until the dispute over the Skopje name is resolved, the Skopjeans will be officially called Slavomacedonians. These moves by Washington also show a clear [word indistinct] of the climate that the U.S. Government desires to formulate in view of the prime minister's upcoming visit to the White House. Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou will leave for the United States tomorrow to prepare for the prime minister's visit. [passage omitted]
