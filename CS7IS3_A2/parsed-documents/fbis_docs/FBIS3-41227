This money entered Ecuador without any control, according to the Interpol report on the activities in Ecuador of the Colombian Montenegro Freire gang, which has been broken up by the police. According to investigations into the participation of two police officers in the money launderers' illicit activities, Jativa Sotomayor not only received the "fee" listed above, which was arranged in advance, but every so often he also received special bonus payments from the leader of the criminal organization, Humberto Montenegro Freire, who often came to Ecuador to monitor his illegal business ventures, in which his siblings, Fernando Javier, Juan Carlos, Liana Elizabeth, and Maria Cecilia Montenegro Freire, were also involved. To carry out his task, this officer had the services of Quito customs appraiser Victor Hugo Valdiviezo, best known by his nickname of "Tocayo," who was also paid large amounts of money in dollars to avoid customs inspections. This man is now a fugitive. Hundreds of Thousands of Dollars It is estimated that in the last two years the Colombian drug dealers paid the lieutenant more than $50,000 to allow this dirty money to enter freely, which "was coming in growing amounts with great frequency. It was hundreds of thousands of dollars," says the police report. Two months ago Jativa was paid $7,000, which he used to buy a Hyundai Pony from the "Autos y Carros" dealership owned by the now arrested Montenegro Freire family. On an earlier occasion, drug dealer Humberto Montenegro gave a pistol and a collection of dollars to Jessica Menendez, the officer's wife. Finally, Jativa somehow learned of "Operation Azteca" and decided to extort $10,000 from the drug dealers, supposedly to halt the investigation. Protection According to the investigations, it is possible that the police officers who have been arrested may also have provided protection to the money launderers' business activities by passing on material intended solely for police use, for which it is assumed that they were paid. At the "Autos y Carros" dealership the police found three teargas canisters of the 515 CS type, two Stun grenades, a Truflite carbine teargas canister, and a handgrenade simulator. At the house at 258 Calle Hidalgo de Pinto, where 11 of the persons implicated in the "Azteca" group were arrested, another teargas canister was found. All these items are intended solely for police use. Accomplices The other officer, Second Lieutenant Wilson Marcelo Salgado Guzman, was apprehended during the night of Tuesday, 28 December at the Montenegros' residence. The report states that he was a close friend of the family and knew of their illegal activities. He was the person responsible for the removal of the suitcases containing dirty money. He also accompanied the local head of the group, Fernando Montenegro, on two trips to Colombia to bring in contraband merchandise. When he was on guard duty, he even allowed Fernando Montenegro access to the San Antonio Hacienda near Santo Domingo de los Colorados, confiscated from Jorge Hugo Reyes Torres. He also kept in his possession a 9-mm pistol that Fernando Montenegro gave him. Captain Fernando Navarro, as a loan, received a chrome-plated 9-mm Baretta from the local head of the "Azteca" group. He kept this weapon for nine months, and only returned it in response to pressure from a superior officer, whose name was not released. Concerning this officer, the report says: "Navarro knew that Fernando Montenegro had this weapon in his possession and did nothing about it, thus failing to fulfill his legal obligation."
