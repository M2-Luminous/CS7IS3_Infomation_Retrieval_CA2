The Center for Radiation and Nuclear Safety says that it has been in telephone contact with the nuclear power station in Kola. The station's chief engineer said nothing exceptional had taken place in the station this week. The German news agency DPA and AFP of France, quoting ITAR-TASS, reported that the third reactor at the Kola nuclear power station had had to be closed down. The reason given was unusual steam in the station building.
