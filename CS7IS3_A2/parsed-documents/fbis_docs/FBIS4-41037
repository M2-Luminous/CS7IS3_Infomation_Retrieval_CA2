We are choosing the way for us to move forward. We are deciding the fate of our country in the very near future and after. Our country, whose independence was secured by scores of generations of our compatriots in suffering, has not yet become our homeland as we had hoped. The state is actually in debt to our people and this debt is mounting up, rather than going down. We know that we are owed in terms of our bank deposits, in terms of payments for agricultural produce, and in terms of (?our bonds). We are in fact being deprived of the right to work worthily to produce goods, to be able to feed our children and elderly, and after many years of work to keep our money in savings. Citizens today, unfortunately, are being deprived of the possibility to receive adequate medical treatment, to study, and to be provided with the bare essentials. Our work is still being paid for by monetary substitutes, rather than money. The laws on paying wages, pensions and grants are de facto being violated in our state. The state is not providing full and timely financial support for our country's invalids, servicemen, and orphans. Country people are not being paid in time. All these are our country's and our state's debts to our people. People are dreaming about their own enterprises. They are waiting for what they were promised. Meanwhile, money, foreign currency, and some of the most valuable assets are being taken away from enterprises. The state of the peasantry, this basis of our country, is particularly poor. Today, they do not even have the right to their own plot of land where their fathers and grandfathers lived. The inactivity of state law enforcement agencies is provoking among people mistrust in the authorities and uncertainty in the morrow, which will lead to social instability. Today we need strong power and a well-chartered course, which would lead us to normalizing the situation in the midst of our country and putting an end to social, political, and regional conflicts. What I am planning to do is this: We need to bring in the principle of social justice in society, which is the main thing, and to make the economy effective for the sake of our people's well-being. People must be able to work freely and earn what they have earned, while the state must make adequate financial provision for those unable to work. Our task, in fact, is to restore our production, curb the crisis, and stabilize prices, wages, and money. Everything should be done for enterprises to work and be profitable. To that end, we will above all expand enterprises' rights, cut taxes, and provide broad opportunities for them to trade and export their products, given the mandatory return of the foreign currency earned to our Ukraine. We must also create conditions that guarantee trade and settlements with Russia in order for us to implement joint projects together, thus providing additional contracts for our enterprises. By means of steps such as these, it will be possible in as short a time as 10 months to stabilize our prices, considerably increase budgetary revenues, cut credit interest rates, and (?consolidate) our currency. It is, however, impossible to pull out of the crisis without improving the state of affairs in agriculture. We must by all means turn our attention to the peasantry and create conditions for them to work. With this aim, there should be stable prices, payment for produce should be guaranteed, every service required by the peasantry should be provided for them,and we should make everybody the master of their land and the master of their farms. Their right of ownership of their money incomes should be protected and their bank deposits guaranteed so that the peasantry can accumulate their wealth and their property and be certain about their future. Overcoming the crisis will make it possible, in my view, in as short a time as one year to raise average wages and pensions by four- to five-fold. It is only then that we will see some return in work by the people and respect for our state. In the first few weeks of my presidential rule, I will return to the people what the state owes them. We will compensate them for their losses from the devaluation of their money in bank savings. The people will be given real and equal rights in privatizing enterprises and will then have additional incomes from owning these enterprises. We will enhance the value of morality in our society and begin by changing our attitude toward children, invalids, women, and elderly, i.e. those unable to protect themselves. To that end, we will introduce new forms of social benefits by increasing budgetary revenues. Primarily, it will be monthly payments for every child until it reaches the age of 17. Second, we will provide special medicines and ecologically safe products for those who suffered as the result of Chernobyl or who live in contaminated areas. Third, we will increase pensions in real terms in order to compensate the people in full for their health that has deteriorated, or the life that has been lost. The state will also provide all invalids with social (?security), which is our moral duty. We will create normal conditions for invalids to live and communicate properly and actively. None of this can be achieved without reforming state power. This primarily applies to the president of Ukraine. He will be entirely responsible for the state of affairs in our country and for actions by executive power. We have had enough of shifting responsibility on to the premier. We will also carry out a judicial reform and form a judicial power (?which) would ensure that law is implemented in society and would supervise both the president and the Supreme Council and other establishments. The division of power, awaited by all of us, must take place at national, regional, and local levels. Regions must be given the right to settle social and economic issues on their territory independently; with this aim they must have a stable budgetary basis and taxation, and regulate on their territory both the production and investment types of activity. We will resolve the issue of political and economic powers with the Republic of Crimea in order to enable Crimea's population to live a rich and free life in our country, at the same time as ensuring the constancy of its borders and the integrity of its territory. We believe that a system of local self-government should allow people democratically to influence their life, for the land that is being distributed regionally and locally out there, and for the communal property and funds to be used for the needs of the people that live there [sentence as heard]. Russian, Tartar, Polish, and German people and other nationalities will live in our country, being proud of their Ukrainian citizenship. I am certain that the only way for us is to become a rich European state. I believe in the Ukrainian people's power and strength. We know what we want. So let us take hold of this and decide our future ourselves.
