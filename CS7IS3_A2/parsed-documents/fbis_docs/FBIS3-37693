During the meeting with Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky, the parties talked not only about bilateral relations, but also about the Yugoslav crisis. Despite a wish to please NATO, so desirable to the countries of the Visegrad Four, Hungary is not inclined to support the bombing of Serb artillery. Serbs and Croats are its closest neighbors. Any escalation of the conflict will result in thousands of refugees and the instability on the border. Meanwhile the economic blockade of the former Yugoslavia has already cost Hungary $1.0003 billion. The Hungarian position is therefore close to the Russian one, and this was reaffirmed by the two ministers. However, their approach to the expansion of NATO remains different. The Partnership for Peace is seen in Budapest as a first step toward NATO membership. However, Hungarians realize that they would need enormous financial means, as well as time, in order to join NATO. Tomorrow Andrey Kozyrev will continue his talks with Hungarian leaders.
