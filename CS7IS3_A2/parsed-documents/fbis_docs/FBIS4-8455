In response to recent statements by Hungarian Premier Peter Boross that he considered himself the spiritual premier of even those Hungarians living outside the state's borders, Kukan pointed out that elections are looming in Hungary and all means are being employed to win votes. "I understand that to mean that he has in mind some kind of spiritual leadership. As far as I know, in the same speech he also said that Hungary respected its current borders. And from our point of view, that is decisive," Kukan said. The recently deposed government of Vladimir Meciar reacted to similar statements by Boross' deceased predecessor, Jozsef Antall, with an anxiety that led it to challenge the loyalty of the approximately 600,000 ethnic Hungarians living in Slovakia, and to charge Hungarian leaders with irredentism, which contributed to a worsening of relations between Budapest and Bratislava. "For the normal development of good neighborly relations with Hungary, inviolability of the border is the basic question from which stems everything else," Kukan said, adding that this question can be answered once and for all if Budapest displays in its "willingness to discuss and to leave doors open" the same accommodating spirit as Bratislava. "If we can solve the question of the inviolability of the border in a way that satisfies Slovak interests, our relations with our Hungarian neighbors can develop normally," Kukan said.
