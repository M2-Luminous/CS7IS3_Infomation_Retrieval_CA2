The depoliticization of the Bulgarian Army, its transformation into an army which defends the state's interests, is one of the greatest achievements of democratic Bulgaria since 1989, he said. This, the president explained, paves the way for the creation of a national army proper, that would defend this country's independence and territorial integrity. The reform in the Bulgarian Army is part of the general process of reforms in this country, the president pointed out. However, he added that in that Bulgaria "lags far behind." The delay of economic reforms not only prevents the finding of solutions to the most pressing social issues; it also prevents the creation of prerequisites and means for a radical reform in the armed forces, he said. He also pointed out that national security is a top priority in Bulgaria's national interests, and the Bulgarian Army is one of the main pillars of national security. Although the diplomats will do everything possible to prevent Bulgaria from being drawn into a conflict, the army should be ready, if necessary, to defend this country's sovereignty and territorial integrity, said the president. He believes that in the course of the reform the army should retain its fighting capacity and readiness. According to the president, the goal now is a new army: smaller in number, better trained, armed with less weapons, but of higher quality. The modernization of the army, the improvement of its fighting efficiency is a task to be taken on by the whole society, the president said in conclusion.
