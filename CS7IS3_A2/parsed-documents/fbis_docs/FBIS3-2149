What is he going to say? Top government leaders seem to be in great fear now. And in case no appearance is made, stock prices in Hong Kong would fall drastically. The night view from the rotating restaurant on the 41st floor of the New Jinjiang Hotel, a top-class hotel in central Shanghai, is certainly excellent. WEN WEI PO, the Chinese-affiliated Hong Kong paper, published an exclusive report in its 10 January issue on a visit to this hotel by Deng Xiaoping, China's strongest man, on New Year's Day. Chinese newspapers and TV have never reported such doings of Deng. In this connection, I promptly took action to confirm this report. While saying he was told to keep it secret, a hotel employee said excitedly: "Yes, I did see him. They was sitting near the window, enjoying both French cuisine and the night view." It has become an established custom for Deng to greet the Spring Festival (the Lunar New Year which falls on 10 February this year) in Shanghai for the past seven years. "For Further Emancipating the Mind" Deng's appearance at the New Year's party televised on Spring Festival eve has become the only chance to confirm the health of the key person who controls China, which has a population of 1.2 billion. Moreover, his remarks in Shanghai, known as the "Shanghai Talks," have become more influential than the Constitution. Regarding his recent arrival in Shanghai, I have obtained information, from "a source," that "he had arrived in Shanghai 10 December (last year)." In mid-December, there appeared in the city a large board, 4 meters wide by 3 meters long, which says: "Development Conforms Well to Reason -- Deng Xiaoping." The board was put up on a major street about 500 meters from the Xijiao Hotel, where Deng Xiaoping regularly stays. This street leads to the Pudong Development Area, which is under development based on the national policy and where Deng Xiaoping has visited several times for inspections. The Xijiao Hotel, located not far from the Shanghai Airport, is usually available for foreigners. You will see hotel buildings and restaurants here and there in a large area. When I tried to enter this area by car, I was stopped by a policeman, who said: "Under construction now. It is off limits until the end of the Spring Festival." In replying to my question as to whether Mr. Deng is staying there, he smilingly said: "I cannot answer your question." There is no mistake about his staying there. A company clerk, who is 42 years old and belongs to the Red Guards generation of the Great Cultural Revolution, said: "During the Great Cultural Revolution, schools were closed and the Chinese people tried to kill one another. We were fed up with it. Thanks to Deng Xiaoping, our livelihood has become better. I hope he will live long." As his remarks indicate, Deng Xiaoping enjoys high appraisal among Shanghai citizens. So far, Shanghai has paid taxes to the central government. However, the city could do nothing about its basic investment in improving its infrastructure. And it was Deng Xiaoping who gave the go-ahead for the projects, which cost huge amounts of money and based on the national program. For Deng Xiaoping, Shanghai is filled with personal memories. He spends Spring Festival in Shanghai because it is warmer than Beijing and also because he wants to pick out talented people who are qualified to work in the central government. Both state President Jiang Zemin and Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, who has been entrusted with the responsibility of managing economic affairs, have obtained their rather unusual promotions because of their administrative abilities while serving as Shanghai mayor. JIEFANG RIBAO, the municipal Communist Party committee organ, frontpaged an article entitled "For Further Emancipating the Mind" in its 13 January issue. There is no mistake that this article states principles based on a good understanding of Deng's ideas. The vice premier and others are making efforts to put the brakes on the over-heated enthusiasm in economic activities. What will become of their efforts after this year's "Shanghai Talks" have been delivered? Attention is now concentrated on the Spring Festival party on the evening of 9 February. To tell the truth, I have obtained unconfirmed information that those scenes to be shown on TV "have already been videotaped." As for this party's location, it is a secret that has never been announced in the past. Reportedly, a visitor to a certain hotel in the city, but not the Xijiao Hotel, said he saw a lady who looks very much like Xiao Rong, Deng Xiaoping's third daughter. Xiao Rong has acted as sort of a "hearing aid" for her father, who has become hard of hearing. Construction work is now under way at this hotel for remodeling the entrance and the construction is expected to be completed before the Spring Festival. There is a great possibility that the party will be held at this hotel.
