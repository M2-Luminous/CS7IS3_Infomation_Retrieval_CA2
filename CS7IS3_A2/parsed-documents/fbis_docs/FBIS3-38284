The stronger it gets internally, the less willing to commit itself externally it seems to become. In his recent State of the Union Address, Bill Clinton listed his reasons to be satisfied, all of which were of an internal nature. Growth now seems assured, consumer and entrepreneur confidence indicators are rising, over 1.5 billion jobs have been created in one year, inflation remains under control, the budget deficit will be cut as soon as next year, and interest rates are at a low ebb. A look at its traditional evils -- especially crime -- must not hide the fact that America is in a strong position in this age of global economic competition. It is then all the more surprising to witness the timid way in which the United States has been exercising its leadership abroad. Mr. Clinton can boast no foreign policy achievement. As for Bosnia, the U.S. President only -- almost casually -- mentioned that the United States could be proud of devising, for humanitarian purposes, "the longest air lift in human memory." A rather inadequate contribution considering that this is a conflict which dents NATO's credibility, mocks the United Nations Organization, and has already claimed over 100,000 lives. The U.S. Administration justifies its aloofness with two arguments. Exerting pressure to stop the fighting at a time when the Muslims have been regaining some ground would be unfair to them -- they were sorely provoked, after all -- and would not lead to a workable solution. Indeed, while the United States has undertaken to contribute to the peacekeeping force should the Muslims, Croats, and Serbs come to an agreement, it wants such troops to secure peace, not to have to force it upon the belligerents, which means that the agreement would have to be concluded in good faith, a highly unlikely proposition. To demand such an agreement -- which is what the Americans have been doing -- is therefore almost akin to a manifesto of non-involvement. Routed in Haiti, battered in Somalia, the U.S. Administration has been equally luckless with a "Russian policy" which it had almost exclusively based on a reformist current which has just vanished from Boris Yeltsin's new government. Coming after those half-failures, its refusal to commit itself in Bosnia puts the finishing touches to the paradoxical face of an America which is willing to exercise its leadership in the economic sphere -- GATT, NAFTA -- but no longer in the political one.
