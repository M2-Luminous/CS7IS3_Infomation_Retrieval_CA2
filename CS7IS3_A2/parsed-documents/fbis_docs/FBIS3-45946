General Secretary Do Muoi gave a report to sum up the work over the past two and a half years and set down the tasks for the next two and a half years. The report said the achievements have been made mainly in three areas, including a very important initial step in overcoming the socio-economic crisis, continued political stability and expanded foreign ties with other countries. Vietnam began a reform program in 1989, switching from a planned economy to a socialist market system. Do Muoi noted that although numerous weakness remained, the achievements have created pre-conditions for the industrialization and modernization of the country's economy. The report ascribed the achievements to the leadership of the Communist Party, rejecting the multi-party political system. It also stressed that economic development must be linked with social justice, reflecting the reasonable distribution of goods and the means of production and fully developing the capability of every citizen. The conference is mid-way between the Seventh National Conference of the Vietnamese Communist Party held in 1991 and the Eighth National Conference in two and a half years time.
