FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dennis R. Connors, Director, Public Broadcasting, telephone: (202) 482&hyph;5802; fax: (202) 482&hyph;2156. Information about the PTFP can also be received electronically via Internet (send inquiries to PTFP @ NTIA.DOC.GOV) or through the NTIA BBS at (202) 482&hyph;1199 (set computer modems for 8 stop bits, 0 polarity). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Application Forms and Regulations To apply for a PTFP grant, an applicant must file a timely and complete application on a current form approved by the Agency. The current application form expires on October 31, 1997, and no previous versions of the PTFP Application Form may be used. (In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, the current application form has been cleared under OMB control no. 0660&hyph;0003.) All persons and organizations on the PTFP's mailing list will be sent a copy of the current application form and the Final Rules. Those not on the mailing list may obtain copies by contacting the PTFP at the address or telephone, fax, computer bulletin board, or Internet numbers noted above. Prospective applicants should read the Final Rules carefully before submitting applications. Applicants whose applications were deferred in FY 1994 will be mailed pertinent PTFP materials and instructions for requesting reactivation. Applicants should note that they must comply with the provisions of Executive Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs.'' The Executive Order requires applicants for financial assistance under this program to file a copy of their application with the Single Points of Contact (SPOC) of all states relevant to the project. Applicants are required to serve a copy of their completed application on the appropriate SPOC on or before February 15, 1995. Applicants are encouraged to contact the appropriate SPOC well before the PTFP closing date. NTIA requires that all applicants whose proposed projects need authorization from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) must tender an application to the FCC for such authority on or before February 15, 1995. (An application is tendered to the FCC when it has been received by the Secretary of the FCC.) However, applicants are urged to submit it with as much lead time before the PTFP closing date as possible. The greater the lead time, the better the chance the FCC application will be processed to coincide with NTIA's grant cycle. NTIA will return the application of any applicant that fails to tender an application to the FCC for any necessary authority on or before February 15, 1995. Indirect costs for construction applications are not supported by this program. The total dollar amount of the indirect costs proposed in a planning application under this program must not exceed the indirect cost rate negotiated and approved by a cognizant Federal agency prior to the proposed effective date of the award or 100 percent of the total proposed direct costs dollar amount in the application, whichever is less.
