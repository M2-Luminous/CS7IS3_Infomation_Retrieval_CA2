Police immediately grabbed the camera of an Agence France-Presse photographer who had taken pictures of the protest and opened it to expose the film. A plainclothes policeman filmed the entire incident. Witnesses said several hundred people were gathered behind security barriers on the eastern side of the square to watch the delegates leave the parliament building when, about 10:45 a.m. (0245 GMT), the pamphlets were scattered by at least two protestors stationed at different parts of the square. Uniformed and plainclothed police, who have been controlling access to the square since parliament opened its annual session March 10, quickly moved to disperse the crowd and seal off the area. The pamphlets were also hastily gathered up. It was not known if any arrests were made. Tiananmen Square was the scene of massive pro-democracy protests which were crushed by the Army during the night of June 3-4, 1989. Since delegates from all over China arrived for the parliament session, dissidents and intellectuals have made several attempts to put across their pro-democracy and pro-human rights views. Three open letters have been sent to delegates, but Monday was the first time dissidents have openly defied the police. Before the session began, police launched a massive campaign to intimidate opposition with the arrest of some 15 dissidents, forcing some of the better-known to stay away from the capital while parliament met. In a separate development, a Chinese carrying a letter addressed to communist party and parliamentary leaders calling for democracy was arrested just after meeting journalists, several witnesses said. Gao Hongming, a civil servant in his 40s, was detained by plainclothes police and pushed into a black car as he came out of the Jianguomenwai foreigners' compound on the east side of the capital in early afternoon. The letter, dated March 7, had already been sent to the party Central Committee and parliament, Gao said before his arrest.
