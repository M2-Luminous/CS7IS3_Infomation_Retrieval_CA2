[Velayati] First, we are extremely happy to be in Cairo and among the Egyptian people. We attribute great importance to Egypt, its people, and its role. We believe that this country and people play a major role in the Islamic world--a role no one can deny, ignore, or forget. It is an important, historic, and pivotal role, not only in Egypt, but throughout the whole Islamic world. [AL-SHA'B] But we would like to know what happened during the meeting. Was the issue of restoring ties to normal discussed? [Velayati] If you mean the establishment of official diplomatic ties, this was not discussed during the meeting, which lasted one whole hour. However, what was discussed during the meeting was everything that has to do with joint cooperation between the two countries in international forums. In addition, we discussed all the international issues of interest to the two countries, such as Palestine, the war in Yemen, and the future of the Nonaligned Movement and the Islamic Conference Organization. [AL-SHA'B] Do you have any specific ideas on restoring relations to normal? [Velayati] Undoubtedly, this requires action to reach joint agreement, eliminate all suspicions, and remove misconceptions on both sides. [AL-SHA'B] Could we say there was some progress at this meeting, or that it had some positive results? [Velayati] Of course some progress was made. And of course some positive points emerged. It is enough for me to tell you this: I have been foreign minister of Iran for 13 years (since 1981) and this is my first visit to Egypt. My mere presence in Egypt is a good and positive step. I can confirm to you that our discussions were constructive and positive. During the meeting, we affirmed both countries' desire to start good bilateral cooperation in the international arena. [AL-SHA'B] Now we come to the most thorny issue, the long-standing accusation that the Islamic Republic of Iran is exporting terrorism to the Islamic World, and even around the world. What do you have to say about this accusation? [Velayati] This is not new; Iran is not the first country to be accused of such things. During the 'Abd-al-Nasir era, Egypt itself was subjected to such accusations. This is an old weapon the West uses to put pressure on countries, especially those who refuse to submit to the control of the Western powers. None of those who have leveled this accusation can actually prove it. It is no more than dangling the sword of Damocles over the heads of those who go against Western and Zionist views. Notice, for example, that yesterday Israel carried out bestial raids on the al-Biqa' Valley in Lebanon, killing and injuring many people. I heard one of the Israeli officials tell the London radio about this raid, saying there is a batch of terrorists whom they have gone to kill. Killing people falls into the realm of terrorism. Israel kidnapped Mustafa al-Dirani from among his own children, and then said he is a terrorist. Those who kidnap people from their homes, terrorize them, and kill other people are the ones accusing the kidnapped and dead of being terrorists. The killer and kidnapper who is practicing all kinds of terrorism is not being accused of terrorism. The Mustafa al-Dirani crime is a peculiar one. Previously a batch of Israeli planes raided Lebanon and it happened that one of the planes was downed and the Israeli pilot captured. When the pilot was handed back, al-Dirani was the one who handed him over, so he was accused of having captured the pilot and was kidnapped. Who can claim that one person is a terrorist and another person is not? It is a strange game they use to gain control over countries. Praise be to God this game has been exposed. [AL-SHA'B] If there are good intentions to improve ties between Iran and the Arab world, there are obstacles blocking the way, including the disputed islands with the United Arab Emirates [UAE]. Why don't we start by looking for a solution to this crisis? [Velayati] It is historically documented that these islands belong to Iran, and we have the documents to prove it. We are ready to send them to anyone who wants to see them. So why is this issue being used as a pretext to stir up trouble with the brothers by others, who are always lying in wait for us and are never short of ways to do so. We want to stress, through your paper, that we are ready to sit down with the UAE to negotiate in accordance with the 1971 agreement. I personally visited the UAE last year, met with His Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan, and held good talks with him. We also met with his son, His Highness Shaykh Hamdan, and the foreign minister, whom we invited to visit Tehran, but he has not done so yet. So what else could we have done? I went there personally and the natural thing was for him to reciprocate the visit. I hereby, through your paper, renew my invitation to him; and I hope he will respond to it, because dialogue is the only way to resolve our problems. Let met tell you about another incident. When we were attending the nonaligned meeting in Jakarta with President Hashemi-Rafsanjani, [UAE foreign minister] Rashid 'Abdallah said: His Highness Shaykh Zayid asks you as Iranian officials to adopt an appropriate stand and to act more appropriately regarding the issue of the Abu-Musa islands. President Hashemi-Rafsanjani immediately ordered us to send the director general of the Iranian Foreign Ministry to discuss the Abu-Musa issue. I immediately contacted him and we sent him to Abu-Musa the same day. Rashid 'Abdallah told us that he was very pleased about what we did. The director general of our ministry took several measures to eliminate the problem. On his way back he stopped over at the nearby Bandar-e 'Abbas to take the plane back to Tehran, but he was surprised to hear of a Gulf Cooperation Council statement denouncing Iran. For the record, Shaykh Rashid 'Abdallah was not present when the statement was issued. [AL-SHA'B] We want to know your precise position regarding the Gaza-Jericho Agreement? [Velayati] Our position now is the same as our position before and our permanent position, which rejects any agreements with the Zionists. [AL-SHA'B] You have good ties with Syria, so what would you do if Syria concluded a peace agreement with Israel? Would this affect your relations? [Velayati] We are against any agreement with Israel by any party. This does not mean that we are not aware of the kind of pressure to which Syria is being subjected by all sides. Suffice it to mention here the numerous campaigns directed against Lebanon, Syria's closest neighbor. If such agreements were signed, naturally it would affect our bilateral relations. We still consider Syria the only major country left to confront Israeli domination. [AL-SHA'B] We would like to learn about current relations between you and Iraq. The Egyptian public is wondering why you and Iraq do not settle the pending problems between you, since you are both Islamic nations. Topping these pending issues is the issue of the POW's and the aircraft you are holding in Iran. Iraq still accuses you of treating it harshly. What do you have to say about all of this? [Velayati] Our viewpoint is the exact opposite of the Iraqi viewpoint. Regarding the Iraqi aircraft we are holding, this matter is governed by the Security Council resolutions. Internationally, we are not authorized to return them. We cannot violate Security Council resolutions. The problem will be resolved within its own framework. Moreover, we are not the only ones who have Iraqi aircraft in their possession. There are some planes in other countries--Jordan, for example. Regarding the prisoners, we say the same thing that Iraq says. We have a mutual problem. They have our prisoners and we have theirs. We believe that there should be a bilateral exchange of prisoners. For your information, an Iranian delegation will visit Iraq on 11 June. A month after that I will visit Iraq myself. A few days ago I met with the Iraqi foreign minister; we have frequent meetings. We are great advocates of the belief that everything can be achieved through dialogue and meetings. [AL-SHA'B] We are puzzled by your stand regarding the Kashmir issue and what is being said about your stand against the Muslims. What is your real stand on this matter? [Velayati] I wish to confirm to the two of you that not a single Islamic or non-Islamic country has cooperated more with Pakistan over the Kashmir issue. You can ask Pakistan if you wish; we challenge you to find a country that has done one-third as much as us. [AL-SHA'B] Undoubtedly, you have made contributions on the Bosnia issue. But the Islamic world expected you in particular to take a more effective and influential stand than you have taken so far. Why have you taken such a stand? [Velayati] I was in Sarajevo last month. I do not wish to tell you what we did there, but I will quote public statements by President Alija Izetbegovic to correspondents: All aspects of the Iranian role in Bosnia will go down in history. Had it not been for Iran, Bosnia would not be in the condition we see it in today. Iran has so far provided many forms of aid. It has also made a proposal to give military aid. Velayati then added: A few days ago, THE WASHINGTON POST published an article in which it confirmed that Iranian planes had transported shipments of arms to Bosnia. Irrespective of the truth of this report, we do is not rule out this kind of undertaking in dealing with Bosnia, where we have seen forms of ugliness unknown to us before. [AL-SHA'B] Before we end this dialogue, we wish to learn about your stand on what you call the state of the "great Satan."? [Velayati] Our stand on the great Satan is the same. It has not changed. It is the same old stand. There is nothing new in it. We have no objections to establishing cordial relations with any party on condition that that party respects our causes and does not support our enemies.
