"We must see our relations with China within the broader context of our interests in the Asian Pacific region, of which America is an integral part," he said in an article entitled "Isolating China Wouldn't Improve Human Rights" which was published on Tuesday's [31 May] "LOS ANGELES TIMES." Justifying his decision to extend the most-favored-nation (MFN) trade status to China, Clinton said, "The actions I have taken on China are in the long-term interests of both the United States and China." "Linking human rights to MFN has taken us as far as it can," he added. He also noted that "after ten years of argument and veto, we no longer had two China policies -- one from the Congress and one from the President -- but a single American policy." On future ties with Beijing, the U.S. President said, "We will have more contacts, more trade, more international cooperation and more intense and constant dialogue on human rights issues." Clinton also praised China's fast developed economy, saying that a 21st-century economy is taking shape in China, which was the world's fastest growing economy last year. China is not only a big market for America-produced goods, but also a source of more jobs for American people, he added. China has a veto in the United Nations Security Council and it is a major factor in Asian and global security, he said in the article, adding that the U.S. and China share important interests in some fields.
