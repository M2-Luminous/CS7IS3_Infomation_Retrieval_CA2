FR940719-2-00068 FR940719-2-00042 [Docket No. CP94&hyph;538&hyph;000] Texas Gas Transmission Corp.; Application May 13, 1994 Take notice that on May 9, 1994, Texas Gas Transmission Corporation (Texas Gas), P.O. Box 1160, Owensboro, Kentucky 42302, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;538&hyph;000 an application pursuant to section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for permission and approval to abandon an exchange service between Texas Gas and Columbia Gulf Transmission Company (Columbia Gulf), all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Texas Gas states that on January 16, 1979, Texas Gas and Columbia Gulf received an order in Docket No. CP78&hyph;525&hyph;000 (Order) issuing to them a certificate of public convenience and necessity (6 FERC Â¶61,038 (1979)) authorizing the transportation of natural gas by Columbia Gulf and the exchange of gas by Texas Gas and Columbia Gulf under a transportation and exchange agreement dated July 6, 1978 (Agreement). Under the Agreement, Columbia Gulf received for Texas Gas's account, on a firm basis, up to 3,000 Mcf per day of gas purchased by Texas Gas at the Exxon Garden City Gas Plant (Plant) in St. Mary Parish, Louisiana, through an existing interconnection between Columbia Gulf and the Plant and transported such gas to Columbia Gulf's Rayne Compressor Station in Acadia Parish, Louisiana, it is stated. Columbia Gulf says that it then retained such volumes, less a pro rata share of fuel and delivered by exchange equivalent quantities of natural gas, less such pro rata share, to Texas Gas at an existing interconnection between Texas Gas and Columbia Gulf in Egan Parish, Louisiana. Texas Gas further states that such Agreement was terminated by the parties effective January 16, 1991. By this application, Texas Gas is requesting authority to terminate the exchange service performed by the parties under the Agreement. Texas Gas states Columbia gulf has already filed to abandon such transportation and exchange service by an application filed in Docket No. CP93&hyph;686&hyph;000, on August 27, 1993. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before June 3, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Take further notice that, pursuant to the Authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that permission and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for Texas Gas to appear or be represented at the hearing. Lois D. Cashell Secretary.
