SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Department of the Army is amending 32 CFR Part 553 in accordance with Section 1176 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994, Pub. L. 103&hyph;160. That Section extended eligibility for interment in Arlington National Cemetery to any former prisoner of war who, while a prisoner of war, served honorably in the active military, naval, or air service and who dies on or after the date of enactment of the 1994 Authorization Act (November 30, 1993).
