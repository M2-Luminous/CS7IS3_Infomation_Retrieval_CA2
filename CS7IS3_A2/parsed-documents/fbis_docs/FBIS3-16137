Before he answers your questions, Leonid Makarovych wishes to make an introductory address. [Kravchuk] First of all, I can only focus attention on certain fundamental issues because the visit was basically covered both in our and foreign media, and its results were outlined in the news conference by the Presidents of the United States and Ukraine, as well as at the summing-up news conference in New York. But I suppose there is a need to draw attention to certain issues. I think this visit -- this official visit, as it is described in the media as well as in the United States and Ukrainian protocols, although there were attempts to call it a working visit, depending on whose definition it is, and according to the protocol definition it is an official visit by the president of Ukraine to the United States -- is a logical conclusion to a rather important stage in the ongoing process of forming the political and the legal-contractual foundations of inter-state relations between the United States and Ukraine. I believe this visit took place in an atmosphere of notable positive breakthroughs in Washington's lengthy but active rethinking of its concept regarding relations with Ukraine. It allowed us to proceed to the more substantive practical implementation of the democratic partnership proclaimed during the visit in May 1992, and to fill it with more specific content. The talks and negotiations that were held with President Clinton, Vice President Gore, Secretary of State Christopher, Secretary of Defense Perry, the heads of the Departments of Finance and Trade, and with other top officials of the U.S. administration, as well as in the Congress and at the Pentagon, proved that the relations between our countries are ascending to a qualitatively new level. There has been a change in relations between the United States and Ukraine to relations between two friendly countries called to play an important role, a strategic role, at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. In any event Ukraine's role is thus evaluated in the long- term strategic political plans of the United States, as I understood it. Of no less importance is the implementation of our approach to balancing the context of bilateral relations by displacing -- this is very important -- the accent from the problems of Ukraine's nuclear (?armament) to other spheres of cooperation. The fact that the American side has adopted namely such a course confirms the correctness of our principled position from this aspect, too. The signing of a whole package of interstate documents during the visit, which determine the fundamental principles and directions of bilateral relations for the nearest future in political, economic, scientific-technical, and cultural spheres, creates an important basis for giving Ukrainian-American cooperation more substance and a more mutually advantageous direction. If one is to take the most important political result of the visit, one may consider, first, the fact that the United States unreservedly -- and this is very important -- confirmed support for Ukraine's striving to consolidate its political and economic independence, and the greater awareness of the potentially increasing role of Ukraine in the development of evolutionary social and political processes, both in the CIS region and in Europe as a whole. Next, the United States has realized to a greater degree the existence of a stable, economically strong, and democratic Ukrainian state, that its territorial integrity and security conform to the interests of the United States, and that Ukraine's loss of political independence could upset the existing strategic balance in Europe and the entire world, leading to unpredictable consequences. Thus, we can say that in the period since 1991 certain strategic balances have taken shape in Europe, and any unexpected development in any state, first of all a state like Ukraine as our primary concern, could lead to an imbalance. This is being increasingly realized both in the United States and in Europe. Next, the United States has expressed readiness to grant additional financial aid to Ukraine. You know the figures. However, it is important for me to emphasize one aspect, namely that the United States has assumed a leading role in the mobilization of additional multilateral aid within the framework of the G-7 in order to support the reform program in Ukraine. This was mentioned by the President of the United States. Another very important aspect is that we have agreed to work on the removal of barriers to trade and investments in order to enlarge access to the two countries' markets. In March, the benefits within the Generalized System of Preferences will be extended to Ukraine, which will open opportunities for more active access to the U.S. commodity market. Incidentally, today I met representatives of the European Union and we also suggested that the European market and the European Union consider Ukraine's proposals to this effect after Ukraine signs, soon I hope, the partnership and cooperation agreement with the European Union, which is to be initialled in the near future, some time in March. We also reached an agreement, and I attach great importance to this, about attracting more active private investment to Ukraine. I held meetings at the Overseas Private Investment Corporation in the United States with representatives of large companies in New York, and I can tell you that the emphasis was on the United States' economic aid to Ukraine and support for private companies' capital investments in Ukraine, given of course certain legislative support on the part of Ukraine. The results of the visit also create real opportunities for the establishment of mutually beneficial bilateral cooperation in the sphere of science and technology and joint space research. There are relevant agreements on all of these issues. If one looks at it from the summing-up point of view, one can say that there are considerable positive breakthroughs both in Washington's philosophy and conceptual approaches toward the establishment of relations between the United States and Ukraine, in terms of pursuing a more balanced and realistic policy that will embrace political, economic, scientific, technical, and humanitarian cooperation, that is, practically all areas. One can state already now that the crucial factor in these breakthroughs was Ukraine's consistent, moderate, and balanced stance in the rather intensive political dialogue at all levels, both with the United States and with Russia, which made it possible to sign the trilateral statement called to maintain the necessary balance in relations between the United States, Russia, and Ukraine. I think it has become clear to all that the signing of the trilateral agreement was a decisive stage in the present development of relations between Ukraine and the United States, and between Ukraine and Russia. The visit made it possible to consolidate the positive trends that had begun to take tangible shape in the bilateral relations and channel them in a direction more consistent with our political and economic priorities. I believe they are also consistent with the aims of both the Western states and Russia. The present steps of the Ukrainian Government must be aimed at working out as soon as possible all the mechanisms regarding the solving and implementation of the problems and agreements that were signed. First of all, we need to ratify two documents, one is the agreement on encouragement and mutual protection of investments, and the other is the convention on the avoidance of double taxation and prevention of tax evasion in respect of income and capital tax. These documents must be ratified. It is very important to resolve, within the shortest possible period of time, and we are working on it now, the issue of setting up a bilateral commission for assistance to trade and investment that we agreed to form, and a commission for assistance to joint activities in the sphere of high technology, scientific research, and development. We have instructed our National Space Agency to hold, in the near future, a meeting of the two countries' experts to examine specific issues and spheres of cooperation in space research in order to sign a respective intergovernmental agreement. The work conducted during and before the visit with international financial organizations, particularly, the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, was very important. This work is now at the completion stage, its specific sections have been worked out, and now the entire program must be finalized. It is a program based on Ukraine's real possibilities, and on our political will to pursue consistent market economic reforms which is our most important task and to which we see no alternative today. We have instructed our Foreign Affairs Ministry to continue consultations with the United States and other G-7 countries in order to mobilize international financial aid to speed up the economic processes and reforms in Ukraine that are taking place and should be more intensive. Thus, one can say without exaggeration that the official visit by the president of Ukraine and the Ukrainian delegation to the United States is a very important stage in the development of bilateral and multilateral relations, and in determining a more clear political role for Ukraine as a European state. I think this visit will enable us to place the right emphasis in our relations, our policy, and our perspective. I am now ready to answer your questions.
