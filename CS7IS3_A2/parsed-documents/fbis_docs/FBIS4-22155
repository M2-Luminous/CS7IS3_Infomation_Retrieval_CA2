Blood is being spilled, and people are dying. There are dead and wounded among the civilians of the villages of Khucha, Kvemo, and Lata, and Ganakhleba has been destroyed almost completely. According to official sources, local battles are under way in Zugdidi Rayon in Western Georgia. The Abkhazians have taken control of the strategically important village of Lata. The Georgian authorities are hurriedly evacuating the population of Svanetia and villages adjacent to the Kodori canyon. Unfortunately, those who predicted a new escalation of the Georgian-Abkhazian confrontation in spring have been proved correct. It is by no means accidental that the new round of fighting began in the Kodori canyon. In terms of its importance to the Abkhazians, it can be compared to the Lachinsk corridor in Nagorno-Karabakh. There is a "humanitarian path" at Kodori, and helicopters delivering cargo from the republics of the North Caucasus to Abkhazia fly over the Kodori canyon. Significantly, their flight paths are out of range of air defense systems. The Georgians will naturally do everything in their power to block that corridor; by the same token, it is clear that the Abkhazians will fight for it to the last man. The forces that have been committed -- artillery, Grad launchers, and helicopter gunships -- attest to the seriousness of both sides' intentions. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has learned that the Abkhazians have moved a regiment into the Kodori canyon and the adjacent area. The Georgians are opposing it with two divisions, not from the regular army but from the militarized Mkhedrioni detachments. In this situation, the politicians can only concede that the opportunity to activate a peaceful mechanism to settle the conflict has been missed. Eduard Shevardnadze has said that recent events in Abkhazia make it perfectly clear that the Gudauta leadership has nothing but disdain for the peacemaking efforts of the UN and Russia. The counterattack on Sukhumi didn't end anything either. People there remember the Georgian parliament's well-known decision to disband the Abkhazian Supreme Soviet, automatically liquidating the Abkhaz delegation at the Geneva talks as a legal entity. As a result, the talks that had been set up with such difficulty were torpedoed. The sides continue to claim that dialogue is still possible. But at the same time, to all appearances, they are preparing for a different course of events.
