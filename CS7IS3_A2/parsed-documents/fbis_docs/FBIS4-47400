The plasmid spectra of 122 strains of Yersinia pestis were isolated in Mongolia from patients, wild mammals, and arthropods. The populations of three plasmidovars of Y. pestis were circulating in the natural foci of plague in Mongolia. Samples were tested for Ca[.sup]2+[/] growth dependence at 37ï¿½C. Of the three plasmidovars, the first harbors three plasmids with mol masses 6, 47, 65 Md. The second and third contain plasmids with mol masses 6, 16, 47, 65 Md and 8, 47, and 75-80 Md. It is hoped that this work will help solve the problem of intraspecific differentiation of the plague microbe and will uncover the mechanism for the formation of epidemically significant populations of Y. pestis and determine their clonal structuring.
