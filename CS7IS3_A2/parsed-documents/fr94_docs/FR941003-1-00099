FR941003-1-00099 FR941003-1-00006 (A) For large-scale projects, particularly those covering a very large area or numerous alternative locations for the undertaking, the purpose of initial identification efforts is to collect and review existing information and records in order to consider the likelihood that historic properties will be adversely affected in choosing a preferred alternative for the undertaking. Draft EAs, DEISs and other environmental and planning documents should, at a minimum, reflect this level of information. A less intensive investigation (which may include development and testing of a ``predictive model'' to indicate where historic properties exist or are likely to exist) will be sufficient until one or more principal or preferred alternatives is identified. (B) For small-scale projects, and for the principal or preferred alternatives of large-scale projects, the agency should determine the extent to which available information provides a reliable basis for decisionmaking, and then consult with the SHPO and others to consider the need for more detailed and site-specific identification, including intensive field survey(s). The agency should follow up by completing identification and ``gather sufficient information to evaluate the eligibility of [identified] properties for the National Register'' (ยง800.8(b)). (d) Coordinate identification with NEPA and other land and resource management planning requirements. (1) The magnitude of effects, both detrimental and beneficial, on historic properties and historic and cultural values should be projected and analyzed in adequate detail so they can be compared to other environmental, economic, and technical analyses and projections for various project alternatives. The projected number and character of historic properties and the likely effects of each alternative on buildings, neighborhoods, land use, socioeconomics, cultural values, and other relevant natural and cultural characteristics of the environment should be taken into account. Historic preservation documents and appropriate analyses, at least of a preliminary nature, should be circulated and reviewed at the same time as other planning documents, such as Eas and DEISs, land management plans, engineering general design memoranda, and transportation Section 4(f) analyses. (2) Appropriate alternatives to recommended courses of action for any undertaking which involves alternatives that may adversely affect historic properties should be studied, developed, and described. (3) Situations where actions are planned by private applicants or other non-Federal entities before Federal involvement should be adequately provided for, so that: (i) Policies are established and staff designated to advise potential applicants of studies or other information foreseeably required for later Federal action and Section 106 compliance, consistent with Section 110(k); (ii) The Federal Agency consults with appropriate State and local agencies, Indian tribes, Native Hawaiian organizations, and with interested private persons and organizations to ensure that the concerns of other parties can be addressed before any irretrievable or irreversible commitment to the project is made; and (iii) The Federal Agency commences the Section 106 process at the earliest possible time so that by the time an EA, Finding of No Significant Impact, or Final EIS and Record of Decision under NEPA is issued, historic properties have been identified, effects determined, and this information is incorporated with the consideration of alternatives for any necessary resolution through negotiation with other parties.
