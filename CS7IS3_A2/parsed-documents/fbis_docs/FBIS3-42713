This conclusion can be drawn from the speeches of members of the government Commission on Operations Problems, the first 1994 meeting of which was held yesterday in the Government House, on Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment. The State of Russia's Aluminum Industry: - Primary aluminum production in 1993 constituted about 2,900 million tonnes - Of this amount, 2.3 million tonnes were processed in Russia - By September 1993, primary aluminum production had been cut back by only 7 percent - The amount of aluminum processed at Russian enterprises was cut to 0.3 million tonnes Three questions were introduced at the meeting of the commission, which was chaired by Oleg Soskovets, first vice-premier. The most important of them, unquestionably, was the draft of the governmental decree "On Measures To Stabilize the Work of the Aluminum Industry." In the words of Serafim Afonin, chairman of the Russian Committee on Metallurgy, up to September of last year the sector was working quite stably. After that, however, because of the increased ruble outlay for electric power (its share in the production cost increased from 17 to 34 percent on the average for the sector) and because of rapidly growing transport costs, practically all 11 Russian aluminum plants entered the "corridor of loss" (the boundaries of which are determined by the prices for the metal on the world market, on the one hand, and the relation of the ruble and the dollar in Russia, on the other). Russian aluminum producers are therefore faced with two very major problems at a minimum. In the first place, the forthcoming 500,000-tonne cutback in production. It is obvious that this government decision lays the foundation for a bitter fight on the part of the directors to protect their plants from artificial shutdown. The words of one of the directors of the Bratsk Aluminum Plant may serve as confirmation of the fact that there will be no place for corporate solidarity in this fight: "Yes, we must curtail production, but let us do it somewhere over there" (he has in mind the plants in the European part of the country). If the government, however, still refuses voluntary mothballing of capacities, the European Union will maintain rigid quotas for the import of Eastern aluminum, and on the American market, in the words of Aleksandr Shokhin, a multitude of anti-dumping processes awaits us. This can in the end lead to the loss of these two very important Russian aluminum export markets (approximately 1.0-1.4 million tonnes a year). The aluminum plant directors attending the meeting, however, were inclined to blame most of their economic disorder on the electric power workers who, in their opinion, unjustifiably raised the prices for their products too high. They feel that the best way out of this situation is to fix prices for electric power at a level of 0.7-1.0 American cents per kilowatt-hour. Lira Rozenova, chairman of the Russian Committee on Prices, however, thought that this price was too low, and agreed that, as an experiment, the price could be set at a level of 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. This, in her opinion, would cause only a 5-percent price rise for electricity for other consumers. The representatives of the electric power workers, however, agreed with neither the one nor the other variant. As a result, the members of the commission came to the conclusion that the draft of the government decree submitted by the Russian Metallurgy Committee has to be finalized in a week. In the words of Oleg Soskovets, the main attention should be paid to raising the domestic demand for aluminum, sharply reduced as the result of the diminishing of orders from the country's military-industrial complex. In addition, at the meeting of the commission the idea was again raised of cartel agreements: it was proposed to the aluminum and electric power producers that they come to an agreement on a bilateral basis on lowering prices for the goods they supplied each other. Incidentally, a day earlier, Soskovets, in an interview with a KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent, noted: "In this country, it is not the fact of carrying out a cartel agreement, but that they cannot come to an agreement on it."
