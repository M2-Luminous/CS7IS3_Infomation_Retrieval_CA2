At a press conference after a cabinet meeting, Kakizawa said he will make the request when he meets Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in Beijing on Sunday. He also said he will call for Beijing's influence in persuading Pyongyang to change its stance. In talks between Qian and South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung- chu on Thursday, China refused to endorse sanctions as a means of breaking the deadlock over North Korea's suspected nuclear development. Kakizawa, who will visit South Korea on Saturday prior to his China trip, said he will ask Han about the details of his talks with Qian.
