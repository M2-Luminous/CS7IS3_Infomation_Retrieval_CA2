It suffered a crushing, painful, and humiliating defeat when for the first time in 73 years it lost its hegemony over the Histadrut Labor Federation. It could be called "an earthquake," or "an upheaval," but Knesset Member Avraham Burg was closer to the mark when he said: "We have been screwed." The blow is much more painful because Labor brought the downfall upon itself. Just as in 1977 Labor under Rabin did not feel the public had grown sick and tired of it, and that its loss of power was written on the wall, in 1994 Labor under Rabin did not read the map properly and lost power a second time. Labor old-timers can shed tears over not paying attention to Hayim Ramon's prophesy about the mass suicide of the whales. The whales are now in their death throes on the beaches, and depend on the goodwill of Ramon, Sarid, and Der'i to admit them into the Histadrut coalition. [Histadrut forefather] Berl Katznelson is now turning in his grave. Ramon's impressive victory, especially since he had only a short time to organize, is proof of the desire by voters -- even among the Haberfeld supporters, who failed to turn up at the polls -- to punish Labor in general, and Labor in the Histadrut in particular. The main blow was suffered by the party bureaucracy and personally by Rabin and Peres, who permitted it to happen. Labor last night talked about "soul searching," and "the immediate return of the deportees," but from today on, it is a new ball game. Overnight, Ramon jumped from a position of asking for favors to one of dictating terms. And in his new status, and with lots of allies in his former party, Ramon is precipitating Labor into a period of shocks which could end not only with the "clearing away" of the entire generation following Rabin and Peres, but (perhaps) also end the careers of Rabin and Peres themselves. The two can forget about running for top office in 1996. Ramon, a product of the system of direct elections and telegenic politics, will run against Ehud Baraq and then perhaps against Bibi Netanyahu. Now, for the first time there is a chance that the young will take over the reins of power before old age creeps up on them. Our politics jumped two grades yesterday. Ramon's impressive victory provides him with several alternatives. The most striking is that he now has the infrastructure to set up a new center party with Meretz and part of Labor, which one day will be able to set up a young and fresh government with a wider-ranging parliamentary base than Rabin and Peres managed to achieve in the 20 years they ruled the party. There is only one small obstacle in the path opened up to Ramon yesterday: He has to be secretary general of the Histadrut, fulfill all his promises, deal with a 35 billion shekel deficit in the pension funds, cut, sell, defend, close down, and what not. If he is made of the right stuff and if he shows us he can perform as well as he talks, the sky is the limit.
