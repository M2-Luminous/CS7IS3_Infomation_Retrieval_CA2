Delay Fraught With Danger"] [Text] Russia never had nuclear submarines in the Black or Baltic Seas. So after the Soviet Union broke up none of them was inherited by the former Union republics. Over the next few years Russia alone will have to recycle more than 200 of these craft containing a considerable quantity of radioactive waste. This is required by both START-II and the fact that the service life of the submarines, many of which are still afloat, has come to an end. But it turns out that at present Russia still cannot comply with START-II promptly, in an environmentally clean fashion, and at the same time to its economic advantage: There is no appropriate technology that can be universally applied. There are programs and government decrees, but extremely poor financing hinders their implementation. The recycling of submarines is a loss-making process. In addition, the Navy -- the latest owner of the equipment, although technically it is owned by the State Committee for the Management of State Property -- does not keep track of the degree to which all required parts of the equipment are present. It is received for recycling without parts and circuits containing nonferrous and precious metals, such as gold, silver, and copper.... In addition, the recycling has to be done by the so-called "roundabout" method: After a submarine is placed on the stocks, the reactor compartment is cut off, but associated redundant compartments are retained. The reactor compartment is then sealed and thrown into the water. Hence the term "outcast." They will remain in the water until the Defense Ministry builds long-promised storage facilities for them. The Defense Ministry, in turn, is waiting for money from the state to do so. Currently there are around 30 nuclear submarines and "outcasts" subject to recycling underwater near large cities, such as Severodvinsk and Bolshoy Kamen, and the village of Snezhnogorsk. Each of them is kept afloat thanks to municipal electric power, thus causing economic damage to the state. Once the power is turned off the "outcasts" will run aground, and the possible seal failure (after 30 years in service) may cause a discharge of radioactive waste. Each submarine (of the earlier types) contains 300-400 cubic meters of radioactive waste measuring from 100,000 to 1 million curie, whereas the safe level for discharging such waste into the water stands at 10 curie (to the power of minus 9). The overall quantity of radioactive waste awaiting recycling has been estimated by specialists at 2,200 cubic meters in Severodvinsk, 2,000 cubic meters in Bolshoy Kamen, and 93 cubic meters in Snezhnogorsk. In the coming years another 200 or so submarines will be decommissioned in the Navy.
