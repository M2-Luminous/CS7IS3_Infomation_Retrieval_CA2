In so doing he is obliged to travel in time, to traverse history twice: Once, to revisit the victory. And once, for a meeting with the specters of the past, which that victory declared finished forever. I used the word "specters" deliberately, because the NEW YORK TIMES has used it frequently in its commentaries on post-election Italy, which are still anxious. On the day when the American president is due to speak in Rome the NEW YORK TIMES addresses him twice. On page three the newspaper says: "Italian neofascism will make Clinton's diplomacy tough." On page 22, the New York daily's first editorial devoted to Italy has the headline, "Bad Memories in Italy." Even if this is the direction of the difficulties that Clinton has to contend with on his first major international appearance, we know, even before we hear him speak, that the American president too will be obliged to split himself in two. One Clinton, aware of the delicacy of his mission and of his role as guest, will display cordiality, his famous smile, and kind remarks which it will not be inappropriate to interpret as encouragement and good wishes for the new government. The other Clinton, an anxious one, will examine the signals and try to understand whether the anxiety that has spread through the world exists purely and simply as a reflection of the past or because there is a real fear that the past will return. "Bad Memories" provides some pointers. The NEW YORK TIMES editorial, starting with its headline, presents its leaders with the jigsaw puzzle of tone, style, rumors (and "gaffes," according to the newspaper) created around this period in Italy's life. It puts forward the following simple arguments: There is no dispute over the horror of the past (of "that" past). Indeed, we -- all the world's non-Fascist and non-Nazi forces -- united to destroy it. But what can be the aim or purpose or use of digging up the corpse, bringing back the smell of death of that time? The editorial seems to be conveying mainly a certain sense of surprise. It sounds more like an appeal for sensitivity than a condemnation of a policy line or a proposed condemnation. It seems to be asking some Italians, without any attempt to interfere: How can you want an appeal to that past? And how can such an appeal serve your domestic life, your economic recovery, your creative impulse, your international future? Clinton will certainly have a copy of that editorial in his briefcase. But Clinton, president of the country that has been the leader of the world and that is returning to Europe as leader of the 1945 victory, has openly crossed the lines between present and past by emphasizing above all the greatness of the good alliance and the intention that it survive any misunderstandings and continue to exist. This, since that alliance among the "good" allies is the very one that brought the world from the Normandy landing to the collapse of the Berlin Wall, keeping it free of prejudice, discrimination, contempt, and any limitations of freedom. The American president and his aides found valuable support, almost a solution to the dilemma (mere formalities or some kind of substantive statement about the new Italy?) by concentrating, at least in statements made to the American press, on the crisis in North Korea, which is becoming serious, to the nuclear threat which seems to be returning. There can be no expedients in that part of the world. Whatever happens, the Korean crisis shows that Clinton's America cannot demobilize with respect to international problems. Then there are the remarks devoted explicitly to this government, which American television cautiously framed with the "causes for anxiety over the presence of ministers having some connection with Fascism." Clinton says: Let us look forward. In so doing he seems to have found the right balance. The dual emphasis on confidence in the country and on the need to look to the future seems to mean: Instead of letting your wheels spin in the sands of time, consider whether you should not make a leap forward. A leap forward in employment, initiative, and cooperation also means a sharp break with the bad taste anxiously evoked in the NEW YORK TIMES editorial. After Clinton has passed through the streets of Rome, we Italians will again find ourselves on the two sides of sharply opposing alternatives: Should we interpret it all as a celebration and normalization? Or should we interpret every expression of anxiety (as happens more in Europe than in America) and antagonism as the sign of an anti-Italian front, every time as a conspiracy against the country, or as the start of a new resistance? But this day in Rome could be useful, over and above diplomatic courtesies. It could remind some people that it would be better to avoid an obsessive "marching on the spot," with attention hypnotized by a single topic, as though the flow of political events could remain frozen. And it could suggest to others that they stop displaying such bad taste (or provocativeness) as to refer to their past as though it were a normal alternative of history. It is not. If the war had ended differently, the world would look frighteningly different. Bill Clinton's mere presence here has told everyone so, irrespective of what he says. But Clinton also had to play a twofold role in his brief -- and, some say, not easy -- meeting with the pope. Again, Clinton -- by nature conciliatory and willing to put himself in other people's shoes -- had to engage in that conversation with the heavy burden of American public opinion, disinclined to accept the Catholic theory of the limitless multiplication of children in the world. And, we imagine, he will have had to draw a dividing line between one vision and the other of the future and the function of the international agencies, of the United Nations first and foremost, and the plan for birth control worldwide. Once again Clinton was forced to realize America's influence in the world and will have had to consider whether the United States really can distance itself from a world leader such as the pope and whether they could not find some common ground in their disagreement by shifting to the aspect of protecting the world, rather than the aspect of limitation. But Clinton's day in Rome was certainly not a waste of time. Not for him, who was made fully aware of the vacuum and disorientation that can result from America's absence or neglect. And not for us, if we really believe that American democracy -- the most steadfast and stable in the world -- remains the reference point for our life and political approach.
