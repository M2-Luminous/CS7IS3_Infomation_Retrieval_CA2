Since China and Luxembourg established diplomatic ties in 1972, bilateral political and economic relations have been improved remarkably, Rong said. Over the past one or two few years, Rong noted, the bilateral contacts have kept growing, and economic and trade cooperation gained new progress thanks to joint efforts of both sides. Though far away from each other geographically and different in domestic situations, China and Luxembourg share the same hope for a peaceful international environment and to develop each other's economy and improve livelihood of the people, Rong said. Rong noted that the development of bilateral friendship and cooperative relations is beneficial for both China and Luxembourg and it has a bright future. After being briefed on China's economic development, Prince Henri said tremendous progress has been scored in China's economy since his last trip to China in 1988. In spite of its size as a small nation, Luxembourg attaches great importance to the expansion of its relations with China, and the two countries should strengthen cooperation in various fields, he said.
