He included solutions peculiar to socialist economies in the system, in which everyone would have retirement insurance without making payments, interest is described as oppression, and prepaid vouchers and low prices are promised. The book contains radical changes in everything from taxation to unemployment prevention without mentioning where the resources would come from to do it. Some of Erbakan's economic prescriptions follow: --How the slavery system exploits us: Our diagnostic brochure explains clearly that the slavery system exploits us through the five germs of interest and capitalism. These germs are: the interest germ, the unfair taxation germ, the mint germ, the exchange rate germ, and the credit system germ. --Basic principles of the Just Economic Order: As known, a mathematical system is expressed in basic terms that describe the system. For example, Euclidean geometry is based on three fundamental axioms, whereas Lobachevski geometry is based on three different axioms. Numerals, of course, are based on four axioms. Likewise, there are basic principles that allow a game of checkers to be played, just as there are basic principles exclusive to chess that allow that game to be played. (These two kinds of geometry are different from each other from the standpoint of the postulates -- accepted basic truths -- that comprise their foundations. This is especially clear in the "parallel postulate": Euclid--In the ancient Greek geometry of 4 BC, only one parallel may be drawn to a straight line from a point outside it. Lobachevski--In the geometry of the 18th [as published] century Russian Academy of Science, it is possible to draw an infinite number of parallels to a straight line from a point outside it.) --Regulatory services: In the Just Economic Order, the state also provides regulatory services for basic economic goods. In the Just Economic Order, for example, a Wheat Foundation would take the place of today's Soil Products Office. This organization is renamed as a foundation because it renounces any goal of profit and becomes an organization solely for the service of the citizen. This foundation would be organized at the city level throughout the entire country. Anyone who had wheat and wished to sell it would give the wheat to this foundation and receive payment at that day's price. Or anyone wishing to buy wheat would pay at the current price and receive as much wheat as he wanted. --"No interest" principle: There would be no interest in the Just Order. For interest is unfair and oppressive. The man who accepts interest is like the man who drinks the tears and consumes the flesh and blood of the poor and needy. One who drinks blood is a vampire. The reasoning offered in order to suppress these facts and, knowingly or unknowingly, defend the capitalistic interest system is: "Money is a special commodity, because a great deal of expense is gone to and effort expended to preserve its stability and value. Property is rented, so why shouldn't money be rented also? Interest is something like rental and, therefore, is right, as capital is an element of production." --Principle of money as equivalent of land, plant, standard commodity, gold and foreign exchange: It is possible to divide goods which may be bought and sold into four groups in the Just Order. They are land, plant, standard commodities, and gold and foreign exchange, or precious minerals and values, which have been offered for sale. Whatever the amount at which these are offered for sale, money exists in that amount to purchase them. Money cannot be poured into the marketplace in exchange for anything else than these goods which may be bought and sold. --Work on credit: Suppose a sewing machine operator makes 5 million Turkish liras a month under the Just Order. I would hire these people and put them to work. The bank, or the state, would pay their salaries and I would be the borrower as the entrepreneur, the owner of the factory. I would then sell the clothing I produced and pay my debt. --Hold credit: I have some wheat. Prices are cheap right now, and I'm thinking prices will be higher in 3 months, so I deliver my wheat to the wheat foundation on condition [of future sale]. I receive, for example, 80 percent of the present price as credit on the wheat being held. When prices increase 3 months later, I say that I'll sell my wheat at today's prices, I get the rest of the price at that time and I'm paying off the hold credit I received. --Paid tax-equivalent credit: If someone has occasion to receive income from the state, he may receive credit in accordance with specific criteria and under specific conditions from the state, depending on the income in question. The name of this credit is "paid tax-equivalent credit." --What is taxation?: All taxes, funds, and deductions that have been imposed under various names are totally unfair and all of them must be abolished. --Social security: A person receives the compensation that is right for the amount of time he works. When he is unemployed, he receives unemployment compensation. When he wishes to retire, he receives retirement compensation. Suppose a worker receives 5 million liras a month while employed, 4 million liras when unemployed, and 3 million liras when he retires. There is no need for this person to wait until a specific age to retire and receive a retirement pension. If he wishes, he may retire and opt for the retirement pension. If he desires to work again later, he may return to active working life.
