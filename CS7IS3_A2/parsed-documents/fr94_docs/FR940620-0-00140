FR940620-0-00140 FR940620-0-00029 Comment. Several municipalities and members of the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE) suggested that a set of fixed requirements could not be applied or enforced under the variety of site constraints commonly encountered along public rights-of-way. Instead, they advocated a performance standard that would allow more flexibility in responding to local conditions. Some jurisdictions, however, requested detailed guidance. The City of St. Louis commented that, ``In order to assure access for persons with disabilities, clear and comprehensive regulations are needed.'' Response. A performance specification or standard generally describes a desired goal for new construction but does not prescribe a methodology. For example, ADAAG 4.34.5 (Equipment for Persons with Vision Impairments) requires that automated teller machine instructions and information be made accessible to persons with vision impairments, but it does not require a specific solution. A performance standard might be useful in ADAAG 14, where most work will probably be constructed or installed within an already well-developed public right-of-way subject to a variety of differing needs, conditions, and constraints that cannot be fully anticipated. A detailed specification will be useful to public works agencies evaluating alternatives, particularly where site constraints may appear to limit options. Additionally, it might be more difficult to determine compliance with a performance specification in such a complex application. Accordingly, these guidelines establish specific requirements for both new construction and alterations in the public right-of-way. Comment. The NPRM included exceptions for site infeasibility within specific provisions. Many commenters requested that an overall exception for site infeasibility be included in a general provision. Response. A blanket exception might have the effect of permitting the least accessible alternative even in new construction when greater accessibility might be achieved. Although the interim final rule includes some limited exceptions for certain conditions in new construction, there is no exception for site infeasibility. However, alterations provisions include both general and specific exceptions for conditions of site infeasibility when strict compliance with new construction provisions cannot be achieved. Comment. A few commenters misconstrued the preamble discussion in the NPRM to require the construction of public sidewalks or continuous pedestrian routes where none may now exist. Several jurisdictions submitted estimates of costs to retrofit existing pedestrian elements to meet the proposed guidelines. Others voiced concerns about their obligations under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794). Several commenters asked how the issuance of new guidelines would affect their transition plans required by the Department of Justice regulations implementing title II of the ADA. ITE suggested that work done under a prior standard be exempted from application of the final guidelines. Response. ADAAG 14 covers newly-undertaken construction, the addition of pedestrian elements, and the alteration of the existing pedestrian environment. It does not require entities covered by title II of the ADA to retrofit existing elements. If new construction, additions, or alterations are undertaken, they must be constructed to be accessible. However, the Department of Justice regulations implementing title II of the ADA (28 CFR 35.150) and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) may impose additional requirements. Path of travel obligations arising out of alterations to a public sidewalk, public sidewalk curb ramp, or street crossing may require the construction of accessible connections between these and other pedestrian elements. This is discussed more fully at ADAAG 14.3. Comment. A few commenters considered the NPRM provisions too costly for the benefits achieved. Response. Many commenters' concerns resulted from a misunderstanding that the NPRM required a retrofit of existing construction. The requirements of this section are consistent with standard engineering practice in new construction, as detailed in the Standard Plans and Specifications for Public Works Construction, section 1 (American Public Works Association (APWA) and Associated General Contractors (AGC). These provisions apply to alterations of existing public sidewalks only to the extent feasible and therefore excessive cost is not anticipated. A Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) has been prepared which examines the monetary and non-monetary costs and benefits to building owners, operators, and users of the guidelines. The RIA is available to the public. 14.2.1‚ê£Public Sidewalks This provision requires that a new public sidewalk and the continuous passage within the public sidewalk connect to the accessible route required on adjacent sites and to pedestrian elements installed or constructed on and along the public sidewalk. Minimum requirements for width, passing space, slope and cross slope, surface characteristics, and separation are provided. Appendix notes provide examples of public sidewalks, clarify the requirement for a continuous passage, and provide guidance for the design of driveway aprons and gratings. Comment. The NPRM proposed that public sidewalks contain a continuous passage that connects to accessible routes on adjacent sites and to pedestrian elements on the sidewalk. Many commenters interpreted the proposed rule to require a continuous passage connecting pedestrian elements even when a public sidewalk did not exist. Several asked whether the provision required the interconnection of existing public sidewalk segments within a jurisdiction. A number of persons with disabilities and groups representing persons with disabilities suggested that public sidewalks should be required in all developed zones of a jurisdiction, particularly in residential areas. Response. As previously discussed at ADAAG 14.1 (General), the construction of new public sidewalks is not required by this section. New public sidewalk construction is typically initiated at the local level, by individual or neighborhood request or as part of a public improvement project. Comment. Several State and local government jurisdictions asked who was responsible for establishing and maintaining the continuous passage. One commenter asked if the continuous passage needed to be designated. Response. Under the ADA, State and local government entities are responsible for ensuring that their public pedestrian facilities are accessible. The Department of Justice regulations implementing title II of the ADA cover the maintenance of accessible features (See 28 CFR 35.133). ADAAG 14 does not require the marking of a continuous passage.
