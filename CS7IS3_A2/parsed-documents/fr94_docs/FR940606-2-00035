FR940606-2-00035 FR940606-2-00023 Proposed Decision and Order of the Department of Energy Implementation of Special Refund Procedures Name of Firm: Dane Energy Company Date of Filing: April 8, 1994 Case Number: LEF&hyph;0122 Under the procedural regulations of the Department of Energy (DOE), the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) may request that the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) formulate and implement special refund procedures. 10 CFR 205.281. These procedures are used to refund monies to those injured by actual or alleged violations of the DOE price regulations. In this Decision and Order, we consider a Petition for Implementation of Special Refund Procedures filed by the ERA on April 8, 1994, for crude oil overcharge funds. The funds at issue in this petition were obtained from Dane Energy Company (Dane). This Office issued a Remedial Order to Dane finding violations of the crude oil pricing regulations during the period December 1978 through December 1980. Dane Energy Co., 22 DOE ¶83,007 (1992). That Order required Dane to remit $8,361,227.88 to the DOE. Believing that it serves the public interest for DOE to compromise its claims against Dane on an ability-to-pay basis where, as here, the financial status of the covered party can be satisfactorily determined, DOE agreed to enter into a Consent Order, whereby Dane agreed to remit $870,000. The DOE received $870,000 on April 8, 1993. This Decision and Order establishes the OHA's procedures to distribute those funds. The general guidelines which the OHA may use to formulate and implement a plan to distribute refunds are set forth in 10 CFR part 205, subpart V. The Subpart V process may be used in situations where the DOE cannot readily identify the persons who may have been injured as a result of actual or alleged violations of the regulations or ascertain the amount of the refund each person should receive. For a more detailed discussion of Subpart V and the authority of the OHA to fashion procedures to distribute refunds, see Office of Enforcement, 9 DOE ¶82,508 (1981), and Office of Enforcement, 8 DOE ¶82,597 (1981). We have considered the ERA's request to implement subpart V procedures with respect to the monies received from Dane and have determined that such procedures are appropriate. I. Background On July 28, 1986, the DOE issued a Statement of Modified Restitutionary Policy in Crude Oil Cases, 51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986) (the SMRP). The SMRP, issued as a result of a court-approved Settlement Agreement In re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation, M.D.L. No. 378 (D. Kan. 1986), reprinted in 6 Fed. Energy Guidelines ¶90,501 (the Stripper Well Agreement), provides that crude oil overcharge funds will be divided among the states, the federal government, and injured purchasers of refined petroleum products. Eighty percent of the funds, and any monies remaining after all valid claims are paid, are to be disbursed equally to the states and federal government for indirect restitution. Shortly after the issuance of the SMRP, the OHA issued an Order that announced its intention to apply the Modified Policy in all subpart V proceedings involving alleged crude oil violations. Order Implementing the Modified Statement of Restitutionary Policy Concerning Crude Oil Overcharges, 51 FR 29689 (August 20, 1986). In that Order, the OHA solicited comments concerning the appropriate procedures to follow in processing refund applications in crude oil refund proceedings. The OHA then issued a Notice analyzing the numerous comments and setting forth generalized procedures to assist claimants that file refund applications for crude oil monies under the subpart V regulations. 52 FR 11737 (April 10, 1987) (the April 10 Notice). The OHA has applied these procedures in numerous cases since the April 10 Notice, e.g., New York Petroleum, Inc., 18 DOE ¶85,435 (1988) ( New York Petroleum ); Shell Oil Co., 17 DOE ¶85,204 (1988); Ernest A. Allerkamp, 17 DOE ¶85,079 (1988) ( Allerkamp ), and the procedures have been approved by the United States District Court for the District of Kansas as well as the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals. Various States filed a Motion with the Kansas District Court, claiming that the OHA violated the Stripper Well Agreement by employing presumptions of injury for end-users and by improperly calculating the refund amount to be used in those proceedings. In re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation, 671 F. Supp. 1318 (D. Kan. 1987), aff'd, 857 F. 2d 1481 (Temp. Emer. Ct. App. 1988). On August 17, 1987, Judge Theis issued an Opinion and Order denying the States' Motion in its entirety. The court concluded that the Stripper Well Agreement ``does not bar [the] OHA from permitting claimants to employ reasonable presumptions in affirmatively demonstrating injury entitling them to a refund.'' Id. at 1323. The court also ruled that, as specified in the April 10 Notice, the OHA could calculate refunds based on a portion of the M.D.L. 378 overcharges. Id. at 1323&hyph;24.
