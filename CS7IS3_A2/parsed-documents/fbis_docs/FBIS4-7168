FBIS4-7168 "dreas082_m_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-082 Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 Thailand Impact of Political Crisis on Economy Assessed Impact of Political Crisis on Economy Assessed BK2804045594 Bangkok BANGKOK POST in English 28 Apr 94 pp 17, 26 BK2804045594 Bangkok BANGKOK POST English BFN [Text] A prominent economist called yesterday for Prime Minister Chuan Likphai to dissolve Parliament in order to prevent an economic depression that may result from a coup d'etat. Dr Chalongphop Susangkan, human resources programme director at the independent Thailand Development Research Institute [TDRI], warned that if the current political situation continues unchecked, it could become an excuse for the military to seize power. Business figures and stock market investors contacted by Business Post yesterday also called for the House of Representatives to be dissolved although they did not necessarily agree that continued problems would encourage a coup. And Dr Chalongphop's boss, TDRI president Amma Sayamwanla, also an economist, blamed the largely military-appointed Senate for the political problems. He said the Senate should be dissolved as well, although he did not think a coup would be encouraged if Parliament is not dissolved. "I know that the constitution doesn't allow for the dissolution of the Senate, but many of the country's problems would be solved if the Senate also could be disbanded," he said. Dr Amma blamed senators' voting against the Government's constitutional amendment proposals for the current political problems. He argued that since senators and their allies in the Opposition had preferred to adopt the now-defunct 1978 constitution as the basis for their proposals, they had created an "open season" for criticising all aspects of the present constitution, including the composition and continuation in office of the present Senate. Dr Chalongphop issued his warning at a seminar organised by Board of Trade of Thailand to evaluate the economy in the first quarter and the outlook for this year. He said that the outlook is bright for the economy to grow at least 8 percent as predicted by many institutions. The only clouds he could see were political: conflict over a possible Cabinet reshuffle, the constitutional dispute and the bombs attacks in the South. These situations contained the risk that someone might want to be a "knight on a white horse" coming to the rescue by staging a coup, Dr Chalongphop said. "In order to pre-empt such a situation, I suggest the Prime Minister dissolve Parliament and return authority to people to vote again because already there are many signs that the political situation is the virus that would harm the economy." He said he believed the private sector and the country's economy were immune to political changes accomplished in a democratic manner. Nondemocratic changes would not be accepted, he said. Responding to a comment that he is too pessimistic, Dr Chalongphop said Thai history provides warnings to politicians that they must not allow anyone to take advantage of political drift. Asked whether he thought the political situation would continue until the end of this year, Dr Chalongphop said that in the past significant changes usually occurred unexpectedly. These would affect some industries such as tourism and slow foreign investment, particularly from Japan. Prayun Thaloengsi, executive director of the Board of Trade of Thailand, took the contrary position, saying the country should give the coalition more time to amend the constitution and then decide their future. Prida Tiasuwan, managing director of Pranda Jewelry, said jewellery exports would grow by 8-9 percent even at a time of political conflict, but a coup would mean a bleak future for his industry. Dr Wicha Chiwalai, president of the Condominium Traders Association, said that political uncertainty, the government's failure to privatise telecommunications and public transport, as well as fluctuations on the Stock Exchange of Thailand would jeopardise the growth of the property industry. Other government and private-sector participants in yesterday's seminar felt the economy would continue to grow satisfactorily, based on the rise in exports, the stimulus provided by infrastructure projects, the expansion of industries to rural areas, and positive external factors such as the recovery of the world economy. Bank of Thailand representative Suchada Thirakun said economic growth in the first quarter was 8 percent, better than the same period of last year because of a 17 percent rise in exports, particularly industrial and agricultural products. Ms Suchada said the outlook for the whole year is expected to be better than 1993 but she cautioned that inflation may be as high as 4.5 percent. Business Economics Department representative Manop Tahongyen said exports in the first two months were about 150 billion baht, up 1213 percent from the same period last year; the March figures will be higher still. National Economic and Social Development Board [NESDB] representative Akhom Toemphitayaphisit said the NESDB had suggested the government do three things to improve the economy: speed up infrastructure projects; increase private sector confidence in investing in rural areas; and restructure the tariff system. Local investors contacted at the SET yesterday said a dissolution of Parliament would improve investment sentiment. Stock analysts believed dissolution is highly possible after Parliament approves the budget. Phaibun Ratniyom, an analyst from Asia Securities Trading, said Thai politics is at turning point. If dissolution occurred now it would stall economic growth since the budget allocation process has not started. He ruled out the possibility of coup, saying "people power" now dominated Thai politics. American investor Doug Grahan said Thai politics were not an important factor in his decisions to invest in Thai stocks. He said dissolution or any changes in the government could be positive for Thai investors.
