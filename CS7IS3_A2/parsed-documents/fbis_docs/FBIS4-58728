[Nahnah] We had hoped the Algerian authorities would not form a government until national accord had been achieved among men of the political class. We had also hoped that this government would be a coalition government that contributed effectively to resolving the crisis. But Mokdad Sifi's government came after it had become clear that the former government (led by Redha Malek) had resorted to escalation through the anti-terrorism law, whose implementation involved numerous excesses. Besides, the former government considered itself the heir of the authorities or the real partner of the existing authorities in the country. This is why the state's rhetoric was two-faced and aroused despair among those wishing to conduct a dialogue. The Sifi government's arrival has given an impetus to the process of national accord, dialogue, and reconciliation which the former government opposed, whereas the head of state was working for it. We are awaiting the government's economic and social program so that we can define our position on it. [passage omitted] [Al-Tawil] Are you making contacts to coordinate with the parties which believe in dialogue in Algeria? [Nahnah] We always try to make contacts with sincere people who are alarmed by the terrorism practiced against citizens, the killing of innocent people, and the stealing of public money. These incidents should prompt everyone to work to break down the psychological barriers and establish common denominators in order to agree on a minimum program. [Al-Tawil] Has Boukhamkham had any contacts with you? [Nahnah] All I know about the release of brothers Djeddi and Boukhamkham is that they were released under an agreement with the authorities and with the top leadership of the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] inside prison. They have authorization so that their actions will at least be legal. In releasing them the authorities have offered part of a down payment. It had been hoped that they would make contacts in several spheres, including the armed groups level, the political class level, and the authorities level. The aim was for the two officials to contain the hotbeds of violence to the best of their ability. But it seems that since their release in mid-Ramadan [last week in February] they have been unable to expand the circle of their contacts to include all influential figures. Some armed groups accuse them sometimes of being agents and of treason. We condemn these accusations leveled at two people who have struggled for a long time for the sake of the [Islamic] call and political action. [passage omitted] [Al-Tawil] Have you made contacts with the FIS? [Nahnah] The people who have not been implicated in violence -- including those in prison, shura council members, or those who won the (canceled) elections -- contact us from time to time. There are contacts between us and them. Some ask our opinion; others do not. We are advocates of dialogue and understanding. We are opposed to excluding some people because of their political ideology and principles. [Al-Tawil] Is Algeria actually moving toward civil war? [Nahnah] The problem is that there are some people who exaggerate Algeria's problem, and others who play down the problem. Algeria is suffering a crisis. But it is an exaggeration to say that it has entered a civil war. The country is suffering what can be termed sedition. [passage omitted] [Al-Tawil] How do you justify your agreement to join the transitional assembly when you said that the dialogue should be held with those who won the canceled elections? [Nahnah] Algeria is experiencing a fire, and to avoid shouldering responsibility it to avoid performing a duty. We cannot see a sick person dying and then say we cannot give him medicine until a specialist doctor arrives. We set several conditions for the transitional phase, including shortening it as much as possible. And we believe that the way out of the crisis is to hold elections and announce a schedule for them in order to assure everyone that the country is following a pluralist road. We also call on the FIS to contribute to extinguishing this fire. When we talk about the FIS, we are talking about citizens. Not all FIS supporters carry weapons or are reckless or foolish. In the FIS there are wise people and people of politics. So we hope that the people of politics will play a role. We also call on the authorities to accept these people in the transitional institutions in order to guarantee curbing the violence which has continued for long. [passage omitted] The FIS should announce that it is not behind the operations aimed against citizens in general, including policemen, traders, journalists, professors, intellectuals, politicians, and Foreign Ministry employees. Because what is happening is going to generate grudges that will continue for many years. [Al-Tawil] What is your opinion of the dialogue method pursued by President Zeroual? [Nahnah] It is serious but not useful [Al-Tawil] You always focus on dialogue and the need for it. Have tried to make contacts or meet with Abassi Madani? [Nahnah] I submitted a request (to meet with Madani), but the authorities have not responded. My request still stands. With a group of influential politicians in the country, I also offered to form a delegation to meet with those held in prison (FIS leaders) or those under house arrest, or after their release, in order to agree on a minimum program that contributes to reviving hope. The request still stands and we hope it will be met. [Al-Tawil] Why do you believe the request has been turned down? [Nahnah] The authorities have begun their dialogue at the defense minister (Zeroual) level with FIS leaders inside prison. They heve also conducted a dialogue with the parties.
