Nagano's remarks ignored the apologies made by Japanese leaders to Asian countries, a foreign minister spokesman said. Disapproval will be voiced in many Asian countries simultaneously, the spokesman said. Some two million Vietnamese starved to death while Japanese troops occupied Vietnam from 1940 and 1945. Last August Vietnam welcomed then Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's recognition of Japan's responsibility for World War II. Hosokawa said shortly after assuming office that Japan waged "a war of aggression" and it was "a wrong war."
