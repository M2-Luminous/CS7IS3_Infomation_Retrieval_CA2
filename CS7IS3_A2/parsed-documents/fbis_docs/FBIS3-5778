In view of his relative importance and influence in opposition circles, the course of action Chang Ki-pyo takes is predicted to have considerable influence on the nationalist-democratic movement and on the problem of making a political force out of the opposition camp. In 1989, during his time in the National Democratic Alliance of Youth and Students, Chang Ki-pyo seriously raised in the students movement the issue of transforming the opposition into a political force, giving birth to the PP. With its failure in the 1992 general election, however, the possibility vanished for the PP to be an independent political force of the opposition. In his very first interview after being released from prison, Chang Ki-pyo showed a strong attachment and intention to build an independent political party uniting all the opposition, and set up the construction of a "new, progressive, political-party-oriented political organization" as his immediate task. I met with Chang Ki-pyo in his Tongjak Cultural Center office, which he created as a base for regional activity when he ran for office as a PP candidate in Kap-ku, Tongjak in 1992. There I heard his perceptions on the domestic situation during this transition period and his ideas on the progress of the nationalist-democratic movement and the problem of making a political force out of the opposition. [Chong Mun-hwa] First of all, in the opposition movement too, people are evaluating the reform policies of Kim Yong-sam's civilian government in a variety of ways. What is your evaluation of these reform policies? [Chang Ki-pyo] The series of reform measures carried out by the Kim Yong-sam administration after its inauguration, forcing the military to withdraw from politics, the personal-assets registration of senior government officials, the implementation of the real-name financial system, the refusal of the Blue House to accept political funding, and so on, were immensely well done. These were epoch-making measures which liquidated the vestiges of the military dictatorship. Some, including the media, criticize this as a one-man show without the support of the legal system, but that is not appropriate. In a nation with a president-centered system, it is right for the president to boldly carry out reform. The National Assembly began last year, but what reforming has it done? There had also been a public servants personal assets registration law before, but because the presidents were not determined to carry it out, it was never put into practice. The series of reform measures was just and it is excessive criticism that really impedes reform. Overall, the Kim Yong-sam administration's reform has great significance and should be highly evaluated historically. It is regrettable that the media, opposition parties, politicians not presently in office, and so on, are not supporting the Kim administration's reform as they should and are not leading it into an even deeper reform. [Chong] Although it is a fact that the Kim administration's reform has contributed to the consolidation of procedural democracy, some criticize that the administration is strengthening an anti-masses stance with its delay in amending labor law, its conglomerate-centered, economic-growth policy, and its opening of the rice market. What do you think of this? [Chang] From a political standpoint, I think the Kim administration will further the reform. As for economic problems, however, I don't think it will be able to solve them. Hence, it seems that the administration will have a hard time gaining continued public support. Early on, the administration intended to induce economic growth by correcting the conglomerate-based economy, but it changed this to a conglomerate-centered policy. For the solution of economic problems, there must be technological development through guaranteeing business and worker autonomy and educational reform. Concerning farm and labor issues, it is not right to identify the Kim Yong-sam administration with the military governments of the past. I don't even think the response of the administration to the labor-management dispute in Ulsan this year was a bad one. The struggle of the Ulsan workers is just, but they should have controlled themselves. Only then can there be progress in both the labor movement and the reform. The Labor Law must be revised, but the efforts of those in the labor movement are lacking as well. The nationwide struggle to obstruct the opening of our rice market is significant, but we must consider policy on the assumption of an opening. History is developing in the direction of globalization; the world is becoming a global village. [Chong] Since the birth of the Kim Yong-sam administration, the influence of the nationalist-democratic movement is receding. How do you evaluate the present stage of the movement and in what direction do you think it must go to overcome this? [Chang] At present, the opposition is not much supported by the public. People commonly say that this is because it is radical and excessive, but this is not an appropriate analysis of the causes of the problem. The core of the problem is that the opposition is unable to present a good alternative. The goal which has long been presented by the opposition is the withdrawal of the military dictatorship; their ideological alternative was reflected in a socialist society in which ideological workers and farmers were the masters. The former has been achieved; the latter has already been confirmed as being unrealistic. The movement has no goal. It is unable to present alternatives for even everyday problems. If it is to present good alternatives, it must have new ideology. Some in the movement are still clinging to Chuche Thought or Marxist-Leninism. Therefore, they are unable to get public support. Only when they gain a new sense of the developmental stages of world history and develop a new ideology and policy befitting it will they will be able to gain public support. Past socialist ideology is a product of the 20th century. The conservative-progressive concept of former days has already been superseded as a standard of measure. Also, the neo-conservativism represented by Reganism and Thatcherism failed as well. A new, progressive ideology can come out of an accurate analysis of the developmental trends of modern society. The developmental trends of modern society are toward globalization, toward an information society, and toward a mass society. A recognition of the fact that knowledge is the main dynamic of production demands of us a tremendous change. Technology is important and we must have educational reform. The sovereignty of the masses demands pluralization and decentralization. There must be a change in our fundamental understanding of the developmental trends of world history. Having this sense of world history, a new, progressive ideology should be set up under the following five fundamental principles. First is the realization of a democracy based on the sovereignty of the masses, the overall dissemination of democracy, and the realization of a communal democracy. Second, an economic system and labor process must be achieved which guarantees the self-realization of labor. Third is the establishment of a social security system with a new philosophy. Welfare policy must be productive and guarantee opportunity. Fourth, we must set up an environmental development strategy capable of symbiosis with nature. Fifth, we must prepare an international policy based on peace, cooperation, and common prosperity. We must escape from past international relationships of domination and exploitation. These five principles are universal worldwide. For our country, we must present plans for the unification of our people. We must leave behind obligatory, emotional unification plans. Unification policy should be developed within the context of world history and a Northeast-Asian developmental strategy. Unification must be one in which the masses are sovereign. It must be democratic, peaceful, and creative. North and South must change in the process of unification. There must be an easing of tensions and a reduction of military spending. What is important, together with the creation of a new, progressive vision, is that the form of "opposition" political forces is no longer appropriate. Institutional political forces must encompass the opposition. The opposition too must operate within the framework of the system. Institutional political forces and the opposition must play the game with one set of rules. The opposition must not concentrate on a competition of criticism, but on a competition of alternatives. We must compete with one set of rules and in one arena. We should become a part of the institutional political forces, not remain as an opposition political force. Social movements and political capabilities must be divided and reorganized into institutionalized political forces, citizens-movement forces, and class, mass-movement forces. The opposition movement must take actions that are politically responsible. It must overcome the fact that it is understood by the masses as critical and constraining movement. It must be acknowledged as a political force responsible to the public. Aiming for political power, it must seriously develop ideology and policy and set out as a professional political force, capable of representing the political intentions of the people. It must form a new political force. [Chong] Through what channels and with what methods will you form an institutional political force? [Chang] That is a question to discuss and decide with members of the opposition movement. My personal thoughts are that the opposition is unlikely to build an independent, progressive party in the near future. Channels must be arranged for and preparations made. The opposition must carry out activities for which the public can have sympathy and show support. A minimum unit and framework is needed for this. If this activity works out well, there can be a large-scale expansion of participation by expert intellectuals. The opposition concept is not necessarily limited to nationalist-democratic-movement forces. It should comprehend all of society's talented who, while not of the established political sector, pursue a progressive vision with a positive determination to put theory into practice. For this, there first needs to be traffic direction within the camp of the nationalist-democratic movement. A cooperative relationship with the Democratic Party [DP] is important for the political growth and development of the opposition. Only when the opposition has secured considerable independence through its activity and power will unity and solidarity with the DP become possible. The greatest objective of my activity, however, is for the opposition to create new alternatives, and so gain public sympathy and support. A new political organization is needed to change the content of opposition activity. Also, we have to go fundamentally in the direction of a political party. The strategy of creating a new party is efficient, whether in working out our relationship with the DP or for promoting a reorganization of politics. We will create a new political organization directed toward a new and progressive political party. This is right in principle, but it is also tactically desirable. [Chong] Evaluations of PP activity have been unfavorable and attempts to form an independent, progressive party are repeatedly failing in the arena of real politics, how will you get your forces together? [Chang] A common evaluation of the PP's failure is that the people will not yet support a progressive party. I do not agree with this evaluation. It was because of our shortcomings that we couldn't get support. The opinion that we were not supported because the political level of the public is low is erroneous. Antiquated progressivism won't work. We must reconsider it and give it new content. Lacking political ability, we were unable to inform the public of the true content of the PP. Another shortcoming was the severe friction within the PP. We failed because of our own shortcomings and those of the movement and PP. The public does have a problem. It is regional enmity. Things will change a great deal in the future. Without a new progressive ideology, we cannot overcome economic problems, political distrust, and so on. Independently, a general consensus is being formed that the opposition must not continue in its present form. We can form ranks different from those of yesterday's PP. [Chong] How are you going to overcome obstacles, such as the general perception that it would be difficult to create an independent party? [Chang] In carrying out political party activities, the question of activity funding is also difficult. In the future, Labor Union Law Article 12 must be revised and the masses must participate in political activity. The most central problem is that we must present epoch-making alternatives and policy with which the people can sympathize. [Chong] What do you think of the question of solidarity among the Popular Political Alliance [Minjung Chongchi Yonhap], which decided on the creation of a progressive political party, the Committee for the Promotion of a Progressive Political Party [Chinbo Chongdang Chujin Uiwonhoe], and others? [Chang] I believe solidarity with forces espousing socialist ideology unlikely. [Chong] What about solidarity with Chonguk Moim [National Gathering] president Kim Kun-tae, who is discussing the construction of a new political organization? [Chang] In political ideology and policy, I believe that Kim Kun-tae and I think the same. If there is a difference, it is only the issue of an independent party. I believe it important for the opposition to establish itself as a political force distinct from the established political sector, as a new, progressive political force capable of squarely participating in a competition of visions with neo-conservativism. I plan to work with Kim Kun-tae. [Chong] What do you think of the Yi Son-sil spy ring incident? [Chang] The Agency for National Security Planning announced that Yi Son-sil was a North Korean spy. I had no idea Yi was a spy. I cannot understand this incident at all. The PP tends to be anti-Chuche Thought. I don't know how North Korea intended to approach us. The claim that North Korea did it is unbelievable and even if North Korea did it, I think it was to stop exchange between the North and South. Personally, I feel that my treatment was completely unfair. But as a main PP executive, I regret that I was unable to stop Yi Son-sil beforehand and I regret causing concern to the public and to persons who have cared for the PP.
