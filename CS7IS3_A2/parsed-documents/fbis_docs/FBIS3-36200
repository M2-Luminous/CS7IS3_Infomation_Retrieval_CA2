There is no doubt that in a democratic state there should be effective civilian control over the use of the Armed Forces. Nor can there be any objection to the premise advanced in the article that we should resort to this obviously extreme measure only after considering the potential for safeguarding citizens by diplomatic means. As for the aforementioned incident in Riga, which was extremely brazen and unprecedented, apart from its emotional aspect (the capture of generals is always viewed in Russia like the loss of military colors) it was a blatant violation of international law. And the numerous illegal acts previously undertaken against Russian servicemen in Latvia constituted aggravating circumstances. In late December 1993 there was a new series of provocations, including an attack on a military courier service and two instances of militia shelling of military transportation. There was an escalation of unpunished provocations against Russian troops, culminating in the events of 10 January, which were timed to coincide with the Russian delegation's arrival in Riga. Even after the Latvian president announced his readiness to take the proper measures, it took five hours before the Russian generals were released, during which time our citizens were threatened with being shot. The Russian side also took account of the fact that the militia is virtually beyond executive jurisdiction when it took measures to protect the lives and honor of the Russian generals. I want to assure IZVESTIYA readers that Colonel General L.S. Mayorov, commander of the Northwestern Group of Forces, behaved superbly in a difficult situation and was in constant contact with the Russian state delegation from the time we arrived at Riga airport. Defense Minister P.S. Grachev and Foreign Minister A.V. Kozyrev, who issued a long statement, were immediately informed about what had happened. The supreme commander in chief -- President B.N. Yeltsin -- was immediately informed too. So it would be wrong to imagine that the measures taken were some kind of "freelance" military operation. As for the actual nature of Russia's military measures, in our delegation's opinion they were the only correct thing to do, since they stopped the incident fromescalating into a conflict with unforeseeable consequences. I particularly want to stress that, if we had limited our reaction to a statement, this would have been seen by radical nationalist forces as a signal to move to even more unbridled provocations against our servicemen, against the thousands of military pensioners and their families, and against the Russian population, which is trying to win respect for its rights. May I voice the view that we have still not yet fully grasped the importance of this seemingly insignificant military-diplomatic step in terms of our foreign policy, the awakening of our national self-awareness, and the boosting of morale among our Armed Forces. The cherished desire of Russia's professional diplomats and of all our countrymen who value our national interests in deeds rather than words is for the steps taken by Russia 10 January become the starting point for a new presidential policy and a new foreign policy for Russia. Russia has firmly and clearly stated, perhaps more than ever before, that it is still a great power and that nobody will be allowed to deliver ultimatums to it, pressure it, or blackmail it. Those planning new provocations against Russia and its citizens now know that there will be a swift and appropriate response on our part taking account of international precedents, including the U.S. experience. This is nothing to do with "imperial ambitions." We are merely talking about a state's right and, I would say, its duty to use all means available to it in international practice to protect its honor and the national dignity of its citizens. I am sure that if we consistently and steadily follow this line in practice we will be able to avoid in the future a great deal of the trouble that is currently visible on the foreign policy horizon. And, on the contrary, if we "give up" this position under pressure from people offering us "good advice," we will again encounter attempts to diminish our national worth and come up against new problems for our state. Anticipating the reaction of our possible opponents, I would like to say that there is nothing short-term about these arguments of mine. The Russian delegation at the talks with Latvia has always, despite the obstacles raised, consistently and successfully pursued this line in strict accordance with the directives ratified by the Russian president. [Zotov ends] Great Powers Still Not Defined by Military Might [IZVESTIYA] Having a strong position is any diplomat's dream. The question is: What is to be considered a strong position? What result did the Russian military men and diplomats achieve in demonstrating their readiness to use force? Initially, after the provocative arrest of the two generals, Latvian diplomats were indeed prepared to make concessions, and Ambassador Sergey Zotov decided that airborne assault battalions would be the most convincing argument at the talks. But Riga's confusion was quickly over. And not because the Latvians were not frightened enough. On the contrary, it was clear to Latvian politicians (and not only them) that it was necessary to be as stubborn as possible in getting the Russian Army to withdraw and in cutting themselves off from Russian generals behind an iron or any other kind of curtain. Did this show of force make the Russians living in the Baltic any more secure? Probably just the opposite. The position of Russian people is affected badly by any attempts to pressure the Balts; the Russians have become hostages to Russian policy. In this sense the armed force was absolutely impotent. So what advantage was gained? Morale improved sharply not only among generals, as IZVESTIYA had assumed, but among diplomats too. It turns out that even diplomats like banging their fists on the table. You can understand why. The behavior of the Latvian officials with whom the Russian diplomats and military have to deal -- whether they like it or not -- betrays the triumph of a provincial arrogance that has suddenly recognized its own power. But it must not be forgotten that the tricks both big and small that have been played by the Baltic officials had just one cause -- the presence on their country's territory of another state's army, whose withdrawal they are demanding as quickly as possible. There is also another issue -- the appropriateness of the response. Almost nine years ago, when Mikhail Gorbachev had been in power for just two weeks, a Soviet soldier from the Group of Forces in Germany shot the American Major Nicholson. It had seemed to the vigilant guard than the American was trying to discover some secrets. So, following the logic of Ambassador Zotov, who values American experience, just how should the United States have reacted? If assault troops are placed on combat alert when people are arrested, should the response to a killing be a missile strike against the enemy? Fortunately for everyone, the United States restricted itself to diplomatic measures, and there is no reason to believe that it ceased being a great power at that point. So IZVESTIYA would by no means want the events of 10 January to be considered the "starting point for a new Russian foreign policy."
