However, the boom in foreign-funded enterprises has also given rise to some problems that must never be treated lightly. This article, based on a massive survey, reveals some shocking facts which will give the reader much food for thought. [end editor's note] Foreign-funded enterprises have been emerging dramatically on China's horizon, giving an impetus to the economic development and modernization of the country. However, the development process is not always smooth. It is true that some foreign-funded enterprises, especially medium and small ones running processing businesses with supplied material, drawings, and samples; assembling with supplied parts; and compensation trade, have disregarded China's labor laws and ordinances, or simply ignored workers' safety, wantonly infringing upon the workers' legitimate rights and interests. As a result, many serious cases have occurred. We can never turn a blind eye to this phenomenon. Seriously Biased Employment Relationship In June 1993, a letter of complaint signed by "37 workers at Asia Woolen Knitwear Company Limited, Shenzhen," was sent to the office of the Shenzhen City Labor Bureau's Employment Monitoring Group. The letter complained about improper labor management of the company and also raised five other issues. As one of the five issues mentioned, the letter disclosed that "so far the company has not signed any employment contracts with its employees." The labor contract is the legal document to confirm and regulate the employment relationship between the enterprise and the workers. Properly signing and implementing the employment contract is the precondition and basis for maintaining harmonious employment relations and safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of both the management and labor. However, a curious but rather common practice among foreign-funded enterprises, is that many employers do not sign contracts with their employees. In Xiamen, over 90 percent of Taiwan-funded enterprises and other enterprises wholly owned by foreign investors have never signed employment contracts with their workers. A general inspection of the implementation of the "Labor Law" in Shenzhen City in 1992 showed that 19.5 percent of the 280,000 staff and workers working in the 2,055 sampled enterprises were employed without fulfilling any recruitment formalities. The number of enterprises which have not signed employment contracts with their workers respectively account for 70 and 90 percent of all the foreign-funded enterprises in the Shantou Special Economic Zone [SEZ] and Zhuhai City respectively. The absence of a binding employment contract has resulted in a seriously biased employment relationship between foreign-funded enterprise owners on the one hand and their staff and workers on the other. An employee's behavior, whether it has violated labor laws and ordinances or not, will be regarded as wrong so long as the boss believes it is wrong. The worker's only obligation is to work and he is entitled to no legitimate rights. Some foreign-funded enterprises have even imposed restrictions on their staff and workers' personal freedom. A joint venture in Shanghai has made it a rule that no employee can spend more than five minutes in the rest room per visit and no one will use the rest room more than once each working day; and no worker "is allowed to date any boy or girl within three years after her or his employment by the company." A Taiwan factory owner warned newly employed workers: This factory is mine, so I am the boss. That means you have to do whatever I tell you to do and you have to work as long as I tell you to work. Whoever does not work conscientiously will be fired. There are plenty of job seekers everywhere now and I can easily hire as many workers as I want to.... A noteworthy phenomenon is that all the foreign-funded enterprises which have failed to properly sign and implement employment contracts are, without exception, very vigorously and strictly enforcing the company discipline, rules, and regulations which they have established on their own. Very often they replace the contracts with their own company rules and regulations. Their company rules and regulations even contain articles which apparently run counter to the state's current labor laws and ordinances and violate the workers' rights and interests. As a result, the employment contract has been rendered an "agreement" which merely safeguards the management's rights and interests and gives the management all the say. Last March, Zhuhai City Labor Bureau received a copy of the "employee's letter of intent committing themselves to abide by the factory regulations in Chengfa Garment Factory." This self-contradictory document under a heading which bore both the terms "letter of intent" and "factory regulations," contains 14 articles. All the articles, from Article 1 through Article 14, are rules which employees are obliged to strictly observe, whereas none of them mentions terms of pay, social security, fringe benefits, or legal holidays. What is more, some foreign-funded enterprises have undisguisedly declared in their factory regulations: "Where any other rules and regulations contradict these company regulations, the latter will override the former." In so doing they have wantonly ignored China's labor laws and ordinances. The relationship between management and labor is one between an employer and employee, in which the two sides act on an equal footing either in terms of law or personality. However, some foreign investors have persisted in acting their own way, interpreting this relationship rather as one between the master and the slave than as an equal relationship. In consequence, the employment relations have become too tense and complicated, disputes between management and labor have gradually increased, and collective industrial action and strikes have taken place in some foreign-funded enterprises. All these are related to infringements upon the staff and workers' legitimate rights and interests. Pay Is Not That High When the first foreign-funded enterprises were founded in China, many people were very eager to work in them. The main reasons were because foreign-funded enterprises offered higher pay. However, things were not as beautiful as people expected. In many foreign- funded enterprises, the pay for employees, in fact, is not in direct proportion to the work they do. Much exciting hearsay has turned out to be merely beautiful legends. The Wang sisters came from a small mountain village in Shaoyang, Hunan. Like millions of migrant laborers, they were extremely excited when they first set foot on Guangdong, a land of which they had long dreamed. However, soon after they began work in a Huizhou toy plant wholly owned by a Hong Kong firm, they found they were earning bitter feelings and many annoyances as well as a humble living and they realized that the world outside was not so attractive as they had expected. Although they had to work for over 10 hours a day on average and seven days a week, their total income was barely over 300 yuan a month. With payments for meals and other expenses deducted, the amount of money they could take home was less than 3,000 yuan a year. In fact, compared with many other more unfortunate wage earners, the Wang sisters are earning quite a handsome income. According to a Sichuan girl working in Dongguan, Guangdong, her boss not only extends the working hours but deprives her of the benefit of legal public holidays. What is more, her employer insists on paying the workers for overtime work at the normal rate. Several migrant workers in a Taiwan-funded enterprise in Panyu, Guangdong, lodged a complaint with the Guangdong People's Broadcast Station, revealing that, although they were working 14 hours a day, the management still refused to pay them wages under the pretext that the factory's products were unmarketable. Furthermore, the management also forced them to pay for their board and lodging, or their identity cards would be confiscated by the management. According to the labor department, complaints with regard to wages being lodged by staff and workers in foreign-funded enterprises are gradually increasing. In 1992, Baoan District in Shenzhen City received and accepted a total of 3,607 complaints against foreign-funded enterprises; of these cases, 1,114 were related to wages. Of the cases of complaint lodged by foreign- funded enterprise staff and workers over the years, nearly 60 percent have been related to wages and the percentage is on the increase. The complaints focused on low pay, because the wage range in most labor-intensive enterprises is only between 200 and 300 yuan a month. This is not only much lower than the wage level for workers doing the same type of jobs abroad but also slightly lower than the wage level for many state-owned enterprises at home. What should be pointed out is that some foreign-funded enterprises have very often failed to pay even such meager wages to their workers in due course and what the workers finally receive is an amount with various deductions. Many foreign-funded enterprises have very rigid factory regulations. They are ruled by penalty, fines can be imposed on workers under various pretexts, and the slightest lowering of vigilance in work on the part of a worker may cost him a fine of a certain amount. Those who take sick leave must pay an amount as a fine, those who take casual leave must pay an amount as a fine, and those who refuse to work overtime must pay an amount as a fine too. A certain factory has made it a rule that any worker who talks while working is liable to a fine of one yuan for each offense; anyone who talks loudly is liable to a fine of two yuan for each offense and, what is still more shocking, is that workers will have two yuan deducted from their pay for each time they use the rest room. The Taiwan-funded Yongqi Company in Fuzhou City has made it a rule that anyone who takes one hour sick leave must pay two yuan; coming to work more than one hour late is counted as a one-day absence, causing the deduction of three days' wages and 30 yuan of full- attendance bonus from the monthly pay. In the case of a Chinese staff member working with a foreign-funded enterprise in Fujian, he earned nearly 300 yuan a month but the cumulative amount of fines deducted from his pay for a certain month was as high as 150 yuan or more. A woman worker in a foreign-funded enterprise in Qingdao manufacturing corduroy, received a monthly earning statement for last February showing a balance of only 16 yuan after all fines had been deducted. She was extremely shocked when she received the sum of 16 yuan as her income for the month and she quit the job in grief. Intensive labor equals low wage minus fines. This annoying equation has been disturbing so many wage earners working with foreign-funded enterprises! Endless Overtime Work To workers in some foreign-funded enterprises, endless overtime work is a nuisance indeed. Generally, wages in China mean the income an employee earns for his work during the normal working hours (8 hours a day). However, nowadays, almost all foreign-funded enterprises count overtime pay as a part of the worker's normal monthly wages. If a worker does not work overtime, then he will not be able to earn a barely acceptable amount of wages. The remuneration package offered by many foreign-funded enterprises look pretty high but one immediately finds out it is actually rather low if one considers the extremely long working hours in these enterprises. The Guangdong Provincial Labor Bureau once conducted a questionnaire survey among the more than 14,000 staff and workers of 17 foreign-funded enterprises. The survey findings showed that, in most enterprises, workers had to work 10 to 12 hours a day and seven days a week. The workers of Shift B in the assembly workshop of a toy company in Zhuhai, once worked overtime up to 170-192 hours each per month and the highest cumulative overtime work record was 214 hours that month, amounting to about 26 working days! An electronics company in Qingdao has kept its workers on overtime of up to 100 hours a month each on average over the past more than a year since its opening. A certain knitwear company once forced its workers to work three days and three nights nonstop and, as a result, many workers passed out at their posts! Back in 1919, the International Labor Organization had already set the rule: "Eight-hour working day and 48-hour working week for industrial enterprises." However, a small number of foreign-funded enterprises are violating this "eight-hour working day system." China's labor department has formulated a policy on overtime work, which stipulates that each worker's accumulative monthly overtime work shall not exceed 48 hours. However, the fact is that in numerous foreign-funded enterprises, workers work much more overtime than this. Let us now review the reward workers gain from overtime work. China's labor policy clearly provides that pay for overtime work, either calculated on a piece or time rate basis, will be 1.5 times the normal rate and work on legal public holidays shall be paid for as double the normal pay. However, in most foreign-funded enterprises, workers do not get their due pay for extraordinarily long overtime work. The practice of extended working hours and overtime work is mostly related to labor-intensive enterprises dealing in the processing business with supplied material, drawings, and samples, assembling supplied parts, and the compensation trade. Operation of these enterprises generally is subject to restriction by the amount of orders on hand. In order to force their workers to work overtime so that they can meet the deadline for delivery, many factory owners usually set the pay standard for overtime work according to the amount of orders and the delivery deadlines. They do not follow any fixed remuneration scale, just paying arbitrarily. Hardly any factories have paid for overtime work in accordance with the overtime pay rate as set by the Ministry of Labor but most enterprises pay for overtime work at the same rate as the ordinary working hour rate. So, there is no actual "overtime pay rate." The workers get no extra compensation for extended working hours. Why then is the practice of working overtime still so common? Are workers willing to work overtime? In fact, most wage earners do not want to work overtime but, rather, they are forced to do so. The Shenzhen Asia Woolen Knitwear Company Limited has set a rule: "Anyone who refuses to work overtime is liable to a fine of 25 yuan." So, if a worker refuses to work overtime, he will lose three days' wages. Therefore, workers dare not resist the management's order to work overtime although they have a lot of grievances and complaints. Some enterprises induce workers to work overtime with bonuses. With overtime work and bonuses linked together, the management can now rest assured that the workers will not refuse to work overtime. A Hong Kong-funded hardware factory in Shenzhen has incorporated the following practice as part of its written regulations: Seventy hours overtime work is the criterion to qualify a worker as a recipient of full-attendance bonus and is the minimum amount of overtime workload for every worker. This factory simply ignores the Guangdong provincial authorities' regulation that no worker shall work overtime of more than 48 hours a month. Some other plant owners do not set any minimum requirement regarding overtime work but resort to another tricky practice: They arbitrarily set piecework limits on their own. In the workshop, manufacturing second hands for a joint-venture timepiece plant in Zhuhai, the piecework requirement for each worker per duty shift is 4,000 pieces, whereas the requirement for a worker of the same category in Japan is only 2,500 pieces per shift. More than 200 workers in the sewing machine workshop of an enterprise in Tianjin, wholly owned by ROK interests, lodged a complaint to the labor department that the workload requirement was too high for them to fulfill in an eight-hour working day. To meet the requirement they could do nothing else but work overtime and if any worker still could not fulfill the requirement after having worked overtime, then it would mean that worker would get no pay for the day. Given the unreasonably high workload, the workers in that plant often have to work until 2000 or 2100 or even later before they can go home. Personality Without Dignity No Chinese could ever forget the plaque hung on the gate of Hongkou Park in Shanghai in old China which bore the words: "No Admittance to Chinese or Dogs." This plaque aroused the national indignation of the several generations of Chinese. It is shocking indeed that an absurd incident, in which a human was kept in a cage together with dogs, happened in a Taiwan-funded enterprise in Fuzhou, China, today in the 1990's. On the evening of 7 November 1993, Yu, a woman worker from Jiangxi Province, were caught when she tried to take away two pairs of shoes from Yongqi Company. Managerial personnel from Taiwan, Chang, Chen, and several other men immediately tied the woman worker up. They beat her up and then hung the shoes around her neck in front of other workers. As the woman worker tried to struggle away, Chang and Chen locked her up in a dog cage. Two big dogs barked at the worker fiercely. She was frightened and trembling, calling loudly for help. Having kept her in the cage for more than two hours, Chang and his assistants took the worker to another dog cage. The company owner Chen spoke to more than 600 woman workers the next day: "I have treated you as humans in the past but now I am going to treat you as dogs." This company owner was really swollen with arrogance and his remark was disgusting! He himself is a Chinese but he is without the least national sentiment! It is noteworthy that cases like this in which laborers' personalities are insulted and their dignity is trampled on are not unusual in some foreign-funded enterprises. An enterprise wholly owned by a ROK firm has assigned a "foreman" to every workshop. These foremen walk around the workshops holding a big stick in their hands. When they find any worker being slow at work, they will beat him or her with the stick. One day, a foreign "foreman" found several woman workers slow at work, he ordered them to prostrate themselves in a line with their hands on their heads. As the woman workers refused to follow his order, he kicked their legs to force them to prostrate themselves. A male worker at Fenghan Company in Tianjin once accidentally hit a foreign managerial officer when unloading a truck. The latter, without looking into the cause of the accident, immediately climbed up into the container and kicked the worker out of it, thus injuring him. Workers at a certain chemical fiber company in Qingdao City are ordered to run round the plant or to stand facing a wall as a penalty for coming to work late. Foremen at a shoe factory in Guangdong often scold and beat workers and the workers "are not allowed to refute or resist," otherwise they will be fired. A Taiwan-funded enterprise in Guangdong even practices the system of "collective penalty," by which a whole work team comprised of dozens of members, has to prostrate itself if any one member has committed a mistake. A shoe company in Putian, Fujian Province has invented some peculiar penalties: Workers are ordered to be drenched by rain, to be exposed to the sun, and to jump like frogs. A young female worker in a ROK-run enterprise in Tianjin, who once violated labor discipline, was forced by the foreign managerial personnel to eat seven cakes (100 grams each) and seven eggs and drink two glasses of water on one occasion before she was allowed to go home. The management's behavior was really inhumane! Body searches are a violation of human rights which is not allowed by Chinese law. The cases of illegal body searches in the nude, as happened in the JAL-Longpo Hotel in Shanghai, have aroused strong reaction. However, cases like this are still taking place from time to time in a few foreign-funded enterprises. A toy factory in Qingdao has had male security guards searching female workers with a view to preventing the workers from taking away goods when they leave the factory for home. Woman workers at a private enterprise wholly owned by a foreign firm in Tianjin complained that they had often experienced insulting body searches upon their leaving the factory for home. A survey conducted by the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions among 20 foreign- funded enterprises in 10 cities reveals that 17.6 percent of the workers in these enterprises had been searched or had seen their colleagues being searched by managerial personnel. To be sure, China is not a wealthy country. But insulting the personality is by no means tolerable by the law! The Price of Blood and Life More than 60 years ago, Xia Yan, in his report "Indentured Laborers," depicted the miserable life and terrible working conditions of a worker nicknamed "Thin Wood Stick." His description shocked the readers. Since liberation, the Chinese working classes have become the masters of the country and the working conditions and environment for workers have been improved remarkably. However, the situations in a small number of foreign-funded enterprises are awakening reminiscences of the past. Let us hear the complaint of a group of female workers at a foreign-funded enterprise in Tianjin: We, 30 people in total, live in a room 20 square meters in area. There are no beds and we have to sleep on the floor. It is easy to step on others when walking through the room to go to the toilet at night. The working conditions are very poor in the factory--the workshop is simple in structure and it becomes as hot as a food steamer on hot days. The rest room is built within the workshop and there are a lot of flies in there. All the windows are sealed by welding and the window glass is painted over. The workshop is not air conditioned so we workers often suffer heatstroke. The iron gate of the workshop is always locked during working hours. We simply think we are working in "hell." There are still more horrible things. Industrial accidents and occupational diseases are a pair of swords hung over the workers, the former being the hard and overt one and the other being the soft and covert one. They are constantly threatening the workers' lives and impairing their health. Fire is the greatest and most direct threat against foreign- funded enterprises. The fire that took place in Shenzhen on 19 November and the one in Fuzhou on 13 December, both covered by the newspapers, killed a total of more than 140 Chinese workers. Many foreign-funded enterprises do not have enough fire prevention facilities and, what is worse, the management does not have a sense of fire prevention. Industrial accidents seem to be very common in some enterprises running businesses processing with supplied material, drawings, and samples, assembling supplied parts, and the compensation trade. According to the Shenzhen City Labor Department, quite a few workers are electrocuted each year in the city and cases of fingers being cut off by machines, such as punching machines, metal cutting machine tools, and injection molders in particular, which have no safety protection casing, have happened from time to time. A metal component part manufacturing plant run by a Hong Kong investor in Xili Industrial Zone, Shenzhen City, once experienced five hand- cutting accidents in a single week. The management of the plant did not report these industrial accidents to the authorities, nor did they take any precautionary measures afterward. In consequence, two more cases of arm cutting happened later. A Taiwan-funded enterprise in Xiamen City has experienced 43 cases of severed arms and fingers and other injuries, in which the worker victims lost a total of 38 fingers! A survey conducted among five township and town clinics in Baoan District, Shenzhen City, shows that they received a total of 11,679 in-patients during the survey period, 1,033 of them or 8.84 percent were workers from foreign-funded enterprises who had been injured in industrial accidents. Workers in foreign-funded enterprises are facing another more dangerous threat--occupational nuisances. Exporting pollution to underdeveloped areas is a usual practice by some investors from developed areas. An international environmental protection expert has pointed out: The present trend is that overseas business interests are exporting some "sunset industries" to China in a planned way. In 1993, Zhuhai City Public Health Department conducted a sample survey in seven Taiwan-funded enterprises. The findings indicated that the percentages of benzene, toluene, and xylenol in the air were all eight to 10 times higher than the respective international standards, the problem being particularly serious in such industries as toy making, plastics, shoemaking, fabric printing and dyeing, and chemicals. Incidents of poisoning had taken place in three foreign-funded toy manufacturing plants, causing 81 casualties of whom four died and eight were irremediably handicapped. A poisoning case which took place in a garment factory in Dalian City causing 42 casualties was due to the poisonous gas released by the fabric supplied by an overseas customer for processing. In Qinhuangdao City, 12 workers in a Sino-foreign joint venture were poisoned the first day the plant started operations. As revealed by the findings from a monitoring operation conducted by the Dalian City Occupational Disease Research Institute at the workshops of 34 currently operating foreign-funded enterprises generating occupational nuisances, only six enterprises met the public health standards. Shenzhen City has conducted an air pollution survey in 547 enterprises wholly or partly run by foreign interests, and it found that only 29.6 percent of the imported equipment installed at these enterprises have antipollution devices and only 26 percent of the machines in these enterprises have gone through pollution tests before being put into operation. Occupational diseases have already impaired the health of the staff and workers of some foreign-funded enterprises. In Shenzhen, a health examination focusing on occupational diseases conducted among 1,100 staff and workers in two shoe factories with serious occupational nuisance problems and another arts and crafts workshop, revealed that many workers experienced a remarkable decrease in the quantity of white blood cells only a few months after they joined the plants, which meant that their health was under serious threat. Meanwhile, however, a survey conducted among 101 enterprises running paint spraying and coating businesses in the city showed that hardly any enterprises provided their workers with antipollution gauze masks, gas masks, or gloves. Some enterprises have only provided their workers with cotton gloves which are of little use in labor protection, while workers in most enterprises are left to be exposed to industrial pollution. In Guangdong Province, 70 percent of the currently operating foreign-funded enterprises have not carried out pre-employment health checks on their staff and workers according to the relevant state regulations and 80 percent have not introduced any regular physical examination system for workers engaged in polluting operations. Our wage earners who have mortgaged their lives and health to their employers are paying a very high price!
