From there it is possible to see the increased military activity in the Amazon region. Venezuelans are reinforcing their positions and building a defense line similar to our Calha Norte. There are also rumors that the Caracas Government might be buying missile batteries from Eastern European ex-Communist countries. There is no territorial dispute between Venezuela and Brazil, and this military buildup does not mean that Venezuela is preparing to invade the Brazilian Amazon region. It is just a reaction to the increased Brazilian military presence, which began early in 1993. Military observers have confirmed what high-precision satellites have for a long time detected: The Amazon region has become a training camp for the Brazilian Armed Forces. It is not yet like that ofApocalypse Now, the famous Francis Ford Coppola film, but military activities have become routine in the area. There is abundant evidence of the increased Brazilian military presence in the area. The airport of Boa Vista, the capital of Roraima, is a virtual frontline defense base. The Brazilian Air Force (FAB) has deployed F-5 and Mirage squadrons in the area. They join the Tucano single-engined planes to perform exercises with ground and sea forces. Navy frigates and destroyers are conducting maneuvers in the mouth of the Amazon River, where they have performed beaching exercises. Ex-Army Minister Carlos Tinoco, and current Army Minister Zenildo de Lucena have both transferred military units from central and southern Brazil to the Amazon. The Petropolis Infantry Brigade (Rio de Janeiro) was sent to Roraima and the Santo Angelo Infantry Brigade (Rio Grande do Sul) was sent to Tefe (Amazon). Border platoons are being created to safeguard the military presence in the area. The Tefe brigade camp, for example, will occupy 500,000 square meters and operate along 2,200 km of the border. It will have three jungle infantry battalions, a hospital in Tabatinga (Amazon), and will have 1,700 troops: 500 in Tefe, 900 in Tabatinga, and 300 in Cruzeiro do Sul, in Acre. The Amazon military unit will have jurisdiction over a highly strategic region: from Santa Rosa in Acre to the Traira River near the Colombian border. It was there that Colombian guerrillas clashed with Brazilian soldiers in 1990. There have been successive incidents in the Amazon since the 1960's, when the Venezuelan Government attempted to take Pico da Neblina, Brazil's highest peak, (3,014 m). In the past few years, intense drug trafficking activities and the growing presence of miners who dispute land ownership with Ianomami Indians, have heightened the tension. Last year Brazil was accused of massacring 73 Ianomamis, although it was later discovered that there were only 19 victims and they were killed in Venezuelan territory. From neighboring Colombia there is also the potential threat of 12,000 FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia], ELN [Army of National Liberation], and EPL [Popular Liberation Army] guerrillas. Those organizations allied themselves with drug trafficking cartels to obtain funds for the armed struggle. According to Colombian intelligence services, the guerrillas are giving armed protection to drug trafficking routes, and they are likely to end up clashing with Brazilian military and police forces. In Peru, the Maoist Shining Path group has allied itself with drug trafficking. The increased presence of Brazilian military troops stems from a change in the strategy of the Armed Forces. According to studies by the War College (ESG), the increased cooperation with Argentina and the development of Mercosur [Common Market of the South] have reduced the geopolitical importance of the southern region of the country, which has been the traditional point of attention for the military. The hypothesis of an external conflict has moved to the Amazon. What was mere theoretical expectation has become official doctrine: since the beginning of 1993, the new line of the ESG has been blatantly christened the National Strategic Concept. Admiral Hernani Goulart Fortuna, an ex-ESG commander who is now a reserve officer, believes Brazil is now really devoted to the Amazon, which occupies an area that is subject to various international interests. "Brazil does not have border problems, it has problems at the border," he said, adding that it is no longer reasonable to maintain 35,000 Navy and Army men in Rio de Janeiro. Fortuna has written a report entitled: "The Amazon: Real Situation and Political, Strategic Vision." In his report, Fortuna claims Brazilians became more concerned about the Amazon following the end of the Cold War. The admiral explains that the latent conflicts, which were being kept on hold by the nuclear terror balance between the United States and the ex-USSR, have begun to emerge in various parts of the planet, and South America -- particularly the Amazon -- is not free of this phenomenon. Sergio Porto da Luz, a reserve sea captain and ESG strategist, has pioneered the thesis of military reinforcement in the region. In his book, Structure for National Power in 2001, Luiz criticizes the broadly disseminated concept that the Amazon is a sort of "world lung." Porto da Luz says: "French President Francois Mitterrand has said that the Amazon is an asset that belongs to mankind, where it could be necessary to exercise the right of intervention. International interest in this region, which has been monitored by all possible sources of the First World, is growing." He believes it is necessary to "show to the international community that Brazil is firmly determined to prevent the Amazon from being treated with impunity." General Antenor Santa Cruz Abreu, who headed the Amazonas Military Command for three years, agrees. He says Brazil should never yield to the "spurious thesis" of the so-called relative sovereignty. Santa Cruz believes the measures adopted by the Army to strengthen the defense of the region, and those of civilian nature like those under the Amazon Region Surveillance System (Sivam) are essential to prevent an international strategic plan from being imposed on the country. "If Brazil abandons the Amazon, there will not be a conventional invasion but an attempt to create an international force to preserve the earth's lung," he warns. Army Minister Zenildo de Lucena prefers not to regard the increasing military presence in the Amazon within the context of a possible conflict, but as a guarantee of security and integration. Not all military men, however, feel free to openly discuss the issue. General Sampaio Maia, current chief of the Amazon Region Military Command, CMA, did not want to talk to ISTOE reporters. According to the officer in charge of the CMA public relations, Gen. Sampaio Maia was "disgusted" at the treatment the press had given to military activities in the region. Nonetheless, on 8 and 9 March, Gen. Sampaio Maia met in Sao Gabriel da Cachoeira, Amazonas State, with General Valentin Porras who commands the 5th Jungle Infantry Division of the Venezuelan Army. The objective of the meeting was to reduce border tension between the two countries. During the meeting, which could not be covered by the press, they discussed the need to improve communications between the Brazilian and Venezuelan armies, to establish more simplified rules for military flights along the border area, and to adopt common procedures to deal with citizens who are caught in irregular situations. One week later, Sampaio Maia received in Manaus the new head of the U.S. Southern Command, General Barry MacCaffrey, who officially conveyed to him the Pentagon's decision not to conduct military maneuvers in Guyana. Brazilian military experts stated that this decision was more than mere courtesy toward the Brazilian officers who did not hide their concern over these maneuvers. Porto da Luz is convinced that Pentagon strategists are aware that Brazil is very seriously considering occupying that territory. Admiral Fortuna said the U.S. Navy proposed to the Brazilian Government to conduct joint maneuvers in the Amazon Region. He even suggested modifying military doctrine and giving priority to the antinarcotics effort. Within this framework, it can be seen that General Bayma Denys' appointment to the Transportation Ministry was no accident. Gen. Denys, a former secretary of the National Security Council and former head of the Eastern Military Command, knows very well the logistic problems faced by the Brazilian Armed Forces in the Amazon region as a result of the somewhat sketchy highway system. Gen. Denys will begin to repair the main accesses to the Calha Norte project site. To give an idea of how precarious the region's roads are, it takes more than five hours to drive the 200 km that separates Sao Gabriel da Cachoeira, Amazonas State, from the Venezuelan and Colombian borders, and it is impossible to do it during the rainy season. Only recently did the Brazilian Army ensure deployment through the use of Manaus Aviation Squadron helicopters and Brazilian Air Force Buffalo planes. Bayma Denys' appointment to the Transportation Ministry implies the presence of more Brazilian Armed Forces contingents in the Amazon Region.
