FR940527-1-00072 FR940527-1-00014 In addition, in section VI.A. of this preamble, we are proposing revised criteria for determining whether an entity qualifies for exclusion from the prospective payment system as a separate long-term care hospital. This proposed change is in response to situations where hospitals are manipulating the process for recognition as a separate Medicare provider in order to circumvent the prospective payment system exclusion rules. For example, some hospitals have begun to organize themselves under what they themselves refer to as the ``hospital within a hospital'' model. The effect of such a reorganization is to grant an exclusion to what is, for all practical purposes, a long-term care hospital unit, even though section 1886(d)(1)(B) of the Act limits the exclusion from the prospective payment system for hospital units to rehabilitation and psychiatric units. We believe that the motivation for such arrangements is primarily financial and may lead to inappropriate transfers that are not necessarily in the best interests of patients' health and well-being. We strongly believe that patients should be treated in settings that are best suited to provide the levels of care the patients need. Decisions regarding the most appropriate setting should be based on clinical criteria. To help ensure that this occurs, to the greatest extent practicable, financial incentives should be neutral regarding the setting wherein a patient is treated. This means matching payments as nearly as possible to the resources required to treat the patient. We believe our current definition of transfer cases provides financial incentives on the acute-care side to transfer patients to excluded hospitals and units in order to reduce lengths of stay and at the same time receive payment at the full DRG amount. These incentives exist whether the acute-care hospital is transferring patients to its hospital-based excluded units or to other excluded hospitals. For these reasons, we are proposing to change our definition of a transfer case by adding new ยง412.4(b)(4) to include cases transferred from an acute-care setting paid under the prospective payment system to an excluded hospital or unit. We believe that this policy would more appropriately pay those prospective payment hospitals that are transferring patients to an excluded hospital or unit before completion of a course of treatment. This policy would extend to cases transferred to all excluded hospitals and units, Veterans Administration hospitals, other Federal hospitals, and hospitals not participating in Medicare. Discharges to non-hospital settings, such as skilled nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities, would still be paid as discharges. 2. Payment for Transfer Cases Since the inception of the prospective payment system, there has been concern that a flat per diem payment rate for transfer cases fails to account for the likelihood that the beginning of a patient's hospitalization is the most resource intensive portion of the stay. Comments received in response to the September 1, 1983 interim final rule recommended that the transferring hospital should receive either the full DRG amount or should be paid on a sliding scale to reflect the higher costs of the first few days of a patient's stay. Our response at that time was that little or no data were provided in support of this position (49 FR 245, January 3, 1984). Last year, in the May 26, 1993 proposed rule, we responded to a ProPAC recommendation concerning payment of transfer cases and described the preliminary results of the analysis undertaken by RAND to evaluate the adequacy of our transfer payment policy (58 FR 30245). RAND found that among cases transferred prior to reaching the mean length-of-stay, 1-day stays cost 2.096 times the per diem payment amount for cases in nonsurgical DRGs (based on the geometric mean length of stay) and 2.576 times the per diem for surgical DRGs. Among nonsurgical transfer cases, the costs of 2-day stays are about 1.215 times the per diem payment amount, and cases transferred after 2 days cost about 10 percent more than the applicable per diem amount. Among surgical cases, the costs of stays of 2 or more days are actually about 7 percent below the applicable per diem amount. To evaluate the impact of replacing the flat per diem methodology with one designed to reflect the observed relationship between costs and the first few days of hospitalization, RAND simulated a transfer payment methodology that multiplies the per diem amounts by the coefficients referred to above. The improvement in payment-to-cost ratios for per diem transfer cases was significant, from 0.7224 under current policy to 0.9722 using the scaled per diem. We did not propose a change to the transfer payment policy last year, however, due to concerns over the specification of the transfer payment formula. First, the coefficients used to graduate the per diem amount are dependent on the specification of the model and the data employed. Ensuring the continued validity of the per diem weighting factors would require frequent reestimation as other payment parameters change and more recent data become available. Second, we were concerned that weighting the per diem amounts by the coefficients directly from the regression may overstate the precision of the estimates of costs per day prior to transfer. Because available data do not attribute charges or costs to a particular day, the estimated costs for each additional day reflect the incrementally higher costs per case compared to transfers occurring 1 day earlier. If, in transfers occurring after 3 or more days, for example, costs per day were more evenly distributed than the graduated per diem payments, the coefficients in the regression might not reflect the costs of additional days.
