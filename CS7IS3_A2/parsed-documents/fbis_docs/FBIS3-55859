He said the Georgian Government is helpless and incapable not only to provide with the security of the pipeline but also to cope with the Azerbaijani military joints [as received] acting in that part of Georgia. Adonts declared that Azerbaijani militants control all the elevations along the Southern part of the pipeline. He said it hampers the reconstruction of the pipeline. In the same time Roland Adonts rejected the idea of Armenia's military interference for provision of the pipeline security. He considers it impossible because this region of Georgia is basically inhabited by Azerbaijanians. This problem requires a serious political and military interference of Russia and Georgia.
