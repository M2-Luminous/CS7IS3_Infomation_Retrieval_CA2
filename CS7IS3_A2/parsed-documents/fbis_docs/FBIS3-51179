The diplomats, representing the United States, France, Canada, and Venezuela, invited General Cedras to create an adequate environment within the framework of the implementation of the humanitarian operation. Specifying in a letter that they were not soliciting security assistance, the four expressed a desire for the full cooperation of the authorities charged with security in order that the staff in charge of this agreement may encounter no obstacle in accomplishing its tasks. A clear warning was therefore sent. Any obstacle to the distribution of humanitarian fuel would hinder the ability of the international community to send food and medications to the most deprived population, reads this letter from the four ambassadors to Gen. Cedras. The Army responded to the Group of Four. Regarding full cooperation concerning the distribution of the fuel, Gen. Cedras referred the Group of Four diplomats to the government. Such cooperation, writes the Army chief, can be defined and ordered only by the government, which will give the necessary instructions to the specialized services of public administration, unquote. [no beginning quote as heard] Gen. Cedras, however, promised security for the unloading and distribution of the fuel. The Army could not escape its essential duties of maintaining order and assuring public safety, he writes in answer to the letter from the ambassadors of the four friendly countries.
