In this regard, we have achieved certain success, made some progress, and gained some new experience. In the days to come, we should make the experimental zones play an even better role in serving central policies and exploring methods for rural reform across the country. Chen Junsheng said: Generally speaking, the situation in agriculture and rural areas has been good since last year. To enhance the good situation, the central authorities have adopted some measures to increase agricultural investment, and all the provinces and departments concerned have increased their share of agricultural investment. Ensuring the supply of essential agricultural products and steady increase in peasants' income are two important objectives of rural economic development in the 1990's. Arousing the peasants' enthusiasm is a new problem which requires solution in work concerning rural reform experimental zones. For this reason, it is necessary to constantly study new circumstances and new problems, and to explore new ways under the new situation. On how to continue to run rural reform experimental zones well, Chen Junsheng emphasized: First, we should readjust the contents and arrangements of the experiment. Since the experimental zones were set up seven or eight years ago, many projects were conceived according to the situation then. For this reason, it is necessary to make a proper readjustment of their contents and pay attention to making breakthroughs in key projects and to summing up experience. Second, it is necessary to coordinate work among the leadership and departments of various experimental zones. This is because experimental zone work involves all quarters and requires the support and cooperation of other departments concerned. Third, to facilitate their experiments, the zones should be permitted to go beyond some existing policies and systems. However, experiments must be strictly kept within proper limits and submitted to the state for approval; only the approved experiments may be conducted. Fourth, it is necessary to strengthen the cadre force of the experimental zones.
