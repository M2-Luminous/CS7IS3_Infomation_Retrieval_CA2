Kiev Clearly Wants To Join the List of European Capitals Waiting for Clinton"] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] In the Russian capital, a number of agreements, including documents on the nonproliferation of nuclear arms, are scheduled to be signed on 14 January. Whether it will be the presidents of three or two states who will affix their signatures to the documents, however, is anybody's guess. Still, according to THE WASHINGTON POST, "the United States, Russia, and Ukraine have stepped up talks on dismantling Ukraine's nuclear potential in the hope of signing a corresponding agreement in Moscow next week." Intensive negotiations are under way in the U.S. capital attended, aside from Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Georgiy Mamedov, by his Ukrainian counterpart, Valeriy Shmarov. Still, it seems unlikely that Leonid Kravchuk will arrive in Moscow. Giving up nuclear missiles together with going hat in hand to big brother would have become too good a trump card in the hands of his domestic opponents, who would not miss an opportunity to accuse the Ukrainian president of a lack of "genuinely national thinking." Nonetheless, squandering a chance to give himself a 60th birthday present of meeting with the U.S. President would be unforgivable from a purely human point of view. This is why reports that Kravchuk invited Clinton to pay a visit to Kiev -- although, to all appearances, the American side seems to be thinking that a trip to the U.S. capital was quite enough for the Ukrainian president -- are hardly credible. It is well known that by giving up Belarus' nuclear potential, Shushkevich earned warm thanks from the U.S. leader, consequently Minsk has firmly reserved a slot on the itinerary of Clinton's European tour. At the same time, being the CIS' head office, it may just as well offer to play host to a summit of the U.S. and Ukrainian Presidents. All the more so, because in this event the meeting will be devoid of the "Moskal" [derogatory Ukrainian word for "Russian"] accent. [passage omitted]
