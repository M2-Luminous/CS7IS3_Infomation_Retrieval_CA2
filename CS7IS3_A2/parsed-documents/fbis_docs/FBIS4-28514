"The United States had repeatedly asked for the postponement of the meeting on the grounds that they had little prepared for it," a ministry official said. He said the two sides will determine the time and place of the meeting later. The postponement of the meeting draws keen attention because it comes at a time when tension is rising over the North Korean nuclear question. The subcommittee meeting was to discuss key military issues pending between the two countries such as the question of whether to hold the Team Spirit exercise and the issue of defense cost sharing, ahead of the main SCM meeting usually taking place in November.
