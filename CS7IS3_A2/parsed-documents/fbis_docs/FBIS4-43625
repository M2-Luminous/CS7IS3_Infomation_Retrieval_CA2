Nevertheless, it should be considered carefully. Be it Bosnia, Somalia, or now Rwanda -- it is always the same problems that emerge if one takes a closer look. First: Everything is always more difficult than it looks. The Somali "gangs of thieves" have proved to be clever tacticians, who even drove the Americans away in the end. Second: The old colonial times when a few battalions were able to "clear up" among the natives are over. Anyone who goes in must be ready to stay. Shooting a hostile headquarters to rubble only takes minutes. But creating a durable political order takes years. Third: Democracies do not like zinc coffins, if there is no solid national interest behind the casualties. And fourth: Since the rebels are on the point of conquering Kigali, this intervention would indeed come a bit late. Is there a path between the "criminal passiveness," which Paris has pilloried, and a criminal carelessness, which pushes away the problems that come after the paratroopers have jumped? Many African states have long offered soldiers to the United Nations. They primarily lack armored personnel carriers that would save them from the snipers. Instead of discussing an unlikely intervention, the rich European Union countries had better send the equipment. In this way, they could save lives immediately.
