The Belgrade press agency TANJUG reported on 17 May that industrial output has been "steadily" increasing since the beginning of the year, the market is "reasonably" well supplied, the national currency, the dinar, is "completely" stable, foreign currency reserves have grown, and budget deficits are decreasing. Dragoslav Avramovic, governor of the National Bank of Yugoslavia and the architect of the economic recovery program, stated in an interview published in the 17 May issue of the Ljubljana weekly MLADINA that his program enjoys "wide" public support. He boasted that Yugoslavia had even accumulated a trade surplus in spite of the sanctions and that the "international financial police" has so far been unable to prevent it from doing so. "In the Balkans, smugglers have really mastered their trade," he told MLADINA, explaining that Serbian wine can be bought in the United States, Switzerland, and Germany. A shoe factory in Kraljevo, he said, is working "full steam" for the Italian market, and "planeloads" of money are being sent from Belgrade. Avramovic invited the reporter to the Belgrade railroad station to see 20-car trains loaded with furniture departing every day. After all, he concluded, "UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] itself is a huge smuggling operation," pointing out that each soldier in the newly arrived Russian contingent "will leave Yugoslavia with a good car." Avramovic is convinced that sanctions against Yugoslavia "must fail," although he conceded that the country is paying a heavy price to circumvent them: It is paying 30 to 40 percent above world market prices for its imports while its exports sell for 30 to 40 percent below market prices. He is also concerned by shortages of petroleum and drugs. On the other hand, Avramovic said he is comforted by the fact that "the country can feed itself well," a "capable" light-industry sector, and a strong armaments industry. Similarly, the 16 May issue of the Belgrade daily BORBA cited Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic as telling U.S. journalists that "sanctions cannot do us any harm even if they last another thousand years." The same issue of BORBA carried a report on the opening of an agricultural fair in Novi Sad at which Federal Prime Minister Radoje Kontic recognized food producers and farmers "who not only managed to survive under the blockade but continued to work and share a major burden in the implementation of the stabilization program." After touring the agricultural fair, Milosevic also praised the accomplishments of Serbian farmers and declared Serbia an "agricultural and agroindustrial power," TANJUG reported on 20 May. In a statement to Radio Moscow reported by the 18 May BORBA, Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic said that "although sanctions have had a serious economic and social impact, they have neither politically destabilized the country nor made us sway from our principled policy." Addressing the participants of the International Conference of Journalists in Belgrade, Marjanovic recounted the effects of sanctions on the economy, estimating the damage at $30-40 billion. Nevertheless, he stressed the positive results of the economic recovery program, according to the 24 May TANJUG report. A monthly opinion poll conducted by the Belgrade-based Market Research Institute showed growing optimism among Yugoslav businessmen, TANJUG reported on 25 May. According to the poll, 63 percent of businessmen expect industrial growth to continue during the next six months. In a similar poll conducted a year earlier, TANJUG states, 60 percent of those surveyed expected a sharp fall in production. Sixty-four percent of respondents in the recent poll expect the business climate to improve over the next six months, compared to 31 percent of respondents to a poll taken in January. However, the TANJUG report notes, "experts" warn that an increase in industrial production might create problems, since low wages have weakened consumers' purchasing power to the point that "the population is struggling at the subsistence level" at the same time that UN sanctions are preventing exports.
