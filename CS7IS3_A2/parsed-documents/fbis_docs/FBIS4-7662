Talking to reporters after a special cabinet meeting, Klaus stressed, however, that it depended on the character of the goods. The Czech Republic is interested in particular in oil supplies, he added. Klaus was referring to his visit to Moscow, scheduled for April 4-5, to which he had been invited by President Boris Yeltsin. Klaus said he would try to settle economic issues which could not be settled at lower levels. He called very important an accord on the support and protection of investments, to be signed during the visit. The Czech Republic has similar accords with other countries but the agreement with Russia will be "less liberal," said Klaus. Another point the cabinet discussed was a proposal to negotiate an agreement on trade cooperation between the Czech Republic and Brazil. The accord is to be signed during Klaus's visit to Latin America, scheduled for mid-April. The Czech Republic is to have a similar accord with Morocco.
