However, the citizens in Aden, and in all adjacent villages and towns, should know that the army of unity does not target citizens and that citizens will not be harmed. This is because the forces of unity protect unity and care for the safety of citizens, who are the objective of unity and whose happiness is sought. Likewise, misled soldiers and officers should know they will receive much appreciation and respect once they join the forces of legitimacy and stand with them in the trench to defend unity. Yes, everyone knows this. It has been proven by experience and events. It was confirmed by previous cases in al-Dali', [word indistinct], Shabwah, Abyan, Lahij, Bayhan, and other places. Citizens were safe and enjoyed care and respect. Every soldier and officer who joined legitimacy enjoyed the care and appreciation of all commanders in the forces of legitimacy and all the noncommissioned officers, officers, and soldiers of the army of unity. This is because they are brothers in arms, comrades in struggle, the shield of the homeland, and the protectors of Yemen. The entire Armed Forces should remain as such, regardless of the attempts made by the enemies of Yemen. Thus, we can say that the citizens who welcomed and cooperated with the forces of legitimacy, as well as the officers, soldiers, and noncommissioned officers who joined these forces, have infused new blood into the legitimate forces. They have made an important contribution to their advance and their victories. Hence, it is clear to everyone that the gang of secession and apostasy, which left behind citizens, soldiers, and officers as a sacrifice for its salvation from the people's wrath, is demonstrating futile thinking and false delusions. This is because the people's grip will continue to chase the gang wherever it goes, follow it into any den in which it hides, and remove it from any cave to which it may resort. [passage omitted] Once again we say: Blessed be the steps of the forces of unity pounding the last strongholds of apostasy. Blessed be the hands of the armies of legitimacy uprooting the dens of secessionists. Welcome to the sons of the Armed Forces who were misled by the renegade ones. Welcome to the brothers joining the Armed Forces and the unionists who are biased toward both the trench of legitimacy and the forces of the people and unity. Peace to all citizens in Aden and in all the villages and towns lying on the road of the victorious and trustworthy unionist march. These citizens will be safe as long as they support justice and legitimacy. They will also be dignified and respected everywhere and always, especially since they are the objective and [word indistinct] of unity. Unity was achieved for them and with their support. This unity will remain. It is for the sake of these citizens and for their pride that the forces of unity are marching against the gangs of apostasy. It is also for the salvation of these citizens that the struggle is continuing against the gangs of secession. Let the citizen be confident of victory [words indistinct] safety. This is because the people's forces are for the people and for their protection. The armies of unity care for the masses of unity throughout great Yemen.
