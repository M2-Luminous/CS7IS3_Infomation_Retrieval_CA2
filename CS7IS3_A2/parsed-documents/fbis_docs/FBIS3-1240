The decision was taken in the light of widespread prisoner dissatisfaction with not being allowed to vote and the subsequent riots at prisons countrywide. A joint TEC, Independent Electoral Commission and government team was established to finalise the details. The TEC decision reversed a decision last week not to allow prisoners who were jailed without the option of a fine to vote in spite of the Independent Electoral Commission advising that discriminating against some prisoners would create logistical difficulties. African National Congress delegate Cyril Ramaphosa warned of many more deaths unless all prisoners were given the vote. He said 23 prisoners had already died. Earlier in the day, about 50 members of the South African Prisoners Organisation for Human Rights protested outside the TEC building against the TEC's opposition to prisoners voting. The TEC resolution was possible because the Democratic Party reversed its opposition on practical grounds. Government representative Roelf Meyer and Ciskei's Mickey Webb reserved their positions but did not oppose the resolution.
