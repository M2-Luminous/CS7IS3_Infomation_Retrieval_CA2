Diplomatic efforts by Russia, which took an independent stand on Bosnian settlement, were backed by the Russian Defence Ministry's concrete steps. When asked by TASS to comment on the latest developments in Bosnia, the Defence Ministry's information and press department said Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev had repeatedly called upon NATO to reverse its ultimatum threatening Bosnian Serbs with air strikes and to find a political solution to the armed conflict. These appeals were voiced during recent meetings in Moscow with high-ranking foreign military leaders -- French Defence Minister Francois Leotard, inspector general of the German Bundeswehr Klaus Naumann and British secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs Douglas Hurd. Simultaneously, the Russian defence minister continuously took efforts, through both diplomatic and its own channels, to avert NATO air strikes against any of the warring factions. The Defence Ministry's initiatives were based on the February message by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to the U.N. secretary general on possible ways of settling the Sarajevo crisis. At his own initiative, the Russian defence minister discussed Bosnian settlement on the phone with his U.S. counterpart William Perry for three times last week. Specifically, during Monday's conversation Grachev, as the Russian president's authorized person, drew Mr Perry's attention to the fact that Bosnian Serbs were gradually withdrawing their heavy weapons for 20-30 kilometers from around Sarajevo or hand them over to U.N. control. The ministers considered possible measures to ease tensions around the Bosnian capital. According to military observers, this and other moves by the Russian military command rested upon the firsthand assessment of the situation in the conflict zone. Thus, an on-the-spot reconnaissance group from among staff officers of Russian peacekeeping forces deployed in Serb Krajina, as well as a group of the Russian Defence Ministry officials headed by airborne troop commander Yevgeniy Podkolzin were sent to the area of possible air strikes. The Russian military obtained guarantees from Bosnian Serbs that they would strictly fulfill their obligations on big guns withdrawal. They also looked into all political and organizational issues concerning the deployment of Russian peacekeeping troops in Bosnia, including their possible reinforcement. As a result, 400 Russian paratroopers were stationed in the buffer zone between the confronting sides near Sarajevo. These military units were transferred here from Croatia with the approval of the U.N. secretary general. Russian Defence Ministry officials believe the presence of Russian peacekeepers in the epicenter of the Bosnian conflict was key to achieving an agreement between Russian special envoy for former Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin and the Bosnian Serb leader. According to Russian military, Russia's peacekeeping troops transferred to the conflict zone need reinforcement. A decision to send to Bosnia extra peacekeepers numbering up to 300 fighters should be approved by the Russian State Duma.
