Shanxi is also poor, as its Luliangshan region is one of China's 18 major poor regions. Among the province's 118 counties, cities, and districts, 14 are national-class and 36 are provincial-class poor counties. This is a harsh reality that Shanxi must face during the course of development. Hu Fuguo, secretary of the Shanxi Provincial CPC Committee and NPC deputy, discussed the topic and talked a great deal about new options for future development. Hu Fuguo said: We have made proper readjustments of the province's development strategy. It can be summed up into eight words, "coal excavation, electricity generation, road construction, water diversion." Hu Fuguo said: Shanxi is a major energy source province. Our strategy for developing the energy industry is to enter the market, reduce bottleneck restrictions, engage in a fairly large-scale operation, make rational exploitation, do intensive processing, and advance toward the world market. In accordance with this strategy, Shanxi basically accelerated its construction of energy and chemical industry bases last year. On the strategy of emphasizing both coal and electric power, Hu Fuguo said: Shanxi will take advantage of its coal to develop the electric power industry. With the State Planning Commission's approval, we recently started the construction of Yangchuan No. 2 Power Plant and the Liulin Power Plant, bringing the total capacity of power generating projects under construction in Shanxi up to 3.6 million kw. At the same time, the Yangcheng Power Plant will be built with imported technology and equipment and with funds from outside the province. During the first stage of its construction, generators with a total of 2.1 million kw capacity will be installed. The preparatory work for its construction is being stepped up. After completion, it will supply electric power exclusively to Jiangsu Province. Feasibility reports on building power plants in Hequ, Wangqu, and Hejin have been prepared. Shanxi's thermoelectric power generating capacity will double by the end of the century. Hu Fuguo said: The construction of roads and water diversion projects is in full swing in the province. The Taiyuan-Yulin first- class highway has been completed and is open to traffic. The construction of two express highways and three second-class highways has started in an all-around way. By 1997, Shanxi's highways will be able to transport annually more than 100 million tonnes of goods out of the province. The construction of the Wanjiazhai project for drawing water from the Huanghe has started. After completion, the project will solve Shanxi's water shortage problem once for all. The Taiyuan airport and railroad are under renovation. On the province's abundant coal resources, Hu Fuguo said: It will not do without excavating coal, but coal excavation alone cannot solve all our problems. The establishment of a socialist market economic structure has created a development opportunity for an energy-rich province like Shanxi. Complete decontrol of coal prices will help rationalize Shanxi's coal management system and create new opportunities for Shanxi's enterprises to accumulate capital funds and develop themselves. The establishment and development of the production-factor market will make it possible to market electricity as a commodity and will enable us to realize the strategy of emphasizing both coal and electric power industries. Shanxi's electric power development will enter a golden age. So long as we seize the development opportunity, new progress will be made in Shanxi's economic construction.
