In a speech in New York, he said Britain could not understand why the United States did not back plans to send an extra 8,250 troops and instead approved an increase of just 3,500. "We must not put ourselves in the situation where we lack the tools to carry out the job," he told the Carnegie Council for Ethics and International Affairs. He urged the United States to back the full increase when the proposal returned to the UN Security Council and "to throw their full weight behind the peace process." Mr Rifkind will intensify his campaign when he meets U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry in Washington tomorrow. He will attempt to persuade him to support the full deployments of extra peacekeepers and to send American ground troops for the first time. Britain believes a substantial U.S. force of ground troops is vital if peace is to be restored successfully across Bosnia. In his speech, Mr Rifkind made clear that the UN would maintain its impartiality in Bosnia. He said air strikes could be launched against any of the warring factions if they were putting UN forces under threat and if a request for air support came from the UN commander, Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose. But he warned it was important to weigh up the consequences of future air strikes. "We must think where this kind of activity is likely to lead us and be prepared to manage our future responses so that we get where we want to go," he said.
