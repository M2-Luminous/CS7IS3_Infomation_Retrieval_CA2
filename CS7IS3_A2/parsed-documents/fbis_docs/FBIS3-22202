According to Yurasov, the submarines whose service life is over were made radiologically safe. Measures needed for ensuring it continue to be taken. However, much money is needed for keeping the submarines afloat, ensuring their stability and resistance to flooding. The maintenance of phased out nuclear-powered ships, nuclear reactors and obsolete nuclear storage facilities also costs a lot to the Russian Navy. Responding to the question [by] ITAR-TASS, Yurasov did not mention the exact amount of money needed for resolving those problems and said the figures should be updated. Yurasov stressed that in 1992 the government allocated to them only 15 percent of the money they really need, while in 1993 they did not receive anything at all. According to Yurasov, the government is pinning its hopes on the federal budget, while most local administrations are doing nothing to help the navy resolve its financial and ecological problems. In 1993 150 nuclear safety inspections were held at Russian nuclear power units, Yurasov continued. Thirty-seven instructions were issued for carrying out work which is dangerous from the radiological point of view. On the whole, no radiologicaly dangerous situations or conditions for them were registered at the nuclear power units of the Russian Navy in 1993. ``Safety is being fully ensured at all nuclear power units,'' Yurasov stressed.
