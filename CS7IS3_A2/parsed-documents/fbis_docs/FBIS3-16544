"What will happen to the Russian Army if the Duma approves the Ministry of Finance's version of the defense budget?" "With whom is it easier for the defense minister to deal -- his counterparts from remote foreign parts or from nearby foreign parts? "Did the supreme commander take the nuclear button with him to Sochi?..." Russian and foreign journalists put an extremely large number of questions to Defense Minister Pavel Grachev at yesterday's press conference. Perhaps the fact that it is three months since the minister met with the press had an effect, but most likely the keenness of the questions was caused by the acute nature of the moment our Russia is living through now. Everything taking place in society is visibly reflected in the life of the troops. A tendency has emerged toward the normalization of the crime situation in the troops (the number of some types of gross law violations was reduced from 25 to 40 percent last year). As a whole, the fall and winter draft proceeded in a better and more organized manner. Pavel Grachev honestly and frankly described all of the Army's "sores" and the main tasks that the troops are resolving. Regarding the putsch the minister put it like this: Their time has passed. We must work and do our job or we shall all be left without bread. As for nuclear buttons, we have three of them. One of the buttons "went" with the president to Sochi. Grachev has the second, Chief of General Staff Mikhail Kolesnikov has the third, but since he is on a visit to France the minister has been left with the button and that is why his previously announced visit to the Leningrad Military District was deferred. In conclusion, I report to readers that it is a long time since the military from PRAVDA were invited to the Defense Ministry. Yesterday, our correspondent was there for the first time after a lengthy "vacation." We shall consider relations restored.
