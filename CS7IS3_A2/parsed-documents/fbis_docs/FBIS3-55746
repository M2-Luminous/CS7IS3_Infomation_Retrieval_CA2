Getting First Collective Experience of Localizing Civil War in Tajikistan"] [Text] The border forces which Russia has kept on the Tajik-Afghan border (the Moscow, Pyandzh, Khorog, and Ishkashim border detachments) have been clearly unable to cope with the "caravans of death" flooding across the Pyandzh River on the border. Gunmen have been bringing in from neighboring Afghanistan not only assault rifles and ammunition. Mines have been brought over by the hundreds, as have mortars, recoilless guns, and even probable "Stinger" surface-to-air systems. The Islamic gunmen soon moved from the tactics of "quiet infiltration" to blatant armed breaches of the border. This situation could not be tolerated any longer. Russia's repeated proposals to strengthen the border details with military subunits from neighboring countries in the region have finally met with a response. Initially 500 men were allocated per country. Then, on 24 September 1993, the heads of the parties to the Collective Security Treaty signed an agreement on the creation of Collective Peacekeeping Forces [CPF] in Tajikistan. Colonel General Boris Pyankov was appointed commander of the CPF. The agreement signed 24 September envisaged that the necessary military contingent would be set up by 15 October last year. This task was carried out. Subunits arrived in good time from Russia and the Republic of Uzbekistan, as did subunits allocated by the Republic of Tajikistan. Certain subunits from the Tajik Defense Ministry were made operationally subordinate to the CPF command. The question of the Kazakhstani battalion has been virtually resolved, although, because of certain differences of opinion in that country's parliament, participation by Kazakhstani servicemen in the CPF system has been somewhat delayed. The CPF are quite an impressive military force. They comprise ground force units and various kinds of aircraft. They also have tanks and artillery, air defense, engineering, and communications systems. Their main task is, together with the Russian border guards and the subunits supporting them from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and the Tajik Government troops, to close off the border as tightly as possible and to ensure reliable protection and defense of it. Everything necessary has been provided to this end. The CPF Headquarters is staffed with generals and officers from all the member states, many of whom have combat experience. Moreover, there are representatives in Tajikistan from each defense ministry. This makes it possible to rapidly solve all the problems that arise. Unfortunately there are plenty of those problems. This was confirmed yet again by the joint session of the Commonwealth foreign and defense ministers during the recent Ashgabat summit. The session heard a report from Colonel General Boris Pyankov, commander of the CPF. He stressed yet again that the main problems continue to be inadequate force staffing and funding. Moreover, there is a need to redeploy certain CPF subunits to allow them to carry out their missions more effectively. As of today a reinforced Uzbek battalion is located near the population center of Shaartuz, in direct proximity to the Tajik-Afghan border. It covers the most likely avenues for armed incursions by gunmen into the Russian Pyandzh Border Detachment's sphere of responsibility. The Kazakhstani military contingent, originally sent to reinforce the Khorog Border Detachment (Gorno-Badakhshan), is protecting Khorog Airport, accompanying convoys, and taking part in patrols. Some forces from Kyrgyzstan are being deployed in the town of Murgab (Gorno-Badakhshan), and others in the population center of Sary-Tash. A battalion is protecting the East Pamir Highway. One other battalion from Kyrgyzstan is operationally subordinate to the chief of the Ishkashim Border Detachment. During the discussion of Boris Pyankov's report the Kazakhstani side expressed doubt about the expediency of transferring its forces to the Komsomolbad region deep within Tajikistan. The reasoning is simple -- the peacekeeping forces are supposed to be used to protect the border. But the Komsomolbad region can hardly be considered quiet. As is clear from the map, it is from here that the hardline opposition plans to launch one of its strikes against Dushanbe. Moreover, Kazakhstan believes that the 500 men previously sent to reinforce the border detail do indeed represent national peacekeeping forces. That is why it would not be expedient to send yet another battalion to Tajikistan. After a brief discussion of these and other problems the decision was made to take additional measures to stabilize the situation on the state border. I think that this will solve many of the problems mentioned in Boris Pyankov's report. After all, with the coming of spring -- which is not far off in Tajikistan -- the situation on the border could deteriorate sharply. The situation in the republic remains complex. That is recognized by everyone. But the main thing -- stopping a civil war -- has been achieved. There is a chance for political and military reconciliation. The Commonwealth "Blue Helmets" are extending that chance and giving the Tajik people an opportunity to forget about the horrors of civil war and start organizing a peaceful life.
