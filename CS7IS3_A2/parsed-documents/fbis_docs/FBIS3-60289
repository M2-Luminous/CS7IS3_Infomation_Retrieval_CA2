Ecological disasters following the releases of highly toxic organic compounds in Bashkiria of 1990-92 have stimulated the development of a domestically-produced system for the protection of drinking water from dioxine and other super-ecotoxicants. For the development of a special technology and equipment more than ten Russian institutes have joined their efforts. Also participating in this work are scientists from the United States, Sweden and the Federal Republic of Germany. The project is financed by the Mayor's Office of Ufa and the Mac-Arthur Foundation of the United States. The project has no equal in world practice, since the country's chemical plants insured a unique "working area," having contaminated vast territories and water basins. The contents of dioxines done in the drinking water of Ufa during the peaks of the outbreaks exceeded the permissible level by more than ten times. The technological cycle for the unit is being worked out by the VODGEO [expansion not given] Research Institute. As the head of the project Alexander Smirnov put it, the results obtained by the present time make it possible to hope that the problem will be solved with the use of Russian technologies and materials. The expenses for removing dioxines, according to VODGEO estimates, will make up 25-30% of the total water-purification expenses.
