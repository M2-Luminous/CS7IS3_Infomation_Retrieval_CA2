FR940428-2-00074 FR940428-2-00044 OSM intends to ensure that, whatever rule is proposed and adopted, the impacts of that alternative will already have been analyzed. Therefore, it would not be necessary to again undertake the time consuming and expensive task of preparing another EIS. The alternatives in the April 1991 draft EIS were. 1. No Action Under this alternative, OSM would not promulgate new rules to clarify whether subsidence is subject to the prohibitions of section 522(e). The determination of the applicability of the prohibitions to subsidence would continue to be made by OSM and the States pursuant to the applicable approved regulatory programs. 2. No Mining Standard Underground extraction would be considered subject to the prohibitions of section 522(e). Because virtually all underground mining may eventually result in subsidence, all underground extraction would be prohibited within the 522(e) areas. Depending on the angle of draw and depth of seam characteristics, some extraction of coal outside the protected areas might also be prohibited if it would be expected to cause subsidence within the protected areas. 3. No Subsidence Standard Subsidence would be considered prohibited by section 522(e). Mining operations that would be expected to cause subsidence within the section 522(e) areas in the reasonably foreseeable future would be subject to the prohibitions of section 522(e). 4. No Material Damage Standard Subsidence that would be expected to cause material damage would be considered subject to the prohibitions of section 522(e). Unless an operator can demonstrate that underground mining would not reasonably be expected to result in subsidence that causes material damage such as functional impairment to protected surface features, structures, or facilities, underground mining would be prohibited in the section 522(e) areas. 5. Prohibitions Do Not Apply Standard Subsidence would not be considered subject to the prohibitions of section 522(e). Restrictions set forth in section 515 of SMCRA and the implementing regulations in 30 CFR part 817 would still apply. Surface activities and facilities related to underground coal mining would continue to be prohibited in the 522(e) areas. Considerations The proposed Federal actions would be programmatic national rulemaking that would clarify the meaning of statutory prohibitions, but would neither allow nor prohibit mining in any site-specific case. Therefore, the analysis in the revised draft EIS will be programmatic in nature rather than site-specific. OSM anticipates including a generic discussion of the impacts that could be expected to result from various types of surface and underground coal mining activities should they occur in each of the protected areas, 522(e)(1)&hyph;(5).
