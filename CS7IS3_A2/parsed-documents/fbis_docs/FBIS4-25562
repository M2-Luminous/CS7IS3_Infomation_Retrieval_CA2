The survey was conducted simultaneously in 57 schools of higher learning in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hubei, Guangdong, and Shaanxi. A total of 14,500 questionnaires were passed out and some 1,360 college students were interviewed and surveyed [figures as received]. The results of the survey show that college students positively support reform and opening up, and are heartened by the remarkable changes in various aspects of the national life since the reform and opening up policy was implemented. Ninety percent of the students believe that reform and opening up have "enhanced the comprehensive national strength," "raised the people's living standards," "emancipated productive forces," and "ushered in the best era in political and economic development since the founding of the PRC." Nearly one-half of the students deem that the government's measures to "respect teachers, emphasize education, and improve the condition of intellectuals" have yielded some results. Students are generally optimistic about the future of socialist market economic system, and they have a better understanding of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The majority of students believe that China will "certainly succeed" or "encounter some twists and turns but will ultimately succeed" in establishing a socialist market economic system. Of the major events of interest to the students over the past year, a considerable number of them show an interest in the publication of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. They believe that Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is "Marxism of contemporary China" and "a relatively systematic theory." Steady progress in the establishment of a socialist market economic system has sparked the students' enthusiasm to study. Compared with two years ago, they have a greater initiative and are more conscientious in study. Eighty-five percent of them say they are "more anxious than before to learn some practical knowledge." Today, the heated discussion on "going into business" among college students has cooled down, while the number of college graduates applying for postgraduate schools is on the rise. Most students, guided by society's demand, voluntarily adjust their subject of study in a bid to improve their qualification. What are the outlook on life and value concepts among college students today? The survey shows that the mainstream of students tends to have a forward-looking and noble-minded personality. They take "ideals," "conviction," "knowledge," "friendship," and "justice" as their dictums and pledge to "work hard and in a pioneering spirit in all circumstances," and to "subordinate individual interests to national and collective interests." During interviews and surveys, college students show a great interest in some major domestic and international issues. They are discontent with the "West's interference in China under the pretext of human rights issue" and hope that earnest efforts be made to correct unhealthy practices and eliminate corruption in the party and society. As far as Chinese education is concerned, they hope that the educational reform be accelerated; they are heartened by the importance attached to education by the party Central Committee, the State Council, and the entire society. It is understood that many of their constructive suggestions have been included in the agenda of educational departments and school administrators at various levels.
