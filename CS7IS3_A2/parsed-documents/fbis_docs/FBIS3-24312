Apropos of this, a conversation with Volodymyr Pylypchuk and Pavlo Minenko, department chairman at the Lviv Trade and Economic Institute, who was a member of the delegation. [Oliynyk] What was the purpose of the Ukrainian delegation's visit to Colorado? [Pylypchuk] Our first objective was to study the management system at the level of an American state and to learn what powers and rights the states have as compared to our oblasts. Which questions are decided at the government level. On which matters cooperation is necessary. In other words, the issue that has always been and still is the subject of dispute here in Ukraine -- namely, the "division of powers." Our second objective was to complete drafting a program for ending the crisis in Ukraine, a program of economic reforms. In addition, we had a third objective -- to eliminate any theoretical differences among the members of our team. It was our goal that when our team returned, we would not only have a program of extraordinary measures for ending the crisis, a program of market reforms, but also that all the members of our team would be of the same opinion and agree on a single approach to solving all issues. That this shadow cabinet, as it has been called, should virtually become a single organism. What is the situation in Yu. Zvyahilskyy's government? Ask one minister how to solve a problem and you get one answer. Ask a second minister, and you hear the opposite. Ask a third, and you get something else again. In other words, there is no one concept in the cabinet regarding what to do, how to do it, and what steps to take to conduct reforms? This is what we wanted to avoid. [Oliynyk] Was it necessary to go to America to achieve this? And why there? Was it because you received an invitation from the U.S.? [Pylypchuk] No. Our team, made up of the same people, also has the opportunity to visit Germany and Greece, but the American invitation was the first to arrive. Also, all the arrangements for meetings and instructors had already been made in the United States. Do not forget that we are on the threshhold of elections, and many members of our team are running for the office of people's deputy. Thus, the U.S. visit was our optimum option. Moreover, the United States is a traditionally capitalist country with a better defined classical variant of capitalism. [Oliynyk] Mr. Minenko, as a member of Pylypchuk's team, what did you learn from this trip? [Minenko] The two weeks we spent in Colorado were hard work, because the esteemed Mr. Pylypchuk never "got off our backs," as they say. We worked 16 hours a day. If my ideas differed somewhat, they managed to persuade me to subscribe fully to the program for ending the crisis. [Oliynyk] What kind of work did you do in the United States? [Pylypchuk] First, we listened to lectures and attended seminars conducted by lecturers and representatives of various state ministries and departments. In addition, every day after supper, we held our own four-hour seminars, at which we polished our program. [Oliynyk] In other words, you have your own program for ending the crisis. And if you head the future cabinet, you will not vacillate. Incidentally, why does the government of Ukraine ... make such poorly thought out moves? [Pylypchuk] They are not a team. The government is not equipped with reformist skills. Each minister is a very good economist at the enterprise level, at the microeconomic level. I studied the biographies of these people -- they were all wonderful directors. But the economy of an enterprise consists of production deliveries, sales, production costs, profitability, prices, wages, etc. And they apply this kind of economy at the state level, which is a fundamental mistake. Because at the state level, the economy is managed with interest, deposit, credit, currency, exchange rate, customs, and budget policies. A policy of subventions, preferences, regulation of liquidity, a reserve policy. These are completely different levers, a different sphere of action, entailing a different understanding of economics. [Oliynyk] While your were visiting the United States, strange things were happening in Ukraine. The Cabinet of Ministers consulted with the Union of Entrepreneurs, which is now headed by former Prime Minister Kuchma. It brought to mind an analogy: if one views the Cabinet of Ministers as a club of grand masters, what is its level of expertise if it invites as its consultants novice directors, including a wash-out grand master like Kuchma? What is most objectionable about this is that it is presented as an attempt to begin structural reform... [Pylypchuk] The problem is that Yu. Zvyahilskyy's government has no strategy. Every politician knows that you begin by constructing the backbone (strategy) of a policy in order to know where you are heading. Then you work out your tactics, the steps you need to take and the order in which you have to take them. You do all this without explaining anything to the directors. Only in extraordinary circumstances, when superincomprehensible situations arise, does the prime minister, the deputy prime minister, or a minister come forth with an explanation. This is when it is necessary to address the people and say something like: "For the next three months, I will be performing surgery on the economy to make it sound again. I therefore ask you to tighten you belts and not complain." The people will then understand what is going on. Right?! Whereas, if the government continually misleads the people and does not itself see the light at the end of the tunnel, then whatever it does, whether it consults with novices or explains to elders -- it is all to no purpose. Clearly, these are death throes. It is pity that the economy has been allowed to deteriorate to this state. At the same time, this is a characteristic feature of the political situation in Ukraine. We know that the communist majority in parliament gave the government its best people -- I say this without irony -- people it had groomed to govern. But this merely serves as additional proof of what communists are good for. [Oliynyk] How was your delegation received in the United States? As representatives of a poor, third-rate state, or as partners who are simply experiencing problems at this time? [Minenko] We were received at a very high level. We had meetings and discussions at the level of the U.S. Ministry of Finance [Department of Treasury], the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund. It was clear to us that we were treated as representatives of a state; moreover, we were constantly asked if Mr. Pylypchuk had really brought a team of economists with him? At the beginning, when we worked in Colorado, we spent only the first few days listening attentively to our professors. After a few days, we had to say to them: "Thank you, but we already know this." Later, the vice president of this economic institute acknowledged that the Americans who had met earlier with similar teams of economists from Armenia and Russia were impressed by the high professional level of our economists, because the level of instruction that we found uninteresting had been quite satisfactory to them. Many government institutions in the United States have created departments that deal only with Ukraine. But apart from the people who work directly with Ukraine, very few people in America know anything about our country. A notion that is still popular there, and this was confirmed even by diplomats, is that Americans approach Ukraine as a piece of the former empire. In other words, this is country located somewhere over there, in Central Europe, it has a population of 52 million people and nuclear missiles aimed at the U.S., and it refuses to disarm. This perception of Ukraine is automatically passed on to most officials. We also learned that these perceptions of Ukraine are actively promoted by the representatives of our "older brother," of whom there are a total of 500 in the Russian embassy. They have time to attend all the receptions and events. This makes it difficult to counter [such perceptions]. [Oliynyk] You have brought us to the second part of this question -- the political implication of the visit of the shadow cabinet to the United States. [Pylypchuk] A change is taking place in the perception of Ukraine, of Ukrainians, their leaders, and their specialists. The same "older brother" is spreading disinformation that Ukraine allegedly lacks experts. This gave us all the more satisfaction to surprise the Americans, who saw after meeting with us that Ukraine does have experts, and high-class ones at that. And that there exists a program for ending the crisis. To which there are no objections on the part of the International Monetary Fund, or the U.S. Ministry of Finance, or the World Bank, or the U.S. Federal Reserve System. And so the Americans wonder: why then are no reforms being effected in your country? We have the necessary people and a program they support, which their own experts would sign on to. [Oliynyk] I would also like to ask this question. How did you explain this to them? [Pylypchuk] You are not the first to ask me to explain. I told them that there are many reformers in Ukraine but that they are not part of the ruling Olympus. The opposition can propose many things, but it is not able to implement its proposals. Because it has no power. I believe that a radical change occurred in American perceptions, and they came to understand that Ukraine has the necessary forces, people, intellect, and professional qualifications. There are also worked-out programs, which are not in an embryonic stage, but which outline specifically what needs to be done and how. This is another political aspect of our visit. I would rather not go on about the future government. All this will be possible if a parliament of reformers comes to power and our collective wisdom is put to use. If this does not happen, then all of us who made this trip will at least have improved our professional skills. If the procommunist parliament returns to power, our program, like all earlier programs, will lie around gathering dust. [Minenko] I would like to note another aspect as well. I have in mind the large reserves of which Ukraine makes little use. Although our embassy is small, we have a powerful diaspora of Ukrainian descent -- people like Mr. Yurko Chopivskyy and Mr. Bohdan Futey and dozens of others, who helped us without any gain for themselves and literally gave us a shoulder to lean on to enable us to do more for Ukraine. They are very anxious to see Ukraine draw closer to America. [Oliynyk] Your team spent a week in Washington. How did things go there? [Pylypchuk] In Washington, we changed our method of working. All our experts worked in groups according to their specialization. I had my own program, which was closely linked with obtaining technical assistance for Ukraine. We agreed on 70 million dollars in technical assistance to help speed up privatization in Ukraine and 20 million dollars to enable us to create a unified computer network in Ukraine that would make corruption in privatization impossible. Our delegation met with the U.S. Vice-President Gore's representatives, Mr. Marshall, and his advisors. [Oliynyk] Do you think that the present government will try to take advantage of the results of your trip, that is, your program? [Pylypchuk] We are prepared to help the government if it is interested. We are not planning to keep our program locked away in a drawer. Except the plan for introducing a Ukrainian currency -- we will never give Zvyahilskyy's government our methodology for this. Not until we ourselves take over... Because they will ruin the method for introducing the hryvnya as they did the introduction of the coupon, and once again blame me for everything. Like they did when they claimed that I had promised that a kilogram of lemons would cost one coupon. I burned my fingers on that one. They did not use my method for introducing the coupon and then accused me of every sin in the book. Nevertheless, we are prepared to advise even this government. Because our objective is greater: to lead the economy out of its present crisis, and that is why it does not matter to us who accomplishes this -- this government or the next. [Oliynyk] What will happen in the economy until the elections are held? What do you predict? [Pylypchuk] I have no wish to alarm people by painting everything in black tones, but the economy will continue to function at a primitive level. [Oliynyk] Could you tell us the professional composition of the group that accompanied you to the United States and which is made up of people you count on. For ethical reasons it would be inopportune to give us their names, even though it is generally known that the group included Professor Chernyak and others. [Pylypchuk] If we were to speak of the cabinet in broader terms -- I have in mind the provisional future cabinet -- this team is much larger: it consists of more than 200 people. There is a humanitarian bloc, a power bloc, and an economic block, which, incidentally, is made up of 60 people, only half of whom visited the U.S. This group includes people who are working for the present Cabinet of Ministers, people who are involved in reforms, as well as people from the executive branch. I think that should suffice. This was my sixth visit to the United States, and each time during my first days there I have been overcome by despair... There are poor people in America; they make up 15 percent of the population. This time I came back with a video cassette portraying a "poor" American. What kind of living standard does this poor person have? This "pauper" has a three-storied house with eight rooms, albeit narrow in width. No one has such a cottage in Ukraine. I do not have one, nor do any of the moneybags who are today scaling the Olympus of power in our country. Let alone the furniture in these buildings -- our underground millionaires would be lucky to have such furniture here. But by American standards, this is poverty. Our society's living standard has yet to reach the level at which it could be regarded as impoverished by American standards. At the same time, I would like to say something else: at present, Ukraine is a diamond that has not yet been polished and is lying in the dust so that many think it to be plain glass. All that this Ukrainian diamond needs is to be polished a tiny bit and put into a dependable setting, and it will sparkle with many brilliant colors. To those who have already buried Ukraine, I would like to say: do not be in such a hurry. Ukraine is capable of very quickly becoming one of the top ten most developed countries in the world, including in terms of its living standard. Ukraine is poor because this parliament and this government are in power. This is her problem, but it is not her fault. That is why we now face the supertask of electing a normal parliament, which will form a normal government and a normal bank that will enable us to rise to the level warranted by our potential capabilities.
