FR940302-1-00020 FR940302-1-00007 40 CFR Part 68 [FRL&hyph;4843&hyph;4] List of Regulated Substances for Accidental Release Prevention Under Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act as Amended; Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Release Prevention Under Section 112(r)(7) of the Clean Air Act as Amended AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Supplemental notice; extension of comment period. SUMMARY: The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, signed into law on November 15, 1990, include provisions for chemical accident prevention. On January 31, 1994, the Environmental Protection Agency promulgated the list of regulated substances and thresholds required under section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act as Amended (59 FR 4478). The list and threshold quantities will identify facilities subject to chemical accident prevention regulations to be promulgated under section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act as Amended; a proposed regulation for such requirements was published in the Federal Register on October 20, 1993 (58 FR 54190). In promulgating the list, EPA deferred action on the proposed threshold quantities exemption for listed flammable substances when used solely for facility consumption as fuel (see 58 FR 5102, 5120, (January 19, 1993)). A supplemental notice was published on January 31, 1994 (59 FR 4500), requesting additional public comment on the hazards associated with flammable substances used as fuel and the appropriateness of the proposed exemption. In addition, EPA also requested comments on the impacts of proposed accident prevention requirements in the absence of an exemption, and on ways of reducing the impacts of these requirements. This notice extends the public comment period for the supplemental notice. DATES: The comment period for the supplemental notice will be extended from the original closing date of March 2, 1994 to April 1, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed or submitted to: Environmental Protection Agency, Attn: Docket No. (A&hyph;91&hyph;74), room 1500, Waterside Mall, 401 M Street S.W., Washington, DC 20460. Comment must be submitted in triplicate.
