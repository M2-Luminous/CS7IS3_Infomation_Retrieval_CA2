"ICRC has been talking to the Chinese Government on the question of access to prisoners for a number of years now. There's nothing new there," Jean-Michel Monod, the ICRC's delegate-general for Asia and the Pacific, told reporters. Monod, who has been participating in these talks, said, however, that the position of Red Cross negotiators has improved since Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen last November 9 officially invited the Red Cross for talks. Prior to Qian's announcement, China had always denounced such requests as tantamount to interfering in the internal affairs of a sovereign state. The announcement came shortly before a U.S.-China summit which was expected to focus on human rights issues, including access to political prisoners, a demand the U.S. had raised repeatedly hoping visits would reduce torture and other abuses. "I do not wish that these negotiations are perceived exclusively in the framework of the U.S.-China relationship over MFN (most- favored nation status)," Monod said, adding that access to political prisoners is a longstanding, traditional Red Cross concern beyond all national interests. U.S. President Bill Clinton has warned that he will not extend preferential trade treatment when MFN comes up for renewal in June unless China improves up its poor human rights record. The Red Cross has checked jails in over 50 countries and will not modify its conditions for visits to Chinese prisons, Monod said. Concerning the talks in Beijing in mid-January, it is far too early to speak about a "half access or a quarter opening or a tenth of a promise," he said, predicting it will be a "long process" until China accepts the idea of a neutral humanitarian organization entering its prisons in order to protect the detainees' rights. Meanwhile, the Red Cross has spelled out its terms for the visits, "the same conditions as for any other country," which will be discussed in a number of more technical follow-ups focusing on the wording and legal problems, Monod said. Once a government gives the green light for prison checks the Red Cross insists on free access to all prisoners of a previously defined category. Prisoners may not be transferred from their actual place of detention, must be allowed to talk in private, and be guaranteed continued contact with Red Cross personnel. Given that negotiations are still in their infancy and that defining the content of an ICRC visit or the category of prisoners is already "really difficult," Monod warned against high hopes for a quick solution to the issue. "We will try to solve all the issues step by step," he said, adding that it is anybody's guess when the first prison visit would be realized.
