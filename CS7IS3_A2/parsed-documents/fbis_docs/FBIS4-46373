He said that the PFLP will not take a negative stand toward the establishments that serve the citizens but will seek to improve them and develop their social and national acts and performance in a way that serves our policies and views while extending the necessary services to the citizens. In an exclusive statement to AL-QUDS, Dr. Habash said that the way the Palestinian forces who reject the agreement will confront the Palestinian self-rule authority will not go outside the pragmatic forms which are now known to everyone -- political, and media struggle. He added: These forms will remain valid and suitable even after the implementation of the agreement. Any change in these forms will remain within this framework and we will not deviate from it as a rule, unless the Palestinian authority resorts to violence against the masses and forces that reject the agreement. He stressed that he will not be the first to resort to violence. Habash noted that the loopholes in the agreement and its inherent contradictions are not enough to bring it down, but action is needed to turn the slogan of foiling the agreement into a practical one. He said that the forces rejecting the agreement are determined to formalize their opposition through effective and influential popular, mass, and political actions. Habash stressed that these forces will seriously work to complete the widely based national and Islamic front and rebuild the PLO on national, democratic, and struggle bases in accordance with the national program and charter so as to allow as much participation as possible by most sectors of our people inside and outside the territories.
