The last will remain in Rwanda as long as the United Nations wants them to remain. All Belgians are due to have left by 19 April. The Spanish military are due to fly them out in two flights a day today and tomorrow. The two Spanish Air Force Hercules planes have landed again in Kigali. This time the aim is to pick up military equipment and Belgian Blue Helmets. The evacuation of this battalion is to be completed in just a few days. The Spanish Hercules landed in Kigali at 2000; the landing strip was well marked, but the orders were that the planes had to fly without lights for security reasons. [Captain Javier Frias] We started our descent, but the air controller in Kigali told us to stop going down because shots were being fired. [Bandres] In principle, the Spanish mission is due to finish on Thursday, 21 April, returning to Spain through Brussels in order to drop the Belgian soldiers off in their country.
