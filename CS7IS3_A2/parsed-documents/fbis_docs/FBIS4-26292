The proposal, contained in a message from South Korean Prime Minister Yi Yong-dok [name, title as received] to his DPRK counterpart Kang Song-san, said that a three-member delegation from each side headed by a deputy prime minister will meet at the truce village of Panmunjom. South Korean President Kim Yong-sam accepted a proposal by DPRK President Kim Il-song to hold an inter-Korean summit through former president of the United States Jimmy Carter here last Saturday. "I was authorized to let you know that we agree to the proposal as it is the most ideal event considering the inward and outward conditions of our country and the fervent wish of our people," Yi Yong-dok said in the message. He noted that the burden on both South Korea and the DPRK has been getting heavier over the past half-century because of distrust and confrontation. "We have been saying that a meeting of the top leaders is favorable if it would quickly dissolve the south-north tension aroused by the nuclear problem and settle a relationship of reconciliation and cooperation by opening the door to peaceful reunification of our country," Yi said. Carter had visited South Korea and the DPRK from June 13 to 18 as "a private capacity" and exchanged views with Kim Yong-sam and Kim Il-song respectively on the situation on the Korean peninsula, including the nuclear issues. Kim Yong-sam, upon hearing of Kim Il-song's wish to meet him at any time, anywhere without pre-conditions at an early date, told Carter on June 18 that he will accept the offer "without any hesitation."
