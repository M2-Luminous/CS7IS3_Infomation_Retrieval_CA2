Narasimha Rao visits Germany next month there will be considerable pressure for his support for this media project which will enhance German influence in India. However, Information and Broadcasting Secretary Bhaskar Ghose said there was no move so far to review the landmark Cabinet decisions of 1955 and 1956 which forbids publication of foreign-owned newspapers and the operation of foreign news agencies in India. The Ministry, he said, had not forwarded any such proposal to the Cabinet. The aim of the 1955 regulation is to protect the Indian newspaper industry from foreign competition. The 1956 Cabinet noting on the wire services says no news agency can operate directly from India. Whatever stories they wish to distribute in India have to be through the Indian news agencies PTI and UNI after being whetted by them. Foreign news agencies have been making several attempts to operate from India. But in the wake of economic liberalisation certain sections of the government, including the Finance Ministry, are said to be eager to open up the media too. In the last couple of years foreign newspapers and wire services have been desperate to get a toe-hold in India so that they have better and faster dispersal of their publications and services in the region. Towards the end of 1992 international lending agencies like IMF, World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank put pressure on Manmohan Singh and the Reserve Bank to improve the financial information services and allow operation of financial news services like Knight Ridder and Telerad (both British). In violation of the 1956 regulation they were given permission. However, I&B ministry is believed to have opposed it. After this REUTER de-linked its financial news from PTI and has been coming out as a separate service from India for distribution to special clients. At one stage the INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE, with the support of the Hindujas, wanted to come out from India. Though the proposal was supported by Manmohan Singh, it did not go through. But in the brief tenure of former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar, a FINANCIAL TIMES of London and Modi's tieup was approved. The approval was given by the Industry Ministry as an industrial venture without considering the relevant press laws or getting the Information and Broadcasting Ministry support. Subsequently the Modis backed out of the project and Aveek Sarkar of Ananda Bazar Patrika stepped in as the partner using the same approval. TIME magazine too is eager to publish from India and Living Media Ltd, publishers of INDIA TODAY magazine, has applied for clearing of the project.
