China is Russia's second largest trading partner after Germany. Station observer (Masenko) notes: In discussing economic cooperation and trade between Russia and China, we should note qualitative changes that have taken place in this respect. While bilateral trade was exclusively carried out by the government in the past, close to 80 percent of trade is now being conducted directly by enterprises that are partners. Russia's export structure has undergone favorable changes, with substantial decreases in the export of raw materials and increases in the export of machinery products to China. The export volume of machinery products, for example, accounted for approximately 40 percent of Russia's total export volume to China last year. Our country's manufacturers of electrical appliances and machinery have secured a solid foothold in the Chinese market. Some 170 million people in China are still without electricity. China's electricity shortage has greatly impeded econonic development. The energy development plan adopted by China has provided Russia with tremendous possibilities. With Russia's assistance, China is now building three large thermal power stations and will complete all 23 [as heard] powerful thermal power plants over the next few years. Moreover, Russia will help in the construction of a nuclear power plant in the northeast province of Liaoning. In addition to power generation equipment, China purchases automobiles, aircraft, metalworking machine tools, and construction technology from Russia. The main strengths of various technologies developed by Russia are very reliable; they are easy to apply and their costs are reasonable. They often play a decisive role for China's import units. Despite growing trade between the two countries, the two sides have yet to score substantial achievements in making investments in each other's country. Russia now has more than 300 joint ventures, of which only a few dozen manufacture goods and provide services; the majority are engaged in trade and serve as agents. The adoption of a prudent approach by the Chinese people is completely understandable. Russia is in an economic crisis; it offers no reliable guarantees for investment because it frequently changes its laws on foreign economic activities. All this is not conducive to the massive infusion of foreign capital into our country. There are also other problems in the trade contacts between Russia and China. The two sides have openly discussed these problems but also say that they should be aware of key advantages in spite of the difficulties; that is, objectively speaking, Russia and China need and complement each other. Russia has the goods that China needs badly, and China can provide Russian with the goods it needs. Our two countries share many common points, among which are a common border extending more than 4,000 kilometers and largely similar problems that should be resolved during the process of economic reform. In the 1950's, China laid the foundation for its industry with the assistance of the former Soviet Union, which was actually Russia; this also played a certain role. It is impossible to rewrite the aforementioned segment of history. As their relations have entered a phase of cooperation based on equality and reciprocity after the two countries ridded themselves of ideological dogma, China cannot forget the assistance provided by Russia, and the two sides hope to maintain their partnership and ensure that their trade contacts will expand steadily over the long term.
