Regulatory Framework The TPA sets milestones to achieve coordinated cleanup of the Hanford Site and provides a legal and procedural framework for regulatory compliance during cleanup. During the development of both EISs, DOE intends to fully comply with the TPA, as modified by the change control process. Federal and State laws that are of major importance to waste management activities at Hanford include the Atomic Energy Act of 1954; RCRA; the Washington State Hazardous Waste Management Act, Chapter 70.105 RCW; and the Federal Facility Compliance Act of 1992. The Atomic Energy Act requires the management, processing, and use of radioactive materials in a manner that protects workers, public health, and the environment. RCRA and the Washington State Hazardous Waste Management Act establish requirements for management of hazardous waste, including generation, treatment, storage, transportation, and disposal. RCRA also requires cleanup of hazardous waste releases from past and present operations when the releases pose a threat to human health or the environment. Related NEPA Documentation NEPA documents that have been or are being prepared for activities at Hanford include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) Final Environmental Impact Statement for Disposal of Hanford Defense High-Level Transuranic and Tank Wastes, Hanford Site, Richland Washington, DOE/EIS&hyph;0113, Vol. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, December 1987. U.S. Department of Energy, Washington, D.C. As discussed in the Background section of this notice, the HDW EIS analyzed the impacts of Hanford tank waste treatment and disposal. (2) Final Environmental Statement for Waste Management Operations, Hanford Reservation, Richland Washington, ERDA&hyph;1538, Vol.1 and 2, 1975. U.S. Energy Research and Development Administration, Washington, D.C. This EIS analyzed the environmental impacts of Hanford Site waste management operations. (3) Hanford Remedial Action-Environmental Impact Statement. The HRA-EIS will assess the potential environmental consequences of alternatives for conducting a remedial action program at the Hanford Site for inactive hazardous, high- and low-level radioactive, transuranic and mixed-waste sites. DOE published a NOI to prepare the HRA-EIS on August 21, 1992 (47 FR 37959&hyph;37964) and intends to issue the draft HRA-EIS in 1994. (4) Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement for Environmental Restoration and Waste Management. The EM-PEIS will analyze the complex- wide environmental restoration and waste management issues and alternatives. DOE published the NOI to prepare the EM-PEIS on October 22, 1990 (55 FR 42633) and issued the Implementation Plan on December 23, 1993. The TWRS EIS will discuss its relationship to the EM-PEIS and how issues addressed in the EM-PEIS could affect the alternatives analyzed in the TWRS EIS. (5) Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement for Reconfiguration of the Nuclear Weapons Complex (DP-PEIS). The DP-PEIS will analyze longterm reconfiguration strategies and evaluate those strategies against the consequences of maintaining existing defense production facilities. DOE published an Implementation Plan in February 1992. In July 1993, DOE published a revised NOI and intends to issue a revised Implementation Plan based on that NOI. (6) Tank Safety Environmental Assessments. DOE has completed eight environmental assessments and issued corresponding findings of no significant impact for activities to sample and characterize tank wastes or to modify tank equipment to improve safety conditions. (7) Stabilization Operations at the Plutonium Finishing Plant. In September 1993, DOE announced plans to prepare an EA for this proposed action and invited public comments on the scope. On the basis of comments, including those received at four public meetings, DOE is considering whether to prepare an EIS instead. Alternatives under consideration may generate liquid high-level wastes requiring storage in the Hanford tank farm. Issued in Washington, DC, this 25th day of January, 1994. Peter N. Brush, Acting Assistant Secretary, Environment, Safety and Health. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;1932 Filed 1&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;P
