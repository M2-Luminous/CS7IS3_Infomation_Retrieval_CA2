Despite the briefness of the visit, Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings declared Castro's stopover an official visit. In remarks made in Barbados, where he participated in the first Global Conference on Sustainable Development of Small Island States, Castro said that in keeping with our revolutionary convictions, we feel solidarity with all African nations. He added that Mandela is the leader with the necessary talent and wisdom required right now in South Africa. During his last day in Barbados, Castro was moved and saddened upon throwing a wreath into the Caribbean off the coast where, 18 years ago, a Cuban commercial plane sank, sabotaged by individuals paid by the U.S. CIA.
