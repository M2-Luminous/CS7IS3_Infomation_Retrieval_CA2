The People's Assembly discussed this criminal act again today. In today's proceedings, in the name of the government, Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi presented a report concerning the Albanian-Greek relations in the light of the present crisis. Our reporter, present at today's session, has prepared the following report: The 10 April tragic event continues to be at the center of our public's attention. After the official pronouncement and that of the various political forces, associations, etc. at today's People's Assembly session, in the name of the government Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi spoke about Albanian-Greek relations in light of the recent events. In his speech to the deputies he said: [Begin Serreqi recording] As I will shortly summarize, the course of Albanian-Greek relations, as neighboring countries and peoples and as the most ancient peoples in the region, shows that the general framework of interstate relations is at first view characterized by several zig-zags and oscillations. In its essence, it has, however, some constants and several conditions that should be accepted and objectively and realistically assessed. On the basis of mutual efforts and reciprocal interest and respect, efforts should be made to smooth out these zig-zags, and if possible to eliminate them. I should first assert that Albania has put an end to isolation once and for all -- the isolation of its policy and the Don Quixotism of the policy of drop dead toward the whole world. Albania is simultaneously liberated from that illusory naivete so that we will ensure a continuous and permanent assistance from everyone, without a justification and motivation. What are those circumstances that have conditioned and still condition Albanian-Greek relations? I would say that first, it is the reality of present Albania, of an Albania that has taken the road of democracy, an Albania that is already passing the transition successfully and is accomplishing the market economy. Second, it is the internal Greek reality, of which I hope that you have been informed. Third, it is the fact that we are neighboring countries, and between neighboring countries relations of neighborliness are, of course, liberated from the illusion of good unconditional neighborliness. Of course there are problems, however, between neighbors and these problems should be overcome. I want to stress that there is a very important thesis, i.e., the stance toward the crisis in former Yugoslavia which, despite the actual elements, is taking proportions almost similar to a Balkan crisis. In connection with this, I want to differentiate what is the stance toward the great all-national Albanian problem. Finally, I should take into consideration the circumstances that Greece is the only Balkan country, member of the European Union, which is not running successfully the presidency for its six-month period. Greece is a NATO member -- even this is a circumstance that should be considered. There is also another very important circumstance -- the admission of the early Albanians in Greece and the admission of the Greek minority in Albania. Of course, the policy of a state, its philosophy toward the minority, and the democratic dimension of a society can turn a minority into a communication bridge that eases relations, but simultaneously can turn it into a Trojan Horse or a factor that aggravates them. There is also another problem. It is the Cam problem, which is put forward by the diplomacy of the democratic government and which should not be ignored. There exists another circumstance which has influenced, though not little, the Albanian-Greek relations -- the mentality, technocratic philosophy, and the influence of the Greek church in the entire policy of the Greek state, the Greek Government, and the attempts to infringe the autocephaly of the Albanian Church. At the same time, there are circles and mentalities which are not liberated from historically known prejudices of the Greek policy, such as expansionism and the North Epirus claims. We are all informed that certain circles, which can by no means be believed when they claim to be completely unsupported or only partly supported by the Greek Government, follow a policy with a [word indistinct] tendency in that sphere that they consider to be their area. In connection with this, it is not at all difficult to make an analysis how the assistance is spread. Not only in the humanitarian aspect, but also concerning the activity of the economic assistance and the Greek business in Albania, we will observe a geography that does not conform to those criteria and priorities that our country possesses for the northeastern areas, as the areas with the most difficult situations and the most backward areas from the economic point of view. It is clear to all that the Greek side has not had a demarcation line and a clear attitude between economic cooperation with Albania and the efforts to exploit this with a [word indistinct] tendency. In connection with this, I want to stress that Albania, as I first said, is not at all against cooperation and harmony in all fields. However, from now on, as Albania has always considered this, but from now on more clearly, Albania will separate what is called a cooperation with the one that is called Hellenism. Another element that should be considered is the presence of the Albanian economic emigrants in Greece. No one from us here wants Albanian-Greek relations to bring economic consequences to the Albanian families. On this occasion, I want to avail myself of the opportunity to thank the generosity of the Greek people who have welcomed the Albanian emigrants at this difficult period of transition and in a way have eased those economic difficulties that our country was encountering during this period. At the same time, I want to make clear that the Albanian economic emigration is not at all a source of the increase of crime in Greece, a claim which has been several times put forward by the Greek side. I want to remind you that if we make an analysis of the Greek emigrants in other countries, we will recollect that at its peak, the Greek emigrants in the United States have the responsibility for the highest crime rate in the United States, as the Italian emigrants kept it at the time of its highest peak in Italy. Thus, if we consider all these conditions and factors that condition Albanian-Greek relations, we would say that in the relations between Albania and Greece, there has been a constant that, if at first looks like a zig-zag -- sometimes very good and sometimes very aggravated relations --, this is an illusory conclusion. There is a dimension that is connected to the internal situations, there is a dimension that is connected to bilateral relations, there is a dimension that is related to the regional situation, and there is a dimension that is more widely connected to our whole continent. First, I want to stress once again that, as we all know, the unprecedented terroristic act that occurred on 10 April can be blamed on the Greek Government. I do not consider it as lightning that strikes in a cloudless sky, but as part of the wave of previous events. I want to stress that all the Albanian political forces in general have agreed with the way the event has been treated. Perhaps there may be a difference in approving or not the reactions of the Albanian Government and in the degree of responsibility of the Greek Government. The thing that strikes you most is the reaction or non-reaction of the Greek Government, the fact of not taking the responsibility, the absence of cooperation needed to throw light on the event, something that may have been partly corrected after the reactions of the Albanian Government, reactions that are already known. I hope there is no need to discuss it any longer. What are the recent events? The recent event is the proposal that came through the diplomatic channel from the Greek Government to cooperate in a joint commission that will investigate and examine the event in detail, and a proposal for a meeting between the foreign ministers in a neutral country or at a multilateral activity. Concerning these two proposals, because as I mentioned above, the policy of closing has finished for us, we are for dialogue and for overcoming the difficulties, considering that a tension in the south will highly aggravate the situation in the region. Concerning these two proposals, the Albanian Government has answered positively, both for the joint investigation of the event and a possible meeting between foreign ministers. I have proposed a meeting in Bucharest on the occasion of the activity of Crans Montana, where I am invited and I will attend. Regarding the international reaction, you know that the whole problem is up for discussion at the Security Council and it will be examined at a meeting of European Union foreign ministers. The case is put forward in the CSCE structures and the High Commission for Human Rights. Generally speaking and in a clear way, it results that the act has been condemned, the responsibility of the Greek Government has come out clearly, and the stance of the Albanian Government has been approved. In conclusion, I judge that we should have no complexes and debasements, as the country's sovereignty, the fate of democracy, reform, European integrity and above all the grand pan-Albanian problem cannot pass through any capital of the world, cannot pass through any party in the world, whatever and wherever it can be, even less through Athens and through PASOK [Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement]. They are more than ever in the hand of the Albanian democratic sovereign state and of the Albanians everywhere in the world, as history [word indistinct) years. Thank you. [end recording] The People's Assembly ended proceedings for this week. The next session opens at 1000 on Wednesday.
