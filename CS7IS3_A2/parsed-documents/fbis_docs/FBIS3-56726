It was pointed out at a press conference that the decision was not related to the executive branch representatives' unwillingness to cooperate with the new chief of administration, nor was it a protest against his appointment. The government did so proceeding from generally applied standards: Once a chief is gone, his cabinet goes, too. The new governor has asked all members of the oblast administration to stay on until February, when a new Sverdlovsk Oblast government will be formed.
