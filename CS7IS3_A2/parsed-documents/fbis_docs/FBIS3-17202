Payments to the Defense Ministry are constantly being delayed. The government's debts to the suppliers of defense production and the military are growing all the time. At present, they stand at 3 trillion rubles. In February-March, 70 percent of servicemen did not receive their money allowances. If the current pattern of financing the industry, including defense enterprises, remains unchanged, there will be no hope to receive the revenues that are planned in the draft budget. Approving the second-quarter budget in accordance with the estimates presented by the Finance Ministry, Mr. Kokoshin believes, would only exacerbate the critical situation regarding budget revenues; as a result, not only the Defense Ministry and the defense industry, but the entire budget sector of the Russian economy will disintegrate. The Defense Ministry stands first of all for purposeful, joint efforts by the executive and legislative branches aimed at increasing the budget revenues. The government and the State Duma need to approve a list of emergency measures to lend substance to the budget's revenue part in a realistic fashion. In that regard Mr. Kokoshin thinks it necessary: to resolve the problems of enterprises' mutual debts by using commodities and financial bills of exchange; to make a one-time investment of money in the industry to restart the industries that have suspended production; and to pass legislation tightening punishment for tax evasion. If these measures are taken everyone will be better off, including the Defense Ministry, Andrey Kokoshin said. If the current situation with regard to budget revenues is preserved, social turmoil and an irreparable collapse of the domestic industry are inevitable.
