As the delegation arrived, the Libyan press was calling on Chad to reconsider its relations with Paris. It has appealed to Ndjamena to cut its ties with France. The interest of the Chadian people, writes the Tripoli daily, AL-SHAMS, is to prevent the return of the colonialists in order to consolidate its relations with neighboring states. These comments undoubtedly reflect an official viewpoint. The same tone can be found in the columns of the daily AL-JAMAHIRIYAH, where France's involvement in Chad is described as harmful. These anti-French attacks come at a time when Ndjamena is trying to obtain Libya's withdrawal from the Aouzou Strip. After the failure of initial contacts in Ndjamena on 17 March, Chad threatened to refer the dispute to the United Nations Security Council in order to force Libya to respect the verdict of the International Court in The Hague, which recognizes Chad's claim to the Aouzou Strip. In this context, Libya's attacks against France look like a maneuver aimed at delaying its withdrawal from the Aouzou Strip. Moreover, Tripoli has had a grudge against France ever since France blamed Libyans for the bomb attack which downed a UTA plane in 1989. On the basis of a military accord with Chad, France has a military presence in Chad with the Epervier operation, which is not of course to Libya's liking.
