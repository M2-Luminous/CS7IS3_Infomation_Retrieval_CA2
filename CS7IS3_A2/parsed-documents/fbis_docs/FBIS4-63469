[Begin Saburov recording] The reaction by Kravchuk was completely uncalled for. When you ask for the law to be observed, you cannot then introduce a state of emergency. That is true, unless you have some ulterior motives, so to speak. As for ulterior motives, I do not know who thinks they are ulterior. They are all out in the open, completely open to view. Here we are talking about the Ukrainian presidential election. Everything that is happening in Crimea is linked to this issue alone. It is the only way for Leonid Makarevich Kravchuk to call off the presidential election. Therefore, strictly speaking, it will be completely inaccurate to talk about Ukraine here. Here we should be talking about a number of characters in the Kiev leadership who are prepared to risk a lot in pursuit of their own goals. So, how far are they prepared to go? This, incidentally, is a matter for their consciences. [end recording]
