FBIS4-628 "drafr071_c_94042" FBIS-AFR-94-071 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 13 Apr South African Press Review for 13 Apr MB1304135194 MB1304135194 BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR Fall of Financial Rand -- Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 13 April in a page-12 editorial remarks that the "free fall" of the financial rand (finrand) on 11 April is "simply a direct message of a massive collapse in overseas confidence." However, the "finrand's weakening will not affect the economy materially in the short term. This market is relatively thin, restricted to non-residents, and subject to wide fluctuation. But the fall has wider implications: continuing fears about our future could kill hopes of massive investment in this country and, without this, the hope of massive reconstruction will also die." Only the country's leaders have a chance to "pull us back from the abyss." `Folly' To Send Peacekeeping Force to East Rand Townships -- A second editorial on the same page believes it was "misguided" to deploy units of the National Peacekeeping Force (NPKF) in the troubled East Rand townships. The record of the NPKF "hardly inspires confidence." THE STAR refers to "desertions, undisciplined behaviour, fractiousness and racist outburts," and "to cap it all: only days before its first graduates were sent into the field, its chief of staff was summarily dismissed after being charged with drunken driving in an official vehicle." To send the NPKF to the East Rand townships seems "the height of folly, particularly as the force is seen by pro-IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] hostel residents as the ANC's armed wing in a new guise." BUSINESS DAY SANCO `Conscience' To Prod New Government Welcome -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 13 April in a page-12 editorial states that groups such as the South African National Civic Organization (SANCO) "have a useful role in a future South Africa." "True, SANCO, or at least many of its most prominent leaders like Moses Mayekiso and his advisers, are unrehabilitated Marxists wh? have made few allowances to the way the world has changed over the past 10 years, and their perspectives are, for that reason, often rather flawed." But, "whatever SANCO's shortcomings, it will do no harm to have a left-wing `conscience' prodding those in the new government who may be prone to adopt the fat cat attitudes of their predecessors." SOWETAN Paper `Pessimistic' About International Mediation Outcome -- "It is naive to believe the mediation team will be able to solve the immediate and practical problems related to the elections later this month," declares a page-6 editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 13 April. "The violence in places like Natal has gained a momentum of its own and will feed on itself for some time to come. The IFP's proposal for a postponement of the poll is also a non- starter with the ANC adamant April 27 `is sacrosanct'. We will have to resign ourselves to the fact that a free and fair election in kwaZulu is not going to be possible and that the birth of a democratic South Africa will be marked by bloodshed. The mediation team will be well advised to focus primarily on the outstanding constitutional issues like the powers of regions." Amicable mediation and agreements on these issues "could defuse some of the tensions in the country and help the proposed Government of National Unity to find its feet. While we are pessimistic about the outcome, we urge all the parties involved to give the mediation process their best shot."
