"The incidents that took place can be divided into two categories. The first involves people wanting to put political pressure on the government, while those responsible for the second category are terrorists," Chawalit said at a press conference after a 90-minute meeting with senior police officers. Chawalit said the March 3 grenade assault on Social Action leader Montri Phongphanit's home, the March 8 bomb attack on a train in Songkhla's Chana district, the March 9 grenade attack on Deputy Permanent Secretary for Interior Sawai Phramani, the March 13 grenade attack on the Nakhon Phanom governor's residence and the March 20 blast in downtown Hat Yai in Songkhla province fell into the first category. [passage omitted] But he claimed the attacks carried out by disaffected political elements with the aim of destabilizing the government were not of national significance. "For example, the grenade attack in Nakhon Phanom (at the provincial governor's home) may be a mistake on the part of the assailants," he said. "Acts of terrorism usually intensify and eventually lead to armed struggle, which is exactly what happened in our country in the past," he said. [passage omitted]
