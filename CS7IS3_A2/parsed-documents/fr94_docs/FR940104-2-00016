Continuous employment prior to surrender of Corregidor to the Japanese on May 6, 1942, to gain recognition for the time spent in the civilian internment camps, and 4.

Upon confirmation of an applicant's eligibility the DD&hyph;214 will be passed to the Awards and Decorations office to determine which ribbons the applicant is eligible to receive (campaign ribbons, theater ribbons, victory medal, etc.). Specific awards (i.e., Silver Star, Purple Heart, etc.) need separate justification detailing the act, achievement, or service believed to warrant the appropriate medal/ribbon. DD Forms 2168 are available from VA offices or from the U.S. Air Force offices in this notice. For further information contact Lt. Col.
