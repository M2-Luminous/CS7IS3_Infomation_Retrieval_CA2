Katyal: "G-15 Relevance Reaffirmed"] [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 13--The presence here of the Malaysian Prime Minister, Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, and the Zimbabwe President, Mr. Robert Mugabe, and their talks with the Prime Minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, and other government representatives today were notable for the reaffirmation of support to the G-15 and its efforts to articulate the aspirations of the South. The decision of the two dignitaries to stick to their plans to visit India even after the postponement of the summit was a symbolic gesture intended to convey their faith in the relevance of the grouping and their interest to strengthen it. This was evident from their interaction with the Indian leaders. The meaning of the gesture was, certainly, not lost. The postponed summit, it became clear after today's talks, will be held either in the last week of March or first week of April. And, as was decided by the permanent representatives of the member-countries, the format of the grouping would remain unchanged--the quorum will continue to be 10; the summit will be held, as in the past, once a year; and representation in it will continue to be confined to the heads of State or government. These decisions were approved by the Ministers from all but three of the 15 who met towards the end of last week. China and Iran had shown interest in associating themselves with the G-15--the former as an observer, the latter as a member. This was among the significant points of last week's discussions which may figure in the talks of Dr. Mahathir Mohamed and Mr. Mugabe, due to be continued tomorrow. A formal decision on new members could, however, be taken by the summit. Dr. Mahathir, who arrived here yesterday, was accorded a ceremonial welcome this morning in the forecourt of Rashtrapati Bhavan. He met Mr. Rao for informal consultations, followed by lunch, at the latter's residence. A meeting with a group of Indian businessmen before lunch, and a call on the President, Dr. S.D. Sharma, in the afternoon were the other highlights of his programme. The Finance Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, and the Railway Minister, Mr. Jaffar Sharif, called on the visiting Prime Minister. Mr. Mugabe, who arrived in the morning too, was given a ceremonial reception at Rashtrapati Bhavan. In the afternoon, he and Mr. Rao met with their delegations. Later, the two held talks without aides. Promoting cooperation Mr. Mugabe's delegation-level talks with Mr. Rao and the Malaysian Prime Minister's informal discussions with Indian businessmen were part of their other objective--to utilise the visits for considering ways to promote bilateral cooperation, specially in the economic field. Mr. Mugabe met the representative of the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII), while Dr. Mahathir Mohamed will see them at a lunch to be hosted by it tomorrow. The former's plan to visit the National Small Industries Corporation and the latter's programme to go to the Maruti factory tomorrow reflect their interests--Malaysia is keen on expanding opportunities for business and industrial cooperation (the two sides are to sign agreements for joint ventures) while Zimbabwe counts on India's help in rural, small and agro-based industries, extension services, and simple technology, related to its needs. Soon, Zimbabwe will take over huge farms, which continued to be managed by the whites since its independence 13 years ago, and distribute the land among the blacks. It will, therefore, be interested in India's help in building its infrastructure in the agricultural sector. The informal talks between the Prime Ministers of India and Malaysia related, apart from G-15-related items like the updating of the draft summit communique, to the role of the U.N. and its peace-keeping operations and human rights. Bilateral cooperation was the main subject of discussion between Dr. Sharma and Dr. Mahathir Mohamed. Asian countries, according to them, had made significant strides in the industrial and technological fields and there was immense scope for cooperation among them in the economic spheres. In their opinion, developing countries could achieve a lot by sharing their experiences in development and pooling their resources for the common good and prosperity.
