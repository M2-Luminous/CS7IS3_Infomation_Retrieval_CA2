FR940217-2-00011 FR940217-2-00006 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Endangered Species; Permits AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), NOAA, Commerce. ACTION: Issuance of modification # 2 to scientific research permit No. 747 (P45H). On August 8, 1991 (56 FR 40312), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) issued Permit No. 747 under the authority of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) (U.S.C. 1531&hyph;1543) and the NMFS regulations governing endangered fish and wildlife (50 CFR parts 217&hyph;227). On March 3, 1993 (58 FR 14202) NMFS issued an emergency modification to Permit No. 747, to be valid through December 31, 1993. On November 26, 1993 (58 FR 62328) notification was published that FWS has applied for a modification which would authorize them to continue the activities authorized in the March 3, 1993 emergency modification for the duration of the permit. Notice is hereby given that on January 26, 1994, NMFS issued Modification # 2 to Permit 747, authorizing the above request. Permit 747 authorizes scientific research on and captive propagation of Sacramento River winter-run chinook ( Oncorhynchus tshawytscha ), including the capture of up to 20 adults per year for broodstock purposes, the incubations of up to 35,000 of their eggs, and the rearing of the resulting juveniles for release into the upper Sacramento River. These activities are permitted through December 31, 1995. The emergency modification, and this modification, authorize the permittee to collect and sacrifice up to 450 coded-wire tagged and adipose fin clipped juvenile winter-run chinook salmon released from the FWS's Coleman National Fish Hatchery. The emergency modification was only valid through December 31, 1993. This modification will authorize this take annually for the duration of the permit, through December 31, 1995. Issuance of this modification was based on a finding that such modification: (1) Was applied for in good faith; (2) will not operate to the disadvantage of the listed species which is the subject of this modification; (3) is consistent with the purposes and policies set forth in section 2 of the ESA. This modification was also issued in accordance with and is subject to parts 217&hyph;227 of title 50 CFR, NMFS regulations governing endangered species permits and modifications. The application, permit, modifications and supporting documentation are available for review by interested persons in the following offices (by appointment): Office of Protected Resources, National Marine Fisheries Service, NOAA, 1335 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910 (301&hyph;713&hyph;2232); and Director, Southwest Region, National Marine Fisheries Service, NOAA, 501 West Ocean Blvd., suite 4200, Long Beach, CA 90802&hyph;4213 (310&hyph;980&hyph;4016).
