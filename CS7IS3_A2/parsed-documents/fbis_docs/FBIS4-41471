According to government estimates, currently there are 1,316 -- mostly small -- joint ventures operating in Russia. The aggregate foreign share in them is estimated at $181 million. The first deputy prime minister's statement was designed to attract as many foreign investors as possible to the Russian economy. In his words, Western investors will soon have an easier time doing business in Russia. This will be helped by the passing of the law "On Concession Agreements, Agreements on Providing Services, and Production-Sharing Agreements with Foreign Investors" and also by amending the law "On Foreign Investment in the RSFSR." According to Mr. Soskovets, these draft documents will shortly be considered by the Government Presidium. Overseas investors' operations will also by facilitated by presidential edicts that will form a third package. In addition, the first deputy prime minister thought it "advisable to reduce the number of taxes, to cut the value-added tax and profit tax rates for enterprises producing goods and services" at the expense of raising taxes levied on mediatory organizations. Presently a government commission is being set up to improve tax legislation, which will be made up of representatives of federal authorities, economic institutes, and "prominent economic managers." Oleg Soskovets expects to receive long-term loans for social projects from the World Bank. In his words, "Western assistance is necessary if reform is to succeed in a swifter and less painful fashion."
