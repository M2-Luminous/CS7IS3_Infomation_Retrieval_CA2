Rodriguez] [Excerpts] Chilpancingo, Guerrero, 20 April--"Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta's assassination did not originate in any national conspiracy involving very powerful groups or politicians." This assertion was made here today by Rafael Aguilar Talamantes, candidate for the presidency of the republic from the Party of the Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction (PFCRN). He added: "Colosio's sacrifice was due to regional interests of drug trafficking Mafias which, finding their financial income impaired, took revenge on President Carlos Salinas de Gortari by killing his favorite political son. They realized that they would be striking him where it hurt most." [passage omitted] Rafael Aguilar Talamantes remarked that, during the Salinas de Gortari regime, a strenuous battle was waged (and is still being waged) throughout the national territory to take prosecutory action against the interests of the Mafias engaged in drug growing and trafficking. No such battle ever occurred during any other six-year term, he noted, adding that this meant that "those hurt would take revenge on someone whose death would grieve the president, and that person was, indisputably, Colosio Murrieta." He commented: "By killing Colosio, they knew that they would deal a severe moral and political blow to his benefactor, his political father." [passage omitted]
