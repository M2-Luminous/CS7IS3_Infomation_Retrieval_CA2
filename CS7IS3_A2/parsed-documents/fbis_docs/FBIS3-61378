Lebed by A. Platitsyn; place and date not given: "I Shall Remain the People's Champion"] [Text] Since the newspapers published in the Dniester region are not distributed on the Bessarabian territory of the republic (especially, naturally, the newspaper of the 14th Russian Army SOLDAT OTECHESTVA), it is sometimes necessary to print excerpts from certain articles or references to them. In this case the interest in the item is so great (after being quoted repeatedly on radio and television) that we decided to reprint the article in its entirety in spite of its length. The more so since the crucial nature of the information and the clarity of presentation are among its undisputed merits. [Platitsyn] Alexksandr Ivanovich, it seems that in the Dniester region things are proceeding to a point where, as you predicted in an interview for KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA in April, the people are just about to "reach for their pitchforks." Negotiations on a political settlement, in spite of the efforts of the mission of the CSCE and the plan it proposed for reconciliation of the sides, have come up against insurmountable differences. Nobody wants to back down. Having been left the only collector of old Soviet money, the republic is rushing toward a financial and economic crash. One cannot quite understand the attempts on the part of the authorities to regulate monetary circulation by political methods. What do you have to say about the situation that has developed? [Lebed] Pay attention to the trio in the Dniester delegation to the negotiations with Moldova. A. Volkova, V. Yakovlev, and T. Zenovich will make every effort to continue these negotiations forever and make sure they come to nothing. And this in no way serves the interests of the people. Both delegations remind one of cats in heat sitting for hours opposite one another howling plaintively but always ready to pounce on a rival. The conclusion of the CSCE mission is a balanced and well-considered document. Not everything in it is indisputable. But it is possible to talk. This requires only one thing--the existence of political will. And this is lacking and none can be seen in the future so far. I do not want to second-guess Moldova--they are approaching the subject of the negotiations from different positions. As for the Dniester region, the question is extremely clear here. From many years of experience we know that authority corrupts people so severely that it is necessary to be very stalwart and conscientious person in order to have the courage to renounce it voluntarily. Under the cover of political demagogy and primitive duping of the people, authorities in the PMR [Dniester Moldovan Republic] are doing everything they can to preserve the gigantic political superstructure that has been created recently. This entire theater with the president, the commander in chief, the ministers, the generals, and the innumerable host of civil servants and assistants constitute an unbearable burden on the people's back. In words we all respect Lenin for his modesty and his Spartan way of life, but in reality practically nobody is willing to give up their privileges provided by power. On the contrary, they have conveniently placed their wives and children in prestigious offices, stuck antennas in luxurious government foreign limousines, and darkened the windows in them so that the people cannot see their servants, and they ride around Tiraspol splashing mud on the bus stops of the people they are supposed to be serving day and night. If there is an opportunity they take a free trip to America or Austria, and they do not even consider it necessary to inform the people of the purposes or results of these trips, or they might fly to Sakhalin to hang out for 10 days. Which is not to say that any fish will be delivered from there. Understandably, a person would have to be a fool to turn down such benefits. Let us imagine for a moment that same "colonel" Gratov: sober-minded, he rides the bus, he has gone without pay for three months. This is not even funny. People like him would lay down their life for the republic although, true, they send others to defend it. And they themselves will get drunk feeling sorry for the deceased. This is why we cannot count on the success of the negotiations under these conditions. The people of the republic must beware of something else. The stubbornness of the Dniester region could end up with unfavorable consequences for the republic. Both Russia and the CSCE (God help Ukraine to survive by itself) could turn against it, and then the evil wish of V. Novodvorskaya, who suggested that Romania seize the Dniester "dowry" lock, stock, and barrel, might come true. And events might develop. Anna Zakharovna Volkova uttered some remarkable words: "Think, people!" I can only add: "Think and act, people! Act before they reign you in completely...." [Platitsyn] Might it not turn out that the complete paralysis of the economy and hyperinflation in the republic will make any negotiations in the political area unnecessary? [Lebed] Now about money. Tajikistan, tormented by war and interethnic strife, has pawned its mountains and its glaciers in exchange for the credit of 120 billion Russian rubles of the 1993 model in cash. It was granted because the republic did not send its mujahidin to protect the White House. There, they measure before they cut. Russia has not and will not give anything to the Dniester region, and there is no longer anything to pawn here. Everything has long since been secretly mortgaged and remortgaged. The naive citizens of the republic and the old timers, their heads filled with ideological cliches, who raised a fuss during the proceedings on the Ilashu case, think that the republic is being controlled by the president and the Supreme Soviet. Would that it were! The real ruler of this region is the Moscow supermillionaire with the nickname of Zika. I know that the authorities are now beginning to pretend that this is the first time they have heard about this. Zagradskiy will be especially adamant. Fortunately, this is well known in the corresponding institutions of Russia and Interpol, where the figure of our banker stands out in a fairly unattractive light. The rapid collapse of prices has not made itself fully felt yet. This avalanche is just beginning to slide. By the new year, when the PMR is left in proud solitude with the "Leninists" whom nobody needs, everything will inevitably collapse. And no matter how the authorities may try by arbitrary decisions to control the "Dniester ruble" with the American dollar, they will not succeed. There are Napoleons all over the place, although, true, it is nice to cure them somewhere else. The miracle will not happen. Merchants will close down and seek their fortune in other regions. The markets, which even today look like they have been raided by Mamay, will finally turn into refuges for the homeless and city dogs and cats, and I do not think it is even necessary to remind you of what is going on in the stores. It cannot be ruled out that a "nest egg" has been stashed for the new year in the warehouses and bases, and it will be brought out before the holiday so that those in the darkened limousines can see how the people fight over it in the waiting lines. And after the new year "we will pour out the water." True, the "farm boys" (there is such a category of prisoners) do not like to take the "ration," it is considered "too low," and therefore there will be bread, milk will be rationed, there will be juices, and there will be pickles in jars and nowhere to get rid of them. And those who today are beating their chests and putting on a show of excessive fastidiousness for the people will switch to dollars and Russian rubles. They have them. And in sufficient quantities. [Platitsyn] You obviously have in mind the public statement by the speaker of the Supreme Soviet when Grigoriy Stepanovich who, without justifying the high price he put on moral damage to him, began to "count his chickens before they were hatched," promising the blind and disabled to more than compensate through the court for budget outlays stolen by A. Bolshakov and others. [Lebed] Very nicely put. I read the so-called complaint of Grigoriy Stepanovich, which was extremely illiterate from the standpoint of the civil code. G. Marakutsa applied to an "independent" court as "chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Dniester Moldovan Republic" and not as a citizen. Thus, exerting pressure on the court: "You, Semen Afanasyevich, decide who is guilty but keep in mind whose side you must defend if you want to remain in your post!" Typical "telephone law." I was in Moscow when Grigoriy Stepanovich suddenly started counting the unexpected receipts of foreign millions. I saw his theatrical demarche on a videotape and I got the impression that it was all a cheap trick. What can come of this? The speaker, clearly twisting the facts and making unproved accusations, is raising the question in a very narrow way. He persistently exclaims: "Prove that it was I!" But let us agree that under the wing of an honest leader all kinds of crooks and swindlers can operate with impunity. And who needs a chief of the legislative power who gives his tacit consent to the creation of "miracles?" The plan is simple--to divert people's attention. The court completed its "proceedings" on the Bergman-Gratov case at the beginning of May, but the court decisions have not yet been carried out because for seven months Bergman's case has been sitting in the Supreme Court of the PMR. Bergman has been stubborn and demands that Shevtsov, Belousov, and others be called as witnesses in the Stepygin case. Exactly the same thing will happen with this case. The court will begin to dig around in this mud, spread it on other individuals, the case will drag out for months if not years, and Grigoriy Stepanovich will continue to rule the Supreme Soviet as if nothing had happened. And then, frankly, I do not believe him. Grigoriy Stepanovich has already made many blunders. Once in an interview for the newspaper SEGODNYA he named too high a pension for former military servicemen so that the pensioners almost had a stroke. Then right on the air in front of all the Dniester region he nailed V. Gorbov to the cross, informing Dniester region residents of the out-and-out lie about the son of a "deserter" from the Shevtsov Guard, who was supposed to have been pursuing his activities in organs of the Moldovan Ministry of State Security in Beltsy. Next on AsKET [expansion not given] came Gorbov's only legal wife, who announced with a tremor in her voice: "Forgive me, Grigoriy Stepanovich, but I did not give birth to any sons. God did not send me any!" Let us ask ourselves this question: Is it possible to believe a person when it comes to serious matters if he has the habit of lying about small things? I do not think so. As for the documents, we shall submit them: We shall mention the accounts through which money and licenses with the signatures of some very well-known people passed and we shall name names. The people say that a friend in need is a friend indeed. There is a time for everything. And I will end by reminding the readers of a statement from Minister A. Saydakov in court. At that time he was acting in the role of voluntary advocate in the case of D. Kondratovich, who also wanted to withdraw from AsKET R1.5 million to study the problems of the "gays." What did Aleksandr Yefimovich say at that time? That soon the courts would be flooded with complaints from the powers that be about protection of their "sullied" honor. And have many complaints been filed up to this point? Not a single one! Draw your own conclusions.... [Platitsyn] Aleksandr Ivanovich, it seems that Anna Volkova stated in public that you, having neither documents nor "even poor copies," had entered, to put it mildly, on the path of back room intrigue and you are persistently trying to discredit the authorities in the eyes of the population. Now, judging from everything, the time has come for you to begin to "play your trumps." Do you have a lot of them in your hand? [Lebed] More than enough. In general I am doing work that is alien to me. But it has already turned out that people are coming to me and continuously supplementing my collection of documents about the life of the "Dniester Court." Since the minister of security is not very intelligent, Shevtsov's "disinformation" sticks out like a sore thumb and therefore these "documents" go immediately into the wastebasket. I have specialists capable of distinguishing authentic from counterfeit. But honest people who have access to the real documents, all those who suffocate in an atmosphere of falsehood and lawlessness, who understand the danger to themselves and those around them, are coming to me. I cannot give the names of these people because they would be fired immediately. And the most obstinate would be "removed from circulation," as Vadim-Vladimir Shevtsov-Antyufeyev likes to say. Let us recall that everything that was discussed previously has been confirmed. We have asserted so many times that Bolshakov junior is a thief and a crook. It turns out that he is also scum. We did not want to believe it; on the contrary, the authorities allowed him to dance a "hopak" and scoff at the patriotic feelings of the Ukrainians. And where is Aleksandr Zakharovich now? Why is he not rushing to court to protect his "honor?" There are many cases like this. And the longer the authorities engage in protection of such people the more resolutely I will rip off their masks and the more painful will be their fall from the heights of the power Olympus. Theirs and that of their protectors. [Platitsyn] Aleksandr Ivanovich, is it true that you just like to shake things up, after all you have a wall in front of you? Or do you intend to rock the boat to the end? All you would have to do would be turn all the cases over to the authorities and you could have a good life. [Lebed] "A wall, but a rotten one"--Lenin said. That is the first thing. Second, everything you are hinting at has already been suggested to me many times. A Volvo, and money, and a bank account, and other nice things. In payment for my silence. But I could not do that. Because that would be tantamount to putting an end to my biography with my own hand. I want to continue to stand up for the righteous cause of the people. And this does not produce any dividends, but morally you feel wonderful. Unlike certain others...I do not want to drown my conscience in endless drunkenness. And I still cannot "turn over" the cases. Not yet, they would simply burn them and pretend to be the "fire hoses." I already have experience.... [Platitsyn] All right, one might say that A. Bolshakov has already been crucified. Who is next? [Lebed] Whoever shouts the loudest: "Stop, thief!"--and is thrilled by the feeling of having others' millions in his pocket. [Platitsyn] Aleksandr Ivanovich, tell me honestly, why did you agree this summer to run as a candidate in the pre-elections for Parliament? One gets the impression that by this action you wanted to test your popularity among the people and be convinced that the people believe in you as they did before and will render you all kinds of assistance in the event that there are radical changes in the republic. And now we have the elections. In spite of the fact that Professor Yakovlev grabbed on to your "shirttails" and threw himself at your feet to keep you out of his private domain, you won a convincing victory. A month later, having run through your scenario, you slammed the door and resigned as deputy. The voters were in shock, and now the Parliament has a hold of "shirttails" and does not want to let go. What next? [Lebed] Nothing. The decree on "nonacceptance of Lebed's resignation" is a game being played with the public. Many people in the Parliament made the sign of the cross and breathed a sigh of relief as soon as the door slammed behind me. It was easier for them without somebody disturbing their somnolent complacency. You can say as much as you want to about the subject of "the influence of moonlight on the swinging of a pine cone" or make predictions about when the Moldovan lei will go bad. And you can do this today when thousands of workers of the best enterprise in the city--I have in mind Odema--are going on Christmas holidays for a month because of a lack of raw material. And the Parliament can find nothing more important to do than discuss the concept of the republic's socioeconomic development. They promise to prepare such a concept by the end of February. And so one wants to shout: Dear friends, and by the end of February everybody in this republic will die waiting this concept. Let us think and guess what they will feed the people tomorrow. And then for now we will somehow scrape by without the concept.... The people are your witnesses, I did not participate in the election campaign and I did not nominate myself. I did get in the way of either A. Safonov or A. Radchenko. True, Mayor Radchenko was bursting to ask me "personally" a certain five questions, but after he became a monopolist of the "Dnieper Mouthpiece" I lost any desire to meet with this person. I could ask him only one question, but I am afraid he would not be able to answer it. He does not have the intellect. Why did I "slam" the door? I do not want to be a part of this power, it will inevitably come to an ignominious end. I am a patient person and I will wait until all of them, receding, have their back to the wall, and in front of them are the facts. Then I and others will have an opportunity to admire their kind faces with the appearance of a set of pensive dumbbells.... [Platitsyn] One painful question, Aleksandr Ivanovich. It is known that in December everyone who has anything to do with the Russian army will receive their maintenance pay in new Russian rubles. And we are speaking about billions. Will it not turn out that against the background of the general poverty your officers will get fat and make those around them envious of their well-being? [Lebed] I did not create this problem. Immediately after the Moscow events, as early as the beginning of October, I suggested a way out of the delicate situation in which the Dniester region had found itself by the will of "citizens of the world" Shevtsov and Matveyev. In an interview in the newspaper IZVESTIYA President I. Smirnov, like a drunk rabbit, flaunted it: "We are living without Russia, not as well, but we are living...." How much worse we are living will be shown in the next few days. In the 14th Army there are many contractors from Russia; they have come to serve, and for this they receive not "Kerenskiy" money but normal money. And recently there has been increased dissatisfaction among officers and noncommissioned officers who actually receive several times less than their counterparts in Russia. What kind of order do you give in such a situation? They can use Russian money in the commissaries and, incidentally, at Russian prices. The merchants will probably surround the military compounds with commercial stores, healthy market competition will appear, some things will find their way to the bazaars, and the merchants will have gasoline, cognac, and other niceties of life. Many will enter on the path of usury, but that is a matter of their conscience. No prohibitions will help here. All able-bodied people of Ukraine are living out of suitcases today: They take pork fat--to Moscow and the border oblasts of Russia, they get rubles--in exchange for coupons, more pork fat--more rubles. It makes me bitter to think that many people of the Dniester region will suffer in this situation, but I am powerless to help everyone. Since 25 July, when Russia exchanged the old rubles, there has been plenty of time to think and we should not waste time on empty debates about Yakovlev's theories. In my view they should have postponed all those festive trips to America and Austria and they should have been working on this day and night and not on the development of a concept or a text for the hymn of the PMR, which by the time it is approved could turn out to be a funeral dirge for the republic. [Platitsyn] You speak about an outbreak of usurious activity. But as far as I know the authorities are prepared to take resolute measures against private black marketeers. [Lebed] Who believes that? For years they have been unable to drive out the gypsies on one small section who established a monopoly on trade in alcohol and tobacco in the city. And you talk about resolute measures. Maybe Zagryadskiy or someone will fight against the black marketeers during times when they are sober? This is a kind of snow job without any snow... [Platitsyn] You have gloomy predictions. Will they come true? [Lebed] Definitely. Everything in life develops according the clearcut laws. We all have the same god. He has mercy on the intelligent and just, and he punishes fools and sinners. Moldova has introduced the leu. For better or worse you can get 30 cents for it. People are gloating over this here, they are figuring out when the end will come for the lei, and in terms of inflation it is compared with its Romanian brother. Behind the primitive political shooting matches they completely forget about the hundreds of thousands of people who have relatives on the Right Bank who go to Kishinev on business, and there are plenty of occasions. For now it is not that the people have nothing with which to pay a police fine, they do not even have anything with which to buy a piece of bread. So a leu that goes through a private party and commercial structures without Zagryadskiy's knowledge will sooner or later end up in the Dniester region and crowd out the "monopoly money." Instead of thinking about solving the problem we are allowing Kondratovich to arrange public investigations: Which politicians are "fools with unwashed necks" and which have clean necks. It is nothing but a big mess.... [Platitsyn] But still the authorities could find a way out of the situation. Not all of the plans are presented for widespread discussion by the masses. [Lebed] They will, by firing into the next ambulance or microbus filled with workers.... [Platitsyn] Oh, ho, Aleksandr Ivanovich, you are not saying that these barbaric attacks are the work of Shevtsov? That these were deliberate bloody provocations to stir up hatred for the enemy? [Lebed] For now I do not want to say that. I know only that on the days when they were carried out soldiers from both sides had abandoned their positions and were fraternizing and exchanging triple kisses for Easter. And the politicians did not like this. It is not important to me which bank the organizers of these monstrous crimes were sitting on. Both of them, greedy for high power and unable to find other ways of satisfying their political ambitions besides rivers of blood of their faithful servants, I would tie together with one rope and drop into the Dniester. I am sure that not very many flowers would be thrown after them.... [Platitsyn] But are you not afraid of evoking the anger of G. Andreyeva? In June she stated: "Let them make just one move and we will again take up our weapons and fight against Lebed." [Lebed] Let us not get sidetracked by the schizophrenic outbursts of that woman whom nobody can put in her place. This shows once again the face of the power such advisers wield. [Platitsyn] Incidentally, on 27 November, in an article entitled "Has No One Been Forgotten?" published in DNESTROVOSKAYA PRAVDA, N. Vorobyev, who through his reporting is constantly spreading a pathological hatred for you and the 14th Army, reported how Lebed's "soldiers" in bulletproof vests degraded the dignity of valiant fighters from Kostenko's battalion, demanding that they give up one at a time and come out of the school without their weapons.... [Lebed] I have already said that it was stupid to sign off on the measure. In order to dot all the i's, let us return to the document. I have before me order No. 53 of 12 July 1992. I quote verbatim: "Recently there have been more frequent cases of arbitrary abandonment of combat positions (desertion) by individual military servicemen and even entire units. Thus on the night of 22 June Lieutenant Colonel Kostenko unilaterally led his subdivisions away from their positions into the city of Bendery and made other units to do the same thing, which was a treasonous violation of the order on retaining the units at the line they had reached. There had also been similar treasonous actions previously. At the present time units of the Second Motorized Infantry Battalion RG [expansion not given] under the leadership of Lieutenant Colonel Kostenko did not carry out the order to liberate the city and are engaged in looting and even murdering peaceful residents." With this same order the battalion commander replaced Kostenko with Lieutenant Colonel A.G. Askerov. Who signed this order? The chief of the administration of defense of the PMR and the current inspector general of the Dniester troops, General S. Kitsak. The order was signed and I was instructed to remove Kostenko. These are the kinds of valiant "protectors" whom Madame Vorobyev is now trying to make look good. And I could give a couple more examples of "valor and heroism" so that people will know how everything really was. And where did the dozens missing in action go? Time will also provide an answer to this.... [Platitsyn] From my discussion with you I get the impression that the PMR today... [Lebed] ...The rule of arbitrariness and lawlessness. I know for certain that this republic, created against a background of the noble idea of fighting nationalism, has gradually been transformed into an instrument for uncontrolled rule of people and mockery of moral sense in the name of satisfying the greedy whims of a pathetic band. The authorities are answerable to absolutely no one in this drive, which is protected by Russian peacekeepers on the one side and Ukrainian border guards on the other. Alas we have not yet learned to answer to our own conscience.... [Platitsyn] Aleksandr Ivanovich, everything is in somber tones, there is no light. Where can poor Ivan go? [Lebed] Anna Zakhrovna Volkova has uttered some remarkable words: "Think, people!" I can only add: "Think and act, people! Act before they have bridled you completely and turned you into speechless cattle! Respect your own humanity! Get rid of the crooks who are capitalizing like parasites on the results of your labor! Act, people! Act before it is too late." And there is no need to suggest how our people should act. Our people are not stupid.
