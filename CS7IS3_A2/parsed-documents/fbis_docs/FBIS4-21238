That is what greeted the government's long-awaited drug policy review yesterday. There is inadequate financing. The government does not seriously come to grips with the stress strategy used by the police. Control is not scaled down. There are no new ideas here. These harsh words came from treatment providers, drug addicts, doctors, and several politicians when the health, social affairs, and justice ministers presented the government's long-awaited report yesterday. There was especially harsh criticism of the lack of financial support for the initiatives. Among other things the report says that home communities will be compelled to finance more county treatment slots ``in such a way that it does not lead to additional total public expenditure.'' ``That is pure pyrotechnics. A dead addict is the cheapest addict for municipalities. Additional treatment will always cost more--even if efficiency is increased. If money does not accompany the initiatives they cannot amount to anything,'' said Peter Ege, a welfare doctor in Copenhagen. The Medical Association is also disappointed: ``The financial support is inadequate. It is necessary to spend money to ensure better living conditions for drug addicts. The government has repressed the idea that not all drug addicts can be made drug-free, with or without methadone,'' said Medical Association chairman Torben Pedersen. The government plans to get its ideas funded in the upcoming economic talks with the counties and municipalities. But the Progress Party and SF [Socialist People's Party] do not believe in that solution: ``The state itself should earmark an amount in the billion-kroner class to go directly to treatment centers,'' said Tom Behnke, drug policy spokesman for the Progress Party. SF also thinks the state should lead the way. In addition to financing, the control policy was sharply criticized. ``If control efforts are given a lower priority many drug addicts will have a more tranquil and stable life while society will have less crime and unrest,'' the chairman of the Medical Association maintained. Confrontation With Stress Strategy His attitude was supported by a broad circle of treatment providers and judges BERLINGSKE TIDENDE spoke to. ``The police effort should be changed so that they no longer focus on individual addicts. This has not produced results,'' said Hans Henrik Brydensholt, a judge at Eastern High Court. But he also thinks the report sets the stage for a confrontation with the stress strategy later on. ``The report is a big step in the right direction. After 25 years of emphasizing control, I think the politicians have realized that the drug problem must be solved through treatment and prevention,'' said Brydensholt. Justice Minister Erling Olsen (Social Democrat) himself wants to change the effort on the street, but said this can only happen gradually--in parallel with stepping up treatment. Conservatives and Liberals expressed moderate support for the government's report. But the parties think the police effort should be increased and that stronger steps should be taken against hashish smoking among young people.
