The BJP has appealed to the people to tell the world that the government had approved this proposal against their wishes. The BJP has also decided to introduce a resolution over this issue in the Parliament. It has also hinted about approaching other parties for cooperation on this issue. The Party said that the day the Narasimha Rao government will sign agreement over the Dunkel draft will be remembered as a black day' in this India's history. The national working committee of the BJP also passed a resolution about it on Saturday evening after a long meeting. Atal Behari Vajpayee, the Lok Sabha opposition leader, said while issuing the resolution that India was expected to lead the developing countries in dealing with the dangers of the Dunkel draft. However, a weak government knelt down in front of the United States and the European union of nations. The BJP resolution said that it had repeatedly warned the government against the multi-national companies and their agents. He said that we had asked for fair trade and not open trade. What did we get? An agreement that has seriously hurt the interests of poor nations. The third world countries will have to live in the shadows of fear of a new kind of colonialism. The BJP said that the Indian government had hurt the nation's interests by accepting the Dunkel draft. The damage to the agricultural area is extreme. Export of garments will also suffer badly. The Indian government bowed down both in Trips and Trims pacts. The resolution also referred to the commerce minister's statement make in the Parliament on 16 December in which he had admitted that other countries had started to defy the U.S. and European pressure while our government was helpless on this issue. The BJP expressed surprise that the commerce minister who was expected to protect the interests of the nation was not embarrassed when he announced this. The resolution said that the commerce minister was telling proudly that India's export will increase by 1.5 to 2 billion dollars. The BJP asks if a country's autonomy can be sold or bought? The resolution reminds the commerce minister that China is not a member of GATT, did not participate in the Dunkel talks, and yet still managed to increase its exports by many times during the last few years. Mr. Vajpayee said that whatever the government says, the truth is that multinational companies like Cargil will continue to twist our arms. Some companies have already started to do that over our neem trees. The resolution expressed concern that the price of grains will be controlled by international trends now and that this will adversely effect our economic autonomy. We have seen that happen in Africa. As the result of signing the Trips pact, drug prices have skyrocketed. The government said about Trips that it will decide on where the foreign investments will be. How can we expect a government that opens its markets to multinational companies to manufacture soda water and potato chips to stand boldly? The BJP leader said that his party has been opposing several Dunkel issues related to agriculture for the last two years. Now it appears that this proposal is detrimental to our national interests in other areas also. Mr. Vajpayee said that the government has until 10 April of the next year. It should make necessary amendments to the Dunkel Draft to help our country and other developing countries.
