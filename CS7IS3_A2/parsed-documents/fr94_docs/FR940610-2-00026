FR940610-2-00026 FR940610-2-00022 Golden Field Office Award Based on Acceptance of an Unsolicited Application Activities to Enhance the Transfer of Pollution Prevention Research Information Among Funders and Researchers Throughout North America AGENCY: Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of Noncompetitive Financial Assistance Award. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy (DOE), Golden Field Office, through the Seattle Support Office, announces that pursuant to DOE Financial Assistance Rules 10 CFR 600.14(f), DOE intends to award a grant to Pacific Northwest Pollution Prevention Research Center (PPRC) for Activities to Enhance Researchers Throughout North America. The anticipated overall objective is to support specific industry-related activity in the areas of pollution prevention research. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: PPRC proposes to build a public-private partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy to support specific industry-related activity in the areas of pollution prevention research. The specific objectives of the PPRC are: (1) To develop and maintain a national clearinghouse for Requests for Proposals (RFPs) on pollution prevention research in order to attract more qualified researchers in the field. (2) To conduct a detailed analysis of funding organizations, to better educate both funders and grant seekers on organizational priorities and current activities. (3) To expand the PPRC database of current and recent research projects in order to avoid wasteful duplication of research efforts and stimulate interest in project results. (4) To publish and disseminate a comprehensive resource guide to pollution prevention research funding, to encourage proposals and publicize funding programs. Therefore, the grant application is being accepted because DOE knows of no other organization that is conducting or planning to conduct this type of effort in pollution prevention. The project period for the grant award is 12-months, expected to begin in June 1994. DOE plans to provide funding in the amount of $45,000 for this project period.
