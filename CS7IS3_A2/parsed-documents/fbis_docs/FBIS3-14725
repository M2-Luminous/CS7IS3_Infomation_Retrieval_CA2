Madhavan Kutty] [Text] Whenever a change takes place in the American Administration, especially from Republicans to Democrats, it is common practice in the media in India and also to some extent in government circles and among politicians to interpret it as a change for the good, particularly for Indo-U.S. relations. But the experience so far has been to the contrary, the simple reason being that the U.S. national interests and their perspectives have remained the same. In other words, the U.S. Administration never changed its attitudes and perspectives on world affairs. It has remained consistent, a fact we can overlook only at our own cost. America fashioned its policies, tailored its approaches and upheld its values on democracy, human rights and whatever its founding fathers prescribed for them to suit their `national interests' as Americans perceived them, whether it was Grenada, Panama, the Bay of Pigs, Iran and host of other things and even on Kashmir. To expect that America will play its role according to the rule book is too much. America will even extend a Most Favoured Nation treatment even if it is convinced that the recipient country violates and defies the basic principles America upholds and wants all others to adhere strictly. America never stood by India or anybody else for that matter. If India drew inspiration from it during our independence struggle it was because it suited America's national interest to support us at that time. It makes one even to think retrospectively that it was in their national interest they wanted Britain to withdraw from India so that one day in the future they can be the replacement! The subsequent U.S. attitude particularly in recent years, more so after the end of cold war towards India on Kashmir, our economic development, scientific programmes, NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty] etc. proves this. Perhaps America was in a happier situation when in the late 60s one Central Minister with proclaimed socialist leanings spoke of `dove-tailing the plan', `India's womb opening up', 'backseat driving' etc. The doves have turned to hawks and planning is now at the dictates of World Bank and IMF. At that time there were warnings of the empire trying to come back by the back door. Now the suspicion has once again started growing among many Indians, thanks to Clinton's pronouncements, Robin Raphel's observations and John Mallot's comments. Opening up and liberalisation may be necessary in today's global situation but it should be in keeping with our national interests and not according to imported prescriptions. One score and ten years ago, John Kennedy in his inaugural address said that American will "pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and success of liberty". Thirty years later Bill Clinton in his inaugural address proclaimed to protect America's "vital interests" and pledged American action when "the will and conscience of international community defied" that is to say that there will be interventions for reasons of American national interests and for reasons of American conscience. Recently an American commentator wrote: "It has been a long road (for Clinton) from Vietnam: the conscientious objector has become the conscientious warrior." He added that it was a "breakthrough" but a dangerous one. Even nations like India have to pay a "heavy price", bear the burden, meet hardships and is forced to support America, oppose their enemies for the survival and success of liberty and tolerate interventions anywhere if America thinks that their national interests and their conscience are affected. The Americans always suffered from some sort of psychological obsession. During the 50s and 60s especially, it was their obsession that they have been entrusted with the responsibility to contain communism. In Vietnam and elsewhere they learnt bitter lessons. In later years their obsession was to uphold human rights and liberty in all parts of the globe and they will be the prosecutor and judge at the same time. Assuming this role, America serves their national interests today in many parts of the world with scant regard for other nations. The standard for fundamental values like democracy, human rights are set by them, administered by them, judged by them and if they find any nation guilty they appropriate the right to themselves to punish such nations by interventions and sanctions. In 1971, Indira Gandhi in an article in Foreign Affairs wrote "....successive U.S. administrations have ignored the fact that India must see her problems and her relationship in a different perspective. India was regarded with disapproval and resentment because of her independent policy. This could not but affect relations between India and America. Despite fluctuations of mood, our relationship as a whole has been uneasy over long period". Today, we are deliberating whether the Prime Minister should visit America now or later, whether a minor functionary of the American administration should be advised to postpone her visit to India or not. What is important is to tell America in the language it understands, as Mrs Gandhi did during the Bangladesh liberation. Prime Minister Narasimha Rao told the UN Security Council Summit last year that countries like India express their views but they are seldom heard. Even the UN is hijacked to serve the national interests of a particular country. This situation has to be, and must be, changed. If the Indo-U.S. relations are to improve, American national interests and India's self-respect should go together. "Nations are not individuals, nations live in a state of nature. If they do not protect themselves they die. Ignoring one's interests, squandering one's resources in fits of altruism, is the fast road to national destruction", This warning given to America by an American equally applies to India.
