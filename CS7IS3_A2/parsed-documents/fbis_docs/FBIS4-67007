They arrested five Pakistanis and one Afghan smuggler who concealed drugs in balloons they swallowed. Some of them also concealed the drugs in capsules they inserted in their anuses. That was only one of repeated smuggler attempts to bring those poisons into the Kingdom. But God, and the alertness and vigilance of customs agents, precluded those drugs from reaching the hands of citizens. The Customs Department has been alert to the fiendish and advanced techniques used by smugglers in their criminal pursuits and consequently decreed last Rabi'-al-Awwal month to organize an integrated enforcement team that would search for drugs concealed in the intestines of smugglers. The al-Jawallah Team [Wayfarers] was organized into three squads, each composed of 13 employees and female inspectors. The team has achieved repeated successes in apprehending a number of smugglers who arrive into the country carrying different kinds of narcotics in their guts. In the main, smugglers conceal drugs, particularly heroin, by stashing them into balloons, or the like, that they would then insert into their intestines. Some 400 such balloons, weighing about 1 kg, have been apprehended. Another technique used by smugglers to conceal drugs is to insert them into their bodies through the anus by introducing capsules and oval objects into the body. There were eight such capsules weighing some 300 grams. Smugglers Dressed in Pilgrimage Garb The [Wayfarers] team apprehended on the last day of the blessed month of Ramadan a gang of Pakistani smugglers composed of five Pakistanis and one Afghan smuggler. It was discovered that they carried in their intestines a number of balloons filled with heroin, as well as other kinds of capsules and oval objects. Some of them were dressed in pilgrimage garb in order to ward off suspicion. AL-MADINAH interviewed Khalaf al-Ghamdi, commander of one of the three teams, who reviewed the details of apprehending the smugglers and discussed the mission of the team. Suspicion Starts It All Said al-Ghamdi: "The team was formed in the third month of the year 1413 Hijra [1992] for the purpose of apprehending only those who smuggle drugs in their intestines. We are not concerned with those who smuggle by any other means, such as in their valises, for example. The technique typically involves swallowing heroin by mouth or inserting it through the anus. "The Customs Department decided to organize a team trained in exposing that method of smuggling. "The team studies passenger documents and scrutinizes their bodies then determines if there is cause for suspicion. "We suspect three or four passengers out of every thousand, thanks to exacting procedures as well as vigilance and concentration by employees highly trained and experienced in smuggling detection." Al-Ghamdi went on: "An employee would then take away the passport of the suspect passenger -- here suspicion rises to about 50 percent -- give him a scrutinizing look, and ask him some questions. "At this point, the passenger would show signs of confusion and disorientation, and it is by those signs that an employee would determine if the passenger is hiding something." Instruments to Detect Smugglers and Users "Then comes the turn of drug-detection instruments which identify what type of narcotic is involved. "Those instruments are capable of detecting not only smugglers but also users. "When an instrument signals, we know that smuggling is going on, but we don't stop there. We use X rays to make certain." Fasting Prior to Swallowing Drugs Al-Ghamdi describes the techniques used by smugglers to insert contraband into their intestines: "A smuggler fasts for about two days before swallowing the drugs. His stomach has to be completely empty or he won't last the distance. Then there is the process of evacuation which accompanies the stomach functions while producing food digesting enzymes. "Once he swallows the drugs, the smuggler lives on liquids only without partaking of any food. Anesthetizing Before Capsule Insertion "As to inserting the contraband through the anus, smugglers place the drugs in oval objects or capsules. A smuggler may carry seven or eight such capsules. "According to one smuggler, the person who provides him with the narcotics keeps him from eating for two days then gives him a shot of anesthetics to put him to sleep. Another person then inserts those `capsules' or `eggs' into his bowels. "About four hours later, the smuggler wakes up and heads directly for the plane he intends to board. He would be at the airport for about three hours in addition to flight time. In other words, he would carry the drugs in his intestines for about 12 hours before arriving in the country." 190 Cases of Smuggling Regarding the weight of the capsules, al-Ghamdi says: "They range in weight from 80 to 300 grams of heroin, depending on capsule size, and any one smuggler may carry between five and eight capsules. "Balloons, on the other hand, weigh between four and 10 grams. As to pills --they band six or seven tablets together. Some 400 such balloons were apprehended." Since deployment, the [Wayfarers] team has so far foiled 190 smuggling operations through the intestines.
