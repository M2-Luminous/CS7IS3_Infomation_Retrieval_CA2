"The novelty in this first meeting of G-7 environment ministers," said Italy's representative [Environment Minister] Valdo Spini, "is that until now, when the environment was mentioned it was only in the context of countries' responsibility towards the health of the planet. Now we have realised that the environment has a key role in economic recovery and in increasing employment in industrialised countries." The ministers from Italy, France, Germany, Britain, Japan, Canada and the United States focussed their attention on six planned themes -- the global environment, employment, trade, green accounting, democracy and financial mechanisms -- and added a further topic, nuclear safety in eastern Europe, to the agenda. Their findings will be discussed by Group of Seven heads of state and government when they meet for their annual summit in Naples in July. No formal final statement was issued after today's meeting. Talking to the press after the meeting wound up, Spini recalled a statement issued by the G-7 leaders after their summit in Tokyo last year, in which they said "despite economic difficulties, environmental issues must be addressed." Now, he said, that word "despite" must be replaced by "because of". Amongst topics dealt with by G-7 environment ministers during their two-day session here was deforestation, with a pledge to work towards a convention for rain forests, an issue which had to be put aside after major differences of opinion emerged two years ago in the world environment conference in Rio de Janeiro. Malaysia and India have since softened their stance. The effects on the labour market of greater environmental awareness were stressed by the ministers, with Spini recalling a report prepared for the European Union which showed that 2.1 million new jobs could open up in this area between now and the year 2000. Cutting taxes on labour and taxing the environment would lead to a "double dividend" of more manpower being used while saving the environment, the ministers agreed. Eco-taxes did not excite enthusiasm across the board in this weekend's meeting, however: the four European members came down in favour but Japan hedged and the United States and Canada were not at all keen. "On this point," Spini said, "all of the Seven agreed on the need to pay the costs of saving the environment from within, but each country said it would find its own solution." The dangers of carbon dioxide, the gas held responsible for the Greenhouse Effect, were admitted by all the ministers, but the United States refused to be held to the 2000 deadline for bringing emissions back to 1990 accepted by the other six G-7 members.
