As for the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], we had a separate interview with Secretary General Yoshiro Mori. Political Reform Legislation: What Does It Signify and How Can It Be Assessed? [Oikawa] What does the enactment of the four political reform bills signify and how do you assess it? [Takemura] I felt that Nagatacho [the political center of Japan in Tokyo] has finally recovered its sound thinking. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and I were watching the upper house reject the reform bills on television. Shortly after that I said, "Perhaps it is better, though we did not expect such a situation," and he replied, "Yes, you are right." The prime minister would have great difficulty in redistricting the nation, in choosing members of the council to be in charge of drafting a redistricting plan, if the reform package were enacted by only a narrow margin of two to three votes. He was aware of that. So for him, a wide consensus was indispensable. [Murayama] I really welcome the enactment of the political reform bills because the Hosokawa Cabinet began by staking its political fortunes on the implementation of political reform. However, as SDPJ chairman, I would like to stress that the biggest point lying at the bottom of the political reform issue is the prevention of corruption. I regret that the fund-raising control system was eased (to allow each lawmaker to set up one fund-raising body to receive corporate donations for a transitional period of five years, while each company will be permitted to contribute up to 500,000 yen a year), because the SDPJ has devoted itself intensely to keeping the proposed ban on corporate donations to individual lawmakers unchanged. However, I feel happy because the coalition government was able to fulfill its responsibility after all. [Oikawa] Chairman Murayama, did you not expect the failure of the reform bills? [Murayama] I never had such a thought, because as a coalition member, the SDPJ is also responsible. [Ishida] I am not 100 percent satisfied with the political reform legislation. However, when I think of the difficulties we had -- finding common ground within the multifactional coalition, plus reaching a compromise with the opposition LDP -- I should say it was the best we could do. It was a historic achievement. [Ouchi] I was very anxious, because at the last minute there were many politicians calling for a second vote in the lower house, knowing that this scenario could lead to a dissolution of the Diet. On 27 January, I called on the prime minister at his official residence in the evening and said, "You should absolutely not dissolve the Diet. Dissolution is equivalent to ignoring the position of the public. A general resignation of the cabinet should also be avoided, because it will lead to great confusion. Please have a top-level meeting with the LDP and make tenacious efforts to the end." I spoke to him as if negotiating personally with him. A top-level meeting with the LDP inevitably meant that the prime minister would have to make concessions and accept some modifications of the reform package. However, as the saying goes, "knock at the door, and it will open;" I thought the top-level meeting would avert the worst situation. [Hata] The political reform legislation gives us the opportunity to eliminate evil practices that had resulted from the multiseat electoral system. Political parties, candidates, and lawmakers are now able to act on their own responsibilities, and they have to do so. We should also achieve Diet reform. [Oikawa] Mr. Takemura, what had the prime minister planned to do if the Diet failed to enact the bills? [Takemura] On 27 January, the prime minister told a meeting of the private-sector advisory committee on political reform that he would not cling to the post of prime minister. That was how he really felt at that moment. If we take him at his word, he had no intention to dissolve the Diet. I have been telling the prime minister, "If you take responsibility for failure by dissolving the Diet, the public will not understand, and it would give an impression that you are acting in a high and mighty manner." It seems that the prime minister did not think too much about failure. [Oikawa] How soon will the date of implementation of the new laws be fixed? And what about the difficult task of redividing the nation into single-seat districts. [Takemura] As the forthcoming regular Diet session will not be pressed for time, it was decided at the top-level meeting that the implementation date will be fixed "before the government's draft budget is formulated." You should know this. As for redistricting, it has to come after (legal) amendments. To be able to start with a clean slate, the redistricting task will be entrusted to several experts. [Oikawa] Concerning the redistricting plan, the adjustment of views inside each coalition party seems to be difficult. [Murayama] An independent council, to be set up under the Prime Minister's Office, will be in charge of compiling a redistricting plan. Therefore, we are not in a position to say we accept such-and-such but we refuse this-and-this. We should accept the plan submitted by the council without reserve. The Second Act of the Political Realignment Drama [Oikawa] What will the coalition be like in the future? Is there a possibility of a reshuffle within the coalition? [Takemura] We have to turn quickly to other important issues, such as the implementation of a new package of economic stimulus measures and the formulation of a budget bill. There will be neither time nor energy to spare for a change in the coalition, until we finish compiling the budget bill, until the prime minister returns from the Japanese-U.S. summit meeting, and, moreover, until the Diet passes the fiscal 1994 budget bill. As we have a tight schedule, we have to go on at full tilt until the beginning of May when the week of consecutive holidays begins. [Ouchi] The coalition should have an intensive dialogue with the LDP on important issues related to national interest, such as the formulation of a budget bill, including such matters as income tax cuts and a consumption tax hike, and the economic framework talks, which are expected to top the agenda of the Japan-U.S. summit meeting. The coalition should not always think about bringing down the LDP by any means. However, I do not mean that the dialogue with the LDP will immediately bring about a reshuffle in the coalition, that is to say, a grand alliance with the LDP. Neither will it lead to a distribution of some cabinet posts to the LDP. The prime minister has clearly said that the compromise with the LDP will not lead to a grand alliance. Moreover, whether the LDP will support the government from outside the cabinet is not the question. It is quite normal and necessary for a government to ask a powerful opposition for assistance and understanding. There is nothing strange about it. [Ishida] The current coalition will not transform into a grand alliance, because the political reform legislation is expected to facilitate the consolidation of existing political groups into two big parties coming to power by turns. [Hata] It is good if all the parties can be in friendly rivalry with one another on the same grounds. For that, a political realignment is necessary. There would be two big political parties in friendly rivalry. If so, politicians will always be keyed up, because any scandal will prove fatal to the party. Moreover, they will have to speak out, having the possibility of a change of regime always in mind. Such circumstances will help develop a sound government with a sound ruling party and a sound opposition. [Oikawa] Are Shinseito and Komeito planning to merge into a new party? [Hata] People are inventing stories about a Shinseito-Komeito alliance as they like. Mr. Ozawa (Shinseito secretary general) and I are on good terms with Komeito Secretary-General Yuichi Ichikawa. However, it does not mean that Shinseito and Komeito will merge into a new party. Once politicians pursue discussion on what politics should be like in the future, political realignment will take shape spontaneously, as the next general elections draw near. [Ouchi] The important issue after political reform is party reform. This should be the next step for political realignment. A new system can be good or bad; everything will depend on political parties and politicians. If it goes in the wrong direction, it could lead to another one-party rule or bring about an undemocratic government. Party reform or political realignment should be easy to understand for the public. Political forces, which have established a democratic ideology, are to play a major role. The new electoral system will prove efficient only if political forces, which have a common local policy or a common vision for the future, can join hands. [Murayama] There might be a little reshuffle in the coalition. However, the framework will probably remain unchanged: The current coalition in power and the LDP in opposition. How will political parties cooperate with one another when the next election is held under the new single-seat electoral system? That is the question. Depending on the outcome of the next election, there might be a minor change in the coalition government. [Ouchi] We should not say, "Let's accomplish realignment of the political map by putting the LDP aside." We are not in such a situation. What is needed is a wholesale realignment affecting all parties, including the LDP. For example, imagine that you have many balls of different colors. You put them all in a box with a small hole. You strongly shake the box, and the balls will come out of the hole in different combinations. But you cannot know the results in advance. Political realignment is like this, and each party should bear this in mind. [Hata] Yes, you shake the box and then a new combination comes out. [Murayama] What kind of merger or what kind of partnership? It will depend on how parties cooperate with one another to win an election. In any event, there is no possibility for a political party to come into power single-handedly for the time being. Which is the best between a two-party system and a moderate multiparty system as advocated by Prime Minister Hosokawa? I personally think that some form of multiparty system is necessary, because the people's mentality is so diversified. [Ishida] The single-seat constituency system will inevitably trigger a policy argument between two political forces, excluding the Japanese Communist Party. In the case of the current government, it was only after the election that the seven parties and one parliamentary group reached an agreement to form a coalition. However, the same procedure will probably not work next time. In the next election, the coalition parties will have to campaign as a new political force formed by different parties capable of reaching agreement on different policies. [Takemura] The LDP and the SDPJ have terminated their historic role. I do not think the current political camps -- the LDP and the non-LDP force -- will be consolidated, as they are in the second act of the political realignment drama. The LDP as well as the SDPJ are expecting various changes. That is not all. All parties, including Sakigake, are going to be hit by a severe blizzard called political realignment. Will it produce three new parties or four new parties? I do not know. Political ideologies and basic policies will become the pivotal point of political realignment. My opinion is that it will not immediately lead to a two-party system, because people's values are so diversified. As for a possible merger of Sakigake and the Japan New Party into a new party, we will carry on negotiations to form a definite plan. I understand that the time is now ripe for a merger, because of the enactment of the political reform legislation. [Oikawa] In terms of political ideology, coalition parties differ little from one another, except for the SDPJ. However, opinions might be divided in regard to the future course of Japan. Is that the case? [Hata] You say that the SDPJ is different. However, the SDPJ has agreed with other coalition parties on the rice issue (for a successful conclusion of the trade talks under GATT). It has also accepted the outline of the eighth report submitted by the Election System Council. Concerning the bill to amend the Self-Defense Forces Law (which would allow the use of SDF aircraft to rescue overseas Japanese from crises), we could also reach an agreement with the SDPJ, although the bill has not passed the Diet yet. Like the SDPJ, there are various opinions inside Shinseito as well. For instance, Shinseito members have suggested many different ways to deal with the question of Japan's eligibility for a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council within the framework of our Constitution. A party having lots of free discussions is a democratic party, and it is the democratic way to cooperate with others once something is decided by the majority. The parties in the ruling coalition can work together on any issue. [Murayama] We want people to change their view that the SDPJ is different, because we are no longer living in an era of ideological conflict. I often tell my party members that we should continue to hold our own ideology on the one hand. However on the other hand, we should see things in a flexible manner, since policymaking requires a realistic stance. It is important for the SDPJ to continue to cooperate with other coalition parties, by finding common ground with them. [Ishida] Seen from the viewpoint of Komeito, there was once a difference in policy between the SDPJ and the other parties. However, when we agreed to form a coalition, we were determined to overcome the differences, and we have been making efforts in that direction until now. For instance, with regard to the Uruguay Round, we had much trouble with the rice issue. However, we were able to overcome the differences though it was an ordeal, and we settled the issue. We should keep this ordeal in mind. If all coalition parties are able to speak out, they can continue to work together. Tax Reform and Administrative Reform [Oikawa] From now on, the SDPJ should find the issue of a consumption tax hike more important than political reform. [Murayama] I do not understand why you always refer to the SDPJ, because the consumption tax hike is also a tough question for all parties in the ruling coalition: Komeito, the DSP, Shinseito -- every party is concerned. A rise in the consumption tax strongly goes against the current of the times. People in the lower income brackets are not paying any income tax. A consumption tax hike will become a new burden for these people who will never share in the benefit of income tax cuts. In this sense, when we think of the purpose and the expected effect of income tax cuts, we cannot accept a rise in the consumption tax aimed at covering the shortfall in revenues. [Hata] We should soon start a debate on what the taxation system should be like; in other words, we will have to discuss whether it will be possible to carry out income tax cuts. My party is having hot discussions. The SDPJ is not the only party highly concerned with it. It is an important issue for every party. What we need is an income tax reduction to stimulate the economy. What should be done to cover the subsequent shortfall in revenues? The outline of a tax reform plan is expected to be presented in about three or four days. [Murayama] Parties in the ruling coalition should manage to reach an agreement after heated discussions, setting aside differences. Such a process helps support and invigorate the coalition government. To what extent will it be possible to implement an income tax reduction? How should it be financed? The SDPJ is now talking about these points. [Oikawa] However, the SDPJ seems to have difficulties putting up a united front on that issue. [Murayama] our immediate plan is to carry out a large-scale reduction of the income tax as a way to stimulate the economy. To cover the shortfall in revenues, we propose revising unfair points in the current taxation system, and cutting down operating expenses. If these measures are insufficient to finance the income tax reduction, we will accept issuing deficit-financing bonds as a special measure. However, it should not be done unconditionally. Deficit-covering bonds should be issued as a short-term revenue source, for instance, within a time limit of three or five years. Moreover, we will have to examine the ratio of direct and indirect taxes in tax revenue; we will also have to look at the balance between assets, income, and consumption. We might even consider a bold and drastic comprehensive taxation. [sentence as published] We propose a sweeping revision of the tax system. At the same time, we should form a new welfare vision to cope with the aging society. How should social welfare be financed? How far can it be covered by tax revenue? How far will social insurance programs be applied? We will have to give a satisfactory explanation to the public. There is nothing irresponsible in what we are saying. [Ishida] Some people say that the income tax cuts and the consumption tax hike should be handled as one unit. This sort of argument should not exist in the first place. A tax reform plan will never be approved by the public as long as there is no clear vision about a welfare society and an aging society. My party cannot readily agree to a plan to raise the consumption tax to cover income tax cuts. [Murayama] If the political reform bills were killed, I had made the following suggestion: The prime minister should neither dissolve the Diet nor announce a general resignation of the cabinet, even if the political reform bills are killed. The cabinet should rather fulfill its responsibility by compiling a new package of stimulus measures, a third supplementary budget for the current fiscal year, and a budget bill for fiscal 1994. The cabinet should decide whether it has to take responsibility for not achieving political reform, only after settling these economic issues. In addition to the revision of the electoral system accompanied by the introduction of anticorruption measures, we will have to promote a decentralization of power and carry out Diet reform. Political reform will only be fully achieved when these three pillars are completed. Decentralization of power and Diet reform are the next two items on the political agenda. [Ishida] Yes, you are right. The government will soon formulate its outline on administrative reform. It will set forth decentralization as well as economic deregulation. This medium-term administrative reform policy will become an epoch-making event that was not conceivable under LDP rule. The Treatment of SDPJ Dietmen who Rebelled Against Their Party Leadership [Oikawa] How will the SDPJ treat its members who disobeyed the leadership? [Murayama] The SDPJ Central Executive Committee has already decided on the punitive action to be taken against those who acted against the party's resolution. The Discipline Committee will make the final decision. One characteristic of the SDPJ is that the party is composed of broadminded people. However, once something is agreed on as a party resolution, the party leadership wants all members to act on it. [Oikawa] Chairman Murayama, do you have any intention to resign? [Murayama] I have never announced an intention to resign. SDPJ rules stipulate that such organs as the party convention and the Central Committee are responsible for party administration. A party convention has to be held, or a meeting of the Central Committee has to be convened, each time as needed, to hear and approve reports on what has transpired. I will have to call a meeting of the Central Committee at the proper time to report the settlement of the rice issue and the development of the political reform issue, and get the approval of other members.
