The VDAA stated today in Mainz that the representatives from political and medical, as well as human rights organizations are no longer able to move freely and contact their offices in Germany. The situation faced by election monitors in the towns of Van and Diyarbakir appears the same, they said. The detained Germans had traveled to Turkey to follow the local elections in the Kurdish area of the country. In view of the behavior of Turkish police, the VDAA fears for the physical and mental well-being of the election monitors and in particular the Turkish interpreters. Alliance 90/Greens MP Angelika Beer reported from Diyabakir today that groups of monitors had been detained and forced to return, after being threatened with weapons in some cases. For example, after they had been taken back from the town of Cizre to Diyabakir, the Turkish Air Force had bombarded a village near Cizre. In the process 14 people had been killed she said.
