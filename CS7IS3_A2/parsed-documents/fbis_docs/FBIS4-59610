He said: We have agreed on many basic points in several areas of cooperation. But, he added, there are still two points which the Palestinian brothers feel they should study further and that they might clarify with the Palestinian leadership. He said the two points revolve around ways of coordination to license new banks, dealing with the Jordanian dinar, and settling payments between the two sides. Dr. al-'Anani explained that these points are not a subject of dispute, but that they remained outstanding, pending a settlement. He expressed hope that this will take place in the near future, and said that if these two issues are settled, we will have accomplished something extremely important to prepare for the comprehensive concept of economic cooperation. He added: We have agreed that after settling issues pertaining to trade, customs tariff, transit, tourism, issues related to the monetary and banking sector, and arrangements to encourage the private sectors on both sides to cooperate, we should move to another stage soon to discuss other issues, like agriculture, industry, transportation, and the contract sector in a detailed manner. He also explained that it has been agreed in principle that the private sector's activities should occupy a leading and clear position in cooperation and promoting economic exchange. Dr. al-'Anani expressed his thanks to and appreciation for the Palestinian side for its seriousness and its sincere desire to reach cooperation and joint concepts about various issues under discussion. For his part, Quray' told the JORDANIAN NEWS AGENCY: Over the past days, we have held brotherly, sincere, and serious talks on various issues of interest to us during the next stage in order to support and assist the Palestinian authority to deal with its burdens. Quray' also said: The most important agreement we reached during these meetings is that we decided that trade between the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and Palestine should be free and should be exempted from all fees and taxes, except every side's practices regarding its national product. He added that it was also agreed that a free zone will be established in the Jordan Valley to assist both sides' farmers to store and process the agricultural products' surpluses and to contribute to other projects. Regarding banks and currency, he said: We have fully agreed on licensing all the Jordanian banks in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. It was also agreed that the Jordanian dinar would be the main currency to be used, not just one of the currencies, and would be the tool of registering and paying to the Palestinian authority. He added: We also agreed to form subcommittees on trade, currency, banks, and tourism, which we hope will begin meetings as soon as possible. He added: There are still some points that need more clarification from the Palestinian leadership, and we will work for that purpose during the next two days and will return to resume our meetings. He said: The session was adjourned and will be resumed very soon. Quray' said that what is left is a discussion of the details and translating the approved working program into facts, as well as monitoring our ability to implement, develop, and expand it in the future.
