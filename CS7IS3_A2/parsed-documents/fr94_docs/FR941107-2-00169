FR941107-2-00169 FR941107-2-00092 9. The sales load that normally would be applicable on sales of underlying Fund shares will be waived, whether an upfront or deferred sales charge. In accordance with the CDSC Order, applicants will waive any otherwise applicable CDSC where: (a) the Sponsor has purchased such shares in connection with the sale of units; (b) the proceeds of zero-coupon obligations upon termination of a Trust, and distributions from a Trust made during the existence of the Trust, have been reinvested by a unitholder in additional Fund shares; and (c) a Trust at maturity has transferred a unitholder's proportionate number of Fund shares from the Trust to a registration in the unitholder's name in lieu of redeeming such shares. Any waiver will comply with the conditions in paragraphs (a) through (d) of rule 22d&hyph;1 of the Act. Moreover, the Sponsor will rebate to the Trustee any payments it receives in respect of units under any rule 12b&hyph;1 plans adopted by the Funds. Applicants' Legal Analysis: 1. Section 14(a) of the Act requires that investment companies have $100,000 of net worth prior to making a public offering. The Trust will have an initial net worth in excess of $100,000 invested in zero coupon obligations and Fund shares. Applicants recognize, however, that by withdrawing certificates representing the entire beneficial ownership of the Trust, the Sponsor may be deemed to be reducing the Trust's net worth below the requirements of section 14(a). Applicants believe that an exemption is appropriate. Applicants also intend to comply in all respects with the requirements of rule 14a&hyph;3, which provides an exemption from section 14(a), except that the Trust would not restrict its portfolio to ``eligible trust securities.'' 2. Section 19(b) of the Act and rule 19b&hyph;1 thereunder provide that, except under limited circumstances, no registered investment company may distribute long-term capital gains more than once every twelve months. Applicants request an exemption from section 19(b) and rule 19b&hyph;1 to the extent necessary to permit capital gains earned in connection with the redemption of Fund shares to be distributed to unitholders along with the Trust's regular distributions. Applicants believe that the requested exemption is consistent with the purposes of section 19(b) and rule 19b&hyph;1 because the dangers of manipulation of capital gains and confusion between capital gains and regular income distributions does not exist in the Trust. The Trust and its Sponsor have substantially no control over events, other than the selection of the portfolio, which might trigger capital gains ( i.e., the tendering of units for redemption). Moreover, because principal distributions are clearly indicated in accompanying reports to unitholders as a return of principal, applicants believe that the danger of confusion is not present in the operations of the Trust. 3. Section 11(a) of the Act makes it unlawful for any registered open-end investment company or principal underwriter for such company to make certain offers of exchange on any basis other than the relative net asset value of the securities to be exchanged, unless the terms of the exchange offer have first been approved by the SEC. Section 11(c) provides that section 11(a) will be applicable to any type of exchange offer involving securities of a registered unit investment trust, irrespective of the basis of exchange. Applicants request an order pursuant to section 11 (a) and (c) approving the termination option. At the termination of the Trust, unitholders still holding units at maturity will have the option of either transferring the registration of their proportionate number of Fund shares from the Trust to a registration in the investor's name, or receiving a cash distribution. Such unitholders also will have the option of either reinvesting the proceeds of the zero-coupon obligations in additional shares of the Fund (without imposition of the normal sales load), or receiving a cash distribution. The exchange will be made on the basis of the net asset value of the Fund shares. 4. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d&hyph;1 thereunder make it unlawful for any affiliated person of, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of either of them, acting as a principal, to engage in a joint transaction with the investment company unless the joint transaction has been approved by the SEC. Applicants' proposed arrangements may be a joint transaction under these provisions. Applicants believe that the proposed arrangements are consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act, and the participation by each registered investment company is not on a basis less advantageous than that of other participants. 5. Applicants do not request relief under section 12(d)(1) of the Act. Section 12(d)(1) limits purchases by registered investment companies of securities issued by other investment companies. Section 12(d)(1)(E) provides, however, that section 12(d)(1) shall not apply to securities purchased by a registered unit investment trust if the securities are the only ``investment securities'' held by the trust. Applicants believe that the U.S. Treasury zero coupon obligations are not ``investment securities'' for purposes of section 12(d)(1)(E) 2 and that the Fund shares are the only ``investment securities'' which the Trust will hold. Accordingly, they do not believe relief from section 12(d)(1) is necessary. 2 Equity Securities Trust, (pub. avail. Jan. 19, 1994). Applicants' Conditions Applicants agree to the following as conditions to the granting of the requested order: 1. The Trustee will not redeem Fund shares except to the extent necessary to meet redemptions of units by unitholders, or to pay Trust expenses should distributions received on Fund shares and rebated rule 12b&hyph;1 fees prove insufficient to cover such expenses.
