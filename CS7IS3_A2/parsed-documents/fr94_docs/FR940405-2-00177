FR940405-2-00177 FR940405-2-00081 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Act Statement The information collection requirements contained in this notice have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. OMB has approved the section 8 information collection requirements under the assigned control number 2577&hyph;0123; OMB has approved the supportive services information collection requirements under the assigned control number 2577&hyph;0154. I. Purpose and Substantive Description (A) Authority The HOPE for Elderly Independence Multifamily Project Demonstration is authorized by section 803(h) of the National Affordable Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 8012) (NAHA). Section 8 project-based certificate (PBC) assistance is governed by section 8(d)(2)(B) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (1937 Act). The Multifamily Project Demonstration differs from the HOPE for Elderly Independence (Nationwide) Demonstration, the NOFA for which was published on July 22, 1993 (58 FR 39372), in that the Multifamily Project Demonstration is limited to one multifamily housing project in one HUD Region and uses section 8 PBC assistance instead of tenant-based section 8 rental vouchers or certificates. The Project Guidelines governing the Multifamily Project Demonstration are consistent with, but not identical to, the Program Guidelines for the HOPE for Elderly Independence (Nationwide) Demonstration, published in the Federal Register on February 4, 1991 (56 FR 4506), and amended on May 29, 1992 (57 FR 22816). (B) Multifamily Project Demonstration Guidelines (1) Purpose and Scope These guidelines implement the HOPE for Elderly Independence Multifamily Project Demonstration. The purpose of the Multifamily Project Demonstration is to test the effectiveness of using section 8 PBC assistance to assist frail elderly persons and near-frail elderly persons to live independently in a multifamily housing project specifically designed for occupancy by frail and near-frail elderly persons, and to have frail elderly persons reside in this housing in sufficient proportion to achieve economies of scale in the provision of needed supportive services. This Multifamily Project Demonstration refers to assistance that is attached to units as ``project-based'' assistance to distinguish this assistance from the ``tenant-based'' assistance provided by the rental voucher program under the HOPE for Elderly Independence Nationwide Demonstration. With tenant-based assistance, the assisted unit is selected by the family. The HA then enters into an assistance contract, which only covers a single unit and the specific assisted family. If the family moves out of a unit, the assistance contract terminates. The family may move with continued assistance under the tenant-based rental voucher program, and may find a new unit that meets program requirements. With project-based assistance, the HA enters into an assistance contract for a specific project to make housing assistance payments for a specified term, provided the unit is occupied by an eligible family and the unit meets program requirements. To fill vacant project-based units, the HA refers families from its waiting list to the project owner. Because assistance is tied to the unit, a family that moves from the unit does not have any right to continued assistance. Except as otherwise expressly modified or excluded by these Guidelines, the provisions of the section 8 PBC assistance program regulations (24 CFR part 882, subparts A, B and G apply to the project-based assistance under this Multifamily Project Demonstration. The following sections in subpart G do not apply to project-based assistance under this demonstration: §882.702, Additional Definitions; §§882.703 and 882.704 pertaining to HA submission and HUD approval of HA plans to implement a project-based program; §882.714(b), Fair Market Rent limitation; §882.720 (a), (b)(1), and (b)(2), HA unit selection policy; the provisions of §882.721, Rehabilitation: Initial inspection and determination of unit eligibility, and §882.723, New construction: HA evaluation and technical processing, relating to the HA selection of a developer/owner since the owner's proposal is part of the HA application being competitively selected under this NOFA; and §882.740 (b) and (c), Housing Assistance Payments Contract. (2) Definitions For the purposes of this program: Act means section 803 of the National Affordable Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 8012). Activities of Daily Living (ADL) mean eating, dressing, bathing, grooming and household management activities as further described below: _ Eating: May need assistance with cooking, preparing or serving food, but must be able to feed self; _ Bathing: May need assistance in getting in and out of the shower or tub, but must be able to wash self; _ Grooming: May need assistance in washing hair, but must be able to take care of personal appearance; _ Dressing: Must be able to dress self, but may need occasional assistance; _ Home Management Activities: May need assistance in doing housework, grocery shopping or laundry, or getting to and from one location to another for activities such as going to the doctor and shopping, but must be mobile. The mobility requirement does not exclude persons in wheelchairs or those requiring mobility devices. Each of the Activities of Daily Living noted above includes a requirement that a person must be able to perform at a specified minimal level (e.g., to satisfy the eating ADL, the person must be able to feed him/herself). The determination of whether a person meets this minimal level of performance must include consideration of those services that will be performed by a person's spouse, relatives or other attendants to be provided by the individual. For example, if a person requires assistance with cooking, preparing or serving food plus assistance in feeding him/herself, the individual would meet the minimal performance level and thus satisfy the eating ADL, if a spouse, relative or attendant provides assistance with feeding the person. Should such assistance become unavailable at any time, the Owner is not obligated at any time to provide individualized services beyond those offered to the resident population in general. The Activities of Daily Living analysis is relevant only to determine a person's eligibility for initial occupancy in a subsidized unit and eligibility to receive supportive services paid for under the Multifamily Project Demonstration, and is not a determination of eligibility for continued occupancy.
