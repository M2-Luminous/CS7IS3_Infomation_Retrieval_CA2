Ukraine's Foreign Ministry, in particular, pointed out that the report referred to the existence of the sovereign Republic of Crimea within Ukraine. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry qualifies this as nothing other than a statement contradicting the Russian Federation's official position on the issue of respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and existing borders of Ukraine and regards it as interfering in Ukraine's internal affairs. This was a statement made by Yuriy Serheyev, head of the information directorate at Ukraine's Foreign Ministry at a briefing. In connection with the Ambartsumov's deliberations published by LITERATURNAYA GAZETA, the Ukrainian Embassy in Russia issued another note pointing out that, according to the embassy's data, Mr. Ambartsumov has been appointed as an extraordinary and plenipotentiary ambassador of Russia. The following question arises: Do Ambartsumov's statements that the USSR's acts on the integration of Crimean Oblast in Ukraine are unlawful, that the Russian Federation Supreme Council's notorious decision on the status of the city of Sevastopol is incorrect and that the borders between our states are not final, correspond to the Russian Federation's official stance?
