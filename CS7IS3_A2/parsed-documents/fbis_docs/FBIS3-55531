Members of the bloc's executive committee and representatives of Russia's Choice in the deputies commissions, who are members of the organizational committee to prepare the State Duma's work, made this decision on Thursday evening. Commenting this decision for INTERFAX, Yegor Gaydar's aide explained position of Russia's Choice bloc's leader on this issue. He said that despite the unacceptability to cooperate with the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, at the request of small parliamentary factions the bloc had participated in the negotiations because it believes that it should use any chance for a constructive work of the State Duma. However, as Gaydar's aide said, in the course of the negotiations on the future chairman of the State Duma, his deputies and chairmen of the parliamentary committees, opponents of Russia's Choice bloc tried to prolong the time because at every sitting they offered new candidacies to replace those approved the day before. It has become obvious, he said, that "a tripartite bloc," consisting of Liberal Democratic Party, Communist party, and Agrarian Party of Russia, has formed in the process of the negotiations which has started to divide the posts of parliamentary committees' leaders. According to their plans, representatives of the Liberal Democratic Party must head, in particular, the committee on international affairs and defense, representatives of the communist party -- committees on state security and economic policy, and a representative of the Agrarian party -- a committee on constitutional legislature and legal reform. Under this situation the Russia's Choice bloc has decided that it will not participate in such a division of the State Duma and make it legal as it is prematurely a non-constrcutive one. Simultaneously Russia's Choice called the State Duma's democratic factions, that is, all factions except the Liberal Democratic Party, Communist party, and Agrarian party to hold active consultations in order to adopt decisions which would promote for the constrcutive work of the State Duma. "It will not take much time if there is a mutual wish to find a coordinated decision," said INTERFAX interlocutor. In his words, Russia's Choice views the principle according to which representative of one of the small factions must become chairman of the State Duma and representatives of Russia's Choice, Liberal Democratic Party, Communist party, and Agrarian party - his deputies as "rather doubtful because it does not take into account interests of small factions." According to Gaydar's aide, Russia's Choice would agree to see either Alevtina Fedulova (leader of Russia's Women bloc), or first deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin or Vladimir Lukin, both representing Yavlinskiy's bloc, on the post of the chairman of the State Duma. Yegor Gaydar's aide also reported that in the course of a two-day working conference held by the members of the bloc on January 5-6, the Russia's Choice bloc had discussed the bloc's tactics in the Duma and working documents to be submitted to the parliament by Russia's Choice. Russia's Choice wants to propose to the State Duma to go through the organizational stage as soon as possible and to concentrate its efforts on the law making work. However, "the situation is being painfully worsening," said INTERFAX interlocutor.
