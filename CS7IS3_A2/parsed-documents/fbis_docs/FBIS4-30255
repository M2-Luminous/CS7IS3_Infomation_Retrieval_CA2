The Economic Planning Board [EPB] said Thursday that the government has already begun detailed calculations to hike public employees' salaries next year at a rate similar to this year's 6.2 percent. In addition to the pay rise, the government is considering increasing the number of primary and secondary school teachers, judges and prosecutors slightly. It is also considering a differential payment of managerial job allowances, which are now uniformly paid to officials of grade four and above, so that those doing a good job would receive better treatment. This year's salary for civil servants is 90 percent of that for state-run businesses and the government may push its employees' salaries up to 94 percent next year and 97 percent in 1996. From 1997, pay for officials would be the same as that at state-run enterprises, according to an EPB official. Meanwhile, the government will freeze the total number of employees next year under its principle of "small government," except that it will newly employ 2,000 more school teachers and 50 additional judges and prosecutors.
