Of course, the accent was on the situation in the Balkans, more precisely on the situation in the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] in its dispute with neighboring Greece, as well as on general relations between Italy and Macedonia. On the importance of the new transport corridor -- the corridor linking Italy, Albania, Macedonia, Bulgaria, and Turkey, Benjamino Andreatta stated: "Italy is very favorably viewing the project for the construction of a trans-Balkan east-west railway and highway corridor that could be a basic component for pursuing cooperation between the states in this region, as well as with the surrounding states, one of which is Italy, due to its geographic position. The initiative was renewed at the recent meeting in Sofia attended by representatives of transport ministries of the interested countries, when the `Memorandum of Understanding' was signed, confirming the commitment and good will for the realization of this project." "The realization of the corridor," Andreatta emphasized, "would enable Macedonia to be better and more equally included in the system of European transport networks. Soon the BERS [not further specified] organization will send a mission to Skopje to determine priority spheres of involvement." Commenting on the development of relations between the two countries, the Italian foreign minister also said: "As you know, Italy has actively contributed to the stabilization of the new republic born after the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia, by assisting its gradual involvement in international life and activities. It is doing so with the firm belief that the association with Macedonia will have a positive effect on the realization of a gradual and desired stabilization of the entire Balkan region. In this context, Rome decided to establish diplomatic relations with Skopje on 16 December of last year. As a matter of fact, even before the establishment of diplomatic relations with Italy, continuing activity for support of your country had begun in the relevant international organizations, in reply to requests for economic aid submitted by the Macedonian Government. Parallel to that, Italy persistently supported the admission of your country to the Central European Initiative within the purview of supporting and approaching Macedonia, and it also expressed its wholehearted support to its admission to the CSCE [Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe] which has, unfortunately, not yet been accomplished, due to the opposition of some member states." "On the basis of such premises," Benjamino Andreatta pointed out, "there is a lot of room for strengthening bilateral cooperation, particularly on the economic and cultural plane. We will dedicate our attention to that in near future, with the hope that in the meantime conditions of stability and peace will be reestablished in the Balkans, that will ease the intensification of bilateral cooperation with all the countries in the region, including the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia." About the dispute with Greece, as well as its implications on security in the region, the Italian foreign minister emphasized that Italy was deeply concerned about the possible negative consequences on stability in the region after the restrictive measures undertaken by Athens. "Italy," Andreata emphasized, "together with the other European partners, never misses the opportunity to present that concern to Athens." He also pointed out that the Italian side looks forward to the resumption of direct negotiations between the two sides as soon as possible, in order to create prerequisites for a gradual normalization of bilateral relations between Macedonia and Greece. "In that regard, it will be necessary, more precisely it will be indispensable for both the sides, to demonstrate the needed flexibility," Andreata said in his exclusive interview for PULS.
