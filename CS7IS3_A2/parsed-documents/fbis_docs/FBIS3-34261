The reason for the postponement was to brief lawyers about the case before the hearing. The court met under the chairmanship of Judge Salah al-Fahd and listened to the witness Abd al-Hamid al-Shatti, a Kuwaiti national who works at the Ministry of Interior. The witness said that when one of the accused was arrested he confessed that he was trained by Iraqi intelligence to assassinate Bush and blow up vital and crowded Kuwaiti locations. He stressed that after the investigations and interrogations it became clear that Iraqi intelligence had provided the two main suspects: Wali al-Ghazali and Salim Nasir, with what was needed, referring to their confession that they were Iraqi intelligence personnel.
