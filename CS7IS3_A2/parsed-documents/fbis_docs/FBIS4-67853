The memorandum was published in connection with the fact that the United States and its satellite forces have resorted to the one-track course of pressure by enjoining fullscope inspections on the DPRK with disregard to the unique status of the DPRK which has temporarily suspended the effectuation of its declared withdrawal from the treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). It throws a revealing light on the major obstacles to the solution of the nuclear issue and the truth behind them. It says that although the United States and the secretariat of the IAEA recognized the DPRK's unique status following the temporary suspension of the effectuation of its announced withdrawal from the NPT, they are still talking about the ``noncompliance with the safeguards agreement'' and ``full inspection.'' ``Such action clearly shows that they are using the safeguards agreement as a leverage for attaining their dishonest political objectives of strangling the DPRK's system,'' it notes. Pointing out that the inspection activities that befit the DPRK's current unique status are only the inspection activities necessary for maintaining the continuity of safeguards, it declares: ``How long the DPRK's unique status will last depends entirely on when the United States renounces its nuclear threat against the DPRK and its policy of antagonizing and strangling it and, at the same time, when the agency redresses its partiality and injustice to the DPRK.'' The memorandum further says: ``The DPRK's unique status would naturally terminate if further round of DPRK-USA talks take place and the simultaneous action steps are carried into practice with a view to resolving the nuclear issue once and for all on the principle of the proposed package solution.'' It notes that the IAEA secretariat and the United Nations Security Council, both in support of the U.S. policy of antagonising and strangling the DPRK, are openly applying their extremely discriminatory and prejudiced double standards to the DPRK's ``nuclear issue.'' ``Unless the United States renounces its policy of hostility and nuclear threat campaign against the DPRK and unless the IAEA secretariat redresses its partiality and injustice to the DPRK, the DPRK's reinstatement in the treaty will remain absolutely inconceivable and, therefore, full implementation of the safeguards agreement will have no sense of word at the present stage,'' states the memorandum, and continues: ``The DPRK sincerely wants the nuclear issue to be resolved impartially. To this end, the United States and the IAEA secretariat must clearly realise their responsibility for the origination of the nuclear issue and for its current complexity, stop resorting to the unreasonable and contradictory method of double standards and pressure, and must seek unprejudiced and substantial ways to resolve the nuclear issue once and for all.''
