During the first quarter of 1994 domestic exports to Germany rose by 2.2 percent compared with the previous year, imports went up by 6.9 percent. In 1993 Austria's exports to Germany experienced the sharpest decline since the end of the war: Compared with 1992 they declined by 6.1 percent to 182.25 billion Austrian schillings [AS]. Imports from Germany declined by 8 percent to AS234.2 billion, according to Guenther Graf, the trade commissioner in Germany. The recovery of the German economy could be seen already at the end of last year; however, its full effect will probably only be felt in 1995, Graf estimates. Austria's membership in the European Union will help to benefit from this recovery. The exports of foodstuffs and beverages in particular will benefit from the opening up of the market. Austrian producers are very interested in the German market and are supported by the Chamber of Commerce with a concerted action program. In 1993 foodstuffs and beverages were the only groups of products that experienced an increase despite the general decline in exports to Germany. The recovery of the German automobile industry also gives hope for an improvement to Austrian subcontractors.
