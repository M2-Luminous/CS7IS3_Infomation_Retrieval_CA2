The Ukrainian Ministry for power industry has 294 enterprises under its command, including 42 power plants and 88 enterprises, which service power and heat transmission lines. Supply of electric power to consumers is effected via 615 regional networks including 493 networks in rural areas of Ukraine. The total length of Ukraine's aerial and cable transmission lines amounts to 1,014,342 km including 951,604 km of aerial high-voltage transmission lines and 62,738 km of ground cable lines. Ukrainian power lines' maximal voltage is set at 800 kV. There are about 2,047,000 transformer substations in Ukraine with an aggregate power of 197,062 MVA. Power Generation (According to the Ministry of power industry) (Billion kWh) Yrs Total Including FFP's Percent HEP's Percent NPP's Percent 1990 298.5 211.6 70.9 10.7 3.6 76.2 25.5 1991 278.6 191.6 68.8 11.9 4.3 75.1 26.9 1992 252.6 170.8 67.6 8.1 3.2 73.7 29.2 1993 230.2 143.8 62.4 11.2 4.9 75.2 32.7 Ukraine's NPP's generated a total of 75.2 MWe including 27.5 MWe by the Zaporozhye NPP, 11.8 MWe by the Rovno NPP, 5.8 MWe by the Khmelnitski NPP, 12.6 MWe by the Chernobyl NPP and 17.5 MWe by the South-Ukrainian NPP. Ukraine's largest fuel-fired power plants are located in Zaporozhye, Uglegorsk, Krivoi Rog and Burshtynsk. Electric power generation started shrinking back in 1991, accompanying Ukraine's total production slump. Reductions in power generation have been, since then, mirroring rather pro rata the dropping power consumption by industrial enterprises, forced to curtail production and thus economize on electricity in view of their products' too low competitiveness, due, among numerous other reasons, to excessive power consumption per unit of produce. According to the Ministry of power industry, in 1993 Ukraine exported 2.7 MWe, though before 1990 it used to annually export as much as 30 MWe. As Vasiliy Protsenko, a deputy agency superintendent with the Ministry, maintains, the sharply reduced power export by Ukraine has been caused by the West's excessive power generation at much lower costs and prices. Thus, purchasing prices have dropped from 5.1 cents to 2.3 cents pr kW, while Ukrainian electric power generation costs average 2.55 per kW. The Ministry's forecast for 1994 is none too optimistic. Though the State Order prescribes to generate 134 billion kWh by Ukraine's fuel-fired power plants, not over 113.5 billion kWh will be actually generated by them. Similarly, Ukrainian HEP's will likely reduce their generation to the 9.46 MWe mark, and 70 MWe is expected to be generated by the Ukrainian nukes. In addition to Ukrainian industrial enterprises' shrinking consumption shortages of fuels will most certainly contribute to the predicted power generation drop. Fuel's Break-Down in Electric Power Generation and Heat Energy Production Ukraine's fuel-fired power plants rely on coal, oil fuel and natural gas. Total power and fuel consumption amounted to 55.6 million tons of conditional fuel, of which coal accounted for 26.2 million tons (44 per cent), oil fuel's share was 6.5 million tons (or 11 per cent), while natural gas and hydro-electric power accounted for respectively 23.1 (38.8 per cent) and 3.7 (6.2 per cent) million tons of conditional fuel. Physical amounts of fuels consumed by power plants were 42.9 million tons of coal, 4.8 million tons of oil fuel, and 20.2 billion cu. m. of natural gas. According to Mr. Protsenko, in 1993 Ukraine imported 6 million tons of coal, basically from Russia, though this year coal imports are expected to drop to 1 million tons, primarily due to shortages of Russian rubles. The forecast shortages of coal and oil fuel are estimated at 2.3 million tons and 2.9 million tons, respectively. Before 1990, the Ukrainian power industry's annual oil fuel requirements averaged 18 million tons. Presently, the figure is reduced to 3.8 million tons, since 50 per cent of power generating units are idle. During the summer season's 30 per cent reduction in power consumption fuel-fired power plants rely on oil fuel and natural gas to save 800,000 to 1 million tons of coal for the fall-winter period. Fuel shortages threaten with emergency situations, since the circuit's frequency drop below the critical threshold of 49.5 kHz will result in the circuit's collapse. In view of this circumstance, the Ministry of power industry has to urgently cut off power supply to some consumers. In this way, about 3,000 Ukrainian enterprises are daily cut off from power supply for brief periods. Ukrainian NPP' consumed about 24 million tons of conditional fuel in 1992. Power Industry's Financial Standing Presently, Ukraine's industrial enterprise-clients owe 9.5 trillion krb. to the Ministry of power industry. The latter's indebtedness is estimated at 9.8 trillion krb. including 1.525 trillion krb. for coal, 1.469 trillion krb. for oil fuel, and 1.952 trillion krb. for natural gas. According to Mr. Turos, the Ministry's agency superintendent, the government's credits, which were granted in late March to the Ministries of Industry and engineering, MIC and conversion to enable their enterprises to repay their indebtedness for fuels, were channeled elsewhere, so the debt to the Ministry of power industry was not repaid. As Ivan Magda, Deputy Minister for power industry, asserts, the Ministry is a virtual bankrupt, while its debtors repay only 50 per cent of their daily debts. According to the Ministry's experts, the too low electric power tariff, which was set on January 1, 1994, is the major reason of the power industry's dire financial straits.
