The private sector has played a positive role in developing the social productive forces and in improving the people's living standards. According to statistics compiled by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, by late September last year, individual industrial and commercial operators had increased to 16 million, hiring 26 million people, up 11.7 and 14 percent respectively over the same period the previous year. Private enterprises had increased to 210,000, employing 3.31 million people, up 72.6 and 62.4 percent respectively over the same period the previous year. The taxes paid to the state annually by individual operators and private enterprises averaged 20 billion yuan, accounting for 7.8 percent of the state's total industrial and commercial tax revenues. The private sector took on about 1 million redundant laborers, making up 10 percent of workers employed by all businesses throughout the country. In Guangdong and Fujian, which carried out reform and opened to the outside world earlier than other areas, individual operators and private enterprises have grown faster. In Guangdong, there are 1.3 million self-employed operators, and private enterprises with registered capital exceeding 1 million yuan number 1,000. In Fujian there are 540,000 self-employed operators and private enterprises, with their total registered capital hitting 7 billion yuan. In Henan, an inland province, there are now 900,000 self-employed operators and private enterprises, the best record for the last 43 years. At present, individual industrial and commercial businesses and private enterprises are allowed to operate in bonded areas, development areas, and experimental areas. In addition, development areas for the private economy have been set up in Shanghai, Shenyang, and Dalian, and investment areas for private enterprises have been set up in Hubei, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Anhui, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu. All this is the first major change in the private sector on the mainland. The second change is that the private enterprises have expanded unprecedentedly in terms of their trades and scope, with operations having extended to all trades allowed by the government. There is every indication that they now are beginning to penetrate such important industries as aviation, chemicals, electronics, building materials, grain and edible oils, and even into the cultural, educational, and public health fields. For instance, private schools and hospitals have been established in various places. Private enterprises are allowed to establish horizontal trans- sectoral and transregional economic ties, and to take stock in, run by lease, contract to run, purchase, and annex collectively owned and state enterprises. A total of 46 state and collectively owned enterprises were purchased and annexed by individual operators and private enterprises in Zhejiang alone last year. This is the third change in the private sector. The fourth change is that more and more private enterprises are moving toward the international market by setting up joint ventures with foreign businessmen. According to incomplete statistics provided by 12 coastal provinces and cities, Sino-foreign joint-venture enterprises set up by private enterprises and foreign businessmen have topped 400. Private enterprise groups also have grown in number and scope with each passing day. Some private enterprise groups have hired more than 1,000 employees and their annual output value has reached 10 million or even 100 million yuan. About 5,000 to 6,000 private enterprises have earned foreign exchange by exporting products and have carried on border trade. A number of self-employed operators and private enterprises have done business, set up factories, opened companies, and engaged in property development in foreign countries. The fifth change is that a number of college graduates, experts, professors, public figures, and retired cadres have joined private enterprises over the last few years with the result that the average age of employees of private enterprises has dropped and that their cultural level, professional level, social status, and reputation have been raised greatly. The private sector on the mainland has risen from oblivion and is playing a greater and greater role in the national economy. With the increase in the number of foreign-funded enterprises and with more and more state enterprises being taken over by private enterprises, the gap between different economic sectors gradually will narrow and they will compete on an equal footing. As private enterprises operate flexibly and adapt themselves quickly to market needs, they will grow at a greater pace.
