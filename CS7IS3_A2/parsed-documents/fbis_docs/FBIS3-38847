[Ruehe] The United Nations has to decide whether and how it wants to punish the culprits. If necessary, the humanitarian measures have to be temporarily suspended. It is not enough to protect the UN troops. The protection of the population is far more urgent, and it requires a different strategy than before. [Bruessel] What can Germany do? [Ruehe] I have advocated for a long time that the Bosnian Muslims be armed so that they can better defend themselves. Germany will not recognize borders that are changed by force. The aggressor will not get a single mark for reconstruction. Now we are supporting vigorously the decisionmaking process of the United Nations, NATO, and the European Union. We agree with Washington on what has to be done. [Bruessel] How can the Bundeswehr participate in a NATO mission? [Ruehe] For months, our Luftwaffe has been taking food and medicine to Sarajevo and eastern Bosnia every day. Our ships and aircraft have been helping to enforce the embargo. The unclarified constitutional issue does not permit more. Moreover, the participation of German soldiers in a NATO combat mission would complicate the conflict rather than help to solve it. [Bruessel] Is NATO unable to act? [Ruehe] The UN Security Council must now show that it is able to act resolutely, quickly, and responsibly. It would be unfair to criticize NATO since only the United Nations can make the decision.
