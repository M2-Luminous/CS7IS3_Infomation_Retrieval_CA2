DP Chairman Yi Ki-taek also expressed sympathy and understanding for the government for having to deal with U.S. foreign policy which, he said, puts its own national interests ahead of all other considerations. Yi evaluated the results of his visit to Washington after returning home Monday, cutting short his U.S. itinerary because of the abrupt resignation last Friday of Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang. "Through my talks with American personalities, both in and out of the government, on the North Korean nuclear row and the Uruguay Round, I am convinced that our party could carry through its positions on these issues," Yi said. The DP opposes sanctions against North Korea and rejects the Uruguay Round trade agreement. The party has vowed to block ratification of the UR accord at the National Assembly. "At the same time, I could feel acutely how difficult it would be to conduct diplomacy against (U.S.) foreign policy that erects a high barrier that is called the national interest," he said. "I realized what kind of steel wall our government officials have to face (in diplomatic negotiations) in defense of our own national interest," he added. The DP chairman defined Yi Hoe-chang's resignation as "a national crisis," and said that the country should form either "a pan- national crisis management council" or "a national coalition cabinet." He said his party, however, has no intention of taking advantage of the current crisis for political purposes. The opposition party is prepared to work together with the ruling party to overcome the present difficulties, he said.
