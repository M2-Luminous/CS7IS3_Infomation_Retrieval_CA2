Asked to comment on the present priorities of the Ministry of Finance, Gerashchenko says: "The Ministry of Finance will have to be rather strict in its budget spending and to allocate credits only to those industries whose survival -- with help or subsidies from the state -- is dictated precisely by state interests." Asked to qualify the financial policy carried out at present by the Central Bank, Gerashchenko says: "Well, first of all, there must be a certain degree of firmness in the light of the constant barrage of requests from various industries, who sometimes stick to old habits and keep on asking for money from both the government and the Central Bank. At the same time we must be aware that in certain instances there are industries which must be supported by our economic policy, and that it would be unwise for us to leave our traditional distribution markets in both near abroad and other countries. This requires certain measures of encouragement, the introduction of certain protectionist measures or subsidies. "The Directors' Council took a decision as early as last year to limit to 12 percent the share of foreign capital within the capital of commercial banks operating on the Russian territory. Certain protectionism is needed here." Asked how the bank's policy corresponds to the presidential edict, Gerashchenko says: "Completely." The program concludes with a lengthy comment by Nikolay Svanidze on the need for a certain cohesion between the bank's "elegant" financial policy and the elegance of its premises. The bank is now in the process of a complete revamp of its so-called small conference room in an "imperial epic style". Painter Ilya Glazunov has been approached and he proposed to paint a huge portrait of Czar Aleksandr II signing a decree on the establishment of the Central Bank of Russia. The bank had its doubts and has backed off from the project.
