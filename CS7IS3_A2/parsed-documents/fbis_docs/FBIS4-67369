Shramchenko: "Nuclear Laws Have Been Written but Are Languishing in Parliamentary Archives"] [Text] The history of civilian and military nuclear power dates back almost 50 years. But we still do not have a single federal legislative act directly regulating the use of nuclear energy. You get the impression that the legal vacuum here suits the competing branches of power, the nuclear power industry departments, and industry down to the ground. Prior to the events of October 1993, one of the initiators of the systematic approach to nuclear legislation was the Radiation Safety Subcommittee of the Supreme Soviet Committee on Ecology. The subcommittee spent three years studying problems of nuclear and radiation safety in Russia and cooperated with the U.S. Senate and the European Parliament in this work. Its portfolio contained the most important legislative initiatives: a draft concept of the legal backup for the use of nuclear power, draft laws on problems of the treatment of radioactive waste, the application of nuclear technologies in the national economy, nuclear power station safety, and others. In conjunction with the draft Law "On the Use of Nuclear Energy," which was prepared by the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet Committee on Industry and Power Generation, they could soon have become the basis for Russia's nuclear law. But they did not. Today neither the Russian Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources nor the government departments which deal with safety problems are showing the due interest in the continuation of that work. Clearly it is easier to live according to departmental instructions. As a result radioactive waste, for example, will continue to be poured into the ground and into water systems. The most dangerous products -- highly radioactive liquid waste -- will be buried deep in the earth as a "gift" to future generations. Clearly it does not make sense for the State Duma to begin entirely from scratch and it is necessary to make use of the existing draft documents. What are the most important principles that we propose, insisting on the systematic regulation of legislation in the sphere of the use of nuclear energy? 1. In the use of nuclear power Russia will be oriented toward the priority of protecting the health of the population and the natural environment over economic benefit; 2. The state will monitor the safety of installations using nuclear power regardless of their forms of ownership; 3. The regulation of safety and oversight in the sphere of the use of nuclear power both in the national economy and at installations of the Russian Federation Defense Ministry must be exercised by a single state organ; 4. The population and pubic organizations must take part in the discussion of questions of ensuring safety in the use of nuclear power and this participation must be enshrined in law; 5. A triad consisting of a federal organ, a component of the Federation, and organs of local self-government must take part in the solution of the most important questions (the siting of nuclear power stations and the storage of radioactive nuclear waste); 6. The final decision on the siting of potentially hazardous installations using nuclear power must take the population's opinion into account; 7. The departmental norms must unconditionally be based on federal laws of the Russian Federation. After the effective blocking of nuclear legislation in the Supreme Soviet, the adoption of the Russian Federation Constitution, and the subsequent hiatus in the legislative organ's activity, the time has come for those departments which use nuclear power to finally realize that the present situation is intolerable. The government must exercise its right to initiate legislation in this sphere. As a result of U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to Russia and the subsequent accords on deliveries of enriched uranium to the United States, the Ministry of Atomic Energy could become the largest holder of hard currency. It is to be hoped that at least a small proportion of the resources earned at installations which represent an enhanced danger to the population and the natural environment will be allocated by the Ministry of Atomic Energy to the formation of a nuclear law. The atom will not remain without rights forever in Russia! [signed] Experts on nuclear law A. Ioyrysh, V. Kiselev, U. Margulis, V. Menshikov, Ye. Nesterov, A. Protsenko, Yu. Rogozhin, Yu. Fedulov, V.
