Information released by the Ministry indicated that the purchase value was put at RMB 68.62 billion while the sales value registered RMB 80.1 billion during the first quarter of this year. There were 9,000 enterprises under the system suffering a loss, making up 52 percent of the total. The sales of major kinds of materials showed a comprehensive drop with cotton down by 51 percent, steel material by 41 percent, aluminium- steel by 60 percent and cars by 33 percent. The loss, according to Mr. Ma, was mainly attributed to investment in key construction items not in place while some production enterprises suffered from a shortage of circulation capital which in turn caused a slump in market demand. Second, enterprises were not familiar with the new taxation system and negative impacts were caused. Third, an increase in interest represented a drop of profits. Fourth, measures adopted were not so effective because of insufficient understanding of the macro- economic situation. The vice minister asked personnel within the system for great efforts to reverse the loss.
