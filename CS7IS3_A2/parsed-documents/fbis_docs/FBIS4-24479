The city has more than 280,000 farmers and herdsmen in the surrounding rural areas. As the drinking water in the area lacks iodine and selenium, the city has invested more than three million yuan since 1990 to build nearly 400 water supply stations with water supply pipes and deep wells. The local government is also persuading and helping local villagers to build lavatories. Now more than 3,600 household lavatories have been built. The Public Health Department has shot several video tapes including "water and public health" and "women's and children's hygiene" and broadcast them in rural areas to heighten sanitary knowledge. A book about hygiene was written and has become part of a compulsory course for primary school pupils in the area.
