FBIS4-23654 "drafr113_c_94009" FBIS-AFR-94-113 Daily Report 13 Jun 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 13 Jun South African Press Review for 13 Jun MB1306115194 MB1306115194 BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR Minister Modise's Gagging of Newspaper -- "Strange, is it not, that within weeks of taking office, an ANC Minister should seek to gag a newspaper in precisely the same way as his Nationalist predecessors did," questions the Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 13 June in a page-10 editorial. "The interdict which Joe Modise sought last week against the WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN bore the hallmarks of many previous similar actions by the old regime -- obsessive secrecy over defence and a knee-jerk reaction to stop matters of legitimate public concern being aired." "We do not know the merits or demerits of the spies' case, and still less about the Minister's motives. What does not augur well is that the new Government should slip so easily into the ways of the old and trample so readily over the public's right to be informed." SOWETAN Minister Modise's Gagging of Newspaper -- "The bid by Minister of Defence Mr Joe Modise to use apartheid's apparatus to muzzle a newspaper is deplorable," begins the Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 13 June in a page-6 editorial. "It seemed rather odd when the former MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] commander brought an interdict in the Supreme Court last week to prevent the WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN from publishing revelations by former CCB [Civil Cooperation Bureau] members. He was rightly condemned by his own party for seemingly attempting to cover up past covert operations of the SADF [South African Defense Force]." "We hope the ANC's criticism of Modise is a signal to other ministers that cover-ups and a lack of transparency in government will not be tolerated."
