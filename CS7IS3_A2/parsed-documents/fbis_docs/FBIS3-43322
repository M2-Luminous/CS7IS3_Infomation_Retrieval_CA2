Otherwise its presence in Kigali is pointless. This is stated in a communique of the RPF issued this afternoon during a press conference held by the front's president, Alexis Kanyarengwe at the Amaryambere Hotel in Kimihurura. In the communique, read by the party's president, the RPF gives its views on some of the problems in the setting up of the broad-based institutions and stresses that it will not tolerate the results of political maneuvers. Here is Colonel Kanyarengwe. [Begin Kanyarengwe recording] [Words indistinct] declares that it will not at all tolerate any results reached by political maneuvers aimed at substituting other lists of deputies for the one initially selected in the framework of setting up institutions on the 37th day after the date of the signing of the Arusha peace agreement. The RPF also declares that it does not accept the last minute change of heart of parties such as the Coalition for the Defense of the Republic [CDR] which had publicly declared that it would not take part in the transitional national assembly and therefore had not nominated its deputies. [passage omitted] Any authority, individuals or parties who neglect their role in the setting up of the institutions will be responsible for the consequences which may result from the situation. This call is made particularly to the president of the Republic who should be the first person to make himself available for the swearing-in ceremonies of the deputies of the transitional assembly and members of the government team. The pursuit of maneuvers aimed at [word indistinct] a minority the blockade of institutions in favor of the president of the Republic and his party, obliges the RPF to declare to the national and international opinions that its presence in Kigali is pointless. [passage omitted] Our position is clear (?and it is the following): We did not come here to play around or to watch a play. We are here to work, we are not here on holiday. This is in summary the meaning of the declaration. We are here to work. If you will allow it, we are available. If there are other intentions, [words indistinct] what else can you reproach the RPF with, of not having done? We are here in the capital. So why are we here? I put this question to you journalists. What is the purpose? To tolerate the whim of your president? No. [end recording]
