This will be promoted by the opening of Kazakhstan's diplomatic missions in more European countries. This was mentioned during a meeting on Tuesday between Kazakhstan Vice-President Eric Asanbayev [name and title as received] and CSCE Secretary-General Wilhelm Hoeynck who arrived in Almaty for a working visit. The sides agreed that more effort should be exerted to put a stop to conflicts in Central Asia, specifically in Tajikistan. On the same day Wilhelm Hoeynck met with Kazakh Foreign Minister Tuleutay Suleymenov. It was noted during the conversation that following a meeting in Rome of foreign ministers of CSCE participating countries, new sovereign states in Central Asia, also Kazakhstan, strengthen their relations with that international organisation and are involved in joint work with CSCE. In the Friendship House in the evening, Wilhelm Hoeynck met with representatives of non-governmental and public organisations and the media and answered their questions. The CSCE secretary-general leaves for Bishkek on Wednesday.
