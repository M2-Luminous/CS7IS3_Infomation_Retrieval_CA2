The two North Koreans, one believed to be a scientist, arrived in Hong Kong separately on March 11 and 13 from China, he said, adding "the matter is now being investigated." They are the first North Koreans to defect in this way. A spokesman for the South Korea consulate here said the two could be North Koreans, but added "we don't exactly know what's going on as of now. The Hong Kong government has not approached us on the matter." The two reportedly walked across the border from China in broad daylight and were at first taken for Chinese illegal immigrants when they were stopped by border patrols on this side. The Hong Kong Immigration Department was reportedly trying to assist the two in their application for asylum in South Korea.
