Our parliamentary correspondent Milan Repka reports. [Repka] Jiri Payne should have left for a two-day official visit to Libya today. According to our information, he decided not to go. Deputy Chairman Jan Kasal told Czech radio that the Chamber's leadership did not cancel any foreign trips. Pavel Seifer, deputy from the Liberal Social Union, said that, in his view, this indicates the Civic Democratic Party's [ODS] preparation to quietly dismiss Payne from the post of the chairman of the Chamber's Foreign Committee. But ODS press spokeswoman Jana Petrova denied this. She told Czech radio that the ODS leadership proposed nothing of the kind to Payne. Regarding the connection between Payne's pronouncements during his visit to the United States and the abolition of his trip to Libya, Petrova said that she did not know why Payne was not going to Libya. A meeting of the Chamber of Deputies is due to open on 15 February. It is likely that a proposal to dismiss the present chairman of the foreign committee from his post will be submitted there.
