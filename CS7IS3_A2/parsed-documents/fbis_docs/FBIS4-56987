President Rafael Caldera criticized price increases of certain products as well as profiteering in the sale of dollars, which are acts of corruption that should be fought. That was part of Caldera's speech during the celebration of the 50th anniversary of Fedecamaras. President Caldera pointed out that all sectors of society must join Solidarity's efforts so it can make progress. Caldera also talked about the importance of opening up opportunities for foreign investment by providing greater legal guarantees. He said private and public corruption must be fought. Let us listen to excerpts of what Caldera said. [Begin Caldera recording] We have seen how the prices of certain products have been increased. The Venezuelan people are undoubtedly being hurt by this. It is an act of corruption that we have to fight. We know that [words indistinct]. That is why an atmosphere such as this, with a spirit of friendship and of solidarity, can lead us to expect that we can all make an effort. Just as the Venezuelan private sector condemns a government official who steals the people's money through public works that are built, it should also condemn a private sector member, who buys dollars to resell them for an undue profit. [end recording] In addition, President Caldera agreed with Fedecamaras President Edgar Romero Navas that the fight against inflation must not be stopped because, according to Romero Navas, the country requires a series of changes. Romero Navas also said coherence and compromise are needed in the executive cabinet. He said our business and political criteria on the handling of the country's resources should also be taken into account.
