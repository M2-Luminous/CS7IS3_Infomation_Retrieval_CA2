Yan disclosed yesterday that representatives of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and the government panel have agreed to hold the second round of formal talks on 13-20 April in Jakarta, Indonesia. Yan, chairman of the government panel in the peace negotiations with the MNLF said that another meeting among members of the mixed committee representing both panels was also slated for 5-7 April in Zamboanga City in preparation for the holding of the formal talks in Indonesia. He expressed belief that the meeting between the two groups will be held smoothly since they have established better confidence and atmosphere for the next round of talks. Yan also said that members of the mixed committee of both panels met yesterday in an undisclosed place in Metro Manila on preparations for the holding of the formal talks. Included in yesterday's meeting were security arrangements for members of the two panels, particularly those to be assigned to MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari during the 5 April mixed committee meeting in Zamboanga City. "We will give him (Misuari) adequate security but definitely not more than 500 as he earlier requested," Yan said. A joint cease fire committee chaired by Brig. Gen. Guillermo Ruiz of the Philippine Marines will submit today the details of the meeting of the mixed committee to Yan. Ruiz's counterpart in the secessionist group is an MNLF major general. The joint cease fire committee has formed 13 subcommittees in the 13 Mindanao provinces to monitor the implementation of the cease fire agreement. Yan said that the recently formulated guidelines and ground rules for the implementation of the joint cease fire agreement signed by the two parties last 7 November in Jakarta "was fully endorsed by the Organization of Islamic Countries." Meanwhile, leaders of the MNLF pledged to arrest their members who were allegedly involved in the recent kidnaping of five school teachers in Basilan. Yan said that the MNLF vowed to arrest Commander Sulaiman Alih and a fugitive municipal councilor of Tuburan town in Basilan who abducted five teachers of the Boji Tambis Elementary School last 7 March. Ruiz said that the kidnaping case presented before the joint cease fire committee was considered the first major cease fire violation of the MNLF. The five kidnap victims were released unharmed last 11 March. Yan, however, stressed that the spate of kidnapings in Mindanao has not adversely affected the ongoing peace negotiations. President Ramos strengthened yesterday his peace process staff as he called on governors and mayors nationwide to fully support the ongoing peace negotiations with various rebel groups. The president, stressing that the peace process must move on, named Manuel Yan acting presidential adviser on the peace process, concurrent with his position as chairman of the Philippine negotiating panel for the peace talks with the Southern Philippine Autonomous Groups (GRP [Government of the Republic of the Philippines]-SPAG). Yan, a former ambassador, succeeded Oscar Santos who was moved by the president to the post of presidential consultant on the peace process. In his regular press conference in Malacanang [presidential office], the president said Yan will be responsible for the administration of the Office of the Presidential Assistant on the Peace Process (OPAPP), as well as supervision of the three government negotiating panels. "Santos will now be free to be sent on a mission-type of activity to help in the peace process, especially in his area of expertise which is among the coconut farmers, small farmers, and workers in Quezon and the Southern Tagalog provinces," the president said. The president said that Santos has been fighting a serious physical disability and has been advised by his doctors to take it easy. "But he is okay now," he added. Ramos earlier ordered peace negotiators to speed up their work without being blocked by legalities. The president directed all Cabinet Officials for Regional Development (CORD) and Regional Development Council (RDC) chairpersons to ensure coordinated action and effective communication in support of the ongoing peace process of the government. During the quarterly CORD-RDC meeting in Malacanang, the president emphasized the importance of the involvement of the RDC chairmen who are also governors and city mayors of their respective areas. "We would like you to get involved in this effort because we are seeing the end of the insurgency. We have to make sure that we provide some hospitality, opportunity, and attraction for those remaining out there in the hills," President Ramos said. The president directed the CORD-RDCs to coordinate closely with the OPAPP and the Regional and Provincial Peace Convenors in the implementation of measures to support the overall peace process of the government. The CORD-RDCs were also directed to inform their constituents on what the government has done to push the reform program and to address the roots of the internal armed conflict in the country. The chief executive required them to submit reports on their activities in support of the peace process to the Office of the President on or before 30 April and thereafter, as may be necessary. The role of the RDCs in the comprehensive peace process calls for pushing the reform process in their own regions and enduring genuine people participation in it.
