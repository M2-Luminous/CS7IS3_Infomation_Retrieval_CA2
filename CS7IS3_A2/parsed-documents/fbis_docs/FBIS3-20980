It could also be used in telecommunications. Multiplexing considerably simplifies the electric wiring of vehicles, but it requires the development of very specific technologies. In particular, the printed circuit--the substrate of electronic component interconnections--must possess three qualities: good dissipation of the heat produced by power components, small overall dimensions, and both at an affordable price. The SMI (insulated metallic substrate) developed jointly with Peugeot by BREE (a subsidiary of the Cire group) meets these criteria. A preseries designed for use on 1,000 XM vehicles is being manufactured; it will be used to test the new process on a quasi-industrial scale. The most original feature of SMI printed circuits is that they use a metallic base instead of the standard glass-epoxy material. Actually, the circuit is built on an aluminum foil no more than 3 mm thick, which is covered with an insulating layer on which the copper conducting plate is pressed. Additional conducting layers can be obtained by using silver or copper-based polymer pastes. When the circuit is equipped with its components and mounted in the car, therefore, the heat it produces can diffuse into the metallic substrate and from there into the car body. This is an efficient solution that does not require adding a heat sink on the circuit--the usual method to improve heat dissipation in power circuits. According to Pascal Poisson, the BREE manager, the savings achieved by not having to purchase and install these heat sinks should offset the additional cost of the metallic substrate, so that the cost of the product would be about the same as that of a traditional circuit. Industrializing the SMI process required the development of adequate production means. In particular, since aluminum foil is a malleable material it cannot be machined with the equipment traditionally used in making printed circuits. The metallic plates must therefore be drilled, cut, and scribed with special tools developed by BREE. The conveying and loading/unloading systems were also modified to accommodate the new substrate, which is heavier than traditional substrates. A total of 1 million francs was invested in preseries production facilities. The Peugeot group's certification of the insulated metallic substrate already created considerable interest from other potential clients (in telecommunications). They are waiting for the first results of the full-scale test performed on the 1,000 XM vehicles which, according to BREE, might warrant going on to mass production.
