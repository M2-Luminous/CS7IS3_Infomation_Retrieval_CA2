FR940617-2-00031 FR940617-2-00017 [Docket No. 940541&hyph;4141] RIN No. 0693&hyph;AB30 Proposed Revision of Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 153, Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics Systems (PHIGS) AGENCY: National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Commerce. ACTION: Notice; request for comments. SUMMARY: A revision of FIPS 153, PHIGS, is being proposed. This proposed revision will add features to the basic PHIGS functionality defined in FIPS 153, which adopts voluntary industry standards, ANSI/ISO 9592.1&hyph;3:1989, and ANSI/ISO 9593&hyph;1:1990, 9593&hyph;3:1990, 9593&hyph;4:1991. The basic PHIGS functionality provides for control and data interchange between an application program and its graphic support systems and for a set of functions and programming language bindings for the definition, display and modification of two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) graphic data. New features will be provided by the proposed adoption of voluntary industry specifications ANSI/ISO 9592.1a,2a,3a,4:1992 for PHIGS PLUS. PHIGS PLUS will augment the basic PHIGS functionality by providing facilities for specifying curved lines, curved and facetted surfaces, lighting and shading, and color. In addition, the proposed revision will add a requirement for the validation of PHIGS implementations using either FORTRAN or C bindings. Prior to the submission of this proposed revision to FIPS 153 to the Secretary of Commerce for review and approval, it is essential to assure that consideration is given to the needs and views of manufacturers, the public, and State and local governments. The purpose of this notice is to solicit such views. This proposed revision contains two sections: (1) An announcement section, which provides information concerning the applicability, implementation, and maintenance of the standard; and (2) a specifications section. Only the announcement section of the standard is provided in this notice. Interested parties may obtain copies of the specifications (ANSI/ISO 9592.1&hyph;3:1989, ANSI/ISO 9592.1a,2a,3a,4:1992, and ANSI/ISO 9593&hyph;1:1990, 9593&hyph;3:1990, 9593&hyph;4:1991) from American National Standards Institute (ANSI), 11 West 42nd Street, 13th floor, New York, NY 10036, (212) 642&hyph;4900. DATES: Comments on this proposed revision must be recived on or before September 15, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments concerning the adoption of this proposed revision should be sent to: Director, Computer Systems Laboratory, ATTN: Proposed Revision of FIPS 153, PHIGS, Technology Building, room B154, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899. Written comments received in response to this notice will be made part of the public record and will be made available for inspection and copying in the Central Reference and Records Inspection Facility, room 6020, Herbert C.
