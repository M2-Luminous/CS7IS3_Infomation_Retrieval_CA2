FR940617-2-00133 FR940617-2-00079 Comment: One commenter felt that it is unwise to rely heavily on the presence of bilingual female staff as the key factor in improving services to refugee women. The commenter felt that the relevance of service matters much more. Response: The issue is access to services, not just relevance of service. We believe that access to services and communication between client and provider improve significantly for refugee women when there are bilingual women on staff to provide services to these clients. III. Allocation Formula Of the funds available for FY 1994 for social services, $68,681,700 is allocated to States in accordance with the formula specified below. A State's allowable allocation is calculated as follows: 1. The total amount of funds determined by the Director to be available for this purpose; divided by_ 2. The total number of refugees and Cuban/Haitian entrants who arrived in the United States not more than 3 years prior to the beginning of the fiscal year for which the funds are appropriated and the number of Amerasians from Vietnam eligible for refugee social services, as shown by the ORR Refugee Data System. The resulting per capita amount will be multiplied by_ 3. The number of persons in item 2, above, in the State as of October 1, 1993, adjusted for estimated secondary migration. The calculation above yields the formula allocation for each State. Minimum allocations for small States are taken into account. Allocations for political prisoners are based on FY 1993 arrival numbers for this group in each State from the Refugee Data Center and are limited to States with 170 or more political prisoner arrivals. We have limited the population base to FY 1993 political prisoner arrival numbers because these funds are intended to serve recent arrivals. We have not included States with fewer than 170 former political prisoners in the political prisoner allocations formula because the resulting level of funding would be insignificant. In these States, we believe the small number of political prisoners could be adequately served under the State's refugee social services program. IV. Basis of Population Estimates The population estimates for the allocation of funds in FY 1994 are based on data on refugee arrivals from the ORR Refugee Data System, adjusted as of October 1, 1993, for estimated secondary migration. The data base includes refugees of all nationalities, Amerasians from Vietnam, and Cuban and Haitian entrants. For fiscal year 1994, ORR's formula allocations for the States for social services are based on the numbers of refugees and Amerasians who arrived, and on the numbers of entrants who arrived or were resettled, during the preceding three fiscal years: 1991, 1992, and 1993, based on final arrival data by State. Therefore, estimates have been developed of the numbers of refugees and entrants with arrival or resettlement dates between October 1, 1990, and September 30, 1993, who are thought to be living in each State as of October 1, 1993. Refugees admitted under the Federal Government's private-sector initiative are not included, since their assistance and services are to be provided by the private sponsoring organizations under an agreement with the Department of State. The estimates of secondary migration were based on data submitted by all participating States on Form ORR&hyph;11. The total migration reported by each State was summed, yielding in- and out-migration figures and a net migration figure for each State. The net migration figure was applied to the State's total arrival figure, resulting in a revised population estimate. Because the reporting period covered on Form ORR&hyph;11 was a maximum of only 8 months as of June 1993 for the majority of States whose reporting base was their cash/medical assistance caseload, extra weight was given to the secondary migration reported by those States to arrive at estimates of secondary migration over a 36-month period. In 1993, no count of recently-arrived refugee children was available from the Department of Education for use as a comparison. Estimates were developed separately for refugees and entrants and then combined into a total estimated 3-year refugee/entrant population for each State. Eligible Amerasians are included in the refugee figures. Table 1, below, shows the estimated 3-year populations, as of October 1, 1993, of refugees (col. 1), entrants (col. 2), and total refugees and entrants (col. 3); the formula amounts which the population estimates yield (col. 4); and the allocation amounts after allowing for the minimum amounts (col. 5). Table 1 also shows the number of former political prisoner arrivals in FY 1993 (col. 6); and the allocation amounts for services to this population (col. 7). V. Allocation Amounts Funding subsequent to the publication of this notice will be contingent upon the submittal and approval of a State annual services plan, as required by 45 CFR 400.11(b)(2). The following amounts are allocated for refugee social services in FY 1994:
