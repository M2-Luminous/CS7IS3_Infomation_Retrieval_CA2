This shows very distinctly what Mr. Mandela thinks of the National Party, and also what he thinks of the whole foreign financial world whose perception of the new South Africa has risen and dropped in accordance with reports the political future of Derek Keys. Every report that hinted that Keys was not going to be reappointed to the cabinet led to a drop in the price of stocks; each assurance that he would be part of the cabinet had the reverse effect. Mandela has reappointed Keys minister of finance, but at the same time shackled his hands and feet. Erwin will want about 90 million rands over five years for the ANC's Reconstruction and Development Program [RDP], an entirely unproductive so-called investment in people, but in actual fact a bonus for ANC supporters as reward for their political support. It is an African application of the American principle of spoils [preceding word in English] after every presidential election -- an America political tradition for a century and a half. "To the victor belong the spoils," [quoted passage in English] President Andrew Jackson said. He dismissed all civil servants and place his own supporters in their positions. Mandela has applied this even more literally; he regards the state treasury as his "spoils." Out of tax money, the ANC will help itself to 1.8 billion rands -- no real productive investment -- under the hundreds of little headings of the RDP program. The white man will just have to pay, and the "deprived" will stand and wait with open hands. Erwin will "propose" and Keys will sign on the dotted line. Keys will have to be content with the shackles, or else he will have to leave, whether Zurich and London like it or not.
