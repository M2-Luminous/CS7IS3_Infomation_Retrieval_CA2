[Pistorio] Today we have the answer to the question that was being asked seven years ago about the survival of the company: SGS-Thomson has managed to recover and has become a structurally-sound group. Debt has been reduced to less than $300 million from the $900 million of two years ago. Cash flow has been positive for two years now. On the technological front, today we have some undeniable advantages. At Crolles, near Grenoble, we have a plant the likes of which few groups in the world can pride themselves on. In 1993 we moved into the world's top three producers of EPROM [erasable programmable read-only memory], one of our specialist products. We are also a world leader in mixed and power technologies. You may not know, for example, that last year SGS-Thomson filed 327 patents -- one-third of the number filed by IBM and almost twice as many as were filed by the whole of the German microelectronics industry. That should be stressed. However, that does not mean we can now rest on our laurels. [Nexon] What ambitions do you have for SGS-Thomson? [Pistorio] The group must continue to grow faster than the market. If we want to hold five percent of the world semiconductor market at the end of the decade (currently we have 2.7 percent), then we need to increase SGS-Thomson's revenues by a factor of four. This is a major challenge, but one that we can meet. I am committed to making SGS-Thomson one of the 10 world leaders in this area within two years. On condition, of course, that we do not drop our guard. [Nexon] What if there is another downturn in the market, as people are predicting, in two years' time? [Pistorio] SGS-Thomson now has the means of remaining profitable. Even if the components market falls, we will remain positive. Our aim now is to increase our profitability over the average for the microelectronics industry. In 1994 our profits will, in principle, be better if the favorable trend continues. If, on the other hand, the market takes a downturn in the second half, the situation will be different. [Nexon] Do you intend competing with Intel in microprocessors and with the Japanese in dynamic memory (DRAM)? [Pistorio] We are currently involved in the microprocessor business, but it is true that we are not active on the mass microcomputing market. We are currently seriously considering this option. We will make our final decision in the next few months. We do not want to rush into things because we are talking about a long-term strategy. To enter this market we could broaden our alliance with the American manufacturer Cyrix. Where dynamic memory is concerned, the answer is clearly no. There are too many competitors, and there is even competition in Europe. It is a vast market but it is not a strategic one today. It is possible to obtain a high level of technological know-how without gaining expertise in this type of component. [Nexon] It is rumored that your public shareholders in Italy want to pull out... [Pistorio] There is nothing that makes me think our Italian partners want to pull out. On the contrary, they should find the company's results rather reassuring. [Nexon] So there are no new partners on the horizon, for example Texas Instruments or Motorola? [Pistorio] None. Any conjecture about transferring a share of our capital to the Americans is quite unfounded. [Nexon] Are you still assured of receiving the remaining $500 million for your recapitalization now you have returned to profit? [Pistorio] That is a decision for the shareholders, but I am confident. It is precisely because they felt the full potential of the company that they released an initial slice of $500 million. Indeed, the performance of SGS-Thomson justifies new investment. In any event, to maintain accelerated growth we will need external financing. [Nexon] People are also talking about a possible flotation on the Paris stock exchange... [Pistorio] Our expansion and our profitability mean that we are going to need capital. The group's situation is likely to encourage investors. Today the conditions have come together in such a way that we can start to think about a flotation. Personally, I am in favor. I have made my views known to my shareholders, but it is they who will decide. [Nexon] What about the $1 billion contribution promised by the French and Italian governments for R&D? [Pistorio] The public authorities are giving positive signs about their desire to maintain the R&D effort. The actual sum will depend on the different projects put forward. We have to remember that this aid will on average finance one-third of the cost of the R&D for the group's main technological projects approved by the pubic authorities. [Nexon] Can we expect to see a major European alliance for components, in particular with Siemens? [Pistorio] We are open to all cooperation agreements. Moreover, we are working with Siemens in the context of the European research program JESSI [Joint European Submicron Silicon Initiative]. However, we should remember that our respective strategic interests are different, especially since we decided not to venture into the area of flash memory. Siemens has just made a large investment in Dresden (former East Germany), but we are not interested in participating. For our part, we are involved in a major R&D cooperation project in Crolles with Philips and the CNET (France Telecom). Managing such a program with three partners that big already requires a lot of work. For the time being, our agreements with Siemens remain on a case-by-case basis. The defense of the European electronics industry does not necessarily come through partnership deals. [Nexon] How is your industrial restructuring program going? [Pistorio] It is complete. Five years ago we had 22 factories. Today we have just 15 sites. However, we have a great need for new capacity. If we had had it last year, our revenues would probably have been up by 50 percent instead of by 30 percent. As a result, we will be deciding on fresh investment in the next six months. This year we must are to start building a new assembly plant in Asia, probably in China. Demand is burgeoning on the Chinese market. We will therefore also need to build at least two more distribution plants (modules) in the next five years, including one in the United States. Nor must we forget our investments at Crolles. Some $250 million has been invested so far, and an additional $150 million is currently being assigned. By the end of next year, a total of $600 million will have been invested on this site. [Nexon] In which zones do you want to build up your presence? [Pistorio] In 1993 our sales outside of Europe topped 50 percent of revenues for the first time ever. However, that is still not enough. Our aim is to reach 65 percent by the end of the decade by strengthening our position in the United States and Asia, where demand is very high. We generate $650 million in revenues with American customers. We hope this year to top the $1 billion mark. Our presence in Asia will also be strengthened through the development of our activities in Japan. Staff numbers should quickly rise to around a hundred. [Nexon] Seven years after the merger, would you say that SGS-Thomson is now out of trouble? [Pistorio] Absolutely. The company now has considerable resources including on the human level. Last year we took on 850 people in France and Italy, and we are continuing to recruit this year. The group is now capable of reacting quickly and of adapting to changes in the market while preserving its culture and warmth. Pasquale Pistorio "I still have some fifty or so years ahead of me," jokes this 58-year old Sicilian. At the controls of the French-Italian manufacturer for seven years now, this rotund and friendly man who despairs of ever finding a winning diet, does not intend hanging up his boots just yet. "He is boiling over with ideas for his group," a government representative said of him. His latest hobby horse is ecology. "SGS-Thomson must be the first company to eliminate CFC's from its products from 1996," he insists. Over the years, Pasquale Pistorio has won the respect of his shareholders. In his view, the European electronics industry deserves to be fought for, all the more so since "the Japanese have definitively lost their market leadership to the Americans."
