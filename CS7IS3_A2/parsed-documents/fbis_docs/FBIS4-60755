['Abd-al-Majid] We have not failed; we made enormous efforts to defuse the conflict. [DER SPIEGEL] But this has not prevented the fratricidal war. ['Abd-al-Majid] The Arab League does not have the right to intervene in the internal conflicts of a member state. The Republic of Yemen officially still exists as a unified state. Nevertheless, the Arab League remains an important political instrument, and that includes in the conflict in Yemen as well. [DER SPIEGEL] What can you do? ['Abd-al-Majid] Both parties to the war in Yemen now want to negotiate. The Arab League has been called upon to mediate between Sana and Aden. [DER SPIEGEL] Are you thinking of sending peacekeeping forces under the green banner of the Arab League? ['Abd-al-Majid] If both sides consider this appropriate, why not? [DER SPIEGEL] In other conflicts in the region, the League has also been ineffective -- for instance, in Somalia. ['Abd-al-Majid] No state whatsoever existed there, which made the costly intervention of UN troops difficult. International organizations cannot replace a state. [DER SPIEGEL] The Arab League also stayed out of the rapprochement between the Israelis and the Palestinians. ['Abd-al-Majid] Not at all. By unanimously recognizing the respective UN resolutions, we have clearly accelerated the peace process. [DER SPIEGEL] Are all Arab League members really ready to recognize Israel's right to exist? ['Abd-al-Majid] All, without any exception -- under the precondition that all parties strive for a just peace on the basis of "land for peace."
