FR940803-0-00098 FR940803-0-00035 Rulemaking Analyses and Notices Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures NHTSA has considered the impact of this rulemaking action under E.O. 12866 and the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures. This rulemaking document was not reviewed under E.O. 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review.'' This action has been determined to be not ``significant'' under the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures. NHTSA estimates that the annual economic impact of this final rule will be between $44 and $61 million. A Final Regulatory Evaluation has been prepared for this final rule and is available in the docket for this notice. Regulatory Flexibility Act NHTSA has also considered the impacts of this final rule under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. By not including the rear seat of vehicles, the agency believes that the small businesses involved in altering vehicles, van conversions, and multi-stage manufacturing will have little difficulty meeting the standard. Most of the companies perform very few changes to the front of the vehicle. Van converters may change the seats, but they typically use the anchorage points provided by the original manufacturer of the front seat. Those manufacturers that start with incomplete vehicles will have to add and certify anchorages. However, either seats with seat-frame mounted anchorages or adjustable upper anchorages will be on the market and these manufacturers should not have difficulty certifying compliance. Paperwork Reduction Act In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (P.L. 96&hyph;511), there are no requirements for information collection associated with this final rule. National Environmental Policy Act NHTSA has also analyzed this final rule under the National Environmental Policy Act and determined that it will not have a significant impact on the human environment. Executive Order 12612 (Federalism) NHTSA has analyzed this rule in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in E.O. 12612, and has determined that this rule will not have significant federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Civil Justice Reform This final rule does not have any retroactive effect. Under 49 U.S.C. 30103, whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard is in effect, a State may not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance which is not identical to the Federal standard, except to the extent that the State requirement imposes a higher level of performance and applies only to vehicles procured for the State's use. 49 U.S.C. 30161 sets forth a procedure for judicial review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court. List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 571 Imports, Motor vehicle safety, Motor vehicles. In consideration of the foregoing, 49 CFR Part 571 is amended as follows: PART 571_FEDERAL MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY STANDARDS 1. The authority citation for Part 571 of Title 49 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. 322, 30111, 30115, 30117, and 30166, delegation of authority at 49 CFR 1.50. 2. Section 571.208 is amended by redesignating existing S7.1.2 and S7.1.3, as S7.1.3 and S7.1.4, and adding new S7.1.2, S7.1.2.1, and S7.1.2.2, to read as follows: §571.208 Standard No. 208, Occupant Crash Protection * * * * * S7.1.2␣Except as provided in S7.1.2.1 and S7.1.2.2, for each Type 2 seat belt assembly which is required by Standard No. 208 (49 CFR 571.208), the upper anchorage, or the lower anchorage nearest the intersection of the torso belt and the lap belt, shall include a movable component which has a minimum of two adjustment positions. The distance between the geometric center of the movable component at the two extreme adjustment positions shall be not less than five centimeters, measured linearly. If the component required by this paragraph must be manually moved between adjustment positions, information shall be provided in the owner's manual to explain how to adjust the seat belt and warn that misadjustment could reduce the effectiveness of the safety belt in a crash. S7.1.2.1␣As an alternative to meeting the requirement of S7.1.2, a Type 2 seat belt assembly shall provide a means of automatically moving the webbing in relation to either the upper anchorage, or the lower anchorage nearest the intersection of the torso belt and the lap belt. The distance between the midpoint of the webbing at the contact point of the webbing and the anchorage at the extreme adjustment positions shall be not less than five centimeters, measured linearly. S7.1.2.2␣The requirements of S7.1.2 do not apply the anchorages of a Type 2 seat belt assembly installed: (a) at a seat which is adjustable fore and aft while the vehicle is in motion and whose seat frame above the fore-and-aft adjuster is part of each of the assembly's seat belt anchorages, as defined in S3 of Standard No. 210 (49 CFR 571.210). (b) at a seat that is not adjustable fore and aft while the vehicle is in motion. * * * * * Issued on July 28, 1994. Christopher A. Hart, Deputy Administrator.
