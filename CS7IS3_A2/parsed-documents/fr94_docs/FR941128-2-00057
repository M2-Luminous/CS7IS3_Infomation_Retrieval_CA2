The volume of checks collected decreased 0.1 percent from 1992 levels and return item volume decreased 1.3 percent. 1994 Performance Through September 1994, the check service recovered 96.4 percent of total expenses, including targeted ROE but excluding automation consolidation special projects costs. The volume of checks collected decreased 12 percent from 1993 levels, reflecting a 4 percent decrease in processed volume and a 33 percent decrease in fine sort volume. The Reserve Banks now project an operating loss of $0.9 million, compared with the $14.8 million return on equity budgeted for 1994. Although the Board believes that the Reserve Banks' current estimate of 1994 performance is conservative, several significant factors are contributing to the variation. First, the check service's share of the pre-tax reduction in pension credits increased expenses by $16.8 million, compared with the original budget estimate. Without this unexpected increase in expenses, the Reserve Banks would have been able to achieve the budgeted return on equity for the check service. Second, the Reserve Banks' volume losses due to the implementation of the same-day settlement regulation on January 3 and the continuing consolidation of the banking industry have been greater than anticipated. In particular, the Reserve Banks now project that total check volume for 1994 will decline by about 11 percent (processed check volume by 4 percent and fine sort volume by 31 percent) and that return item volume will decline by 5 percent. Originally, the Reserve Banks projected that total volume would decline 10 percent (2 percent for processed check volume and 33 percent for fine sort volume) and that return item volume would decline 2 percent. Third, severe weather during early 1994 contributed to higher than budgeted float costs. 1995 Issues The changes occurring in the check environment that will continue to challenge the Reserve Banks include additional volume losses due to increasing direct presentments of checks by depository institutions, expansions of private check clearing arrangements, and further consolidation of the banking industry. Despite these changes, the Reserve Banks are committed to providing efficient, fairly priced check services to the nation's depository institutions. To accomplish this objective, Reserve Banks are continuing to (1) reduce staff, (2) contain other costs, (3) control increases in fees, (4) improve deposit deadlines, and (5) emphasize the use of electronic presentment and deposit products, which increase the efficiency of the check collection process and can reduce its total costs. In addition, the Reserve Banks are beginning to use image technology in their commercial check operations. Image technology has the potential to increase the acceptance of check truncation and, over the long run, reduce the cost of clearing paper checks. Total check service operating costs plus imputed expenses are projected to be about 5.1 percent below estimated 1994 expenses. The decline in total check collection volume is expected to moderate somewhat in 1995. Based on the Reserve Banks' projections, a decrease in total volume of 2.4 percent is anticipated, reflecting no change in processed volume, an 11.5 percent decrease in fine sort volume, and a 1.0 percent decrease in return item volume. 1995 Fees Overall, the 1995 check fees approved by the Board will increase 1.2 percent on a weighted average basis, compared with 1994. For 1995, the Reserve Banks are continuing to adjust fees to reflect more accurately the fixed and variable costs of providing check services. Thus, cash-letter fees and fine sort package fees will increase 5.7 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively. Forward processed item fees will decrease 0.4 percent, on average, while fine sort item fees will increase 2.0 percent, on average. Of the 2,180 forward collection and fine sort fees, almost 68 percent will remain unchanged, 19 percent will increase, and 7 percent will decrease. Additionally, 2.6 percent of all fees represent new products, while 3.7 percent of the fees have been discontinued, due to the elimination of the last remaining blended fees associated with tiered pricing and the elimination of some deadlines. Fees for return items are increasing 6.2 percent overall, reflecting increases in return cash-letter and package fees. Of the 1,494 return fees, 59 percent are unchanged, 36 percent increased, and 2 percent decreased. The fees for the Interdistrict Transportation System (ITS) are unchanged.
