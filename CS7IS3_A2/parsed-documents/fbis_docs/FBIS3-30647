According to data released by the Socialists, the BSP has over 400,000 members and over 20,000 activists in its more than 10,000 local organizations. The BSP Supreme Council passed a resolution prioritizing the personnel problem and describing it as a key one for the BSP efficient work and the implementation of its policy under the new conditions. This is an essential problem of the democratization of the party and its intraparty life, the resolution reads. It lists the immediate prospects for the BSP participation in the government and points out the necessity of building a consistent system for BSP organizational and personnel work under the new circumstances. 10 percent of the electorate will vote for the New Policy Centre (NPC), NPC leader Dimitur Ludzhev predicted at a news conference in Kurdzhali, southern Bulgaria, today. Once again he described the 1994 draft budget proposed by the cabinet as unrealistic. [passage omitted]
