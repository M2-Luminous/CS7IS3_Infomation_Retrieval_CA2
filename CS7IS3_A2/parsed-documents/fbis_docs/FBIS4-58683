That coincided with another treacherous attack launched by brigades of the Republican Guard and the Central Security against the Martyr Ba Suhayb Brigade, as well as an attack launched by units of the 2d Armored Brigade, stationed in (al-Kibsi) Camp, in Lahij Governorate against the command of the southern operational axis and the Bakil Air Base. In the early hours of this morning, the situation was finally settled by the Central Security units and the military police in Aden Governorate, and the situation was completely controlled after large numbers of those forces joined, despite the fact that (?executive) al-Ahmar family in Sanaa tried to use them to strike at the homeland, unity, and democracy. Forces also joined the ranks of our valiant armed forces, while others surrendered. Sporadic battles are still going on with some pockets of the 2d Armored Brigade after some troops surrendered and others joined the ranks of the units of the southern operational axis. In Dhamar, units of the Martyr Ba Suhayb Brigade managed, after waging fierce battles and rare heroisms and deluged by various combat acts, to resolutely confront and completely foil all the intensive attacks and campaigns carried out by the forces of apostasy, treason, and conspiracy. They retreated under the effect of the [word indistinct] precise strikes to rear positions. Some turned back, defeated. [passage indistinct] In al-Dali' axis, a battalion from the Martyr 'Abbud Brigade, supported by crowds of valiant citizens from the sons of the areas, managed to stop an attack from several directions in which various types of heavy weapons, armored vehicles and artillery were used in an attempt to penetrate inside the former border areas. Our valiant forces, through the steadfastness of the masses, managed to destroy 15 tanks and other losses are not yet known. The battles are still most intensive in this area which is at present under intensive artillery shelling of villages and populated quarters. In the Mukayris axis, units of the 20th brigade are still continuing their confrontation valiantly against the attacking forces that tried to direct their strikes with various heavy weapons at Mukayris town and the neighboring villages. Heavy losses and damage were inflicted on innocent citizens and their property. In another dangerous development of the military situation, the bloody gang of al-Ahmar family, with the aim of striking at important vital economic (?institutions) of the economic and commercial capital Aden, embarked on launching numerous air raids at Aden international airport and the power station, Aden port, the radio and tv corporation building, and the Aden refinery. However, our air defense, which is always vigilant, was lying in wait for them and shot down three hostile war planes. Those raids did not succeed in achieving their expected aims, with the exception of the travelers' lounge at Aden international airport where a number of civilians were killed and wounded as a result of this hit.
