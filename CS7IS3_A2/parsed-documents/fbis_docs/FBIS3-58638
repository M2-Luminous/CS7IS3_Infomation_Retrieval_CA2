Rudolf Scharping, chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], said in Bonn on 17 January that the determination with which the SPD has concentrated on the great economic and social issues is decisive for the party's "successful course." This includes an economic policy forum on the modernization of Germany's economic base, at which the SPD will discuss its government program with entrepreneurs later this month. Prior to the Federal Government's 17 January meeting on additional spending cuts of DM7.5 billion, Scharping doubted that the planned new borrowing could be limited to DM70 billion. Scharping said Federal Finance Minister Theo Waigel's (Christian Social Union -- CSU) budget "borders on a falsification of the balance sheet." There were differences of opinion on the budget policy within the Free Democratic Party [FDP]. According to party chairman Klaus Kinkel, the government will not survive 1994 without a supplementary budget. This was rejected by Federal Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (FDP) as "adventurous speculation." At the ministers' meeting, Kinkel rejected additional spending cuts in the defense and educational sectors. He said the Bundeswehr was not the nation's reserve cash box. Following talks with scientific organizations, Kinkel stressed the importance of biotechnology for Germany as an investment center. The Christian Democratic Union presented its economic program on 17 January. It is supposed to show ways out of the economic crisis over the medium term and was approved by the party's leading bodies at a closed meeting in Windhagen near Bonn last weekend [15-16 January].
