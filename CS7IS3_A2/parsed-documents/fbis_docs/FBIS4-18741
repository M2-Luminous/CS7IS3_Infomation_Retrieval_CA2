Thus, the green light has been given for the evacuation of our fellow countrymen from Rwanda. At 1645 hours a first C-130 plane landed in Kigali. An hour later four more planes followed. Just now a news conference was held in Evere with Defense Minister Delcroix. Together with Chief of Staff Charlier, he explained the progress of the evacuation. Delcroix also paid homage to the 10 Belgian blue helmets who were killed by Rwandan soldiers. Here is a report by Bruno Huyghebaert: [Huyghebaert] Operation Silverback is the codename under which the Defense Ministry and Army have conceived the evacuation operation from Rwanda. Initially the intention was to land in Kigali early this morning between 0300 and 0600 hours, Minister Delcroix said. But Rwandan troops had blocked the airport. Then, in cooperation with the French and the United Nations, we had to negotiate until this afternoon in order to be able to begin the evacuation. The intervention unit of the paracommandoes was meanwhile in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. Chief of Staff Charlier said that 250 paracommandos landed in Kigali this evening with the necessary support equipment. They will take refugees to Kigali airport where, if necessary, they will be provided with medical assistance and be evacuated on to Belgium via Nairobi. The entire operation is proceeding with French, U.S., Dutch, and Italian assistance. The names of the refugees will be circulated by the foreign affairs ministry via the media. The first refugees will be arriving at 0230 hours at Melsbroek military airport from Bujumbura in Burundi where they had gone under their own steam. Minister Delcroix also paid homage to the 10 Belgian blue helmets who were murdered in a cowardly fashion in Kigali. Meanwhile, their bodies have been flown from Kigali to Nairobi by a C-130.
