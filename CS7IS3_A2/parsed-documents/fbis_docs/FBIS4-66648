The talk climaxed by setting the days and hours for the entrance. Is it true that the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and Jericho and the entrance of Palestinian police to take up their duties there has become imminent? Will their appearance among their people be appreciated and respected? Or are there major obstacles hindering this entrance--obstacles that might mar their coming--not to mention other hidden obstacles that could surface in a moment? As a preliminary to answering these questions, we must pause to consider the implications of the agreement concerning Hebron; for that agreement reflects the Israeli leadership's way of thinking and their modus operandi in handling the specious and artificial basic problems and obstacles that have appeared or will appear during the negotiations and during implementation of the agreements. I think there is no doubt in the Palestinian ranks that the agreement concerning treatment of the Hebron massacre was inadequate and that Palestinians are right to criticize it and consider it a negative sign of the policy and way in which Rabin has handled and will handle subsequent problems. At Rabin's insistence, the agreement lacked any mention or practical step against the settlers and their weapons and against their behavior. The Hebron massacre gave Rabin opportunities to make up for the time he has wasted since 13 December to the present; yet he reaffirmed his insistence on continuing the policy of advancing slowly on the path of negotiations--a policy he has followed thus far since assuming office, especially after the signing of the Oslo Agreement on 13 September 1993. The massacre gave him an opportunity make the racists, extremists, and all Israeli enemies of peace understand that they would not be allowed to toy with such major Israeli issues as the issue of peace; but he hesitated. Instead of removing the settlers from the city of Hebron and ending the friction there, he imposed on the people of Hebron measures that increased the friction, raised the degree of tension, and could lead to the evacuation of several thousand residents of central Hebron. I think that anyone who wishes can register even more criticism of the Hebron agreement and those responsible for it. Yet this will not undo the fact that the agreement has been signed and become a fait accompli that, in coming days, will be translated into practical steps on the ground in Hebron. Norwegian, Italian, and Danish forces will arrive there shortly. I think their arrival is an important gain that must be seen and dealt with positively and that one must work to develop. The value of this foreign presence lies not in the military and security capability of these forces to confront the settlers' provocations and crimes--for these matters are beyond their capacity and outside the scope of their activity and responsibilities. Rather, it lies in the implications and dimensions of their presence itself. Their presence with Rabin's agreement means that he acknowledges that the West Bank and Gaza are occupied territory; for no one would accept the entry and stationing of foreign forces on his own territory. It also means that sovereignty over this territory does not belong to Israel; for a foreign presence involves a violation and challenge to the sovereignty that Israel claims over part or all of this territory. I think that the value of this presence will increase even more and become more and more prominent as greater numbers and more nationalities of foreign forces arrive in Gaza and Jericho under the provisions of the Declaration of Principles (DOP), which alludes to such a presence. Regardless of the difference of opinions over the Hebron agreement, it has confirmed objectively that the positive momentum that the peace process has possessed to date remains greater and more powerful than the obstructive force that has grown in recent months. However, objectivity forces one to acknowledge that no one can be absolutely certain that the positive momentum can compel Israeli forces to hasten their withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho or cause the American cars and vehicles that have arrived for the Palestinian police to set out quickly in a few days' time on the Rafah-Gaza road and the South al-Shuna-Jericho road. Preventing the peace process from being torpedoed is one thing; accelerating the conclusion of final agreements is something else, with other considerations and calculations, especially on the part of the American sponsor. Although donor nations have moved energetically and have thankfully begun shipping the civilian and military aid needed to equip the Palestinian police, and although the Israeli side has begun to evacuate certain sites in Rafah, Gaza, and Jericho and has proposed that the Palestinian side send a delegation of senior officers for reconnaissance to prepare for the sending of the vanguard of the Palestinian police forces, it is also true that these steps remain formal and must not be allowed to cover over the large issues of dispute still being discussed and debated between the two sides. The Palestinian side has estimated the size of the police force needed to cover the duties assigned to it at 10,000 men. For reasons relating to skill, experience, and urgency of the operation, it has insisted that 8,000 policemen should come from abroad and that 2,000 West Bankers and Gazans should be recruited later. Although the Israeli side acknowledges that major and varied missions await the Palestinian police, it is still haggling. In its most recent offer, it agreed to 9,000, with the number from overseas limited to 6,500. I do not think it will be difficult to reach a common denominator on this point. Along with disagreement over numbers, there is substantial disagreement over the schedule for the withdrawal of Israeli forces and therefore for the entry of the main body of Palestinian police. The Palestinian side proposed to the Israeli side that negotiations on withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho be accelerated: one should work toward reaching an agreement on all the security questions without prejudicing the other issues on the table. However, the Israeli delegation rejected this and insisted on reaching an integrated "Gaza-Jericho First" agreement. It continues to regard the signing date of this integrated agreement as the starting point and date for the beginning of the Israeli withdrawal and the beginning of the entry of the main body of Palestinian police and their assumption of duties. According to the agenda that the two sides approved as a basis for the current negotiations, this means that the following problems would have to be discussed and resolved: 1. Economic issues: in this area Palestinian and Israeli negotiators still must complete an agreement on labor and employment, farming and industry, tourism, banking problems, and the operation of accident insurance companies. 2. Legal questions: the Israeli side proposes discussing issues of jurisdiction, criminal jurisdiction, and cooperation in legal matters. 3. Civilian authorities: the two sides still have not resolved questions concerning water control and management, archaeology, and regional planning. 4. In security matters, besides the withdrawal plan and the police deployment plan, the negotiations still must reach agreement on the security laws dealing with individual incidents, the question of a temporary international presence in Gaza and Jericho, and the secure corridor back and forth from Gaza to Jericho. If one ponders all these still unresolved issues, the main inference one can draw is that discussing and debating all these unresolved questions will require several weeks, if--and this must be emphasized--Israeli intentions are sincere. As the saying goes, the man who has been bitten by a snake fears the trail of a rope. The Palestinian side has been stung by Rabin three times: first when he put off negotiating for a year before entering the Oslo channel; second when he missed the 13 December date set in the Declaration of Principles for beginning withdrawal; and third when he protected the racists and extremists in Hebron and allowed them to stay there. If the visible unresolved questions confirm that the Israeli side is going to miss the 13 April date for full withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho according to the provisions of the Oslo agreement, we shall be faced with ample time that Rabin and the Israeli negotiating delegation will try to fill with formal moves such as the entry of a group of leaders for reconnaissance, the entry of 300 policemen into Gaza, Rafah, and Jericho, or beginning to design and build joint liaison offices. I think this stretch of time will witness a race between those international, regional, and local forces eager for progress and success in the peace process and those local and regional forces that oppose the process. Each of the two tendencies will throw its full weight: the former to pass through the period in peace and safety. I think we shall notice the practical translation in the movement of American planes toward Cairo and al-'Arish airports, carrying military vehicles and armored cars for the Palestinian police, and in the movement of planes from donor nations, carrying the remaining kinds and quantities of military and civilian equipment. It will also be seen when Norwegian, Danish, and Italian forces land at al-'Arish and Cairo on their way to Hebron. The other tendency, particularly the racist, extremist forces that are friends and allies of Rubinstein, naturally will concentrate its efforts on committing a new massacre somewhere. Why not, when the massacre at Abraham's Tomb derailed negotiations on the Oslo agreement for six weeks, and when the punishment it received was very light and was not without an implied compensation! From now on, until the signing of the final agreement on implementing the Oslo agreement, talk about the entrance of the police will continue and may increase, but it will remain nothing but talk until the beginning or middle of May. I believe that great and varied tasks await the Palestinian side from now until such an agreement is reached. These tasks include developing the management of the negotiations and improving the negotiating method itself. It is no accident that the Palestinian negotiating delegation lacks specialists and experts. It is also damaging nationally for experienced and skilled residents from inside [Palestine] to remain absent from the negotiating table. Another task is to plan and prepare the forces needed to undertake the great and varied work that will have to be accomplished on the ground in the West Bank and Gaza. Anyone who thinks that the success of the Palestinian police in their patriotic missions depends on good training, large numbers, or powerful equipment is wrong. The basis of their success lies in good behavior with the people. Above all, it lies in effecting a qualitative change in people's lives. Such a desired change can be made only by mobilizing all resources and energies and by relying on the collective organizing role of institutions.
