So far this year manufacturers of farm machinery have lost more than 106 million yuan ($12.2 million) because of slow sales. Officials with the ministry's information and statistics bureau said that during the first five months of this year the industry's output was valued at more than 17.3 billion yuan ($2 billion) or 34.5 percent of the year's target of 50 billion yuan ($5.75 billion). However, they added, the production growth was 13.1 percent less than the same period last year. At the same time, sales have fallen 24.6 per cent from a year earlier. The ministry's analysts say the industry's products simply are not competitive. Because the prices of farm machines have risen under the government's new tax system, farmers prefer to fix up their old machines or even do farmwork by hand. Sales of the industry's mainstay products -- such as large and medium-sized tractors, engines, combine harvesters and water pumps -- have all dropped from last year. The worst hit are combine harvesters, whose sales have fallen by half. Government officials have started to show signs of worry that the slow sales may hinder agricultural production this year. Although some machines are already too expensive for farmers, some manufacturers want to raise prices even further. They argue that higher prices are justified by higher costs, chiefly more expensive production materials and greater tax burdens. The high price of diesel oil is another reason farmers are not buying machinery. A ton of oil now costs more than 1,453 yuan ($167), up 365 yuan ($42) from last year. In Jilin Province, one of the country's major grain producers, so many farmers are doing their work manually that the amount of farmland ploughed by machine has shrunk to 1.2 million hectares, 27.7 per cent less than in 1991. There is an exception to the dismal market, however. The Ministry of Machinery Industry says that factories in Shanxi Province are selling 45.2 percent more farm machinery than last year. The reason is simple: They are concentrating their production on the simple and inexpensive two-wheel tractors, which are very popular among Shanxi's farmers.
