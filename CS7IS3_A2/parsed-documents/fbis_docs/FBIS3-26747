As a major waterway in South China, Pearl River consists mainly of four water systems: the Western River, Northern River, Eastern River and Delta Zhuhe River with annual flowing volume ranking second in the country, after the Chang Jiang River, the country's longest. The river constitutes an important hydro-power production base in the country. The plan is aimed at enhancing the river's anti-flood capacity, including construction of embankments and reservoirs to ensure the safety of major cities such as Guangzhou and Nanning in the flood period.
