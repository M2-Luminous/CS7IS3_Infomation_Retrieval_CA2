Why Are We Increasingly Hearing About Delaying Presidential and Parliamentary Elections?"] [Text] Efforts are afoot to gradually condition us to the fact that the next presidential and parliamentary elections will not take place at the time established by the Constitution. Rumors, inspired "leaks" followed by direct statements on this count, and many other things point to a decreasing possibility of the voters electing a new Duma at the end of 1995 and voting for a new, or old, president in June 1996. Hints are coming from circles close to the head of state's entourage about the possibility of prolonging the Federal Assembly's brief, two-year, existence for another couple of years in exchange for an analogous extension of the incumbent president's powers. In the Duma such a deal, relieving the deputies of the headache caused by the need to face fresh elections, finds increasing understanding. An appeal recently circulated by the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] faction contains the following number one point: "Given the absence of normal conditions for lawmaking activity by the Duma and the deputies in working with their constituents, the term of its present composition should be extended by two years." Thank God, so far the LDPR does not set the procedures for forming state power bodies, but it is clear that a drive toward destroying the corresponding constitutional provisions has begun. Even now it is clear which arguments are being made and will yet be made in support of this idea. Many words will be spoken about the vital need for stability and continuity of power, which were secured at such pains in the Social Accord Pact. About the impermissibility of jeopardizing democratic transformations embodied by President Boris Yeltsin. About the need for more time for the main power branches to adapt and begin real work to adopt the legislative enactments that are so important to Russia. And finally, historical arguments will be cited to confirm that the prolonged existence of state leadership in unchanged form fully corresponds to the domestic political tradition. I cannot say that the above-mentioned arguments have no political or logical rationale. Nonetheless I am sure: To follow this path is not in the country's interests. And not because the intention is primarily to keep in power those who already have it. Continuity and efficiency of state institutions and the need for their adaptation should have been considered earlier, when the current Constitution was being written and adopted. Now, for all its imperfections, it -- and not individual personalities -- is the guarantor of social and political stability. What undermines the state's buttresses and hinders consolidation of the democratic tradition is violations of the Constitution, increasingly committed by top officials. I shall venture to state my confidence that Russia will emerge as a democratic and civilized state only when a constitutional change of supreme ruling authority takes place in the country for the first time in its more than millennium-old history. I stress: constitutional, not merely apparently legitimate, as has been the case in the previous decades and centuries. Before 1917, there was no constitution to speak of, and therefore there could be no question of the handover of power. Continuity was ensured through heredity, and this was called monarchy. After the Revolution there were many fundamental laws but none of them stipulated a mechanism for such a handover, while the supreme ruling authority itself was for the most part unconstitutional. The removal of Mikhail Gorbachev from the helm also, as is known, had nothing to do with the Constitution -- the Union or the Russian one -- and brought about the destruction of the USSR. The democratically elected legislative bodies have also been unlucky. Out of four pre-Revolutionary Dumas, three were disbanded. Neither the Congress of People's Deputies and the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, nor the Congress and Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation of the previous convocation died a natural, that is to say constitutional, death. And the birth of the present Federal Assembly was never based on the Law. One conclusion follows from all this: Presidential and Federal Assembly elections should take place when they are supposed to. Only in this event shall we be citizens of a democratic country, not an eastern despotic regime with some democratic embellishments. If there are no elections, it will be a short way to hereditary presidency and deputyship. Some may dislike this. But not myself or my colleagues in the Duma PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] faction.
