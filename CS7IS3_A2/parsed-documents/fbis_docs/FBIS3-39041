A statement issued by the White House notes that the decision was made in recognition of the democratic expression by FYROM of the duty to establish a sovereign and independent state based on democratic principles. The full recognition was announced today but full diplomatic relations will be established when Skopje gives assurances that it will cooperate constructively for the settlement of its dispute with Greece, a U.S. ally for many years, as the statement points out. [passage omitted] Skopje President Kiro Gligorov, who constantly refers to his country as the Republic of Macedonia, said that its independence and stability are a prerequisite for peace and stability in the Balkans. He also noted that good-neighborliness is a vital interest of his country and that Skopje is prepared to begin immediately to negotiate with Greece within the UN framework in goodwill and a desire for mutual understanding and respect for mutual interests. He also said that his country respects the territorial integrity and borders of Greece and of all the neighboring countries. In Athens, Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou tonight received U.S. Ambassador to Greece Thomas Niles, who conveyed to him an official invitation from President Bill Clinton to visit the United States in April. On the U.S. recognition of Skopje, government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos made the following statement: The Greek Government expresses its discontent at the U.S. decision to recognize Skopje. This development is certainly not pleasant for Greece. It is a wrong move by the United States. However, it is a significant fact that the United States is specifically reserved about diplomatic relations with Skopje and links it with conditions that refer to Skopje's hostile propaganda against Greece and to a respect for human rights. [passage omitted] There has also been strong reaction by the opposition. New Democracy chairman Miltiadhis Evert described the U.S. decision as a bad option and added that the Greek Government was taken by surprise and was confused.
