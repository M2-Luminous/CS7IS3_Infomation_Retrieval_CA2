FR940719-1-00020 FR940719-1-00007 Establishment of this regulated navigation area will not endanger commercial traffic. No navigable channel in the vicinity of this regulated navigation area will be affected. Vessel traffic will find it necessary to transit around this regulated navigation area when going to and from Liberty State Park, New Jersey, in a southerly direction. The vessel traffic that transits this area consists primarily of commercial dinner cruise boats in the early evening hours and a number of small fishing crafts throughout the day. However, there are ample waters which will allow vessel traffic to safely transit around this regulated navigation area. Although the effective period of this regulation is scheduled to terminate concurrently with the Agreement on December 31, 1994, it may be amended to remain in effect during subsequent Agreement renewals. Regulatory Evaluation These regulations are not significant under Executive Order 12866 and not significant under Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040, February 26, 1979). Due to the fact that the proposed regulated navigation area is not known to be heavily used by commercial or recreational traffic and that there are sufficient waters to allow vessel traffic to safely maneuver around this area, the Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this regulation to be so minimal that a Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary. Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under Section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). For reasons given in the Regulatory Evaluation, the Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation to be minimal. The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This proposal contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501). Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this action in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this proposal does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environment The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of these regulations and concluded that under section 2.B.2.c. of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it is an action under the Coast Guard's statutory authority to promote maritime safety and protect the environment, and thus is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion Determination will be included in the docket.
