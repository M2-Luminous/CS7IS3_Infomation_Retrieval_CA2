The team also punished the chief of the Navy's Signal Corps and nine other officers for neglecting to supervise eight programs related to the Yulgok project. The chief of the inspection team, Lt. Gen. Chang Pyong-yong, announced the results of the two-month probe into the Yulgok project at the Defense Ministry building. Navy Cmdr. O Yun-hwan was arrested last week after it was disclosed that he had informed a trader of the expected bidding price for shooting control equipment on military ships, in order to negotiate a contract for a higher price than the expected bidding price, at the end of 1991. Trader Chon Won-hong received more than 1,154,000 U.S. dollars, indeed higher than the expected bidding price, from the Defense Ministry for importing and providing the shooting control equipment, thus making an undue profit of more than 190,000 dollars. Cmdr. O received roughly 80 million won (about 100,000 dollars) from Chon, who was also arrested early this month. Cho Ki-hyon, head of Chong U Construction Co., Ltd., was arrested for bribing two officers to win the order and for using a particular construction method at military schools on the outskirts of Kwangju and Kimhae. Army Col. Chong Sok-yong and Air Force Lt. Yim Myong-yong received 20 million won and 47 million won, respectively, from Cho. Both were arrested in January. The inspection team also said that Daewoo Corp. drew up a behind- the-scenes contract with Lockheed Aircraft Ltd. of the United States for mediating the Navy's purchase of sea patrol planes (P-3C), besides the official contract. Daewoo received an official commission of 3 billion won from Lockheed and asked for an extra 18.4 billion won under the secret contract, only to be rejected by Lockheed. The inspection team reviewed the Air Force's F-4E Phantom fighter improvement project and decided to cancel it due to excessive expenditure and U.S. restrictions on transferring advanced technology to South Korea. On the Korea Navy Tactical Data System (KNTDS) program, the inspection team said the Navy did not judge U.S. development of the system precisely and paid the American company, Litton Ltd., 2.7 billion won unnecessarily for the system. Chang said after the announcement that his team had carried out a strict investigation of former defense ministers including Kwon Yong-hae and Choe Sae-chang, but had found nothing untoward. Meanwhile, Chang added that the inspection team will ask the Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry to cancel the registrations of the 11 businesses which are involved in the Yulgok irregularities including Koverseas Ltd. The Yulgok special inspection team, comprised of the Armed Forces special inspection group, the Defense Security Command, joint investigation team and the ministry's law officers, finished a mission yesterday that began last Dec. 28.
