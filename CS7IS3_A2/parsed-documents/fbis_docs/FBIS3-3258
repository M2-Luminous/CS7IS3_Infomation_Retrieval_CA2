However, after weathering storms over the past year or so, many peasants have experienced various dilemmas caused by not knowing what course to take. One of them is: Who will manage agriculture after the peasants head for the market? Since the beginning of last year, the whole society has been publicizing leading agriculture to the market and letting the peasants grow whatever brings them money. However, being accustomed to doing production work according to plans worked out by the higher-level authorities over the years, the peasants have found it difficult to adapt themselves to the new situation overnight. It sounds good to grow whatever brings them money, but they do not know what to do when they actually try. Growing grain alone will not bring them much money, but if everyone rushes headlong into growing cash crops, they certainly will not make any money either. It makes one's heart ache to think of the fall in the price of apples in Gansu, hot peppers in Shaanxi, and water melons, garlic, and so on in the provinces of the central plain. Red beans, white beans, black beans, and broad beans sold well last year, but who can be sure that they will also sell well this year? It is also difficult for just one or two households to grow special cash crops. Where can they buy the seeds or learn the relevant techniques? Where should they sell their products? At present, most peasants can only grow enough grain to ensure they have enough to eat and resign the rest to fate. The market economy is an economy characterized by economic results. It really is a tough job for peasants, who are simple and unsophisticated, universally badly educated, and not economically minded, to grope for information, carry out market analysis on their own, and forecast what crops they should grow to make money. Another dilemma is: How can one wade across a river without finding stepping stones? Since the peasants cannot clarify the market situation, they are compelled to act blindly. However, as we all know, agriculture is quite different from other sectors. The most distinct characteristic of agriculture is that its production cycle is long and its risk index is high. The risks are mainly expressed in five aspects. The first is the risk of natural disasters. At present, peasants in the overwhelming majority of localities depend as much on human efforts as on the climate. The second is the risk of pests. Many insects' resistance to pesticides has increased, and if dosages are not increased or if any mistakes are made in using the pesticides, it is possible that nothing will be reaped. The third is market risk. The market is like a battlefield in which commodity prices are ever-changing. Moreover, cycles of production of agricultural and sideline products are long. At sowing time, prices may be good, but the prices may change by harvest time. The fourth is the risk caused by inferior and fake means of production in agriculture. At present, fake chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and seeds have done serious harm to the peasants, and the peasants can do nothing about them. The fifth is that inputs to agriculture have decreased markedly. Peasants' hidden burdens remain at a high level. All this has inevitably caused a sense of misery and hopelessness of "finding no stepping stones to cross the river" among more and more peasants who have just become involved in the market economy. The third dilemma is: High output does not necessarily lead to high income. In recent years, peasants' incomes have increased slowly mainly because the relative interests of agriculture are indeed too low. High output may not necessarily lead to higher income, and higher output can even result in greater losses. Although in recent years, prices of agricultural and sideline products have risen a little, the extent of price rises for the agricultural means of production far exceed those for agricultural and sideline products. According to statistics, since the beginning of last year, price rises for various agricultural and sideline products have been less than 12 percent, but for pesticides, plastic sheeting, chemical fertilizers, farm machinery, and so on, the rises are over 20 percent, and for diesel oil, kerosene, gasoline, and so on, over 80 percent. The prices of some agricultural means of production have even soared or doubled, and this is really dreadful. However, peasants cannot do without them. Relatively speaking, prices of agricultural and sideline products have apparently been on the low side and the scissors difference between the prices of industrial and agricultural products is increasing day by day. Since peasants' real incomes are not increasing, their enthusiasm about farming cannot be aroused. This has compelled able-bodied laborers to earn money in other localities and farmland being laid waste is unavoidable. No wonder peasants have cried out: Where is the way out for peasants? Where is the way out for agriculture? The answer is naturally to further deepen reform. How should grain production be protected as agriculture moves toward the market, especially after restrictions on grain prices have been removed? Is it to develop "high output, high efficiency, and high quality" agriculture and earnestly increase peasants' incomes? Although this has already attracted great attention from the CPC Central Committee and governments at all levels, it is even more necessary at this time for the whole society to show common concern, give support, and carry out studies and explorations.
