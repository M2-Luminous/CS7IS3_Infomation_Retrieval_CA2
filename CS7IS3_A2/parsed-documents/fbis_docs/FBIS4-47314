I. Lyakhov, Institute of Control Problems; UDC 689.324:519.248] [Abstract] This article examines and analyzes a closed exponential network of queues of large dimension with several classes of calls. This network, which includes finite sources of calls of every class and a set of one-channel devices, is a generalized model of inhomogeneous multiprocessor systems with a completely connected interface, as well as a generalized model of multiterminal systems with external memory. The Laplace method is used to prove a system of assertions which define and validate asymptotic approximations for basic stationary characteristics of the model for a rather broad set of cases of load distributions among the servicing devices in the network. This is in contrast to previous papers where asymptotic approximations with a predetermined accuracy were obtained only for cases of a single class of calls or a small load on all (finite) one-channel devices. The simple form of the approximations makes it possible to guarantee accuracy and quickly obtain a solution to the problem of evaluating the performance of multiprocessor and multi-terminal systems.
