The prerequisite: a way must be found to produce homogeneous films covering a large area more quickly and cheaply. The first diamond synthesis using ordinary graphite was accomplished by brute force. In the 1950s, researchers from the giant American company General Electric used temperatures of 2,000ï¿½ C and 50,000 atmospheres of pressure to produce artificial diamonds. This process predominated for a long time. In 1990, 350 billion carats or 70 tons of diamonds, valued at a billion dollars, were produced using this method. But there are more elegant ways to do it. As early as the end of the 70's, a team around Prof. Dimitri Fedosseyev at Moscow University had done pioneering work on low-pressure diamond synthesis. "The technological arrogance of the West prevented us from taking the Russian work seriously," admits Ralph-Juergen Peters, coordinator of the BMFT program for diamond synthesis. Only the Japanese paid any attention to the pioneering feat. They rapidly modified the process and protected it with a wall of 500 patents. In CVD (chemical vapor deposition) technology, carbonaceous gas is exposed to high temperatures at low pressures in the presence of hydrogen and deposited as a thick layer of polycrystalline diamond on suitable substrates. For a few years nothing happened to disturb this process. It was not until the 1980's that the international professional world recognized the true potential of this technology and its possible applications. Intensive efforts at further development began. Numerous suppliers in Japan and the U.S. are working on the development of processes and marketable products. Companies and governments all over the world have invested several hundreds of millions of dollars. One catalyst is the hope of being able to replace silicon as material substrate with diamond film, at least in part. But at the moment the bulk of the products manufactured with the CVD process are offered in the classical diamond areas: machine cutting and optics. The diamond conglomerate De Beers has been on the bandwagon since the mid-80's. After fundamental experiments in Johannesburg, "several million pounds sterling" were invested in England, according to Dr. James Campbell, chief of the industrial diamond department. The pilot CVD plant on the Isle of Man was transformed into a production plant. But "because of the stiff competitive situation," Campbell is unwilling to reveal any details about the costs, capacity or processes of the reactors, which have been in use since last June. In the Fraunhofen Institute for Film and Surface Technologies, IST, Dr. Matthias Fryda and Dr. Claus-Peter Klages succeeded in developing a process, which has already been patented. In this process the hydrogenating gasification of coal makes it possible to produce diamond films both economically and ecologically. Traditional plants have up to 100 liters of processing gas flowing through them per minute. The gas generally consists primarily of hydrogen, with a small percentage of hydrocarbons, of which again only a part contributes to diamond growth. The residual hydrocarbons and all the hydrogen are blown into the open air. In the process developed in Hamburg "in contrast, the waste gas is reprocessed in a closed circuit with the help of hot activated charcoal," according to Dr. Lothar Schaefer of the IST. "No gas is used up or released into the environment during film production." The process (in outline) provides for the breakup of the hydrocarbons which hinder diamond deposit, and it supplies the necessary methane concentrations for film production. A special property of the process is that under given pressure and temperature conditions a definite hydrogen-carbon gas mix is always produced in the carbon reactor, even when other oxygenated or inert gases are added which encourage diamond separation. The process is still rather exotic: the German scientists achieved their best results to date with a coal produced from coconut shells. It makes gas streams of up to 25 liters per minute and kilogram possible. Japanese researchers initially chose their national drink, sake, as the starting point for their diamonds.
