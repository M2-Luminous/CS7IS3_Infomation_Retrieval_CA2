The sintered feed and grown crystals consist of Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]2[/]Ca[.sub]1[/]Cu[.sub]2[/] O[.sub]8+�[/] phase, but the first-scanned feed includes Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]2[/]Cu[.sub]1[/]O[.sub]6+�[/] and Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]3-x[/] Ca[.sub]x[/]O[.sub]y[/] (x-1) phases as minor phases. The grown single crystal samples exhibit higher superconducting transition temperature and the narrower transition width compared with the sintered and first-scanned feed samples. The high resolution electron microscope images and electron diffraction patterns indicate that the single crystal samples have an incommensurate superstructure along the b-axis with a period of about 5a. The superconducting transition temperatures (zero resistivity values) along the a-, b- and c-axis for the single crystal samples have nearly the same value of 83 K. _r_[.sub]b[/]/_r_[.sub]a[/] and _r_[.sub]c[/]/_r_[.sub]a[/] at room temperature are 1.67 and 250 respectively. 1. Introduction Materials[.sup]1[/] are divided into congruently and incongruently melting categories according to their melting behavior. Congruently melting material, corresponds to A or C phase in Figure 1, can coexist in equilibrium with the liquid phase of the same composition above melting point. While incongruently melting material, corresponding to B phase in Figure 1, decomposes into the solid and liquid phase of different compositions upon heating. Figure 1. Congruently and incongruently melting compound. Compound B starts to decompose into the solid and liquid phase upon heating at temperature T[.sub]o[/] through peritectic reaction, then the solid and liquid phase have compositions A and X[.sub]1[/] respectively at temperature T[.sub]1[/]. If compound B is slowly cooled from high temperature, solid phase of A starts to precipitate at T[.sub]E[/] and the composition of liquid changes from E to F with decreasing temperature. If temperature is further decreased below T[.sub]o[/], solid phase of B precipitates while the composition of liquid phase changes from F to G. Therefore, composition A precipitates from the liquid phase between D and F, but composition B precipitates between F and G. Namely, congruently melting material can be grown from the liquid phase of same composition, but incongruently melting material should be grown from the liquid phase of different composition. In the case of incongruently melting material, an undesirable solid phase may be precipitated later because the composition of liquid phase changes continuously with precipitating solid phase. Therefore, we keep the composition of liquid phase unchanged by supplying additional B compound as much as precipitated, when we grow single crystal of composition B from the liquid phase between F and G. Most of the high-temperature oxide superconductors are known to be incongruently melting materials. High-temperature superconductors have been grown by various methods such as slow cooling,[.sup]2[/] directional solidification,[.sup]3[/] top seeded solution growth (TSSG)[.sup]4[/] and travelling solvent floating zone (TSFZ) method.[.sup]5-7[/] High quality single crystals have been obtained by the TSFZ method because this method has the merit of no contamination from the crucible compared with the other methods. Takegawa et al.[.sup]5[/] first succeeded in growing Bi[.sub]2.2[/]Sr[.sub]1.8[/]Ca[.sub]1[/]Cu[.sub]2[/] O[.sub]8+�[/] single crystal from the liquid phase of Bi[.sub]2.4[/]Sr[.sub]1.5[/]Ca[.sub]1[/]Cu[.sub]1.8[/] O[.sub]8+�[/] by the TSFZ method. They reported that the single crystal grew along the a-axis and had the same composition as the feed prepared through the solid-state reaction within experimental error. In this work we have grown the Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]2[/]Ca[.sub]1[/]Cu[.sub]2[/] O[.sub]8+�[/] (hereafter, Bi(2212)) single crystal by the TSFZ method and investigated the structural and electromagnetic properties of the sintered feed, first-scanned feed and the grown single crystal. 2. Crystal Growth The feed and the solvent (act as a liquid phase from which the single crystal grows) were prepared through the solid-state reaction using powders of Bi[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/], CaCO[.sub]3[/] and CuO as starting materials. The starting materials were mixed in the nominal compositions of Bi[.sub]2.2[/]Sr[.sub]1.8[/]Ca[.sub]1[/]Cu[.sub]2[/] O[.sub]8+�[/] for feed and Bi[.sub]2.4[/]Sr[.sub]1.5[/]Ca[.sub]1[/]Cu[.sub]1.8[/] O[.sub]8+�[/] for solvent, and calcined in air at 810�C for 12 h. The calcined materials were pulverized and pressed into rods of 8mm diameter and 100mm length under a pressure of 20 kg/cm[.sup]2[/]. Then the feed rods were sintered in air at 850�C for 62 h with intermediate grinding, and the solvent rods were sintered under the same conditions for 12 h. The feed, solvent and seed were arranged in an infrared radiation furnace with double halogen lamps and ellipsoidal mirrors (NEC, SC-35HD) as shown in Figure 2. The infrared radiation from halogen lamps is focused by ellipsoidal mirrors and melts the solvent located at the focal point of the mirrors. The feed, solvent and seed are shifted synchronously downward slowly during the crystal growth. Then, the feed composition is precipitated at position I[.sub]2[/] as much as dissolved at I[.sub]1[/] while keeping the liquid composition unchanged. The details of the crystal growth can be found elsewhere.[.sup]5,8[/] Figure 2. Schematic representation of the configuration of seed, solvent and feed in an infrared radiation furnace. The A part of liquid phase may be sucked up into the feed by capillary force if a porous feed is used. In such a case the feed should be shifted downward additionally in order to supply sufficient liquid for the crystal growth. But this induces the change of the liquid composition and an undesirable secondary phase may be grown as explained in the introduction. So, we first prepared a dense feed by performing the first-scan at a high rate of 8mm/h as shown in Figure 2(a). The first-scanned feed consisted of very small single crystal. The density of the sintered and first-scanned feed was about 45% and 90% of the theoretical value of Bi(2212) phase respectively. The first-scanned feed was used as a feed for the second-scan (single crystal growth). The amount of solvent was 1.5 g and 0.5 g for the first- and second-scans respectively. The feed and seed were rotated in opposite directions at a rate of 13 rpm during each scan in order to homogenize the molten zone. The crystal growth was carried out for 3-4 days at a rate of 0.5mm/h, and we obtained crystal boule of _P_ = 6-7mm and l = 35-40mm as shown in Figure 3(a). However, the crystal boule is not a single crystal as a whole, but consisted of many single crystals. Figure 3(b) shows the single crystals separated from the crystal boule with a wire cutter and a knife. Single crystals were easily cleaved along the c-axis due to the weak bonding between double BiO[.sub]2[/] layers. The well developed surface in Figure 3(b) is c-plane. Moreover, we could also easily distinguish between the a- and b-axis because Bi(2212) crystal is well known to grow along the a-axis. The density of the single crystal was above 95% of the theoretical value. Figure 3. Photographs of (a) the crystal boule grown by TSFZ method and (b) single crystals separated from the crystal 3. Structural Properties Powder XRD patterns of the sintered feed, first-scanned feed and grown crystals were observed using CuK_a_ line as an incident radiation. We have measured the XRD pattern of the grown crystal after powdering it in order to compare it with those of feeds and to check whether impurity phases are involved or not. Figure 4 confirms that most of the sintered feed and the grown crystal consisted of Bi(2212) phase, although very tiny peaks of Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]2[/]Cu[.sub]1[/] O[.sub]6+�[/] (hereafter, Bi(2201)) phase are observed around 22� and 26� for the crystal samples. However, Bi(2201) phase and Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]3-x[/]Ca[.sub]x[/]O[.sub]y[/] (x-1) phase are distinctly observed in the first-scanned feed grown at a high rate of 8mm/h. This tendency is consistent with the result of Kubo et al.[.sup]8[/] They reported that the volume fraction of Bi(2201) phase decreased with decreasing the crystal growth rate. Figure 4. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the sintered feed, first-scanned feed and grown crystal. The Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]3-x[/]Ca[.sub]x[/]O[.sub]y[/] (X-1) phase, which was first observed by Ikeda et al.,[.sup]9[/] and identified by Sato et al.,[.sup]10[/] appears in a sample annealed in nitrogen or below 700�C in air, namely, in an oxygen-deficient condition. Hence, it is considered that the oxygen content in the first-scanned feed is lower than that in the sintered feed or grown crystal. The peak positions of Bi(2212) phase in each specimen are nearly the same, suggesting that the compositions of the grown crystal is nearly the same as that of the feeds. We have observed the backscattered Laue diffraction pattern for the grown single crystal using continuous CuK_a_ line as an incident radiation. As shown in Figure 5, the Laue diffraction pattern consists of layered spots due to the layered structure of the crystal along the c-axis.[.sup]11,12[/] However, we could observe no Laue diffraction pattern with the incident radiation along the a- or b-axis. Figure 5. Laue X-ray backscattering photograph of the grown single crystal taken with an incident beam parallel to the Figure 6 shows the high resolution electron microscope image of the grown single crystal taken with an incident beam along the a-axis. The whitish spots represent the oxygen atoms or the vacancy. The large dark spots just upper and below the whitish lines along the b-axis correspond to the Bi atoms. Double BiO[.sub]2[/] layers repeat along the c-axis with a period of about 30 Angstroms. Five less dark dotted lines, corresponding to the Sr, Ca and Cu atoms, also can be observed between double BiO[.sub]2[/] layers, which confirms that the grown single crystal is a Bi(2212) phase. Figure 6. High resolution electron microscope image of the single crystal viewed along the a-axis. Figure 6 shows that the double BiO[.sub]2[/] layers are modulated into the Bi rich and Bi deficient regions. The dark region, Bi rich region, and less dark region, Bi deficient region, in double BiO[.sub]2[/] layers are repeated along the b-axis which induce a superstructure along this direction. The superstructure has a period of 10 atomic distance for the majority part, but a period of 9 atomic distance for another part in Figure 6, this implies that the single crystal has an incommensurate superstructure[.sup]13-15[/] along the b-axis with a period of about 4.8a. Moreover, the atomic layers of Sr, Ca and Cu are also modulated into the honeycomb pattern due to the effect of the modulation of double BiO[.sub]2[/] layers. The superstructure along the b-axis can be observed more distinctly in the electron diffraction pattern. Figure 7 shows the electron diffraction pattern of the single crystal taken with an incident beam along the a- and c-axis. The period of the principal diffraction spots along the b-axis is nearly the same as that along the a-axis suggesting that the averaged atomic distances along the a- and b-axis are nearly the same. However, there are also minor diffraction spots along the b-axis with a period of about 1/5 of the principal period. The period of the real lattice is inversely proportional to that of the diffraction pattern because the diffraction pattern is represented in reciprocal lattice space. Therefore Figure 7(a) confirms that Bi(2212) phase has a superstructure along the b-axis with a period of about 5a which is consistent with the result of high resolution image. The superstructure along the b-axis can also be observed in Figure 7(b) taken with an incident beam along the a-axis. Figure 7(b) shows that the lattice parameter along the c-axis is about 6a.

Electromagnetic Properties The dc magnetization measurements were carried out using a Quantum Design SQUID magnetometer. Figure 8 shows the field cooled magnetization curves for the samples of sintered feed, first-scanned feed and the grown crystal taken at a field of 10 G. As for the crystal, electromagnetic properties were measured after air annealing. The crystal was heat treated at 840�C for 30 min. and cooled to 400�C at a rate of 12�C/h, then furnace cooled below 200�C. The magnetic field was applied parallel to the c-axis for the crystal. T[.sub]c[/](onset)s for the sintered and first-scanned feed are nearly the same. However, the transition for the first-scanned feed is broader than that for the sintered feed, presumably because of the mixed secondary phases, such as, Bi(2212) and Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]3-x[/]Ca[.sub]x[/]O[.sub]y[/] (x-1). The single crystal specimen shows not only higher T[.sub]c[/](onset) of 84 K but also narrower transitions, _D_T[.sub]c[/] (10-90%) of about 4.5 K, as compared to the feeds suggesting that the grown crystal is more homogeneous than the feeds. Figure 8. Field cooled superconducting transitions of the sintered feed, first-scanned feed and crystal taken using 10 G Figure 9 shows the temperature dependence of resistivity for each specimen. Electrical resistivity was measured using the four-probe method with a current of 1-2 mA. Current was along the a-axis for the single crystal. Each specimen shows metallic resistivity behavior in the normal state. T[.sub]c[/](zero) increases with processing, from the sintered feed to the single crystal. T[.sub]c[/](zero)s for the sintered feed, first-scanned feed and single crystal are about 45 K, 58 K and 83 K respectively. In case of the magnetization vs. temperature relation, the superconducting transition of the first-scanned feed is broader as compared to that of the sintered feed as shown in Figure 8, although the T[.sub]c[/](onset) for the first-scanned feed is nearly the same as that for the sintered feed. However, it is considered that the first-scanned feed shows not only higher T[.sub]c[/](zero) but also narrower _D_T[.sub]c[/] compared to that of the sintered feed in resistivity measurements since the density of the first-scanned feed is about two times of that of the sintered feed, so that the superconducting path is well connected in the first-scanned feed. The resistivity of the first-scanned feed is larger than that of the sintered feed because of the presence of mixed secondary phases of Bi(2201) and Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]3-x[/]Ca[.sub]x[/]O[.sub]y[/] (x-1) phase. Figure 9. Temperature dependence of the resistivity for the sintered feed, first-scanned feed and single crystal. The The temperature dependence of resistivity along the a-, b- and c-axis of the grown single crystal is shown in Figure 10. The resistivity curves in CuO[.sub]2[/] plane show metallic behavior in the normal state while that along the c-axis makes a small peak around T[.sub]c[/]. Figure 10. Temperature dependence of the resistivity along the a-, b- and c-axis of the single crystal. The dimension of Although _r_[.sub]a[/] and _r_[.sub]b[/] are well known to show metallic behavior in the normal state, _r_[.sub]c[/] is controversial. Martin et al.[.sup]16[/] reported the semiconductor like _r_[.sub]c[/] with _r_[.sub]c[/]/_r_[.sub]a[/] - 1.5 x 10[.sup]5[/], but Yasuda et al.[.sup]17[/] obtained metal like _r_[.sub]c[/] with _r_[.sub]c[/]/_r_[.sub]ab[/] - 500 which is consistent with our results. T[.sub]c[/](zero)s along the a-, b- and c-axis have nearly the same value of 83 K. Anisotropic ratio of _r_[.sub]c[/]/_r_[.sub]ab[/] for Bi(2212) is much larger than that for YBCO phase[.sup]18[/] suggesting the two-dimensionality is more evident in the Bi(2212) phase. _r_[.sub]b[/]/_r_[.sub]a[/] and _r_[.sub]c[/]/_r_[.sub]a[/] values are about 1.67 and 250 in this experiment, but Martin et al. had obtained different results with _r_[.sub]b[/]/_r_[.sub]a[/] - 0.5 and _r_[.sub]c[/]/_r_[.sub]a[/] - 1.5 x 10[.sup]5[/]. It is considered that the difference may come from, (i) although Martin et al. had measured the resistivity anisotropy for Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]2.2[/]Ca[.sub]0.8[/]Cu.O[.sub]8+�[/] single crystal, Bi[.sub]2.2[/]Sr[.sub]1.8[/]Ca[.sub]1[/]Cu.O[.sub]8+�[/] single crystal has been used as a specimen in the present measurement, and (ii) Martin et al. had measured the resistivity by Montgomery method,[.sup]19,20[/] but we have measured by conventional four-probe method in our experiment. 5. Summary We have grown Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]2[/]Ca[.sub]1[/]Cu[.sub]2[/] O[.sub]8+�[/] single crystals in air by the travelling solvent floating zone method through twice scanning process. The density of the specimen increases with processing from the sintered feed to the grown single crystal. Most of the sintered feed and the grown crystal consist of Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]2[/]Ca[.sub]1[/]Cu[.sub]2[/] O[.sub]8+�[/] phase, but the first-scanned feed grown at a high rate of 8mm/h involves Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]2[/]Cu[.sub]1[/]O[.sub]6+�[/] and Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]3-x[/]Ca[.sub]x[/]O[.sub]y[/] (x-1) phases as minor phases. T[.sub]c[/](zero)s of the sintered feed, first-scanned feed and grown crystal are about 45 K, 58 K and 83 K respectively. The susceptibility and resistivity measurement show that the single crystal not only higher has superconducting transition temperature but also narrower transition width suggesting that the grown single crystal is more homogeneous as compared with the feeds. [as published] The high resolution electron microscope image and electron diffraction pattern show the single crystal has an incommensurate superstructure along the b-axis with a period of about 4.8a. The resistivity anisotropy of _r_[.sub]c[/]/_r_[.sub]a[/] is about 250 which is larger than that of YBCO phase suggesting that the two dimensionality is more evident in Bi(2212) phase. References 1.
