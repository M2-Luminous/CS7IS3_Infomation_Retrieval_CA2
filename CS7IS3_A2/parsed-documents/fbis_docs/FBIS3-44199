The Angolan head of state noted that, first and foremost, Blondin Beye has known how to abide by Angolan law, adding that he has tried to have the warring sides reach whatever understandings they possibly can. Asked whether he thinks today that the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] had planned all along to launch a war in the event that it lost the September 1992 elections, President Jose Eduardo dos Santos replied that it is possible that UNITA already had alternate plans, like all the forces -- especially the more backward forces -- that have assisted him during the conflict.
