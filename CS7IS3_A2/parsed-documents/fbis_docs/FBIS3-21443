Talking to newsmen BJP economic exports Jai Dubashi who is a member of the national executive alleged that in this scam that concerns commerce ministry, the customs revenue had been hit by Rs 3,000 [rupees] crore and that excuse revenue by another Rs 2,000 crore. He said the exports figures being quoted by the government are highly inflated and need be inquired and checked. He said people involved in this VABAL scam are owners of firms close to the ruling Congress party. At least one firm had figures previously in a similar case of dubious import-export business. In a joint statement Mr Jay Dubashi and BJP spokesman Krishan Lal Sharma, MP [member of Parliament] said there was no end to scams under the Narasimha Rao Government. Two years ago it was the stock and banking scam in which over Rs 5,000 crore were spirited away under the nose of a slumbering Finance Minister by a gaggle of Congress politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen close to the ruling party. And now there was another scam this time in the Commerce Ministry from whom exporters and businessmen claiming to be exporters secured licences for exports and robbed the government of over Rs 1,800 crore by manipulating an export incentive scheme called VABAL. The joint statement of the BJP leaders termed the above figure as only the tip of the iceberg as the actual loss must be much more--so large that it was unlikely to have taken place without the collusion of insiders in the ministry, just as the stock and banking scandal was the handiwork of people who had an access to the highest levels in the Finance Ministry and the Reserve Bank of India. The modus operandi of the exports "under the VABAL scheme is that an exporter files a declaration for exports or fictitious exports, obviously in collusion with authorities which can be as much as 20 to 30 times his actual exports. The foreign exchange he "earns" was nothing but his own money sent out of India through "Hawala" transactions. These bogus "exports" promptly go into the books of the Commerce Ministry as legitimate exports, though they are nothing of the kind." "In addition, the exporter gets import licences for raw materials on the basis of his bogus declaration, which can be as large as two-thirds of "exporters." He does not pay customs and other duties on them. Thus he launders black money into white, cheats on taxes and helps the Commerce Ministry to cook up its books and claim that exports are booming said the joint statement. They said some of the first which have received such licences are close to the ruling party. At least one firm has figured previously in a similar case of dubious import-export business, the BJP leaders alleged in their statement maintaining that if exporters can claim bogus exports under VABAL scheme they can also do so outside VABAL, which meant that a large proportion of the so-called exports must be fictitious. The joint statement wanted the Commerce and the Finance Ministries to come clean on the VABAL scam and tell the BJP what steps if any they have taken so far to plug the loopholes and to book the culprits.
