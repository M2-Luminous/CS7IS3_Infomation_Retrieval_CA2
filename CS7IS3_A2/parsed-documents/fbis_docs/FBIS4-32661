At this meeting of the heads of the European Union, on which occasion a new European flag bearing 16 stars was first raised (Norway, Finland, Sweden, and Austria have signed admission agreements), Rome has after all made a few steps that will make Italy, at least in the foreseeable future, more important in this newly enlarged society than it was during its relentless "political purgatory" within the circle of the former Twelve. The meeting of "the Magnificent Seven" (the most developed industrial countries in the world) will soon be held in Naples, at which Russia will be completely swamped by the economic and political embrace of the West, and Italy at the moment also chairs the CSCE. Berlusconi will thus not find only his own television stations crucial this time, as he will be all over the television screens as a leading global diplomat. In Corfu he even managed unexpectedly to tip the scales of the diplomatic trade over the election of the new president of the European Commission, in which even the Germans -- who only recently took it rather coldly -- had to give in to the European parliamentary games over Berlusconi's neofascist allies. Now PANORAMA claims that the Twelve have agreed to support Italy with its constant designs on Slovenia, and Italy has again been discovering what already seemed irretrievably lost: the mentality of the winner, though the most important players are being kicked out of diplomacy (Fini) and the soccer field (Pagliuca). In this political and media atmosphere Foreign Minister Antonio Martino is visiting Sarajevo, Zagreb, and Belgrade this Monday and Tuesday [27-28 June]. Rome has suffered quite a lot, being pushed out of the global remodeling of Bosnia-Herzegovina with contemptuous dismissal, with even Turkish soldiers accepted as part of the blue helmets, while Clinton expressly forbade the Italians to do the same. In the Balkans the Italians have suffered an unexpectedly large number of victims (European observers and journalists), but have received hardly any profit through sales; they are now among the loudest in the preparations for the reconstruction of Sarajevo, and some claim that the final plan for the division and rearrangement of Bosnia-Herzegovina will be sealed at the Naples meeting of the wealthiest nations. Martino arrives in Belgrade as the number one CSCE man, who might persuade Milosevic to let European observers go to Kosovo after all, while he comes to Zagreb as a neighbor, who will continue to drive Croatia crazy with the "hot-cold" policy whenever he deems it necessary. In parliament he thus rejected any stories about Italian territorial aspirations toward Slovenia and Croatia, promising -- as Granic described to a half-empty parliament -- "to abide by the European norms and agreements," but it is precisely those "European norms" that could bring more long-term headaches to Zagreb than the frivolous flirting of certain Italian circles with [Krajina's] Borislav Mikelic, the expert on all sorts of salami. Within a strictly diplomatic framework, Rome cannot harm Croatia, which only aspires to the Council of Europe, as much as Slovenia, which already hopes that it has squeezed its foot in the door of the European Union, but Rome can keep lead both countries by their noses to the applause of the European lobbies with constant references to the protection of minorities and free movement of capital, people, and ideas. Those who support a similar observance of European standards in Istria constantly challenge Zagreb, while Zagreb can not silence Istria without alienating Europe, so Croatian diplomacy in that respect keeps chasing its own tail in ever narrower circles. Among other things, the Statute of the County of Istria has just been officially rejected because of some unwelcome multicultural and multilingual ideas, and at this moment only political dreamers could visualize that in the foreseeable future they could muster a majority in the Croatian parliament to agree to a new natural return of Italian property, and even vote for a law that would enable Italians -- or any foreigners -- to buy Croatian real estate. Croatian politics still adores Europe in principle, but only in the way that it does not become pregnant [as published], and to what extent this titillation from the other side of the Adriatic can be unpleasant was best shown by two heated speeches by Tudjman, in Podgora and Pazin, which, in some Italian circles, have caused surprise, shock, mockery, and rejection with barely concealed abhorrence. Anger and bitterness about "Cypriotization" and UNPROFOR are growing in Croatia, while Italy is enjoying a summer renaissance, so Mate Granic will, in his talks with Antonio Martino, have to invest a lot of good will, patience, and generosity to persuade his guest that it does not always pay to be pig-headed about everything because of a little political noise on either side of the Adriatic.
