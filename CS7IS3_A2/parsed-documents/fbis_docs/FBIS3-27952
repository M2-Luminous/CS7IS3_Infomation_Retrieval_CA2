The convention approved, among others, promotion of an election system combining proportional representation and small electoral districts, and the party thus appears to have settled pending issues for the time being. However, the seeds of dissention are continuously smoldering because the new executive lineup was formed on the initiative of the left-wing faction and all election-related posts are occupied by a group assuming a cautious position toward the combined formula on the election system. The SDPJ is the largest party in the ruling camp, but neither the group promoting the combined formula nor the group using prudence shown clear visions for the survival of the party. As a result, the introversive logic--which retains traces of the "1955 system" [the two-party system formed in 1955 with creation of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the SDPJ]--is going unchallenged within the party . The fear that, with its increasing left-wing tinge, the SDPJ might be a "powder keg" in the Hosokawa coalition government is becoming a reality, though this fear was noted at the outset. A very difficult problem was put forward at the SDPJ convention in late September which was held to elect the new executive leadership. The problem was: The SDPJ suffered a historical crushing defeat in the July general election. Nevertheless, it achieved the long-cherished desire to overthrow the LDP and participated in the coalition government. However, the people's support only keeps falling sharply, and they do not appreciate us at all. We have agreed to the introduction of the combination of proportional representation and small electoral districts which might become our own grave in the future. Now, how can the SDPJ restore the people's support and survive? Show the way. This is like asking one to find a way to carry out a funeral and a wedding at the same place at the same time and to satisfy all of the attendants. This is a difficult and strange demand, judging from common sense exercised in the political world thus far. Accordingly, the way to resolve this problem cannot be found unless an approach totally different from the conventional one is used. The problem will prove to be utterly unsolvable as long as the party uses the kind of Diet-steering arithmetic prevalent under the 1955 system--an arithmetic in which "one plus one" makes three or one. However, the answer given in the recent party convention represented a solution reached by the use of the "1955 arithmetic" in whatever way we may look at it. Still Competent To Make Leftward Bounce In the election of the chairman, Mr. Kubo, regarded as the most likely winner, hurriedly withdrew his candidacy as a result of a closed-door adjustment. Mr. Murayama, who is rather plain as the face of the party, declared his candidacy. Setting aside a character sketch, it was hard to understand why the chairman should be Murayama, not Kubo. However, there was clear logic within the SDPJ in this connection. The election to decide Chairman Sadao Yamahana's successor after he expressed his desire to resign was intended not only to clarify responsibility for the defeat in the general election. It was an intraparty struggle for leadership waged by inquiring into causes for the defeat, that is, by discussing the rights and wrongs of the past policy line, and of deciding what policy line should be taken now. During the era when the SDPJ was an opposition party, the party's left-wing faction rapped the executive leadership, reasoning that "the party has invited the people's criticism because it inched close to the line of the LDP." As a result, the party followed the course of leaning to the left. It made the so-called "leftward bounce." In the recent party convention, because of the aforementioned complicated setup, the logic of the leftward bounce--a perception under the 1955 system, that is, Japan's cold war structure--prevailed although the party found it hard to draw a straight monolithic conclusion as in the past. The interest of the mass media and the people in the chairman's election was concentrated on what distance the SDPJ would maintain with the Hosokawa coalition government and how it would handle the combination of proportional representation and small electoral districts; however, SDPJ members were looking at the candidates Kubo and Murayama from a different perspective. The two persons did not differ in the basic position that they would work to maintain the coalition government and promote the combination of proportional representation and small electoral districts. But Mr. Murayama's emphasis on respect for "intraparty democracy" drew attention. He merely told the simple, taken-for-granted truth that important decisions should unfailingly be made through discussions at appointed organs. However, this remark assumes a deeper meaning when viewed in the light of the SDPJ's actual condition. Deciding things through organs means that party organizations should make full arguments in a proper order and finally await the conclusion at the party convention. This means that matters to be decided should unfailingly be referred to local organizations for discussion and that the party cannot ignore the intentions of the local organizations, which hold 80 percent of party members and a majority of deputies to the party convention. In view of the actual situation in which most local party members are leftist activists, organizational discussions are tantamount to letting arguments go through a leftist filter at all stages, and so it also means that policies cannot pass unless they are acceptable to the left-wing faction. In the past as well, many reform plans backed down from original drafts in the process of debate and were finally torn to pieces through alterations. The real substance of attaching importance to intraparty democracy is synonymous with revival and maintenance of the leftist-wing faction. The reason why the members looked to intraparty democracy was the issue of the combination of proportional representation and small electoral districts. The SDPJ at its 1991 convention decided to oppose the combination formula, saying that "its introduction will not be permitted." Changing this decision requires the approval of the party convention or the Central Committee. However, the Yamahana executive leadership did not take these proceedings at all. The local organizations, actual election-performing forces, had a strong sense of crisis from the feeling that the SDPJ would be dead and buried under the combination formula. In the eyes of the local organizations, this was why the party made the decision against the formula through debate, but Chairman Sadao Yamahana changed the decision arbitrarily without any consultations. They felt that this was critical and that something should be done to curb it. It was not only the combination formula. Those local forces also could not overlook the issue of another condition for the sharing in the government--"succeeding the policies held up until now (under the LDP government) regarding fundamental national policies such as diplomacy and defense." They feared that if this position were pursued as intended, they could not carry out struggles against bases and atomic bombs which had formed the centerpiece of activities by local organizations. They felt that such a development might lead to the collapse of the party organization itself and that, therefore, the decision on the condition was a matter of life or death for the party. However, the decision was also made arbitrarily by the executive leadership. In his candidacy announcement, Mr. Murayama said: "What the SDPJ should do now is to rally the most excellent traditions, talents, and qualities of the SDPJ and its members and take a new look at the `mind' of the SDPJ" (SHAKAI SHIMPO)." He then added that "the first step toward this end is the thorough implementation of intraparty democracy." In these remarks, he expressed local fears on behalf of the local members. The election of the chairman came to an end in an instant. On 9 September, the date for the candidacy application in the election, 25 chief secretaries of prefectural headquarters across the nation assembled in a hotel in Tokyo and decided to support Murayama. It is said that 10 additional persons expressed the desire to join in the move although they did not attend the meeting. This number shows how strong the local voice was. No one could be his match under these circumstances. Upon hearing this development, Mr. Kubo gave up his candidacy. The Murayama executive leadership was thus formed on the basis of misgivings by local organizations. All the more because of this, he is hog-tied by local pressures. Mr. Yamahana was compelled to take responsibility for his arbitrariness, but the coalition government became possible because he pushed his way in this arbitrary manner. Conversely, it will be structurally impossible to expect the Murayama executive leadership to follow the same position in the future. Prepared To Accept Split? It Is To Make Final Choice The person who called for the meeting of 25 chief secretaries which played a determining role in deciding the next chairman was former Vice Chairman Masahiro Yamamoto, a leftist big wheel who, though living in retirement, had covert influence with local organizations and the party headquarters. He was the prop of the "Society for Building a New SDPJ," a power base for Mr. Yamahana's rise, seceded from the society in opposition to the combination formula and became the motive power for Chairman Murayama. On the evening of that day, the 25 persons assembled at the official residence of the lower house speaker and met Speaker Takako Doi. Ms. Doi reportedly expressed the hope that they would promote their position in consultations with Mr. Yamamoto in the future. And in the election of the chairman, the Murayama camp was joined by former General Secretary Tsuruo Yamaguchi, a member of the rightist Suiyokai and former Diet Administration Committee Chairman Shun Oide. The two are close to Ms. Doi as members of the force for constitutional protection and have held strong anti-Tanabe (former Chairman Makoto Tanabe) feelings. In this context, it may be said that the Murayama system is in substance "Doi's new party" which has been formed around Ms. Doi, joined by local activists, left-wing lawmakers, and some rightist members, and rallying the force for protection of the Constitution. This is clear from a passage in Mr. Murayama's candidacy announcement that "it is naturally an important part of our job to create an impressive and vigorous Diet easy to understand for citizens in support of Ms. Takako Doi, who, bearing the most excellent SDPJ traditions upon her shoulder, was inaugurated as the House of Representatives speaker." Ms. Doi appears to have firmed up her determination to restore the SDPJ as a party for protection of the Constitution amid the SDPJ's crushing defeat and establishment of the non-LDP coalition regime on the initiative of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa. This is also the determination to block the two-conservative party doctrine. The general outline was shown when Mr. Yamahana asked Ms. Doi to take office as speaker of the House of Representatives. In the process of consultations between the two persons from late July to August, it became clear that Ms. Doi's concrete goals were to shift the chairmanship to the hand of the left-wing faction, to strengthen the SDPJ's subjectivity, and to realize the combination formula in such a way as to enable the tripolar system, not the two major party system. The Murayama system should thus be looked upon as deep-rooted. It is, in fact, impossible to solidify, as in the past, the ties between leftist and rightist factions under the anti-LDP banner alone now that reorganization of the political world has become a reality with the LDP divided and with the SDPJ sending six cabinet members to the regime, though it was possible when there was a powerful enemy called the LDP in ahe 1955 system. If one is discontented with the Murayama line, one has no option but to secede from the party. Although the "non-conservative liberals" (Rengo Chairman Akira Yamagishi, etc.) equally adopt a tripolar plan, the policies they uphold are contradictory to the demands of the local organizations and also conflict with the line of protecting the Constitution. If the SDPJ aims to promote a coalition government with a conservative force no matter which of the two systems [the two major party system and the tripolar system] it chooses, it cannot help diluting its own unique fundamental policies and movement. It may insist on a coalition government retaining the SDPJ's subjectivity, but this is simply a castle in the air in view of its current competence. The SDPJ has now come to its final fork in the road. Between Political Regime and Subjectivity One branch of the road is the two major forces system and the other is the tripolar system. Mr. Tanabe of the reformist faction views that the political world will shift along a moderate multiparty system under two big political forces for the time being. On the basis of this view, he stresses that "in responding to the reorganization of the political world, we should be ready to participate in it actively, not passively, and to this end we should have the determination to even readily "disband the party" if the people request it and conditions are mature for it." According to Mr. Tanabe, a party is "nothing but a means and tool for changing politics in compliance with the people's desires," and he argues that "we cannot stick to the tool and consequently choose the way for getting isolated from the people and `existing only in name and being virtually dead.'" Do not be hung up on the banner or the party--this is what his stand calls for. This doctrine that the party members should even be ready to disband their party is the path that the local organizations, the left-wing faction, and Ms. Doi are most alert to. This alertness is represented by the argument of former Chairman Masatsugu Ishibashi who belonged to the force for constitutional protection. Mr. Ishibashi asserts: "There is not a shred of persuasiveness in the excuses that it cannot be helped for the party to make sacrifices in order to realize the change of regime and vitalize parliamentary democracy. This is all the truer when we think that the SDPJ's weakening and collapse link immediately to revision of the Constitution." The point of his argument is that the party should be kept alive with its banner upheld persistently. This is by contrast a "survival strategy." Mr. Tanabe's assertion is attended with the danger of the party collapse. However, in view of the public opinion trends Mr. Ishibashi's line also cannot completely dispel doubts about how long the line could stay persuasive in the future for expanding the SDPJ's power. This is a difficult choice, but the SDPJ has now been driven to a point where it cannot but choose either of the two paths. It may be said that this time the party has opted for the latter path by choosing Chairman Murayama. Yet the party must abide by the agreement on establishment of the coalition government now that it has actually participated in the government and is adopting the motto of maintaining the coalition government. In such a case, "succeeding the previous regime's policies" will unavoidably become a heavier burden for the Murayama executive leadership which attaches importance to local forces. As to the estrangement between the SDPJ's inherent fundamental policies and the succession of the previous regime's policies, Mr. Yamahana could not give any indications except saying that "efforts will be made to fill up the gap." Specifically, the party should address the following issues: the measure to cope with post-Cambodia PKO (UN peacekeeping operations), a revision of the Self-Defense Forces [SDF] Law so as to enable the dispatch of SDF aircraft overseas to rescue Japanese nationals, the income tax reduction which has become the largest political task, and the consumption tax increase to provide a revenue replacement for the income tax reduction. It is also pressed hard to strictly observe the distribution of fixed seats (250 seats in the small electoral districts and 250 seats in proportional representation) with regard to the combination of proportional representation and small electoral districts. The combination formula sustained restrictions through a resolution at the party convention. Especially, the PKO and consumption tax issues represent a line from which the party cannot budge an inch because the former is the symbol of Constitutional protection and the latter, that of Ms. Doi. If the SDPJ gives priority to its intraparty position, the coalition government now enjoying unprecedented support will become an absurd being, and the party will be deserted by the people as a criminal responsible for it. On the other hand, if it prizes the maintenance of regime, the party's subjectivity cannot but recede. Mr. Yamahana solved this dilemma through arbitrary action, but it is hard to foresee how Mr. Murayama who barred this method on his own will tide over the situation. Barrier Is 1993 Declaration The new executive leadership's campaign policy is to be decided at the party convention to be resumed in January next year. The largest point of contention at the convention is how to deal with the "1993 declaration." The declaration, a realistic line giving a second look at almost all fundamental party policies, touched off a strong opposition among the local organizations from the outset when it was originally drafted. Delegates of chief secretaries across the nation even warned (then) Secretary General Hirotake Akamatsu that "if we are not consulted with beforehand, we will totally revise it at the party convention." The declaration is, in outline, similar to the party-founding declaration of the Japan New Party, and the reformist faction expected the declaration, if adopted, to open the way for the formation of a new liberal party joined by the SDPJ even if represented by its conservative force. However, in view of the trend shown in the election of Chairman Murayama, the fate of the 1993 declaration is already as perilous as a light exposed to wind. Mr. Ishibashi criticizes this declaration bitterly, saying: "Except for views on the Japan-U.S. security arrangement and on the SDF, it makes little difference from the new declaration I worked out. However, it has its characteristics which are the excessive considerations for others' positions and the use of all sorts of flowery words." It is unlikely that the 1993 declaration will materialize. Attaching importance to intraparty democracy reflects local voices, and at the same time means bringing out the color of the left-wing faction. Moreover, the present reorganization of the political world is so quick in speed that a party cannot catch up with it by the SDPJ-type organizational decisionmaking. In consideration of these two elements, it is believed that the SDPJ will deepen its isolation within the Hosokawa coalition government which has begun to show a strongly conservative face and that such deepening isolation will make the voice of the left-wing faction louder and louder. Such is the phenomenon expected to take place. At length, the party will assume the image of a center-left political party upholding constitutional protection as its slogan. In the Rengo chairman election which was held concurrently with the election of the SDPJ chairman, trade unions with a strong leftist tinge originating from the former Sohyo [General Council of Trade Unions of Japan] rebelled half openly against the Yamagishi coalition line. The center-left faction is thus clarifying its range of influence. With the 1995 upper house election in mind, the Murayama executive leadership will not change its major policy of maintaining the Hosokawa coalition government; however, after the election it will unavoidably get poised toward establishing an SDPJ-centered coalition government. On the other hand, there is a persistent view that, on the supposition of the SDPJ dropping out of the Hosokawa coalition, Mr. Ozawa has begun working to form a new force which has Shinseito, Komeito, and the Democratic Socialist Party as its centerpiece and absorbs part of the LDP. In such a case, one cannot rule out the possibility that the SDPJ's reformist-rightist faction whose foothold has become narrower will join in the force. When things develop this way, the bold choice of the Hosokawa government in consideration of the SDPJ's allergy to Mr. Ozawa will no longer be meaningful, and a clearly Shinseito-centered government will be produced. The SDPJ's swing toward the left will create a momentum to rock the foundation of the Hosokawa government. Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone once carved his way into the labor world which was the base of support for opposition parties, saying that "I will expand the left wing of the LDP." New conservative parties such as Shinseito, Sakigake [Harbinger], and the Japan New Party have now plucked the fruit of his endeavors, and they are now further closing in on the citadel of the SDPJ. If the SDPJ upholds its subjectivity, it will accelerate the birth of a regime which the SDPJ does not want. One thing that is certain in this cynical reality is that fire is set to a blasting fuse attached to the SDPJ.
