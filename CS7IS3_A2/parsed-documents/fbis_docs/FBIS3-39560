In the first letter, sent to leaders in the United States, Britain, France and Germany, Yeltsin alleged that the Western powers had sidestepped the UN and had gone against the Partnership for Peace accord between East and West in issuing an ultimatum in Bosnia. The second letter was of a very different nature, well-informed sources said, briefing Ciampi on the Bosnian Serbs' agreement to accept Russian mediation, and to withdraw heavy weapons from the Sarajevo exclusion zone. Confirmation that the Bosnian Serbs had begun moving their arms came both from commanders on the ground in Bosnia, from a spokesman at UN headquarters in New York and from southern European NATO command in Naples, where CIC Admiral Mike Boorda described Thursday as "very positive." His deputy, General Antonio Milani was more cautious, telling the press "the pictures we see on television, of children playing in Sarajevo, are encouraging, as is the news that first positions are being evacuated and the first arms handed over... But this does not complete the mandate we have been given." "It could prove that by Sunday night all sides will be satisfied," he added. "A first step has now been taken." Boorda's close aide Captain Trevor Murray told journalists of the careful attack plans laid over weeks of gruelling double shifts, but was prepared to admit that bombarding Serb positions would not be the ideal solution for the conflict in the former Yugoslav country: "no one is kidding themselves that they can solve Bosnia's problems with bombardments. We all know that this is a very complicated situation." While launching raids on Bosnia would be tricky, he added, "a mission in Bosnia would be considered much less risky than the war in Iraq." Some 100 fighter-bombers and 80 support aircraft are standing by in bases on Italian territory, ready to take off for Bosnia should the need arise. More planes are on the alert aboard three aircraft carriers -- the French Foch, the British Ark Royal and the U.S. Saratoga -- in the Mediterranean. A meeting of foreign ministers from France, the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands will take place Sunday evening in the Aviano U.S. airforce base in eastern Italy from the Operation Deny Flight is coordinated. On a five-day visit to Rome, Serbian opposition leader Vuk Draskovic welcomed the Russian moves to avoid air strikes and predicted Thursday that the Bosnian Serbs would respect the ultimatum. "I cannot believe that (Bosnian Serb leader Radovan) Karadzic would be so crazy as to not respond positively to these requests," Draskovic said at a press conference in the Italian capital. Commenting on Russia's reluctance to back airstrikes, the Serb opposition chief said he could understand Moscow's resentment over the way that NATO has taken the UN's policing work upon itself: "Russia is a great power and NATO's biggest mistake has been to exclude Moscow from the peace process." With the truce holding on the ground around Sarajevo, more wounded were flown out of the Bosnian capital to Falconara airport in eastern Italy. A first load of 12 wounded and their helpers was followed later in the day by 14 more, to be distributed around hospitals in Italy, Spain, the United Arab Emirates, Austria and the United States. In this evening's cabinet meeting in Rome, Social Affairs Minister Fernanda Contri briefed ministers on her recent visit to Sarajevo and told them of an accord with her Bosnian counterpart for humanitarian aid convoys for children of all religions and ethnic groups all over the beleaguered country. Croatia's social affairs department has also agreed, she said, to allow the convoys to set out from the port of Split for Mostar and Sarajevo.
