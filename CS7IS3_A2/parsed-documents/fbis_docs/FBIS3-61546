We will not dispute the American professor; he possibly exaggerates, but it is possible to understand him: for many months he ``fought'' the higher powers in the United States for the ``right'' to carry out joint work with the Russians (they have the same problems as we do!) and therefore the successful completion of the experiment so exhilarated Professor Younger. After all, this also justified the efforts made and what is most important, the doors were now flung wide open for future cooperation. On our side the director was Professor Chernyshev. And what is there to hide; to a great extent due to Vladimir Konstantinovich everything went off brilliantly. After all, it was precisely he who was not only the ideological inspiration of the devised program, but also its organizer and executor. It was precisely the ``Chernyshev team,''riveted for many years on a single goal, which realized the ``launch of the first joint `thermonuclear satellite' in the history of the two countries--Russia and the United States.'' Our conversation with the scientist began with the traditional question: Gubarev: Who are you? Chernyshev: Division head at the All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Physics, doctor of physical and mathematical sciences. I have been working here since 1950, since immediately after graduation from the Moscow Physical Engineering Institute... Gubarev: And how did you chance to come here? Chernyshev: I was chosen at the institute. Evidently someone took notice of me. I graduated from the institute with "flying colors." Gubarev: Did you know where you were going? Chernyshev: When I asked about this they told me that it was somewhere within the boundaries of Gorkiy Oblast. Gubarev: What was your first impression? Chernyshev: Very unusual... It was winter, January. There was a great deal of snow. The streets were very well plowed. Young soldiers in sheepskin coats maintained order. I felt concern about who lived here. And the living conditions were very comfortable for the young specialists who came here. Don't forget that 1950 had come and you can imagine what the situation was in the country... We were quartered in hotel No. 2. Comfortable conditions, exactly the opposite from how we lived in Moscow! When we arrived in the dining hall we were surprised at the choice of dishes. And our first impression was that we had arrived in a ``corner of paradise.'' Gubarev: And the next day? Chernyshev: Work began. Gubarev: Was it also like paradise? Chernyshev: It was really work, very interesting, and I recall those years with satisfaction. The people paid no heed to time. It was commonplace to return from the work site sometime in the middle of the night and even toward dawn. Everyone worked with enthusiasm and each of understood that an extremely important task was being performed. None of us knew precisely what it was, but we guessed vaguely... Gubarev: And when you learned for the first time that you were working on a weapon? Chernyshev: The first year I vaguely guessed the nature of the work and a little later began to participate in discussions of the problems and naturally I understood that we were dealing with the manufacture of a nuclear weapon. I began to learn from Mikhail Yakovlevich Vasilyev. He was an exceptional lover of work, a fine experimenter, a very honest person... I always remember him with great warmth. He instilled in us a feeling of responsibility for the delegated task. He was our teacher. A little later in the course of the work I had the opportunity to interact with Yuliy Borisovich Khariton. The meetings with him, I believe, left an indelible impression not only on me, but also on all the young specialists. Gubarev: You are the experimenter. You did not know in detail about similar work which had been carried out in the United States. So how come you were at a very high level and were on a par with the Americans? Chernyshev: Many specialists of our institute are very high-class specialists. And each in his own field can be proud of what he has done. Sooner or later each will be asked the question; ``And what did you do?'' And if you judge honestly, then the fingers on one hand will suffice to list the tasks done, but each of these tasks performed will bring you satisfaction because it was of a high class. And more than just one or two tens of specialists at our institute can be proud of such results. Now, looking backward and comparing the work of our specialists with those at other institutes, you are convinced time and again that a unique scientific center was established here with an enormous scientific-technical capability. Gubarev: You constantly set off explosions. And were there many such experiments? Chernyshev: Many thousands. Especially during the first years we worked day and night and therefore there were a great many explosions. Gubarev: And just why did you set off the explosions? Chernyshev: Even the most magnificent theoreticians cannot foresee everything. Usually there are close to the truth, but all the fascination is that you get a wet film and you see how the theoretical computations and the experimental results differ substantially because the phenomena with which you are dealing are nevertheless very complex. Mankind also has very little work experience in this field, after all, we are talking about high energy densities when a high concentration of energy, high temperatures and pressures are attained in short time intervals. The behavior of matter is very difficult to predict under these conditions. Moreover, when you're talking about weapons, every step requires careful and thorough checking. If you look backward once again and attempt to determine how many useless and unnecessary experiments there were, their number is very small. But they also were necessary in order to understand how to move forward. Gubarev: Probably it was pleasing for the experimenter to say: Dear Academicians Sakharov and Zeldovich, were you mistaken? Chernyshev: This is a natural reaction... But it was far more pleasant when together with the theoreticians you make your way toward the truth. I had the satisfaction of working with both Andrey Dmitriyevich Sakharov and Igor Yevgenyevich Tamm. And I keep only bright impressions from these meetings. Incidentally, when the first experiments with magnetic commulation were discussed with both Sakharov and Tamm they very naturally and simply sensed what was not understood. Andrey Dmitriyevich frequently repeated: ``Let's think together!'' He was a very magnetic personality, he understood us and discussed any problems as equals. And new ideas and new experiments took shape. Thus it was, for example, in the development of magnetic flux generators. Gubarev: Was an idea of Sakharov the basis for the present-day experiment? Chernyshev: Andrey Dmitriyevich proposed the idea of magnetic commulation in 1951. Gubarev: Pardon me for interrupting, but in ordinary terms what is ``magnetic commulation''? Chernyshev: This is the compression of a magnetic flux in a circuit by means of external forces. Some of the energy is transformed into magnetic field energy, and as a result of circuit compression the current sharply increases, which makes it possible to use such devices as generators of superpowerful magnetic fields. In this field great successes were attained by the now deceased Academician Aleksandr Ivanovich Pavlovskiy. In these same devices it is possible to obtain great supplies of energy and high flux densities during short time intervals. In 1951 Sakharov stated that in principle it is possible to use magnetic commulation for producing a thermonuclear burst. To me this thought was very attractive. However, it was necessary to overcome enormous difficulties. Although during the first ten years some apparatus appeared, it already was clear that in order to produce a thermonuclear burst the power had to be increased a hundredfold. I had the idea of a disk explosively driven magnetic field generator and it began to take shape in 1961. Over the course of some time we were the only ones who had this technology. Our results were reported for the first time at an international conference in 1983. Unfortunately, attempts of American researchers to achieve the same results were not crowned with success. Naturally, in the report we did not give what is related to ``know-how.'' Thus, ten years have passed and now the Americans are undertaking energetic attempts to achieve that which we attained in 1983. Gubarev: How do you explain their lag? Chernyshev: Several factors. It seems to me that the Russian research was more innovative, because, however paradoxical it may seem, they worked under more difficult conditions. It is no secret that good outfitting with personal computers enables Americans to make many calculations and determinations, but at the same time ``slows down'' the development of thought. Gubarev: It is clear what cooperation gives to the Americans. But what advantage is there to you? Chernyshev: First of all, we understand the level at which they are. We are adopting a number of methods which we did not know of earlier and most importantly, are solving many thermonuclear synthesis problems. Indeed, even such a rich country as the United States by itself, without broad international cooperation, is not capable of solving this problem. Gubarev: I propose such a project. We detonate a nuclear charge, transform the energy in your generator, direct it into a beaker filled with water, obtain a thermonuclear burst, and then direct this enormous energy to an electric power plant. The scheme seems so elementary, so what is fallacious about it? Chernyshev: The fact that in the very first stage you use a fission reaction. Our task, however, is to obtain "clean energy." It is assumed that superpowerful magnetic generators will be used as the triggering device. In these generators it is the energy of an explosion, not the energy of fission, which is the operative agent; then a system is triggered in which there also is no fissionable materials and as a result of synthesis we obtain energy, some of which will be used for the next thermonuclear cycle and all the rest is directed for the needs of people. Gubarev: Thus, the Americans nevertheless were doubtful in the first stage? Chernyshev: This was related to the successes in developing explosively driven magnetic field generators. The history of their development dates way back. The first abstracts were submitted to an international conference as early as 1965. Andrey Dmitriyevich Sakharov even then insisted that Pavlovskiy and I without fail go to the conference and tell about our successes in this field. And here then began a game of ``leap frog'' with the trip, since after all we worked at a secret center. First they told us: ``Go!'', but after a month had passed it was ``No, don't go!'' Finally, Aleksandr Ivanovich and I were called to Moscow for formalization of the passports and there again it was ``yes,'' then ``no.'' Finally Pavlovskiy and I became weary of all this, climbed into an aircraft and flew off to Arzamas-16. And our interests at the conference were represented at the conference by Sergey Petrovich Kapitsa. On his return he stated that our reports were very greatly anticipated there, interest was enormous and our results made a very strong impression on the Americans. There was still another conference in Washington in 1979. We also presented a series of reports there. And again they did not allow us to go and therefore the Americans asked with interest: ``If we come to Russia will we still not be able to meet up with the authors?'' Unfortunately, the answer of our specialists was evasive... And therefore the Americans concluded that ``Pavlovskiy and Chernyshev'' did not exist and therefore when we appeared before them for the first time they were exceedingly surprised. Since 1983 we have already been regularly meeting with our American colleagues and such contacts are enabling us to learn better not only about one another, but also about the essence of that problem which we are solving together. Gubarev: What were your impressions of Los Alamos? Chernyshev: I was there twice. Both centers--Los Alamos and ours--somehow are very similar to one another. There is a special aura which prevails in both places. The strong sense of being cut off from the rest of the world. The very same system of passes and being photographed. And at the same time the creative atmosphere of scientific research. The Americans, the same as ourselves, are inspired in their work, are proud of it... We speak in different languages but our thoughts and actions are similar, very close. And therefore we so easily understand one another. Gubarev: And you did not have the sensation that you were on the different side of a barricade? They made weapons in order to annihilate us and you made weapons to annihilate them? Chernyshev: I think that you yourself can answer this question... It was a pleasure for us to confirm that the team of specialists gathered at Arzamas-16 in no way is inferior to that which worked beyond the ocean. And that we were capable of solving not only the same, but also even more complex problems. The sensation that you work in such a strong institute as ours was pleasant, I won't downplay that! I have been in many scientific institutes and at large scientific centers: in Moscow, at Leningrad, in the Urals and in Siberia, and I have always felt that our institute was for me. Gubarev: I'd like to ask a more direct question: do you not regret that you have spent your entire life working on nuclear weapons? Chernyshev: That was the duty of the times and I had to engage in it. Gubarev: Do you feel that weapons work advanced different branches of physics and thereby facilitated the development of science in general? Chernyshev: To be sure. Work on military projects always is carried out at the level of the latest advances. And without question there also is a payoff for all related fields. But at the same time each of us had the conviction that mankind would find sufficient common sense never to put nuclear weapons to use. Gubarev: You were at the tests? What were your sensations? Chernyshev: Mixed feelings. But one feeling nevertheless predominated. It was necessary that this weapon never be used. That was the principal conclusion. Gubarev: What were your impressions from work with the Americans? Chernyshev: It was important that such contacts be made strictly on an equal basis. If the arrangement is set up in that way everything is taken with understanding and respect. And honesty is necessary: this is possible and impossible. Gubarev: The first experiment was behind you. What then? Chernyshev: The Americans are proposing a program for the next two years. This is research on the physics of magnetized plasma. We are very interested in using American diagnostics, which in some respects is superior to ours. They have better computer resources and because of this--better processing of the results. But at the same they have shortcomings. They, I repeat, are ``loaded down'' with computers and therefore they don't want to think a little without having recourse to them. ``So there is no bad without good''; in this case some advantages appeared for us. The joint program on our theme is definite and clear for the coming years. Gubarev: For example, the "thermonuclear satellite." And what place is occupied by "tokamaks"? Chernyshev: I regularly visited the Atomic Energy Institute. Even at the time when the work was headed by Lev Andreyevich Artsimovich. And even then it seemed to me that this path not only was long, but also very expensive. Even if you bear in mind that our ``boublik'' would be five meters in diameter and with a cross section of about a meter, it can be counted on only as an approximation, an approach to ignition of the "thermonuclear satellite," and in order to obtain it the dimensions must be increased by an order of magnitude -- by a factor of ten! A structure of cyclonic dimensions is obtained. It requires investments of more than one billion dollars. It is impossible for any individual country to realize such a project by itself and therefore different countries are cooperating. The entire approach is based on the prolonged containment of plasma. This is a very long-term and costly program. True, this is a stationary system in which the plasma will burn a long time. To be sure, a great many problems appear which are related to the instabilities of plasma, its thrusting onto walls, cooling, etc. And therefore for those who in their spirit feel closer to pulsed systems an apparatus of such a type has no appeal. Gubarev: What about lasers? Chernyshev: These systems are as complex as the tokamak. There must be careful regulation of each beam. Should an earthquake occur anywhere an adjustment must be made and therefore there is a need for some kind of floating platform, etc. There also other kinds of apparatus which are equally complex and expensive. And each of them requires powerful energy sources and they exceed the power of all electric power plants on the planet by many times... However, the systems which we proposed--I have in mind explosively driven magnetic field generators--make it possible to achieve ignition and even a demonstration experiment far more simply and less expensively. And indeed, before investing billions of dollars in a laser ``thermonuclear satellite,'' in an apparatus with ion beams, it must be understood: suddenly some restrictions show up which we do not suspect today! The results of experiments, as well as calculations, show that explosively driven magnetic field generators are the shortest path to obtaining ignition. Fortunately, many American colleagues also share such a point of view... Once we told of our research, the course of our investigations, to Academicians Khariton, Velikhov and Aleksandrov. They insisted that we continue to work because if success comes it will be equal to the breakthrough into space. That's what they said... They supported us very strongly, but now the events of recent years have exerted an influence on our work and has slowed it down. But a skeleton of specialists for the time being remains and this is very important--all are enthusiastic, they understand that a breakthrough into a fundamentally new field of science and technical progress is possible. This is a noble objective. I think that our mission will be accomplished if we come closer to the long-cherished dream that gives meaning to our life and work.
