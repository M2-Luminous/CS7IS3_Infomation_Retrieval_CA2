To implement a sustainable development strategy, said Gao Guangsheng, official from the State Planning Commission, is to develop the economy on the basis of protecting the ecological environment from deterioration and keeping resources sustainably available. At an international seminar on the environmental protection action plan which closed today, Gao said, the old development model characterized by high input and high consumption is no longer in keeping with reality. Experts at the seminar said that the basic ways of realizing the sustainable development strategy include increasing the efficiency in using resources and energy, waste recycling, and developing new alternative resources. According to the official, China is considering the selection of about 100 priority projects concerning key problems which urgently need to be solved in implementing the strategy, to promote cooperation with international environmental protection organizations. "The first batch of priority projects will be selected by March this year," he said. The official said these projects will be those with a sufficient input of funds. Cooperation is necessary in this field, since seeking development is the common task for all countries in the world, said Zhang Kunmin, deputy director of the National Environmental Protection Agency. "As a developing country, China should use the experience of other countries, especially of developed countries, for reference," Zhang said. He said China has promoted cooperation with Britain, Germany, Denmark and Canada in this field and some projects are in progress or under discussion.
