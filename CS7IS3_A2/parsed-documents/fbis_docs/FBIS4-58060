The meeting considered new developments in Yemen in the wake of the deplorable military incidents which occurred between the 1st Brigade and the 3d Brigade in 'Imran on 27 April. The political bureau pointed out, in light of the information and data available to it, that the battles in 'Imran began with an organized, planned, and premeditated attack by 1st Armored Brigade forces from the 1st Armored Division. The attack was supported by Republican Guard forces, central security troops, and some tribal groups. The 3d Brigade was compelled to respond to the treacherous attack. These deplorable, bloody battles led to heavy material and human losses in all units engaged in the fighting. The victims were innocent soldiers, sons of the one Yemen, men from the same Yemeni Armed Forces. What made the situation more atrocious was the unethical and unpatriotic conduct towards the wounded on the part of the 3d Brigade. The wounded troops were forced into cells and interrogated -- many were tortured while they were still bleeding. These stupid acts affected some members of the military commission, in particular the detention and provocation of our brother Colonel 'Ali Naji Ubayd, a member of the military commission and director of the defense minister's office, who was in 'Imran as part of a military commission that was attempting to calm the situation before it exploded. He, along with his brother members from the military commission, have made tireless and mighty efforts to preserve and secure the Armed Forces and indeed, the entire homeland, against disastrous internecine warfare and destruction. The matter did not end there. The positions of the 1st Brigade were strengthened with new brigades from the Republican Guards and the 1st Division, with the aim of continuing the attack and besieging 3d Brigade positions. At the same time there were intensive troop concentrations and reinforcements sent to confront the Ba Suhayb Brigade, the 1st Artillery Brigade at Yarim, and the 14th Brigade at al-Qama. They were also positioned opposite al-Bayda, Mukayras, Ma'rib and Shabwah. The political bureau linked the events at 'Imran, the concentration of troops, and the new military reinforcements, to events like the incidents at Abyan and Harf Sufyan, the aggression against the Ba Suhayb Brigade in Dhamar, and the threats and assassinations of members of the YSP in the northern governorates. The movements of these party members were monitored and their names written down on lists that were prepared as a prelude to the assassinations. There were attempts to close the headquarters of the party, such as that witnessed in the Governorate of Hajjah. The political bureau also linked this series of military activities to the stupid, hysterical, propagandist, and patched-up media campaigns waged by the media of the General People's Congress and the Yemeni Alliance for Reform, against the YSP and other patriotic parties. These campaigns climaxed in a speech by the chairman of the Presidential Council and the secretary general of the General People's Congress on 27 April. The political bureau said the president's speech was tantamount to a declaration of war. Worse still, it was clear political and media preparation (?to justify) the military attack against the 3d Brigade in 'Imran, which occurred a few hours after the speech. The president's speech blasted all the (?objectives) and concepts [word indistinct] of national consensus, as well as the pledge and accord document. It was characterized fabrications [word indistinct] and abuse against the YSP, the other patriotic parties, and the dialogue commission. The speech also contained repugnant words and expressions which reason cannot countenance as emanating directly from the president. The political bureau stressed that the series of military incidents and the escalation of media and political campaigns were integral components of the same scenario [preceding word in English] and design whose fundamental objective was to abort the pledge and accord document, paralyze national unanimity, and abort the activities of the dialogue commission, the military commission, and the meetings of the Council of Ministers, besides hindering all internal patriotic efforts. These incidents are also intended to hinder Arab and international efforts to tackle the crisis on nationalistic and democratic grounds, and on the grounds created by the pledge and accord document. This design also aims to kill democracy in its cradle, harming national unity and adopting the methods of political annexation [ilhaq] and hegemony, while entrenching autocracy and oligarchy at the expense of the higher interests of the people and the homeland. It also aims to kindle the flames of civil strife, and finally to drive the country towards a destructive and [word indistinct] civil war which will destroy everything, and threaten the homeland's unity and the people's gains and achievements. The YSP began as a unionist party from the inception of its factions in the early 50's, and admirably fought the battles of the national and social struggle for liberation and unity against the rule of the imamate and colonialism. It gave up many martyrs for the cause of the Yemeni revolutions of September and October. It was behind the raising of the banner of unity, and was at the vanguard to achieve unity on 22 May, 1990. It proposed democratic dialogue from the beginning as a fundamental course for the development of Yemen's social political system. The party espoused the slogan of reform, and was the first to call for national dialogue [word indistinct] with the other parties to conclude the pledge and accord document. The party's glorious achievements and great historical record truly outweigh these rabid attempts, which vainly attempt to damage its history and patriotic symbols, and to distort its national and social objectives. The YSP can only stand with the people. It will pursue no other path except that of unity, democracy and national consensus. That was how it lived in the past with the people, that is how it is at the present -- it will not be otherwise in the future. Those who are swimming against the current of the times and who are inclined to think of and return to the past, are the same ones who pride themselves on past struggles and on an honorable and brilliant past. But they are the same ones who [words indistinct] the use of the pistol and terrorism [words indistinct]. They are the same ones who still talk about the interests of the homeland and the people from the very narrow corner of their tribal and (?clannish) interests. The YSP political bureau condemns all military acts of aggression, and calls for stopping this deterioration immediately. It also wishes to confirm the importance of the following essential issues: 1. Stopping the deterioration of the situation and the military build-up, because of the danger this poses to the people and the homeland; releasing the men of the 3d Brigade and stopping reinforcements and the military build-up against the 3d Brigade, the 14th Brigade, and the Ba Suhyab Brigade; (?removing) the military reinforcements confronting al-Bayda, Abyan, Shabwah, and Ma'rib. There should be an immediate investigation into the 'Imran events and other military incidents preceding it. The results of that investigation should be made public. Theos sides which are shown to be linked to increasing tensions and engaging in military incidents should be called to account. There should be a swift end to the clashes between the brigades. 2. Swiftly implementing the pledge and accord document and commencing upon those tasks connected with military security aspects, due to their importance in preventing war. There should be planning and preparation for a secure atmosphere in which to implement the document. The brigades should withdraw all the Armed Forces from the places which used to be called border areas [atraf] and particularly from the governorates of Ta'izz, Laj, Ibb, Abyan, Shabwah, al-Bayda and Ma'rib. Forces should be withdrawn from towns, above all from Sanaa and Aden, and the terrorist camps should be closed down. Military and security forces should be redeployed and (?restationed), in accordance with the stipulations of the pledge and accord document. 3. The dialogue commission should draw up and publish a timetable for implementing every task in the document. The commission should assume responsibility for following up and supervising these efforts. The commission should make public the implementation's outcome at every step. It should publicly condemn any side which behaves in a dilatory manner in the implementation of the document. The dialogue commission ought to fully undertake the role set out for it in the document. The party rejects any attempt to marginalize the role of the dialogue commission. The political bureau calls for the return of the two brothers, Sinan Abu-Luhum and Mujahid Abu-Shawarib, to exercise their tasks in the dialogue commission, as they have a history of patriotism and prominent contribution to the national dialogue within the framework of the dialogue commission. 4. The dialogue commission should be vested with responsibility for supervising the management of the news media, and should be given the right to suspend any media programs or activities which contradict the spirit of the pledge and accord document, or which contribute to deepening the crisis and inciting civil strife. 5. The political bureau calls on all patriotic parties and social organizations, as well as all groups of people such as workers, merchants, peasants, tribesmen and owners of national capital, in addition to intellectuals, religious men, students, and the security and armed forces, to rally their ranks to contribute positively and effectively to preserving the union and democracy, to reject war and internecine fighting, and to demand the implementation of the pledge and accord document. The party supports holding public sit-ins as a peaceful, democratic and cultural approach for expressing the opinion of the masses. It rejects any attempt to sabotage or hire the masses to serve selfish or narrow group interests. Sparking off war should be prevented. The implementation of the consensus of national unanimity will be linked to the effectiveness of the time-honored, patriotic and public accord. 6. The political bureau expresses appreciation for the role of brothers and friends in containing the current crisis and their assistance in tackling it with peace and democracy. The political bureau welcomes the continuation of these efforts to ensure concerted internal and external efforts towards overcoming the crisis, preserving unity and democracy and implementing the pledge and accord document so as to ensure security and stability in Yemen and in the region generally.
