Bakke as leader and Strand Gerhardsen as deputy leader. The leader of the Norwegian Printers Union, Finn Erik Thoresen, was also reelected as deputy leader, but he did not play the same role as the other two at the weekend's national conference in Oslo. Yesterday it was Strand Gerhardsen who inspired the meeting with a speech which was more sober than most of the other "No to the EU" speeches at present. Her main message is that Norway will have "a little more scope" to pursue social democratic policies if we remain outside the EU. She reached few firm conclusions and admitted that she had a great understanding for the "yes" side's argument that we have to join the EU to achieve influence: "This was after all one of the reasons why the labor movement entered the Storting. The problem is simply this: What are we to change and together with whom are we to change it? ``We have after all accepted the foundation of EU cooperation in the form of the Maastricht Treaty. This is something we cannot change. Also, those who are already members of the EU have been involved in getting this foundation adopted. There are many good social democrats in the EU, but I am unable to see that they have enough strength to change anything in particular,'' the SME deputy leader said. She hinted that it would be more difficult to pursue social welfare policies in Norway, in part because we will have to pay billions to the EU in membership contributions. She expressed fears of increased unemployment because she takes the view that the EU does not give the same high priority to the fight for full employment as we have done -- and can do -- here in Norway. She also complained about the lack of democracy in the EU and said that in many respects Norway could be a pioneer if we remain outside. "Then we would have the potential to try new things, and of course to go wrong and make mistakes, but perhaps also to develop new policies which can be the model for policies elsewhere. It would be nice if we once again could be a pioneer, as we in the Nordic area were when it came to welfare policy, and as we in the Nordic area perhaps have been when it comes to women in political life," Strand Gerhardsen said. She was rewarded with a lengthy standing ovation from the delegates at the national conference. In addition to the central executive board there were two representatives from each province. SME does not have the money to arrange larger conferences. [passage omitted]
