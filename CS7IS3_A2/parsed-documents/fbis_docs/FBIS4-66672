The project involves the setting up of 100 million telephone lines in four years. The Ministry of Communications signed the first deal in this context with a German company. Today, the minister of communications signed another agreement with the U.S.-Canadian Northern Telecom. Details in this report by Imad Koutata: [Koutata] On the basis of this agreement, Tunisia will be provided with 360,000 electronic telephone lines that will be distributed in many parts of the country. A network of mobile telephones, known as JSM, will also be set up. This network will include 5,000 lines that will cover the greater Tunis province. The network will be a great help to businessmen and investors in view of the great incentives and encouragements provided for them in the investments code. The agreement also includes a proposal for a partnership between Northern Telecom and Tunisia. The partnership will concern both industrial and commercial fields. The partnership proposal involves the setting up of a center for developing programs used in the telecommunications industry, the revitalization of the manufacture of subscribers' equipment used at telephone exchanges and, finally, the assembly and manufacture of telephone exchanges. The agreement opens wide prospects for an industrial and commercial partnership between the two sides. [passage omitted]
