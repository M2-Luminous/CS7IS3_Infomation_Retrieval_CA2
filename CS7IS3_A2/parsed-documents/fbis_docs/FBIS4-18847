He got into a meeting of the 44-strong liberal grouping, which had, however, written to him asking him to stay away from Strasbourg because of his extremist right-wing nationalist views. Zhirinovskiy's movement calls itself the Russian Liberal Democratic Party and scored a striking success in December's general election. Asked to leave the room, Zhirinovskiy berated the group as "CIA agents afraid to have a democratic debate." He added, "I was not invited here to drink champagne." The liberal MP's walked out. Zhirinovskiy is part of the 18-strong Russian delegation attending the Council of Europe's latest parliamentary assembly. Russia has had "special guest" status since 1990. Assembly speaker Miguel Angel Martinez commented that Zhirinovskiy was "certainly not the most important" member of the Russian team. The Russian MP earlier complained that France had given him a visa confining him to Strasbourg, and said that restriction on his movements was a violation of his rights as a Russian member of parliament.
