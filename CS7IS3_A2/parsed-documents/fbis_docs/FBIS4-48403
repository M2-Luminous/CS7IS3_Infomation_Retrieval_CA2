Minister Mocumbi said that the Mozambican Government knows that these men are armed because they were told this by a Young Pioneer they captured in Zambezia Province. Minister Mocumbi was adamant that his government is not dealing in trivial accusations, but has solid evidence for its claims. [Begin Mocumbi recording] What we are talking about is not rumor. It is a fact that a group of armed people crossed from Malawi to Mozambique. This is not a rumor at all. It is a fact that has been acknowledged by the Malawian authorities. [end recording] The Mozambican Government does not know how many Young Pioneers have crossed the border, but feels that the Malawian Government is in a better position to provide this information. Minister Mocumbi said that there was a possibility that Renamo soldiers, who have been based in Malawi, also crossed into Mozambique at the same time as the Young Pioneers. The Mozambican Government is now considering taking the matter up with Renamo, whom it has accused in the past of sheltering the Young Pioneers. But Minister Mocumbi said the possibility of using force to expel these men was, in his words, an option that was remaining open.
