ATM switching systems represent core equipment for high-speed communications digital networks such as broad-band integrated services digital networks and enable the offering of diversified services such as voice, character and image transmissions and frame relay for high-speed transmission of data. Japan Teleway will seek sophistication of communications networks for responsiveness to multimedia needs in connection with the completion of the nationwide communications network in fiscal year 1994. ATM switching systems to be purchased will comprise several units and will represent an investment of about 1 billion yen. ATM switching systems are made by domestic manufacturers, such as Fujitsu, and have been jointly developed with Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Company (NTT). Executives of Japan Teleway have said, "Our study will consider procurement from overseas communications equipment manufacturers," because NTT is a competitor of Japan Teleway in the high-speed communications arena. Leading sources for such purchases include AT&T of the United States and Northern Telecom of Canada. ATM switching systems are designed to meet multimedia requirements such as the processing of voice, images, and characters on an integrated basis. NTT initiated development work on the systems in 1991, started test operations in 1992, and plans to launch high-speed communications services based on the system in selected areas in 1997. Japan Teleway is the first of the three new telegraph and telephone companies to initiate purchases of ATM switching systems. President Higashi of Japan Teleway assumes, "The future will render operations impractical without ATM switching systems capable of processing images and characters. Even those new telegraph and telephone companies which were behind schedule in installing nationwide communications networks plan to have such systems installed in the two remaining regions of Hokkaido and Shikoku by the end of the fiscal year. Moreover, increased interest in multimedia communications services has been demonstrated by industry which is expected to purchase ATM switching systems. It appears that other new telegraph and telephone companies will also initiate procurement of ATM switching systems.
