This time the procedure concerns foundry pig iron. Relevant bodies of the Czech Foreign Ministry have not yet received any official notification about the procedure. The Czech Republic's permanent mission at the European Union immediately protested against the Commission's one-sided approach, asked for information necessary to discuss specific trade instances, and said that the aim was to find a solution acceptable to both sides. This is only the third instance of anti-dumping procedure against Czech importers since 1991. However, over the last two-months period this is the second instance following accusations levelled against Czech exporters of cement.
