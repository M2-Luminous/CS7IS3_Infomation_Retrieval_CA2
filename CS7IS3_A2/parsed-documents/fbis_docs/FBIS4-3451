Dai Xianglong, vice-governor of the People's Bank of China, noted that in the first quarter of this year, state-owned enterprises recorded a production growth of only two percent, in contrast to 50 percent for township enterprises and 90 percent for foreign-funded ones. According to the State Statistical Bureau, the country's overall economic growth was 12.6 percent for the January-March period. Factors contributing to the slow growth of state-owned enterprises include tightened investment in fixed assets and reduced supply of materials, said Dai, now attending a national conference here in China's largest city. Another factor was that state-owned enterprises which have been transformed into stockholding or joint venture companies ceased to have their production included in the state sector's statistics. The state increased loans for working capital to enterprises. From now on, said Dai, banks will act on a case-to-case basis in extending loans to state-owned enterprises. Priority will be given to those with good economic performance, followed by those in a position to turn red into black in a short time. Enterprises up to the neck in debt and with no hope of recovery will be declared bankrupt, in line with the "bankruptcy law," Dai added.
