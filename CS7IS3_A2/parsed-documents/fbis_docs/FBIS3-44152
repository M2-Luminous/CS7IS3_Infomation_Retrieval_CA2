In the southern suburbs of the Congolese capital, the security situation in strongholds of opposition leader Bernard Kolelas has been on the slide in recent days even though the Army has moved in to try to seal them off, and the American decision has been taken after consultations with the State Department. From Brazzaville, Antoine Mouyambala telexed this report: Around 25 dependents of embassy staff are to be evacuated to the United States. Yesterday, the ambassador left his residence and moved in with one of his staff for the time being. The trouble took place on Friday [21 January] evening when, during a period of four hours, soldiers took up positions on the terrace of a villa next door to the ambassador's residence. Their fire was directed at the opposition stronghold of Bacongo, but several shots went wide and there are signs of some 50 bullets having hit the walls of the ambassador's residence, damaged windows, and broken the windscreen of the ambassador's car. It is now a week since the suburbs of Bacongo and Makelekele, which are under the control of opposition militias, were blockaded by government-supporting security forces. Although the interior minister has given assurances that the barricades are nothing more than routine checkpoints, the people of these areas do not dare walk around nor attempt to leave the areas. Buses and taxis are not serving the two suburbs. The Congolese Red Cross says that thanks to the blockade, it has not been able to carry out humanitarian work in Bacongo and Makelekele. But a member of the opposition in Bacongo told journalists by phone that people in the area were receiving food supplies thanks to transporters bringing supplies from villages in the surrounding region, which is the home area of opposition leader Bernard Kolelas. With both Bacongo and Makelekele being on the edge of Brazzaville, the security forces have been able to seal the suburbs off completely. But the resupply of the two suburbs is also guaranteed by traders on the River Congo between Brazzaville and Kinshasa. Meanwhile, violence continues to afflict other parts of Brazzaville, with acts of pillage and theft taking place every day. A group of people last night broke into the house of a West African trader and snatched 5 million CFA francs, as well as other goods.
