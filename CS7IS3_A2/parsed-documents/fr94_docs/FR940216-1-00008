On page 2578, first column, under section 160.077&hyph;31 Approved Use, paragraph (j)(4) should be designated paragraph (4) and the word ``added'' should read ``amended''. 2. On page 2578, first column, under section 160.077&hyph;31 Size Ranges, paragraph designation (1) should be a lower case (l). §160.077&hyph;23 [Corrected] 3. On page 2585, first column, in §160.077&hyph;23(b)(1)(i), ``§160.077&hyph;3(d)(5)'' should read ``§160.077&hyph;23(d)(5)''. §160.077&hyph;23 [Corrected] 4. On page 2586, first column, in §160.077&hyph;27, paragraph (e)(2), under the heading Hybrid Inflatable Type I, II, or III, in the fourth sentence ``will not'' should read ``may only'' so it reads ``The buoyancy provided by this PFD when not inflated may only float approximately 90 percent of the boating public.''
