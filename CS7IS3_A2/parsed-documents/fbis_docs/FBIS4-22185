Mikhail Kolchev by Vyacheslav Mamontov, place and time not indicated: "Why a Military Trade Union?"] [Text] A lot has been said and written lately about the Independent Trade Union of Service Members (NPSV). Press attention was drawn to it by the scandalous departure of one of the leaders from the organization and his announcement of the self-dissolution of the NPSV. This incident also interested me. Especially since two years ago, as soon as the trade union appeared, I prepared the first article in the military press about it. How then are things going with the public association of service members today? What problems is the NPSV resolving in the field of social protection of the man in shoulder boards? I asked the Chairman of the Central Committee of the NPSV, Captain 3rd Rank (Res.) Mikhail Kolchev to talk about this. [Mamontov] Mikhail Ivanovich, two years ago, in instituting the military trade union, you made a loud statement about independence in its name. From what did you want to be independent? From the Defense Ministry? From the existing system of resolving the social problems of service members? [Kolchev] Indeed, the name of our organization was perceived by many in the literal sense. But we were trying primarily to say to service members that we intended seriously and in a businesslike manner to work at the protection of their professional, socioeconomic, and spiritual rights and interests. And in these things one can hardly succeed by relying solely on oneself. For this reason, we immediately began to establish contacts not only with the state organs, but also with the public associations that have set themselves the task of social protection of service members. We proposed to them that we join forces. The reply was a simple one: "Every man for himself." We came forward with the initiative to create a supervisory council, consisting of the representatives of public organizations of service members, for monitoring the expenditure of the resources received from the sale of written-off military equipment. It was calculated that by selling just one submarine, we could provide housing to all the apartment-less officers in Moscow. But this too turned out to be something no one needed. So we resolve our tasks by our own efforts, naturally without refusing the assistance of interested departments and organizations. In this context, we have established close contacts with the Defense Ministry, the Ministry of Social Protection, the Federal Employment Service, and the Russian Union of Veterans of Afghanistan. [Mamontov] But after all, things did not develop smoothly between you and the Defense Ministry at first. [Kolchev] I won't deny it. Bureaucrats turned up who, upon learning about our existence, tried to put a spike in the wheel. In accordance with the Law on Trade Unions, the ministries and departments are obliged to sign collective contracts for each year with the labor collectives (in the army these are military units). We sent all the constituent and organizational documents in this regard to the Defense Ministry, but they were pigeon-holed. They began to procrastinate, which we saw as an attempt to close the trade union. Military jurists joined the fray and tried to prove the unsoundness of our organization from the legal standpoint. It was hard to guess where it would all end. But we found a quite simple solution. We prepared all of our programs and documents and wangled a reception with the defense minister. After becoming acquainted with our materials, Pavel Sergeyevich supported us. The approaches to resolution of the urgent problems of the army proposed by the trade union were a surprise to him. By all appearances, someone had given him non-objective information about us, which boiled down to [saying] that people had come together in the military trade union to fill their pockets at the army's expense. [Mamontov] How do the rank-and-file members feel about these initiatives of the central committee of the military trade union? [Kolchev] They support us completely. We keep them constantly informed about our work by sending out informational digests to the primary organizations. I have to say that the number of members of the NPSV is growing constantly. Recently "newcomers" have turned up in Kaliningrad, Orel, Voronezh, Liyepaya, St. Petersburg, Kursk, Samara, Nizhniy Novgorod, and Khabarovsk. In order to combine efforts in social protection of service members, we have put forward an initiative for creation of a Federation of Trade Unions of the Power Ministries and Departments, and also put forward proposals to the corresponding authorities regarding the creation of trade unions of the Border Troops, the MB RF [Russian Federation Ministry of Security], the tax police, the customs committee, and the Cossack formations. Now there are already organizational committees formed to hold constituent conferences for these trade unions. [Mamontov] Judging from the available information, the trade union is more known for its construction work. [Kolchev] We are indeed greatly involved in supplying housing to service members. And here we have achieved some results. For example, jointly with the International Migration Commission (MMK) we have devised a program for construction of housing and social adaptation of service members. Its essence lies in the integrated resolution of the housing problem and retraining of officers and warrant officers, discharged to the reserves, for civilian specialties with allowance for the desires and needs of the regions for particular professions. The program also provides for allocation of resources to service members for organization and development of their own affairs. Implementation of the program began with the signing last year of a contract to finance housing construction with the Agency for International Development (AMR), which represents the interests of the U.S. State Department, and a contractor, the Fund for Financial Support of Small enterprises, which is a structural component of the NPSV. After this, an additional contract was signed between the AMR, the MMK and the NPSV for the retraining of discharged service members. The work done in this area by the trade union is unique in its way. You see, for the first time investment funds are being sent directly to the contractors, bypassing the state distribution channels. But we are building housing not only with help from abroad. We are trying to find a construction contractor and a sponsor, and are finding parcels of land and signing contracts. For instance, we were able to reach an agreement with the Murmansk Nickel Combine for payment of construction for housing for officers of the Northern Fleet using their products. We found a company that would buy the nickel and pay the expenses for construction. The result: 20 families of the Northern Fleet members will have well-appointed housing. And the NPSV will receive nothing for itself from this. Naturally we understand that we cannot stick solely to apartment problems. We also have other accomplishments. For instance, in seeking to expand participation of the military in privatization, we went to the government with a proposal to provide state support to the association "Russian Business Center of Reserve Service Members" organized by the NPSV. The association was to assume full responsibility for social adaption of former service members in a number of regions of Russia. A draft order of the RF government was prepared regarding the creation of a network of production enterprises on the basis of the military camps freed up as a result of army reform, with the participation of discharged service members and their family members. Even now we have several such camps to our credit and are beginning work to implement this project. The military trade union has established the "Military Investment Company," which is opening up the prospect of financing our further programs for social and general living arrangements of service members. Besides this, we have now begun implementing the international project "Russian Life" to create a military insurance company of the West European type, and are also working to implement the concept of a non-state pension fund for former service members. [Mamontov] The military trade union is two years old. That is pretty young. It is true that you have a lot of work to do. But surely you didn't undertake this work for the sake of building apartments for discharged military, and creating different kinds of funds? [Kolchev] The problems which we must deal with today naturally do not have to be inherent to the military trade union. Construction of housing, the retraining of discharged service members, these are state tasks. In the future we intend to ensure that they remain so. Through the legislative initiative which the military trade union possesses, in contrast to other public associations, we will defend the professional, socioeconomic, and spiritual rights and interests of service members. You see, now many different documents are appearing which infringe on the rights of the military, do not correspond to the provisions of the Constitution, and violate the generally accepted norms of human rights and freedoms. So we have no end of work ahead of us. And we have already set about doing it. We have prepared and sent to the government documents in which we ask the state to assume the obligation of providing servicemen with housing. But ideally, the work of the trade union must boil down to accomplishment of middleman functions between the Defense Ministry and the persons signing the contract for performance of military service. Here we will have to ensure compliance with the terms of the contract, by providing legal, juridical, and social assistance to service members, and protecting their interests in different conflict situations with their employer. Without interfering in the principle of one-man command. As you see, it is a subtle and complex problem. And we have to be serious about it. For that reason we hope that the service members will support us in every way. After all, only by combining our efforts can we obtain respect for the army and for the military man, and be able to live and do our duty to the Motherland worthily. [Mamontov] Thanks for the talk, and good luck in your work.
