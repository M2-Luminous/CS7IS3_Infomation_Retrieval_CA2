Quotas have not been allocated, however, as the Russian Federal Migration Service has noted. In the words of Vladimir Volokh, deputy director of the service, foreign workers, including Ukrainians, who are presently working in Russia must be "licensed" and appropriately registered. Otherwise they face threat of eviction. When job vacancies arise, priority in filling them now goes to Russian citizens according to the law; next in priority are refugees from the near abroad, then persons who reside permanently in Russia, and lastly--foreign workers. According to the new statute, the dumping of a national labor force is not permitted, i.e., a foreign citizen must receive no less for his labor than what a citizen of Russia would be paid in his position. True, as Vladimir Volokh noted, this international regulation is routinely violated in all countries, especially by small-scale private employers. A foreign worker has the right to receive the same types of medical, cultural, and sports-related services as do his Russian colleagues, as well as the same right to all types of social benefits, including accrued labor tenure by occupational specialty, compensation for injury incurred during the course of labor activity, and so forth. All these provisions apply not only to the worker himself, but to members of his family residing with him as well. However, not a single Ukrainian traveling to Russia to earn money has to date been registered with the Directorate on Labor Migrant Affairs of the Federal Migration Service. The only exception is the rotating work crews that traditionally work at oil production enterprises in Siberia and the Far East. In Tyumen Oblast alone, according to the clearly understated assessment of directorate chief Grigoriy Barabanov, about 150,000 Ukrainians are working at present, and in no way do all of these comprise rotating work crews. In total, the directorate believes, not fewer than 300,000-400,000 Ukrainians are working in Russia, and this number is increasing every day. No one in state organs knows--or, more accurately, they prefer not to know--what kind of discrimination these people are subject to on the job and in everyday life, and how dangerous for Ukrainians--and for Russians as well, incidentally--the chase after the "easy Russian ruble" is becoming, a pursuit that has encompassed the near abroad. The migration service explains that the requirement for mandatory licensing does not apply to foreigners engaged in science or culture who are working at institutions established in Russia by intergovernmental agreement, crew members on ships at sea and river vessels, students undergoing on-the-job training at Russian enterprises, accredited journalists, lecturers, instructors, and certain other categories of citizens.
