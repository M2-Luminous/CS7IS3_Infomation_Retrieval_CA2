Beijing Hints of Aircraft Purchases from Airbus In a move that could have serious implications for the U.S. aviation industry, Beijing has signaled that it is considering using aircraft purchases to further reward France for its recent pledge not to authorize arms sales to Taiwan. In discussing China's tentative plans to buy "more than 40 planes" from the United States and Europe this year in a recent interview with China Daily, Ye Yigan, president of the China Aviation Supplies Corporation, seemed to make a special effort to imply that the French-based European consortium Airbus Industrie may have an edge in competing for those sales when he stated that "normalization" of Sino-French ties will "help" China's business with Airbus (3O January-5 February). Pointing out that competition among "foreign companies" for a share of China's aviation market is "tough," Ye went on to suggest that China may shift more business to the French-based firm, noting that "in the future" Beijing will "further develop and improve" its relations with Airbus. Although it has been less than a month since China and France announced the restoration of bilateral ties, Beijing has already awarded a French firm a lucrative Guangzhou subway contract. The Chinese government had previously diverted business contracts away from French firms to register its displeasure over the French decision of November 1992 to sell Mirage jet fighters to Taiwan.
