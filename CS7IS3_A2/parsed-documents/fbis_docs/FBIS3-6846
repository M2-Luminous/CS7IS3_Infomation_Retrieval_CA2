(NTT) said Tuesday [22 March] it has developed a new thin film for possible use in a magnetic disk with the memory capacity nearly 100 times that of conventional ones. The researchers made the breakthrough by discovering a magnet with a diameter of 8 nanometers (one-billionth of a meter), contained in a cobalt-chrome alloy crystal, they said. Conventional magnetic films are made up from an alloy crystal 60 nanometers in diameter, according to the researchers. The discovery of the new alloy film is expected to pave the way for the production of the increased capacity magnetic disk, the primary storage medium for computers, which they said will be put into practical use in a few years. The current magnetic disk with a diameter of 2.5 inches has a memory capacity the equivalent to 10-day's volume of a major Japanese-language morning newspaper.
