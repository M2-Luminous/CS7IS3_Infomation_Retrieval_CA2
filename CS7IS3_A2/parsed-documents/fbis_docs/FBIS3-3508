Shuai Defu, Shengli's chief geologist, said that the recent sinking of new wells in the Chengdao offshore oil and gas site, China's biggest of its kind, has found over 100 sq [square] km in oil formations, compared with the original area of 40 sq km. And further exploration is needed to establish the actual extent of reserves. In the Linnan oil reservoir, an oil belt of nearly 1,000 sq km has been assured, with an annual capacity of more than 500,000 tons. On the north of the belt, a 2,000-m [meter]-deep deposit has been found. It is considered to be one of the best oil production centers in the region. In the Feiyantan field, the newly-verified reserves last year doubled the initial figure. In addition, the oilfield has also seen expansion after fresh strikes at other oil reservoirs such as Hekou, Bonan and Caoqiao, according to Shuai. Located in the Yellow river delta in east China's Shandong Province, Shengli claims 65 verified fields with several billion tons of oil reserves and gas amounting to tens of billions of cubic meters. Since its maiden year of 1964, Shengli has sunk 53 wells and produced 520 million tons of oil, accounting for one-fifth of the country's total. It has paid over 22 billion yuan in profit taxes to the state, five-fold the government's investment in the field. So far, geologists have developed systems to probe for reservoirs in Shengli's complex geological conditions, impressing counterparts in the U.S. and Japan. Now, armed with upgraded computers and other sophisticated technology for oil exploration, experts are confident about the great potential of the oilfield. Last year, the growth in newly-verified deposits was maintained above the average pace of the past 30 years.
