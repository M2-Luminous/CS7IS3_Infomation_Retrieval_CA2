Several countries, including Chile, could buy up to 20 Mirage-5 type aircraft from Belgium. The planes were modernized recently before being parked in a hangar as a result of the Belgian Armed Forces restructuring plan. Emmanuel Duvivier reports: [Begin recording] [Duvivier] Last September, these Mirage-5 fighters flew over the Bierset region [site of a major Belgian Air Force base] for the last time as a consequence of the cuts implemented by Defense Minister Leo Delcroix. Since then, the planes have been kept at a military field near the border with the Netherlands pending offers by potential buyers, and are beginning to rust. The Charleroi-based SABCA [Belgian Aeronautic Construction Company], which recently modernized the aircraft, has been asked to investigate the international market on behalf of the Belgian state. Preference will be given to potential buyers from democratic countries. The most likely candidates for now are the Philippines and above all Chile. [Delcroix] Chile is a democracy. There is civilian control over its Armed Forces. The president was elected after a real democratic process. Thus, I believe that there is no problem in this respect. [Duvivier] A Chilean Air Force delegation is expected to come to Belgium some time this month and test the aircraft. If the outcome of the preliminary contacts with that country is favorable the national defense budget could be credited with 3 billion Belgian francs by next July. That amount would then be used to help modernize the Belgian Armed Forces. [end recording]
