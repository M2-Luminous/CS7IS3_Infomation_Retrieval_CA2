Border guards at the Birobidzhan detachment, guarding nearly 500 km of waters along the border with the PRC, prevented over 100 border violations in the first week of the operation. About 2 km of floating and fixed gill nets have been confiscated along with hundreds of meters of hooked tackle. Sixteen of the most hardened Chinese poachers were detained. After registration of the incidents of poaching, the culprits were handed to the Chinese authorities. ITAR-TASS was told by Mikhail Naymilo, head of the detachment, that "the Amur these days is practically clean." After an official statement to Chinese border representatives, the Chinese border patrols, the river police, and the fish patrol inspectors stepped up their activities noticeably. Before Operation Cover went ahead, none of these departments even attempted to halt the intensified poaching by their compatriots.
