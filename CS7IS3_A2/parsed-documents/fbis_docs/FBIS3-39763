In a statement to CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation] tonight, Gustave Feissel also said that any concrete progress will become obvious in a few days or a week from the proximity talks, which will resume on Thursday [24 February]. He also noted that the disagreement on the Varosha issue lies in the question of safe access and the time schedule. Concerning the Turkish Cypriot side, Feissel further revealed that it demands assurances that it will obtain the benefits described in the CBM's. On the results of the first two-day [round of proximity talks] Mr. Feissel said that it is premature to describe them as positive or negative. Concerning the notes he is preparing, Mr. Feissel said that their purpose will be to assist the two sides with ideas and views to reach an agreement. He further noted that on some questions there are bigger disagreements than on others, but expressed the hope that these disagreements will be overcome soon. Responding to a question, Mr. Feissel said that the two sides have the will to approach the issues in a reasonable manner. If they do not seek to obtain political benefits from this effort, he added, then we will succeed.
