Decline in World Demand for Arms"] [Text] "In general, there is a perceptible worldwide decline in the demand for weapons, and suppliers seek new contractors in order to protect themselves against having to make production cuts. Even the markets they have ignored before have now become of interest to them," a high-ranking official connected with the Polish arms industry told us. According to him, currently pride of place in the world arms trade goes to the United States, although Britain has recently also increased its sales. Arms purchases have fallen from some $50 billion to approximately $20 billion. Whereas previously the Russians used to earn half of these amounts, at present their share amounts to only about $2 billion. It is hard to explain why Poland is being singled out for attack rather than, for instance, the Czech Republic, which sells as much as we do. Recently that country was visited by General Pinochet, and he certainly would not have been discussing purchases with Jablonex [costume jewelry manufacturers], especially because he visited the Brno military technology fair. Poland used to sell quite a lot of weapons, mainly to the Warsaw Pact countries but also to the Middle East, our interviewee added. Commenting on the reports broadcast by the British television's Channel 4 about the sale of 16 containers of machine guns to Iraq, he said that journalists preparing the program displayed ignorance. All guns have serial numbers, and far too many people would have had to be informed about the export of so many containers. Lucznik makes only submachine guns, not rifles; the latter are manufactured at Cegielski and Tarnow. "Recently an unidentified foreign journalist called us and asked whether it was true that we were making new MIG-21's and selling them to Yugoslavia. Poland has never produced any MIG's, and, as far as MIG-21's are concerned, they are surely only wanted, if they are wanted at all, as museum pieces nowadays," he said, adding that it was impossible to sell weapons to the countries of the former Yugoslavia because of the international controls in force. "Only the neighboring countries would possibly be able to smuggle something in there," he commented. "As far as Iraq is concerned, it is well known that weapons filter in there mainly via the Kurds. Poland had sold tanks to that country, and, consequently, if we were accused of supplying them with spares, that would at least make some sense. Arms sales have to make economic sense, and that is the only criterion," the official insisted. In his opinion, we should be developing our arms industry. "The Hungarians buy from both East and West. This way they cushion themselves against political pressures and exigencies. We could easily be making money from our industry, and that is precisely what many states are unhappy about, because, for instance, out of all of the countries of the former USSR [as published], we are the only one that manufactures helicopters," he added. [Box, p 6] - Polish arms exports have declined by about 85 percent since 1988, and orders from the Polish armed forces have declined disastrously. - Since 1965, the Polish arms industry has produced 11,000 tanks, 6,800 self-propelled howitzers, 1,600 artillery tractors, about 9,000 armored personnel carriers, 6,000 helicopters, and 1.5 million submachine guns, as well as munitions. - Between 1984 and 1991, Poland exported weapons worth $1.8 billion and 7 billion transfer rubles. - Between 1979 and 1989, exports of tanks earned Polish industry $2.5 billion. More than 80 percent of arms were exported to the former USSR.
