While the spotlight was certainly on the defense budget, the main question was -- what can and should be done to add the needed 18 trillion rubles [R] to the budget. Vyacheslav Mozgalev, spokesman for the Ministry of the Economy, put it straight that given the planned defense appropriations (R37 trillion) Russia could have no defense as such as early as by August. That is to say there is also a clear realization in the government quarters (something one could have hardly doubted) that the defense appropriations in the draft law are absolutely inadequate. The Finance Ministry, that eternal opponent of the Defense Ministry, in the shape of its spokesman Andrey Astakhov generally agreed that it is hard to maintain the army with this money. Attempts were made at the session to pry open some "hidden reserves." By hiking the tax on super-profits? It was instantly recognized as being naive because only the lazy do not conceal the real profits of their enterprises today. What about levying a tax on paychecks, not those in publicly financed organizations but those in the "private" sector that exceed one million and more? What else? To levy an additional (defense) tax on commercial banks and, of course, to wring out the greatest possible amount from privatizing state property? All agreed that the planned privatization revenues in the draft budget are absurdly low. Some other suggestions were voiced and accepted for discussion. Still it was obvious to everyone that an increase of the budget deficit through additional state appropriations is inevitable.... The Finance Ministry spokesman tried to accuse the military of slowing reforms, as if suggesting that this is the crux of the matter. This was objected to by First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin and Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the Russian Federation Armed Forces General Staff. They gave facts, too. The general truth that "reforms are costly" was illustrated in particular by the following example. The lack of funds for converting and recycling arms and military equipment makes it necessary to preserve the subunits and units to maintain these arms and equipment. For example, some 1,500 sailors serve on obsolete nuclear submarines of the Northern Fleet. Clearly, you cannot leave a nuclear reactor untended. But this is no longer either armed forces or defense. This is a security threat in a sense. As is the 40,000 tonnes of chemical weapons for whose destruction not a brass copper has been earmarked yet. Or take such a question as discharge of 100,000 officers under the forces reduction plan. This means paying each 20 monthly salaries, discharge money, providing housing.... There is no money for all that, although that is no compensation for the great number of those wishing to accuse the army of lacking reform. Generally, one could hear at the session so many depressing facts and statistics that someone unprepared and of vulnerable mind would be better off not knowing them. Recognizing that it is important to probe at the reasons for why we have ended up in such a fix, Sergey Yushenkov still urged the audience to think about short-term prospects, about what should be done.
