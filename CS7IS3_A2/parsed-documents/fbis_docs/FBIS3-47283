The statement charged that the United States was kicking up a nuclear racket on the pretext of North Korea's "nuclear threat" with a view to justifying its acts of interference against Asia. The Seoul "civilian government", it said, defined North Korea as "a danger" and has brought even the North-South dialogue to a deadlock, still following the methods employed by the former military dictatorial "regime", to continually intensify crackdown on the South Korean people. The statement noted that the South Korean authorities, ignoring the righteous aspirations of South Korean students, have been ruthlessly trampling upon even the elementary human rights of the people and opened the rice market to jeopardize the existence of peasants. It referred to the South Korean authorities' failure to urge Japan to pay compensations for the "comfort women for the Army".
