However, the formation of the cabinet has been substantially delayed, and the unexpected secession of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] from the coalition government has taken place. This was the result of the SDPJ's strong protest over the sudden materialization of the plan to form a large parliamentary group to unify the coalition parties. Thus, the new administration has set sail amid a raging storm. The plan to form a large parliamentary group was proposed repeatedly by Shinseito and Komeito even during the previous administration. This time it was Keigo Ouchi, chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], who made the suggestion. Apparently, the purpose is to form a group around Shinseito and a group which is larger than the biggest ruling party, the SDPJ, to consolidate the power base of the administration. This is also linked to plans to form a new new party [shin shinto]. Shinseito's Ichiro Ozawa will probably be the central figure in the new parliamentary group. This ambush of the SDPJ immediately after the election of the prime minister in the Diet came after the attempted exclusion of the SDPJ to permit some coalition parties to support Michio Watanabe's candidacy for the premiership and after the recent meetings to reach a policy accord. SDPJ Diet members would rather not leave the coalition, and they are also being enticed with the chance to become the "joint candidate of the ruling parties" in the next general election to be held under the single-seat constituency system. Therefore, Ozawa and his associates were very confident about their plan. Added Momentum in the Realignment of the Political World However, even supporters of the coalition in the SDPJ were incensed by the series of arbitrary actions taken. The decision to leave the coalition was a matter of course because the SDPJ had had serious policy differences with the coalition in the first place. The SDPJ is now expected to strengthen its cooperation with Sakigake [Harbinger], which had left the coalition earlier, and the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] is also expected to make its own moves. Thus, the outlook for the realignment of political parties remains volatile. The Hata administration is expected to be Shinseito-led, with the chief cabinet secretary and other key cabinet ministers, in addition to the prime minister, all coming from this party. The new administration faces many difficult policy issues. One urgent issue is to start deliberations on the FY 1994 budget. Solutions acceptable to the people are also needed on the issues of an economic recovery, mending the stalled Japan-U.S. economic relations, and tax reform. Work remains to be done on deregulation, the decentralization of power, information disclosure, and economic and administrative reforms advocated by the previous administration. How to deal with the DPRK (North Korea), with which relations have been shaken by its suspected development of nuclear arms, is also a serious problem. The government has to act cautiously on this issue and avoid creating unnecessarily a sense of crisis. It is indeed difficult to expect strong leadership from Prime Minister Hata, who admits to "acting out the scenario written by Ozawa" and who has always acceded to the bureaucrats' wishes. While he probably intends to exercise political leadership through "Shinseito's domination," the administration is expected to be extremely unstable without the SDPJ's participation. Ozawa and his group's tendency to adopt an arbitrary style and methods is not unrelated to what is happening right now. Hata, a coordinator type of personality, is said to have subtle differences with Ozawa in terms of political style and the concept of the state. He has, however, consistently gone along with Ozawa in the end. This way of dealing with things leaves serious concern when it comes to handling an issue such as the Korean peninsula. Even in Shinseito, which has relatively more experience as a ruling party, there are no elder politicians who have served as prime minister. It is, therefore, difficult to take advantage of such people's profound political and diplomatic experience. As a result, control of the bureaucrats will be weakened. As for the other ruling parties, even the DSP has joined Shinseito's bloc, as if forming an encirclement of the SDPJ. The opposition LDP is also unhelpful. President Yohei Kono is constantly on guard against Shinseito, and many LDP members follow his political line. Thus, the party is unable to come up with a viable rival political line. The present circumstances may possibly trigger further splits in the LDP. The People Need To Keep a Close Watch It goes without saying that only the people can truly check on the political authorities. The citizens should watch and reflect on the words and deeds of each party and faction carefully in preparation for a possible dissolution of the Diet and the ensuing general election. The present political situation resembles the nebulous postwar period, which experienced two coalition governments. The current case may be even more volatile. If the Hata administration is but a transition to a further principled political reorganization, then all the commotion about the new parliamentary group may still be meaningful. The Hosokawa administration which was upholding political reform was pulled down by the prime minister's own money scandal. Hata, who is termed "Mr. Political Reform," should not forget his original convictions. Although laws have been passed on a reform of the political system, there is still a long way to go in the purification of the political sector. If Prime Minister Hata intends to exercise his own style of leadership, he should champion the cause of political reform.
