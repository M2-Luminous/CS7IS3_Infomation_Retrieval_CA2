C. Tsai] [Text] Taipei, April 9 (CNA) -- Taiwan investment in Mainland China is expected to drop as both the government and the private sector reacted strongly to Beijing's callous handling of the Qiandao (Thousand Island) Lake boat disaster. Twenty-four Taiwan tourists, long with six mainland crew members and two guides, were killed in a fire aboard a cruise ship in Qiandao Lake in Zhejiang Province March 31. Most of the bodies were burned beyond recognition. Mainland authorities withheld information on the cause of the disaster and refused to give Taiwan reporters access to the site. They performed autopsies on the bodies without consulting relatives of the victims and restricted the movement of the grieving relatives who rushed to the site after the disaster. In response to the inept handling of the disaster, the Ministry of Economic Affairs announced Saturday [9 April] that the government will not consider at the moment allowing domestic manufacturers to build industrial parks in the mainland. The establishment of industrial complexes on the mainland, requiring a large capital outlay, is of little help to the upgrading of Taiwan's industrial base, said Yin Chi-ming, director general of the ministry's Industrial Development Bureau. Excluding land costs, Yin elaborated, development costs for a 100-hectare industrial zone are estimated at NT$2 billion (US$75.47 million). It is inappropriate for Taiwan investors to make such big investments in Mainland China, where political and economic risks are relatively high, he pointed out. Once the mainland's investment climate improves, the bureau will consider approving industrial zone investment on a case-by-case basis, he added. Meanwhile, the Taipei-based Cross-Strait Business Development Foundation decided to cancel a delegation's scheduled visit to Hainan island in mid-April. The delegation, comprising several legislators and representatives of a dozen listed companies here, originally planned to investigate Hainan's investment environment. The prestigious wealth magazine followed suit, canceling a "securities tour of Mainland China" slated to begin in late April, in protest against Beijing's inhumanity in handling the Qiandao Lake disaster. The small and medium enterprises association issued a statement, lambasting Beijing's neglect of human rights and urging Taiwan investors to avoid the mainland market. Li Cheng-chia, president of the association, said that domestic manufacturers should not invest or increase investments in Mainland China until after Beijing authorities respond to questions posed by the boat disaster. Some domestic enterprises including Rosa Foods Co., Ltd. have shelved their mainland investment projects to condemn Beijing's flagrant violations of human rights.
