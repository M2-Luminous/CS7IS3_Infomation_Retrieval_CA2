Self-employment is based on Decree Law No. 141, which permits the practice of 136 different types of jobs. According to Diaz, more that 70 percent of the people authorized for self-employment fill less than 20 percent of the activities permitted, of which the most common are wagon worker [cochero], carpenter, hair dresser, pushcart worker [carretonero], and manicurist. As you know, Decree Law No. 141 states that the regulations are dictated by two state committees: the State Committee for Labor and Social Security, and the State Committee of Finances. The first grants permission for self-employment and the second deals with collection, since authorized persons must purchase a license. This money is income for the state budget. The State Committee of Finances has announced that the implementation of an overall tax system is being considered, which, if approved, would include people who are self-employed.
