A source at the Follow-Up Committee, which is making arrangements for this meeting, and which comprises several leading national and partisan figures, has informed AL-DUSTUR that the committee's preference is to see the ceremony for signing the document of understanding take place in the Jordanian capital under the auspices of His Majesty King Husayn and the Jordanian people. The source added that since the security situation precludes the holding of such a meeting in Yemen, all parties prefer to see the reconciliation meeting between the Yemeni president and his deputy take place in Amman, given the role His Majesty King Husayn has played to achieve reconciliation, and also due to the balanced Jordanian position toward the Yemeni crisis from the outset. The source indicated that invitations for this ceremony will be extended to some Arab leaders, foremost among which will be Omani Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id, Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, representatives of several foreign countries, and Arab League representatives after coordination is effected between the Yemeni Government and the Jordanian Government. It is clear that the Follow-Up Committee charged with making arrangements for this meeting, which comprises Shaykh Sinan Abu-Luhum, Brigadier General Mujahid Abu-Shawarib, 'Abdallah al-Anisi, Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, Culture Minister Jarallah 'Umar, and Ahmad Jabir 'Afif, has agreed to hold the reconciliation meeting in Jordan in light of the contacts held within the past four days. Given the current security situation, heightened tension, and several complicated circumstances, it has become very clear that it is impossible to hold the reconciliation meeting anywhere in Yemen. In this regard, several senior Yemeni officials said that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih refuses to see the meeting take place in Hadramawt. Similarly, Yemeni Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid is opposed to signing the reconciliation document in Sanaa. Several Yemeni officials said that the security situation and mutual mistrust will prompt any official who will have to attend this meeting to bring with him a large number of guards and escorts to protect him, a number that could exceed 5,000--something which would make it impossible to get the situation under control, and which might consequently cause a security disaster. [passage omitted] It is to be recalled that the Yemeni vice president has welcomed the holding of this meeting in Amman. A senior official of the Yemeni Socialist Party has said: In case it is found to be impossible to hold the reconciliation meeting on Yemeni territory, our first preference is to see it held in Amman. (passage omitted] AL-DUSTUR also learned that France expressed a willingness to host the reconciliation meeting on its territory. However, Yemeni officials said that they prefer to see it held on Arab territory if it is found to be impossible to hold it on Yemeni territory. They added that they prefer to see it held in Amman if an agreement is reached on holding it in an Arab capital.
