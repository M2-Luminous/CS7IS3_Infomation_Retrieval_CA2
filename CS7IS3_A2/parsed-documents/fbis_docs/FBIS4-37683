The party described the accusations leveled at him -- namely that he led a scheme to carry out bombings and assassinations -- as "a fabricated theatrical ploy within the framework of the continued harassment of him." The Ummah Party yesterday distributed a statement which it said was prepared by al-Mahdi before his arrest, concerning the arrest by security authorities of two Ummah Party leaders, namely Professor Hammad Baqadi and 'Abd-al-Rahman Farah. In his statement al-Mahdi said that the basic principle on the basis of which he operates is "civil jihad, and working to achieve democracy in Sudan without bloodshed or foreign intervention." [passage omitted] Al-Sadiq al-Mahdi said in the statement distributed by the Ummah Party yesterday that "security services have on several occasions tried to fabricate accusations against us: They accused us once of working with Libya to achieve certain aims through violence. That was in 1989. Then they leveled accusations at us on more than three occasions: They twice accused us of planning coup attempts, and once they dragged our name into the bombings case heard recently. They also fabricated numerous accusations against us with regard to cases involving violence and bloodshed. These accusations are nothing but fabrications." Al-Mahdi added: "This is why I say once again that the present accusations leveled at some well-known men from our group are nothing but an attempt to distort our reputation and continue the usual fabrications in a bid to create sensational situations and divert attention from the political and economic failures." Concluding, he said: "Once again I say that we are pursuing one line, that is civil jihad, to achieve the homeland's aims. And even if we -- for one reason or another -- decide to pursue another line, it would not be in such a naive manner or in the recklessness clear in the background of the accusations."
