Such efforts would eventually contribute not only to expanding direct foreign investment in this country but also to raising the overall living standards of the Japanese people, according to the fiscal 1994 white paper released by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. The paper said an overhaul of institutional systems that hamper smooth industrial activity in Japan would facilitate an inflow of reasonably priced high-grade foreign products into the country and help reduce production costs and living expenses. The amount of foreign direct investment in Japan has been lower than that of foreign investment in any other major industrial country, the paper said. Rules and regulations serving as barriers to the creation of new businesses need to be eased, corporate research and development activities should be reinforced and capital market regulations should be relaxed for more international financial transactions between Japan and abroad, it said. These measures would smooth the way for industrial restructuring in Japan, helping it attain the chief goals of narrowing a price gap between home and abroad, and curtailing its huge global current account surplus. The global trade structure has been changing rapidly following activation of capital and technology transfers beyond national boundaries which has been traced to the recent surge in international investment, the report said. Growth of services trade, for example, has gathered momentum on commodities trade, with services trade accounting for 30 percent of overall global trade, it said. The white paper described investment as "the fountainhead" of global economic growth. There is a clear correlation between investment and economic growth, it said, noting countries with an average annual investment of over 30 percent as a percentage against their gross domestic product (GDP) scored significantly high economic growth during 1989- 1991. The white paper said investment is also effective in creating employment on a long-term basis, noting east Asian countries other than Japan, which recorded an increase in investment of around 10 percent during the 1980s, saw employment grow 2 to 3 percent while Japan and European countries with lower investment growth scored a gain of only around 1 percent in their jobs markets. The paper also noted South Korea, Taiwan and other newly industrializing economies (NIEs) in Asia achieved remarkably high economic growth after turning net investors in the early 1990s, while industrialization in countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) quickened after their active acceptance of foreign investment. The paper said foreign investment in China, especially on its coastal areas, has been rising sharply, a factor pushing up the country's vibrant economic growth. Vietnam has been emerging as a major destination of investment, reflecting the resumption of Japan's low-interest yen loans in 1992 and the lifting of U.S. trade sanctions against the country earlier this year, the white paper said. It said Japan's mammoth current account surplus has been attributed to a chronic excess of its savings over investment. In 1992, for example, Japan's savings came to 160 trillion yen and its investment 145 trillion yen, leaving a balance of 15 trillion yen which was equal to the current account surplus for the year, the paper said. In the United States, the current account balance has been in the red for years, due to massive net investment in the public sector stemming from the large budget deficit, the paper said. The white paper forecast Japan's savings ratio will fall in the future in line with the rapid aging of the society, a factor expected to push down the black ink in the current account balance. In order for Japan to play a key role in encouraging world investment activity, Japanese companies should conduct their business operations in a manner that would bring about the best interests for global systems of production, distribution and parts procurement, the white paper said. Specifically, the paper said Japanese firms should stop taking advantage of east Asian countries simply as areas to secure a cheap labor force. Japan also should take the initiative in promoting free trade in line with the spirit of the recently concluded Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, the paper said.
