Stazic on a news conference by Milan Djukic, president of the Serb National Party, in Zagreb on 13 April: "The NATO Attack Injured the Dignity of the Serbs!"] [Text] Commenting on the air strikes against the Serb positions around Gorazde, Milan Djukic, president of the Serb National Party [SNS], stated on Wednesday at his party's news conference that "the Serb people, as any other people, have dignity, and there is a limit to how much injury to this dignity can be tolerated." According to Djukic, "with the one-sided air strikes, without any warning," the NATO forces and the United Nations have "injured the dignity of the Serb people." Djukic believes that NATO should have bombed the Muslims too, for the sake of peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Djukic thinks that, because of this action carried out by international mediators in the Bosnia-Herzegovina civil war, the peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina has become more distant, and that a new war is emerging. Djukic claims that the NATO action at Gorazde will make the peace process more difficult and put a strain on the relations of the conflicting sides in the negotiation process. Djukic explained that the international mediators cannot ask the Serbs to join the peace process while bombing them at the same time. By not approving of the air strikes against the Serb positions near Gorazde, and condemning NATO for not having attacked the Muslims too, Djukic threw the ball into the neutral court and added that "the United Nations and NATO are the most responsible for the situation in Gorazde, as they did nothing to really protect the area except declare it a protected area." The SNS officials also discussed the possible continuation, that is, the postponement of the Zagreb negotiations between the local Serbs from the UNPA's [United Nations Protecred Areas] and representatives of the Croatian Government. Namely, they believe that the second stage of negotiations, which has the establishment of economic ties on the agenda, will be much more difficult than the first, as the negotiators will have to tackle political issues, that is, sovereignty. They believe that the negotiations that were supposed to have been held on Tuesday in Zagreb have been postponed because the so-called Krajina is undergoing the process of establishing their government. They also believe that miracles should not be expected in the second stage of negotiations, even supposing it ends successfully, as the critical point will be reached in the third stage, when the subject of negotiations will be the status of the Serbs and the so-called Krajina. According to their estimates, the second stage of negotiations will only be finished in eight months, and they are thus critical of the Croatian politicians who have been promising fast reintegration. The SNS officials repeated their request that representatives of the Serbs from the free territories of the Republic of Croatia also participate at the negotiations.
