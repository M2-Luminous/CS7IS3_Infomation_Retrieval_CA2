FR941025-0-00039 FR941025-0-00010 14 CFR Part 91 [Docket No. 27748; Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) No. 69] RIN 2120&hyph;AF40 Removal of the Prohibition Against Certain Flights Between the United States and Haiti AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule; removal. SUMMARY: This action removes Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) 69, which prohibits the takeoff from, landing in, or overflight of the territory of the United States by an aircraft on a flight to or from the territory of Haiti, and which further prohibits the landing in, takeoff from, or overflight of the territory of the United States by any aircraft on a flight from or to any intermediate destination, if the flight's origin or ultimate destination is Haiti. This action is taken in response to UN Security Council Resolution 944 (1994) directing, inter alia, the termination of the sanctions mandated in U.N. Security Council Resolution 917 (1994), and to the Executive Order issued by the President on October 14, 1994, cancelling sanctions mandated in Executive Order 12914 (May 7, 1994). EFFECTIVE DATE: October 16, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mark W. Bury, International Affairs and Legal Policy Staff, AGC&hyph;7, Office of the Chief Counsel, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20591, Telephone: (202) 267&hyph;3515. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On May 18, 1994, the FAA published at 59 FR 25809 a final rule prohibiting certain aircraft operations between the United States and Haiti. SFAR 69 was issued in response to Executive Order 12914 (May 7, 1994) and UN Security Council Resolution 917 (May 6, 1994) mandating, inter alia, an embargo of most air traffic with Haiti. SFAR 69 prohibits the takeoff from, landing in, or overflight of the territory of the United States by an aircraft on a flight to or from the territory of Haiti. SFAR 69 also prohibits the landing in, takeoff from, or overflight of territory of the United States by any aircraft of a flight from or to any intermediate destination, if the flight's origin or ultimate destination is Haiti. The terms of SFAR 69 provide for exceptions for regularly scheduled foreign air carrier passenger flights and for particular flights approved by the United States Government. On September 19, 1994, U.S. military forces entered Haiti in accordance with September 18, 1994, agreement between the United States and the de facto government of Haiti. The September 18 agreement further required the leaders of the de facto government of Haiti to relinquish power and provided for the lifting of the economic embargo and sanctions imposed in accordance with applicable Security Council Resolutions, including Security Council Resolution 917. Thereafter, the UN Security Council decided in Resolution 944 to terminate the sanctions imposed under Security Council Resolution 917 at 12:01 am on the day after the return to Haiti of President Aristide. In an Executive Order issued on October 14, 1994, the President cancelled sanctions mandated in Executive Order 12914, including the prohibition on certain aircraft operations between the United States and Haiti imposed under SFAR 69.
