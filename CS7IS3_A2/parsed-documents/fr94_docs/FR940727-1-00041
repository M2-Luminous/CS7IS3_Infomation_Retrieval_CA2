FR940727-1-00041 FR940727-1-00014 Second, the Agency is requesting comment on the options proposed in the Universal Waste proposal ยง273.11(b)(2) and ยง273.13(a)(2) (58 FR 8129&hyph;8130) for demonstrating that lamps are not stored for greater than one year. In addition, with respect to tracking of lamp shipments, the Agency is requesting comment on several alternatives. The approach included in today's proposed regulatory text is the same as that included in the universal wastes proposal for batteries (ยง273.12(b) of the universal waste proposal). This approach requires that the manifest system be used (which triggers the use of hazardous waste transporters) for shipments from the last consolidation point to a destination facility, but that no manifests or other records (or hazardous waste transporters) be required for shipments from generators to consolidation points, between consolidation points, or from generators to destination facilities. On the other hand, because a number of comments received on the proposed universal wastes rule disagreed with this approach, the Agency is also requesting comment on two additional approaches. The first alternative, which was suggested in several comments on the universal wastes rule, would be to require that persons initiating and receiving shipments of lamps retain shipping papers documenting the shipments. The minimum data elements required for such records could be specified (e.g., quantity of lamps, date of shipment or receipt, name and address of shipper and receiver). The second alternative would be not to specifically require any specific record keeping for shipments of lamps, but, as with all exemptions, the person claiming the exemption would have to keep documentation to show they qualify (see ยง261.2(f)). The Agency is requesting comment on this second alternative because it is believed that due to the large volumes of lamps, shipments are more likely to be made directly from the generator to a destination facility. Records would be available for such shipments because destination facilities are already required under 40 CFR 264.73(b)(1) or 265.73(b)(1) to maintain records including the description and quantity of each hazardous waste received. It is likely that lamps would be shipped directly from generators to disposal facilities because volumes are likely to be large enough that consolidation will not be necessary to make full truckloads. In addition, the storage space and careful handling required for management of these wastes make consolidation less attractive and shipment directly to the destination facility more likely. A third question on which the Agency requests comment is what management controls would be appropriate to impose on collection of lamps under a special collection system approach. Some of the data included in the docket for this proposal discuss the risks of the types of management likely in lamp collection such as management at the generator's site, transportation, and storage (U.S. EPA, 1993a). Requirements could include packaging that would be required to meet a performance standard of minimizing breakage for unbroken spent lamps. A wide variety of containers would probably satisfy such packaging requirements. EPA expects that packaging in which new replacement lamps are shipped from the manufacturer would frequently be reused to store and transport removed, used lamps. Another option could be to impose a prohibition on intentional breakage of spent lamps by generators. In addition, requirements could be imposed on the storage and transportation of spent lamps that are inadvertently broken, to prevent further mercury emissions. Steel 55-gallon drums or any enclosed container could be used to hold broken lamps for transportation to the disposal site. In summary, the Agency requests comment on whether the exclusion should include requirements to minimize mercury emissions during storage and transportation of spent lamps. Management standards would apply to transporter and consolidation points as well as for generators. The Agency requests comment on management practices for lamps, the risks posed by these practices, and appropriate technical controls to minimize these risks while at the same time not inhibiting collection and proper management. The Agency also requests comment on whether generators or consolidation points should be allowed to intentionally crush lamps to minimize volume for storage or shipment and what, if any, standards should be imposed to protect against mercury releases during crushing or the subsequent management of crushed lamps. The proposed universal waste management system includes a prohibition on treatment (crushing is considered treatment) of lamps at the generator, transporter and consolidation points. A fourth question on which the Agency requests comment is whether to include a 3 to 5 year sunset provision on the universal waste system for lamps. A sunset provision will require EPA to re-evaluate the effectiveness of the universal waste system in addressing the disposal of lamps after 3 to 5 years. The Agency can then decide whether less controls or more controls are needed to maintain the safe management of lamps and whether to extend the inclusion of lamps in the universal waste system. VI. State Authority A. Applicability of Rules in Authorized States Under Section 3006 of RCRA, EPA may authorize qualified States to administer and enforce the RCRA program with the State. (See 40 CFR part 271 for the standards and requirements for authorization.) Following authorization, EPA retains enforcement authority under sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA, although authorized States have primary enforcement responsibility. The standards and requirements for authorization are found at 40 CFR part 271.
