Danzim, deputy secretary of the autonomous regional party committee, chaired the meeting. Chen Hanchang, member of the autonomous regional party committee standing committee and director of the propaganda department, relayed the principal guidelines of the conference. He said: We should firmly grasp the basic guiding principle of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, closely center around the central work of economic construction, subject ourselves to and serve the work of the entire party, comprehensively carry out the tasks on the propaganda and ideological front, and provide a favorable ideological guarantee and public opinion for stepping up the establishment of a socialist market economic system; promoting sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development; safeguarding political stability; and promoting overall social progress. Chen Hanchang said: At the national conference on propaganda and ideological work, General Secretary Jiang Zemin further expounded the major tasks in propaganda and ideological work: The propaganda and ideological front must firmly grasp the basic guiding principle of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and emphatically do a good job in four aspects of work, namely, theory, public opinion, ideological education, and the main theme, which means arming the people with scientific theory, guiding them with correct public opinions, cultivating them with a lofty spirit, and inspiring them with excellent work. The one basic guiding principle and four aspects of work put forward by General Secretary Jiang Zemin serve, respectively, as the soul of the propaganda and ideological front that defines the direction of all work and as four major key projects that embody and carry out the basic guiding principle. Only by so doing can we better accomplish the important missions undertaken by departments in charge of propaganda and ideological work; correctly publicize the party's theories, line, principles, and policies; vividly reflect the great practices of the masses; and unite all the strength that we can muster to strive for attaining the magnificent goal of establishing socialism with Chinese characteristics. Chen Hanchang urged party committees at various levels in Tibet to fully understand the significant importance of the national conference on propaganda and ideological work; earnestly study the guidelines of important speeches delivered at the conference by General Secretary Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, and Director [of the Propaganda Department under the CPC Central Committee] Ding Guangen; fully study, grasp, and implement these guidelines; and regard this as a turning point to boost Tibet's propaganda and ideological work to a new level.

He noted: 1) We should firmly adhere to the basic principles for the work of the entire party and consider the overall situation to completely accomplish the important missions undertaken by the departments in charge of propaganda and ideological work and make contributions to advancing the construction of material and spiritual civilization as well as social progress in Tibet. 2) We should gain a clear understanding of the international and domestic situations and seize the opportunity to step up the pace of reform and development in Tibet. To serve the cause of reform and development, we should continue to carry out propaganda and ideological work by being well aware of public opinion and maintaining the stability and continuity of the keynotes in propaganda. We should seek comprehensiveness, objectivity, and precision and avoid one-sidedness in propaganda. Taking the basic interests of the party and state as our main concern, we should consciously act in unison with the CPC Central Committee in terms of politics. Tibet's tasks in reform and development are more arduous this year. All departments in charge of propaganda and ideological work must keep emancipating their minds, seeking truth from facts, integrating their own characteristics, seriously summing up experiences, studying the law of propaganda, promoting their work with creativity, and vigorously seeking new ideas for propaganda and ideological work under the conditions of a socialist market economy. 3) We should regard the work of maintaining social stability as our duty and support reform with a clear-cut stand. This year is one of crucial importance to the progress of Tibet's reform and construction. Thus, we must fully assess the arduousness and complexity of reform. Whether we can score a victory in the work of deepening reform is a severe test of us. In this new year, comrades on the propaganda and ideological front should subject themselves to the overall situation, serve the central work, correctly guide public opinion, support reform with a clear-cut stand, precisely grasp and publicize the party's principles and policies, correctly address the overall economic situation in a timely manner, and scientifically and conscientiously publicize a series of reform programs, policies, and measures adopted at this year's regional work conference on the economy. They should regard social stability as their duty and address and resolve in a timely manner the ideological problems cropping up in the course of reform. They should carry out the media's supervisory role and help party committees and governments at various levels improve their work, properly handle public feelings, and thaw contradictions to create a favorable milieu and public opinion for deepening reform and smoothly establishing a new socialist market economic system in Tibet. 4) Party committees and governments at various levels must strengthen their leadership in propaganda and ideological work. Propaganda and ideological work plays an important part in the overall efforts for the cause of establishing socialism with Chinese characteristics; it is a political advantage of the CPC and an important magic weapon for ensuring the smooth progress of reform and construction. Party committees and governments at various levels must attach great importance to this work, strengthen their leadership in it, and really take responsibility for the work. Party committees at various levels should place the work of intensifying and improving propaganda and ideological work on the agenda and frequently give guidance and check on the work. Government departments at various levels should attach importance to and support propaganda and ideological work; create necessary conditions for cadres engaged in the work; actively help them resolve practical difficulties; and strive to solve the current problems of scarce personnel, poor quality, bad facilities, and dull work methods on the propaganda and ideological front so as to remarkably improve the conditions for propaganda and ideological work and bring about better results.
