NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA traditionally offers its readers the opportunity to express themselves freely on its pages, especially if there is a suspicion that the other pluralistic domestic press is not pluralistic enough, so that the invective the author holds dear will still be published somewhere. For example, during the first days after the August putsch in 1991 when the communist press was banned, NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA published Mr. Limonov. But there is no need to attach personal letters. Everything is clear without them. Monday on television M. Poltoranin stated: "Journalists use the language (not Russian) which I call `camp Hebrew.' It is the language of lies, Russophobia, and contempt for the people. The journalists do not understand that they are evoking a wave of anti-Semitism in response." So this is the language in which the newspapers are published in Russia. What comment can be made here, how can this be interpreted? Poltoranin could have called the camp language "jargon," "criminal talk," or "perverted Russian." He called the language of journalists "camp Hebrew." Hebrew is the ancient Jewish language. "Russophobia" is a word put into the chauvinistic article by the same name by the magazine NASH SOVREMENNIK. And in order to make sure there were no doubts, Poltoranin added the bit about the "wave of anti-Semitism in response." It was clear that only Semites could cause such a wave. We did not learn anything new about Poltoranin. But this was the first time he was so candid. Like DEN, Pamyat, and Mr. Zhirinovskiy. For the candor--thank you. If M. Poltoranin, the chairman of the State Duma Committee on Mass Media, will allow us, we will teach him some pure Russian. For it was not in vain that he wrote in ROSSISKAYA GAZETA: "The average statistical journalist is an ordinary person who does not always understand the deep processes in the change of formations. He, too, needs guides to the roads of reform." Now I know precisely who our Guide is. And, of course, I want always to understand the deep processes. In the summer of 1950 Comrade Stalin wrote the work of genius "Marxism and Questions of Linguistics." The entire country learned by heart the Discovery that language is neither a base nor a superstructure. So many people who understood poorly went to the camps--may God remember their names! Poltoranin is a continuer of the great cause. He learned, he understood, and he did not forget. By adding to the word Hebrew the adjective "camp," Poltoranin, it seems, was also hinting at our future destination. Deep processes are frequently reflected in folklore. And we, over a bottle, for many decades have sung accompanied by a guitar: Comrade Stalin, you are a great scholar. In linguistics you are simply a luminary. But I am a simple Soviet prisoner-- Not a Communist and not even a Jew. We sing it in chorus--Russians and Jews and Tatars (we have all kinds of journalists). We sing in Russian because they did not teach us Hebrew. We sing and we look at how, shuffling along with a party gait, the solid member of the State Duma goes to the podium. Chairman of the mass media, Russia's Choice, M. Poltoranin. It is difficult to reproach a person for both anti-Semitism and Russophobia at the same time. But I have to say that you rarely hear such malicious Russophobery as comes from that same Poltoranin. On that same television program he stated: "The Russian idea is coming to a head, like a boil." Is it not painful for you to sit down, Mikhail Nikiforovich? P.S. I have no questions for the new procurator general. He already knows (from experience from Stepankov) that it is better not to disturb Poltoranin. Kazannik understands that fanning ethnic dissension at such an altitude--is not even criminality, it is not Article 74 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, but--it is politics! Our native domestic politics. Because for a Western politician such a statement would be tantamount to suicide. The only person to whom (without any special hope, incidentally) one can ask a serious question is Gaydar. Yegor Timurovich, you are the leader of Russia's Choice. Poltoranin is in your ranks. If he says such things and you remain silent--does this mean that you have ripened? You are already a real 100-percent Soviet politician. You could be stamped as such. If there were a free space on you for the stamp.
