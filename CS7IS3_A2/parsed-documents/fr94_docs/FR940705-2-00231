FR940705-2-00231 FR940705-2-00091 Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;i. Protective Clothing (BL3&hyph;P) Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;i&hyph;(1). Disposable clothing (e.g., solid front or wrap-around gowns, scrub suits, or other appropriate clothing) shall be worn in the greenhouse if deemed necessary by the Greenhouse Director because of potential dissemination of the experimental microorganisms. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;i&hyph;(2). Protective clothing shall be removed before exiting the greenhouse and decontaminated prior to laundering or disposal. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;j. Other (BL3&hyph;P) Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;j&hyph;(1). Personnel are required to thoroughly wash their hands upon exiting the greenhouse. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;j&hyph;(2). All procedures shall be performed carefully to minimize the creation of aerosols and excessive splashing of potting material/soil during watering, transplanting, and all experimental manipulations. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2. Facilities (BL3&hyph;P) Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;a. Definitions (BL3&hyph;P) Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;a&hyph;(1). The term ``greenhouse'' refers to a structure with walls, roof, and floor designed and used principally for growing plants in a controlled and protected environment. The walls and roof are usually constructed of transparent or translucent material to allow passage of sunlight for plant growth. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;a&hyph;(2). The term ``greenhouse facility'' includes the actual greenhouse rooms or compartments for growing plants, including all immediately contiguous hallways and head-house areas, and is considered part of the confinement area. The need to maintain negative pressure should be considered when constructing or renovating the greenhouse. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;b. Greenhouse Design (BL3&hyph;P) Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;b&hyph;(1). The greenhouse floor shall be composed of concrete or other impervious material with provision for collection and decontamination of liquid run-off. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;b&hyph;(2). Windows shall be closed and sealed. All glazing shall be resistant to breakage (e.g., double-pane tempered glass or equivalent). Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;b&hyph;(3). The greenhouse shall be a closed self-contained structure with a continuous covering that is separated from areas that are open to unrestricted traffic flow. The minimum requirement for greenhouse entry shall be passage through two sets of self-closing locking doors. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;b&hyph;(4). The greenhouse facility shall be surrounded by a security fence or protected by equivalent security measures. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;b&hyph;(5). Internal walls, ceilings, and floors shall be resistant to penetration by liquids and chemicals to facilitate cleaning and decontamination of the area. All penetrations into these structures and surfaces (e.g., plumbing and utilities) shall be sealed. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;b&hyph;(6). Bench tops and other work surfaces should have seamless surfaces that are impervious to water and resistant to acids, alkalis, organic solvents, and moderate heat. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;b&hyph;(7). The greenhouse contains a foot, elbow, or automatically operated sink, which is located near the exit door for hand washing. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;c. Autoclaves (BL3&hyph;P) Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;c&hyph;(1). An autoclave shall be available for decontaminating materials within the greenhouse facility. A double-door autoclave is recommended (not required) for the decontamination of materials passing out of the greenhouse facility. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;d. Supply and Exhaust Air Ventilation Systems (BL3&hyph;P) Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;d&hyph;(1). An individual supply and exhaust air ventilation system shall be provided. The system maintains pressure differentials and directional airflow, as required, to assure inward (or zero) airflow from areas outside of the greenhouse. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;d&hyph;(2). The exhaust air from the greenhouse facility shall be filtered through high efficiency particulate air-HEPA filters and discharged to the outside. The filter chambers shall be designed to allow in situ decontamination before filters are removed and to facilitate certification testing after they are replaced. Air filters shall be 80&hyph;85% average efficiency by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 52&hyph;68 test method using atmosphere dust. Air supply fans shall be equipped with a back-flow damper that closes when the air supply fan is off. Alternatively, a HEPA filter may be used on the air supply system instead of the filters and damper. The supply and exhaust airflow shall be interlocked to assure inward (or zero) airflow at all times.
