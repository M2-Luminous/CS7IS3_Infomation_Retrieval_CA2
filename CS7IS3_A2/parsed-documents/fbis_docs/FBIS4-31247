They are also called industrial zones, free customs zones, or industrial bases. They are regarded as a way of achieving economic growth that has passed its test, and they are to be established also in Poland. Recently, the government adopted a draft law on S.E.Z.'s. Mr. Minister, when will the idea be actually implemented? [Pol] The government will approve the final version of the draft law in June. Then, it will be submitted to the Sejm and one should expect the parliament to adopt the law in October. Which means we will begin establishing the first S.E.Z.'s by the end of the year. [Nowak] At the stage of working on its concept, why did the Industry and Trade Ministry use the experience of an Irish firm called Development Ireland? [Pol] The choice of the firm was determined by an auction, and also by the fact that the firm succeeded in establishing one of the best functioning S.E.Z.'s in the world, that is the Shannon zone. Among others, highly processed production is concentrated in the zone. [Nowak] The draft law envisages economic preferential treatment for investors, as well as the easing of procedures. What will these entail? [Pol] The most important point will be a tax break when it comes to income tax, which in the West is known as corporate tax. We envisage a complete waiver from the tax for half of the period for which a particular S.E.Z. will be established, while in the other half of the zone's existence, we envisage a 50-percent tax break. What does this mean? If we establish a S.E.Z. for a period of 20 years, then some units--the most attractive ones which we will be most eager to have--will be able to gain a waiver from corporate tax for a period of 10 years, which is really an enormously significant advantage. Apart from that, we envisage breaks on real estate taxes, an accelerated depreciation, as well as a possibility of deducting investment expenditures from costs. And I think the easing of customs and bureaucratic procedures, are also important. We want to have the kind of situation where investors operating in a S.E.Z. would concentrate on the process of producing whatever they want to produce, while the area's manager will be obliged to secure property and all kinds of services for the producers, for instance telecommunications services. We intend to minimize the cost of manufacturing merchandise and services, in order to increase their competitiveness. [Nowak] Who will make decisions on the establishment of the zones? [Pol] Only the government will be authorized to make such decisions. [Nowak] Supposing some territorial authorities are not interested in a particular S.E.Z. because the advantages gained from its establishment will not compensate for the loss of income revenue. What will happen then? [Pol] We will not force anybody to do anything--such is the general rule. But it is true that we are granting waivers, we give up on collecting some taxes, but the state will receive personal income taxes at the same time. And if people work instead of collecting unemployment benefit, then for the state budget, that means revenue instead of expenditures. We also have the VAT tax since production is growing. These are revenue sources and we are basing our concept of S.E.Z.'s on such principles, while also taking into account the need to make the regions more active generally speaking. After conducting a global analysis, one will see that it really pays to have a S.E.Z. in a particular region. [Nowak] Who will represent the State Treasury's interests in such a zone? [Pol] Primarily the industry and trade minister. But I also want to be clear that this does not exclude the finance minister's right to exercise supervision, nor does it exclude the foreign economic cooperation minister's involvement for instance in issues of customs law. [Nowak] Will foreign investors be authorized to conduct economic activity in these S.E.Z.'s, or will it be restricted to companies with foreign capital? [Pol] Anyone will be able to conduct economic activity. We envisage no limitations whatsoever, neither when it comes to the kind of capital, nor regarding its source. We need both big and small investors, both Polish and foreign ones. We also intend to introduce no distinctions when it comes to tax breaks and other procedures. We introduce the same rules for all firms. [Nowak] Could the scale of investment have an impact on the size of tax breaks? [Pol] Yes, but this is not just about the investment scale. The idea of S.E.Z.'s is much more comprehensive than that. Apart from so-called multifaceted zones where we will be particularly eager to see investors with big projects, we will also want to establish zones geared toward some specific fields. In such cases, the size of the investment is not as important as its content [preceding word published in italics], meaning its know-how [preceding two words published in English], the project's technological value, and so forth. Apart from that, there is a need both for someone to produce a product, and also for someone to provide service to the investor in question. [Nowak] Since the size of the capital that was invested, among others, is to determine the size of the breaks granted, what will be the capital's minimum value required? [Pol] We envisage neither an upper nor a lower limit. Investment quality, employment size, and the project's proecological nature, will be of particular importance to us. [Nowak] Conducting economic activity in S.E.Z.'s would also facilitate the establishment of a duty-free area. Is this being taken into account? [Pol] Absolutely yes. It is our ambition to have a duty-free area in each S.E.Z. It is a very important issue. We even want to take things so far--and we will cooperate with the Foreign Economic Cooperation Ministry and with the Main Customs Office on that issue--as to have each S.E.Z. have its own customs office. Along with customs officials, we would like to set up modern customs services procedures to make activity easier, and not to be an obstacle. [Nowak] Foreign investors may be interested in purchasing land or real estate in the area of the S.E.Z.'s. Will they have a right to do so? [Pol] Yes, they will. They can both buy and lease land. We envisage all possible kinds of mechanisms--after all, some like to work on their own property while some others do not, since their involvement is on a short-term basis only. That is why we must be flexible. [Nowak] Waivers for firms having to sell foreign currency acquired from the sale of merchandise and services manufactured in an S.E.Z. to currency banks, could be a strong investment incentive. [Pol] We are trying to get the National Bank of Poland and the Finance Ministry to issue such a currency permit to the firms. But I cannot say at this stage whether we will succeed since this is a strategic issue, linked with the state's financial security. We think our idea could be regarded as an experiment. [Nowak] Will every unit be able to conduct activity in a S.E.Z., or do you perhaps envisage auctions or other types of measures? [Pol] Generally speaking, we regard auctions as an excellent way of selecting the best. In case the auction procedure is not used, the industry and trade minister will determine who will have the right to conduct economic activity. [Nowak] How many such areas are being planned in Poland? [Pol] We do not want to create a multitude of such areas throughout the country. We want to approach the concept with caution in the beginning. We will begin with a pilot zone [strefa pilotazowa], followed--within two to three years--by two or three more, and then we will see how they function in practice and how profitable they are. Depending on the outcome, we will either be opening up the door, or closing it. [Nowak] Does the ministry already have specific ideas as to where exactly it would like to initiate the experiment? [Pol] At this stage, I would rather not mention all the regions being considered by us. I will just speak briefly about Mielec. The town was one of the initiators of the whole concept, and it has fought for its implementation. It is an area of aviation industrial monoculture, with a high unemployment rate but also with a very highly skilled cadre and an excellent infrastructure. After all, there is an airport on the territory of the Mielec Transportation Equipment Plant, on which any aircraft can land, including a Boeing 777. There is also a railway network--both narrow-track and wide-track--so this could for instance be a place for reloading shipments from the Far East (going through the former USSR) to West Europe, and vice versa. There is also hot and cold water, electricity, assembly halls and modern equipment. Planes are manufactured there, and the company cooperates with the Boeing concern by producing aircraft doors for Boeing--that is proof of what the plant is capable of. Mielec's location is also an asset--it is close to the eastern border, and if one wants to take some time off after work, Bieszczady Mountains are just around the corner. Generally speaking, we will first take into account those regions where a big potential has been accumulated but it has not been fully used up to now, for instance the construction site for a nuclear power plant in Zarnowiec. [Nowak] Do foreign investors show an interest in our zones about which there has been much publicity for the second year in a row? [Pol] Yes, they do. Actually, they show a very big interest but I am not authorized to disclose trade secrets. [Nowak] Could you at least tell us what countries these investors represent? [Pol] The largest amount of offers came from the United States, perhaps because so-called industrial parks [parki przemyslowe] are very popular there, and businessmen know that it is simply good business. We also have many proposals from Germany, Italy, France, and also from our domestic capital, which is a particular reason for joy. [Nowak] Mr. Minister, can you tell us what kind of economic activity do they want to conduct? [Pol] They are interested in the production of passenger cars, trucks, and various kinds of building materials which are often very complicated. We have also received offers that take the skills of the Mielec crew into account--this is, among others, the plastic treatment of metals.
