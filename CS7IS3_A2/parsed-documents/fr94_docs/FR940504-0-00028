FR940504-0-00028 FR940504-0-00009 5. Architectural Aluminum Coating-Rule 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09 (U)(1)(a)(viii) A. Proposed Action The VOC requirement in this paragraph establishes a limitation of 6.2 lbs VOC/gallon of coating excluding water for high performance architectural aluminum coatings. OEPA considers this limitation to constitute RACT. This relaxation is supported by a September 6, 1985, letter from Reynolds Aluminum, to OEPA. This letter states that ``We have been unable to convert our High Performance Architectural Aluminum Coatings to a low solvent formulation.'' Reynolds attached a December 6, 1984, letter from PPG which states that its efforts to develop compliant coatings for the architectural and recreational vehicle markets have been unsuccessful. USEPA proposed to disapprove this relaxation because OEPA has neither documented the infeasibility of add-on control nor the potential use of powder coatings. Three of these suppliers, Armstrong Products, Fuller O'Brien, and Polymer Corporation, expect their coatings to pass the 5 year exposure test. Some of these are currently in the third or fourth year of their 5-year testing period. Therefore, a permanent relaxation for high performance architectural aluminum coatings is not approvable. B. Comments OEPA's July 31, 1989 Comment: The USEPA purported availability of compliant coatings for high performance architectural aluminum coatings at 3.5 lbs VOC per gallon from Armstrong Products, Fuller O'Brien, and Polymer Corporation should be documented in the docket. If a permanent relaxation is not appropriate, does USEPA recommend a relaxation for a specific year (e.g., up to 1989 or 1990)? USEPA Response: Documentation of USEPA's conversations with powder coating suppliers is in the Docket. The CTGs and Ohio SIP establish the presumptive RACT for this source category. Ohio's comments provide no support for its proposed relaxation. USEPA is only able to take actions on proposed SIP revisions that are submitted to it. USEPA will evaluate the merits of a compliance date extension if submitted and supported by OEPA. Therefore, USEPA is disapproving this relaxation. Final Action OEPA had proposed a number of revisions to its RACT I, RACT II, and general VOC rules. These are contained in OAC Chapter 3745&hyph;21&hyph;01, Definitions; OAC Chapter 3745&hyph;21&hyph;04, Compliance and Schedules; OAC Chapter 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09, Emission Limits; and OAC Chapter 3745&hyph;21&hyph;10, Test Methods. A listing and short description of all of these revisions are in USEPA's technical support documents, dated July 14, 1986, September 23, 1986, and July 27, 1988. Many of these revisions are minor. Ohio submitted these regulations in 1986 in order to meet the RACT requirement of the pre-amended Act and USEPA reviewed this submittal against the general RACT requirement of the preamended Act, 1977 Act ยง172.54 FR 22915 (May 30, 1989). Since USEPA did not issue a SIP call with respect to the elements of this submittal, these revisions are not required under the section 182(a)(2)(A) RACT fix-up requirement of the Act. However, amended section 172 retains a general requirement that States must adopt RACT for nonattainment areas. Therefore, USEPA is taking final partial approval action as proposed under Section 110 and Part D of the Amended Act, with the exception of the following: 1. USEPA is disapproving the proposed relaxation for food can end sealing compounds in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09(D)(1)(e) (from 3.7 to 4.4 lbs VOC/gal). 2. USEPA is disapproving the proposed revision to the exemption, as well as the entire exemption in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09(N)(3)(e) for the application by hand of any cutback asphalt or emulsified asphalt for patching or crack sealing. In addition, USEPA is disapproving the recordkeeping requirements in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09(N)(4) because they are inadequate with respect to the time period during which records are required. 3. USEPA is disapproving the relaxation (from 3.5 to 6.2 lbs VOC/gal) for high performance architectural aluminum coatings in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09 (U)(1)(a)(viii). 4. In the proposed rulemaking for this revision published at 54 FR 22915 (May 30, 1989), USEPA proposed to take no action on the exemption for new sources in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09(U)(2)(f). USEPA believes that the Amended Clean Air Act affects this element and will repropose action on it consistent with the amended Act in a separate Federal Register document. 5. In the May 30, 1989, proposed rulemaking for this revision, USEPA proposed to disapprove the relaxation for miscellaneous metals in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09 (U)(1)(a)(vii). This requested rule relaxation will be reproposed in a separate Federal Register notice because the relevant policy has changed with the Amended Act. As stated earlier, Ohio's April 9, 1986, State submittal included new VOC regulations for additional RACT III source categories not specifically covered by Ohio's existing rules and a site-specific revision for the Huffy Corporation. This Federal Register document does not address these other elements of the April 9, 1986, submittal. This notice also does not address those amendments to the ozone SIP that were previously submitted on March 28, 1983, to USEPA and for which final rulemaking was taken on January 18, 1989 (54 FR 1934). Under Executive Order 12866, this action is not significant. It has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by July 5, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (see section 307(b)(2)).
