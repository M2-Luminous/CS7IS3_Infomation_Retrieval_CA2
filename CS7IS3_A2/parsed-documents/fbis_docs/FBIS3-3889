Abraham Roodt, deputy head of the South African mission at the GATT headquarters, made the statement while meeting with a Taiwan delegation for tariff-reduction talks under the GATT framework. During the talks, Roodt asked Taiwan to cut tariff rates on 22 agricultural and 126 industrial products in accordance with GATT requirements. Roodt complained that South Africa has been unable to raise agricultural exports to Taiwan because Taiwan maintains quota and area restrictions on farm imports. "We hope Taiwan can raise annual import quota for our apples and allow our grapes and grapefruit to enter its market," Roodt said. Taiwan currently allows annual importation of 500 tons of South African apples. In response, Huang Yen-chao, head of the Taiwan delegation, said Taiwan has decided to remove quota and area restrictions on farm imports after it gains GATT membership. "We'll instead regulate farm imports with a tariff system," said Huang, also director- general of the Board of Foreign Trade. This was the first round of Taiwan-South African tariff talks in connection with Taiwan's bid to join the Geneva-based world trade regulatory body. As the two countries have maintained close relations, Huang said, the talks proceeded under a "friendly, pleasant" atmosphere. The two sides will hold further discussions later this year. Earlier in the day, the Taiwan delegation also held tariff- reduction talks with its Hungarian counterpart. Hungary was the second country that expressed the intention to hold bilateral tariff-reduction talks with Taiwan after the United States. The Hungarian mission, headed by Aniko Ivanka, a senior secretary in charge of economic affairs at the Hungarian GATT office, asked Taiwan to cut tariff rates on 28 agricultural and 34 industrial products, including auto parts, engines, meat and dairy products. Huang told hungarian delegates that large quantities of Hungarian auto parts have entered Taiwan, indicating that Taiwan has not discriminated against Hungarian products. The two sides agreed to meet again later this year to further discuss tariff and non-tariff problems. They also agreed to promote bilateral trade and economic cooperation. The Taiwan delegation arrived in Geneva Sunday for tariff- reduction talks with six countries, including Hungary, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil and Turkey. Taiwan was admitted as a GATT observer in September 1992 and is expected to become a full member by the end of this year.
