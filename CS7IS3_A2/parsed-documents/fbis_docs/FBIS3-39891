Every election and almost every opinion poll showed low ratings for the Social Democratic Party [SPD] and the Christian Democratic Union [CDU], while right-wing extremist groups, the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS], and other protest parties won remarkable successes in land and municipal elections. To many people it seemed certain that an increasing number of voters would turn away from the big parties in the Bundestag elections. With the German tendency to feel terror in anticipation of possible events, memories of the Weimar Republic were evoked. In this process, most people did not realize that the weakening of the popular parties is by no means a law of nature. There are two settings that decrease popularity of the small parties and concentrate voters' attention on the big parties. If a problem affecting national fate is to be decided in elections and if the two popular parties take clearly defined oppositional views on it (this was the case in 1990 when the CDU/Christian Social Union's [CSU] unrestricted commitment for unification stood against the SPD's tendency to slow down the process), then a polarization between the two popular parties in a question that deeply concerns the nation strengthens these parties and decreases interest in new groups. The second setting is competition between two big parties, a situation, where voters consider a change in power possible, but by no means certain. This is the case today. It is, therefore, hardly surprising that the trend toward small parties and protest groups has been stopped for the time being. Over the past few weeks, the CDU/CSU and the SPD have gained support, while all other parties have lost potential voters. In December, 8.4 percent of those polled wanted to give their second vote in the Bundestag elections to the Free Democratic Party [FDP]. By the end of January, only 7.7 percent intended to do so. The share of those who wanted to vote for Alliance 90/Greens sank from 10.2 to 9 percent; support for the PDS went down from 5.3 to 3.4 percent. Support for the Republikaner has declined by almost 50 percent, from 4.6 to 2.7 percent, the lowest figure since January 1992. In contrast to that, the SPD has gained just under 4 percent, the CDU/CSU 2 percent. For the first time since 1991, the SPD is supported by more than 40 percent of the population. Together, the two popular parties currently achieve 76 percent, distinctly more than the 1993 average, which was 69 percent. Parallel to growing support for the two popular parties, the conviction is increasing that one of them will reach a majority capable of forming a government, together with a small coalition partner. Only 26 percent of those polled expect a grand coalition, while 47 percent consider such an alliance unlikely. The strong fluctuations in party preferences and the great number of undecided voters show that the outcome of the elections is completely open. At the moment, the SPD is in the lead. Its candidate, Scharping, gets more support from the voters than Chancellor Kohl. But when Rau and Lafontaine ran against Kohl, the starting position was the same. Just how unstable the preference for a particular candidate is, can be seen from the answers to the question in whom those polled would put the most confidence in case of a foreign policy crisis: If the situation in Russia gets more critical and this threatens Germany, the population favors Helmut Kohl as chancellor at a proportion of two to one.
