Box 2563, Birmingham, Alabama 35202, filed an amendment to its original application for certificate of public convenience and necessity filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;682&hyph;000. In its original application in Docket No. CP94&hyph;682&hyph;000, Applicant had requested authorization to construct, install and operate approximately 21 miles of 12-inch pipeline and the necessary measurement facilities to connect Applicant's system at or near mile post 101.44 on its Chattanooga Branch Line in Catoosa County, Georgia, with the facilities of East Tennessee Natural Gas Company in Bradley County, Tennessee. The total cost of the facilities was estimated to be $6,951,000. The facilities were proposed to serve 11 municipal and distribution customers (Customers) in Eastern Tennessee with firm transportation under Applicant's Rate Schedule FT. Specifically, Applicant states that because of the execution of service agreements for firm transportation by several of its existing customers, Applicant has determined that it requires additional compression on its North Main Lines to provide the full firm subscription requested by the Customers of 11,350 Mcf per day. Accordingly, Applicant requests in the amendment authorization to construct, install and operate an additional turbine compressor engine of 1,452 horsepower isometrically rated at 59 degrees fahrenheit at its existing McConnells Compressor Station (McConnells) located in Tuscaloosa County, Alabama. In addition, Applicant plans to modify the compressor wheel assemblies of the two existing 1,360 horsepower turbine compressor engines at McConnells. The total horsepower at McConnells upon installation of the proposed turbine engine would be 6,872. The cost of the installation and rewheeling of the compressors is estimated to be $2,128,000. Applicant requests authorization from the Commission by May 1, 1995, or sooner, to construct and install the compression and pipeline facilities because of the long lead time required for the purchasing, construction and permitting of the facilities. In addition to supporting the full firm service subscription to the Customers, Applicant states the compression facilities proposed in the amendment will enable it to provide firm service to the City of Austell, Georgia (Austell) pursuant to a transportation request made by Austell on July 15, 1994. Austell and Applicant have executed a Service Agreement for service under Applicant's Rate Schedule FT for 2,500 Mcf per day for a term of ten years. Applicant states Austell had the next position in its transportation queue after the Customers. Applicant has submitted a revised statement of revenues and cost of service with the amendment reflecting the cost of the additional facilities and the additional firm subscription of Austell. Applicant represents such statement demonstrates that the project remains a benefit to its system. Comment date: December 8, 1994, in accordance with the first paragraph of Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.
