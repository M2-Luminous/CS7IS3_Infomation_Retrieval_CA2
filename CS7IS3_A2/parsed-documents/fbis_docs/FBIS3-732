They also expressed the need to further enhance such cooperation for the benefit of the two countries. In a joint communique issued at the end of President Mugabe's four-day state visit to Botswana, the two presidents called for more efforts to be put in exploring other areas of cooperation, in particular the tourism sector. They also resolved to undertake measures, including the increase of border posts to facilitate legal and unhindered movement across the common border, and to make joint border patrols to curb illegal border crossings and cattle rustling. The communique says President Mugabe has expressed Zimbabwe's appreciation for the generous gesture by Botswana in giving that country a part of her quota of beef exports to the European Community for 1993. The heads of state commended the mediation efforts in the now subsided conflict in Lesotho by the international community, including Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe. On South Africa Sir Ketumile and Mr. Mugabe welcomed the positive steps by Inkatha Freedom Party Leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi to register provisionally for the forthcoming South African elections scheduled for next month. They expressed hope that the rightwing parties will also join the negotiation process and participate in the forthcoming elections. The communique says the two presidents called for national reconciliation and appealed to the international community for humanitarian assistance for the Angolan people. On the situation in Somalia the two presidents noted with concern the decision by Western governments to withdraw their troops from Somalia, observing that the international community has an obligation to help the Somali people while conflict remained unresolved. They also discussed the conflict in Sudan, Liberia, and Bosnia-Hercegovina and the suffering inflicted on the people.
