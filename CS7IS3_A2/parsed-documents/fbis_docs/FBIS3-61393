The first such showing took place on February 8, the day Sildm�ae took his oath of office before Riigikogu [Estonia's parliament]. "The award of `Entrepreneur's Friend' was obviously given to me in recognition of my attitude toward entrepreneurs, that is different from that of life-long bureaucrats of earlier times," said Sildm�ae the night before yesterday, after the EVEA [Estonian Small Business Association] representatives had been to the Economic Ministry to present the minister with the pin and the certificate confirming the title. Sildm�ae is convinced that, considering Estonia's size and its geographic location, the future of our economy can only be in small and medium-size business enterprises. He has had a considerable share in the creation of the Credit Fund for Businesses with Small and Medium-Sized Capital Requirements, the utility of which has repeatedly been questioned by the prime minister as well as other members of the government. In the opinion of many of the European Community experts, lending money at a lower interest rate from Estonia's own commercial banks amounts to state subsidy. An Estonian Entrepreneur Is Relatively Honest Sildm�ae is satisfied with the new income tax law that establishes a uniform 26-percent tax rate for natural persons as well as legal entities. "Collecting income tax is dialogue between the entrepreneur and the tax collector. The objective of the new law was to find an optimal level at which there is no point to lie or to hide," Sildm�ae says and rates the Estonian entrepreneur as a relatively honest being who no longer has to hide his profits. Estonians are relatively honest, especially when compared to their Eastern neighbors. In the Western business world of developed countries which Sildm�ae, for lack of a fitting term in Estonian, called the business community, unwritten rules prevail. "If you cheat once, you will simply be left outside of that circle." Privatize Everything But the Nuclear Plant "The privatization process is slow and one could speculate that, following the present policy, it would take about two-to-three years to privatize perhaps 80 percent of the state-owned enterprises. The rest will take at least 10 years, says Sildm�ae, who is also a member of the Privatization Agency's administrative council, and supports the position that everything that could be done using private capital, should be done using private capital. There are currently 380 state enterprises within the administrative scope of the Economic Ministry. Some of them have been partially privatized, others are in the process of being sold. In Sildm�ae's opinion, companies that produce and sell energy cannot be privatized in the near future. For the time being some strategic areas like the railroad, for example, should also remain the property of the state. "Once the economy evolves, a business culture will emerge and give substance to the word 'agreement' that, in the rest of the world, is acceptable not only in writing but also verbally, and onecan start building on that. There are money-printing facilities in the world that are based on private capital. If there was a nuclear power plant in Estonia, maybe that should not be privatized," Sildm�ae says. Investment Climate Free of Risk Over the past few years, Estonia has made its way on the map of the world. A big job has already been done in the Scandinavian countries and in Europe, and Sildm�ae is out to conquer new regions. Along with Prime Minister Mart Laar, he visited Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan. Along with President Lennart Meri, he went to Kuweit, Turkey, Jordan and, only recently, returned from Marocco. "This is how agreements are developed for economic cooperation, protection against mutual double tariffs, and for protecting investments. These, in turn, make possible the development of enterprise based on private initiative," says Sildm�ae who, up until now, has put his signature on only one international agreement that regulates foreign trade relations between Estonia and Austria. He thinks that, compared to the rest of Eastern Europe, Estonia's situation is very promising, and that we have managed to convince foreign investors of the relatively risk-free nature of our investment climate. During the year now ending, foreign investments made in Estonia have been larger than those made in Latvia, Lithuania and Belarus combined. This success can be attributed largely to several laws passed by Riigikogu lately, such as the right-to-own law, along with its implementation. Approaches of Ministries Differ The Economic Ministry headed by Sildm�ae coordinates the preparation of quite a number of laws. Mentioned, among these, should not only be the national law to support private enterprise, the regional policy law, and the preferred regions law, but also the law dealing with the city of Paldiski, and the three laws that are closely linked to the decree signed by Sildm�ae in June of this year, dealing with restrictions on advertising for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products. These are laws on advertising, tobacco and alcohol. This summer's decree is not going to take effect with the new year, as planned, because everything is held up by the consumer protection law. "The Economic Ministry's approach to legislation differs from that of the Ministry of Justice, which wants to create volumes of legislation that would cover the entire field of commercial law. This, however, would take a long time and, since life cannot be put on hold, we better get the necessary laws ready one by one," says Sildm�ae, not willing to wait until Estonia gets smart enough to compile such large volumes of laws that have taken other states decades, or even centuries to assemble. Sildm�ae's impatience is understandable considering that, in order to insure rapid development of Estonia's economy, he is expecting investments in the range of $100 to $200 million a year to be made in Estonia. "This year's 1 billion Estonian kroons is not enough. Looking at downtown Tallinn can be deceptive. The cellulose plant alone, which Estonia really needs, requires investments to the tune of 500 million DEM. The areas calling for large investments in Estonia are many, like our energy production, for one," says Sildm�ae, as he tries to find reasons why production should go outside of Tallinn: "When you look at Estonia on the world map, and talk about the investment climate, one can see it has become suitable. The same is happening inside Estonia. The climate is suitable in Tallinn and the Harjumaa district. It gets worse going North-East, and worse yet going South-East." It was for the express purpose of enhancing regional development that the Innovation Fund and the Estonian Export Credit Fund were created at the Economic Ministry, in addition to the credit fund for small business. Sildm�ae does not believe that any production facilities requiring investment could be financed by Estonia's commercial banks at the current borrowing rates. This type of credit could only work for something with rapid turnover, like sales. Altruistic Creative Potential Besides entrepreneurs, Sildm�ae wants to support the formation of all possible clubs, cooperatives and associations, because he sees them as a valuable source of creative potential. "When we started out at the ministry a year ago, our credo was that we are not the smartest," Sildm�ae says, describing the style he and his team had. "Our success hinges on being able to connect the all the sides of the quadrangle: Civil servants, entrepreneurs, scientists and foreign consultants." The fact that the economic minister is a man of action, was proven by Sildm�ae in August when he, along with some kindred spirits, formed the Taxpayers' Alliance, which he also calls G-13. "The Taxpayers' Alliance is a completely apolitical organization, the members of which simply get together over a cup of coffee, to discuss the processes taking place in Estonia's society, and to find solutions to the problems facing us. To stay in shape, one has to keep evolving. G-13 was one such opportunity. Its members come from different walks of life, representing different ambitions, and different political views," Sildm�ae says. He characterizes the launching of this highly controversial organization as a blue-eyed, if not altruistic attempt to show that there is a non-partisan force, springing from economic realities. Sildm�ae's Job Is Done When he took office in February, Sildm�ae said that he had agreed on a term of up to one year with Prime Minister Laar. That year will be up on February 5. In the meantime, the economic minister, as a person, has caused so much controversy in government circles that the media has come up with a slogan "Sildm�ae home for Christmas." "I have also been a civil servant prior to my previous life and have promised that I will never enter state service again. After my January talks with Messrs. Kannik, Luik and Laar, I made a different decision knowing full well that it will bring me both profit and loss. I thought it would be possible, in about a year, to build up a ministry that would be viable and could work out an economic strategy for Estonia. Today, this job is done," says Sildm�ae who has consolidated four ministries under one roof, and reduced the number of his subordinates from 270 to 150. "By motivating people, and by giving them a chance for self-actualization, we can get by with a smaller number of employees. People just roll up their sleeves and get to work," Sildm�ae says. He has held out until Christmas, and soon we'll see how it goes with the year that was promised. On January 10, Sildm�ae will appear before Riigikogu to respond to the inquiry initiated by the Isamaa faction regarding the economic minister's participation in business ventures. "Actually, I have already responded to this inquiry before I took office. For the duration of my term as minister, I have turned over my stock portfolio to a lawyer, who will also get all the earnings from them," says Sildm�ae who, besides his interest in the Finest Hotel Group (10 percent), and AS Rebaco (that controls the Hanseatic Bank), has a relatively less known block of shares in AS Tomut, a design and construction firm registered in Tartu. It is of utmost importance to Sildm�ae that, after his departure, the ministry retain the same general atmosphere, and that the new minister be an expert, and not a politician. He is apparently returning to his former position as director of the Finest Hotel Group. This could also be deduced from the fact that Andres Eesmaa, who is heading the hotel company currently, is still using the title of acting director, and has not been appointed to head the company officially.
