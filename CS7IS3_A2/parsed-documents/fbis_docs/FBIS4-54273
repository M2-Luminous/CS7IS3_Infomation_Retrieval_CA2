FBIS4-54273 "dreas103__a94006" FBIS-EAS-94-103-A Daily Report 25 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Foreign Embassies Briefed on Atomic Energy Policy Foreign Embassies Briefed on Atomic Energy Policy OW2505144394 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 25 May 94 Morning Edition p 3 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2505144394 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] It was learned on 24 May that the Science and Technology and the Foreign Ministry held a briefing for foreign embassies on the outline revision of the nation's long-term plan for atomic energy development. The briefing was held following requests from several countries, and it was first time the government has attempted to explain a policy review before formal approval. The responses of the foreign officials indicated their deep interest in Japan's plutonium policy, particularly the light of the controversy surrounding the DPRK's (North Korea's) nuclear policy. The 20 May briefing was intended for science and technology specialists at foreign embassies. Officials were sent from the embassies of 11 countries, including energy-advanced nations such as the United States, the UK, France, and Germany, as well as Pacific nations such as Thailand, Indonesia, and Australia. Officials of the Science and Technology Agency and the Foreign Ministry received those foreign officials, and explained the future direction of Japan's plutonium policy. During the 90-minute briefing, Japanese officials passed out booklets of the draft plan written both in Japanese and English, and received questions from foreign officials after a lecture. One of the attendants said they severely questioned Japanese officials "why Japan is so eager about development of fast breeder reactors," and "if construction of No.2 plutonium processing plant was postponed in view of the demand-supply balance of plutonium." Some of them reportedly requested Japan to explain its plutonium policy in their homelands since "our homeland is keenly interested in the issue." The long-term plan on atomic energy development has never made public before formal approval by the government. However, the Atomic Energy Commission, the composer of the long-term plan, disclosed a draft plan on 18 May to secure the openness of Japan's energy policies in view of domestic and international criticism of Japan's policy on plutonium use. In response, the Science and Technology Agency and the Foreign Ministry received more than a dozen inquiries from foreign embassies in Tokyo. The Science and Technology Agency said: "We decided to hold the briefing to help them understand the Japanese Government's policy to make clear its plutonium policy." Commenting on this, the Foreign Ministry said: "More than 50 countries expressed their strong interest in the shipment of plutonium to Japan last year. Japan cannot promote the use of plutonium without the understanding of the international community."
