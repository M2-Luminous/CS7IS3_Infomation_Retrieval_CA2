Some people have already nicknamed this mysterious and top-secret aircraft the "Russian miracle." "No, it is not a `miracle,'" Mikhail Simonov, general designer for the Sukhoy Experimental Design Bureau and project leader, told us, "but the Su-34 series-produced front-line bomber, created in our firm. Its chief designer in the design bureau is Rollan Martirosov, and in the plant -- Oleg Sobolev." The Su-34 is designed to repulse an attack on Russian territory and is to replace in the combat ranks the Su-24 and Su-24M front-line bombers which have been flying for almost 20 years and to resolve certain other tasks. The fourth-generation bomber has all the potential for doing this. It has a practically unlimited flight range. Without refueling in the air -- it is, nonetheless, equipped with such a system -- the Su-34 can fly for 4,000 km without wing tanks! It can easily be transferred in a matter of hours from one part of the country to another where a threatening situation might suddenly arise on the border. Usually, Simonov said, it takes a combat aircraft a whole week to fly from the Far East to Tajikistan, for example. Sometimes an intermediate airfield will close owing to bad weather, then fuel will not be delivered in time, then people will forget to feed the airmen or will not give them an opportunity to rest properly. The new bomber is not affected either by weather conditions or by the time of day or night. Despite any meteorological conditions, its fundamentally new onboard digital computer and other radioelectronic equipment, which, incidentally, is duplicated many times over, will unerringly bring the aircraft to the prescribed region with an accuracy to within one meter. The self-guiding and correcting missile and bomb weapons -- the stocks suffice to fulfill any tasks -- will hit even a well defended point target. At a range from zero to 250 km. But the main "charm" of the new bomber is its cockpit. It is as spacious as the flightdeck of a Tu-134 passenger airliner, and equipped with air conditioning. The pilot and the navigator sit not one behind the other, in tandem, as is usual in any two-seater, but side by side. They can get up from their seats, stretch their legs, lie down in the aisle between the seats, do physical exercises, and then pour borscht from a vacuum flask or heat it and sit down to dine. There is even a toilet. Everything has been done on the Su-34, Simonov said, to ensure that even after a flight of 1,000 km the airmen are not tired and are able to work above the battlefield as though they had entered the bomber's cockpit a few minutes previously. The new machine is equipped with an active flight safety system or, as it is sometimes called, an artificial intelligence system. It enables the plane to execute aerobatic figures at the maximum ground speed (equal to 1,400 km per hour) and at the lowest altitudes, to unerringly follow the contours of the terrain, to hug [ogibat] the ground, and also to easily overcome ground forces' air defense weapons. The bomber is as hard to detect as a cruise missile, Simonov said. The aircraft is "held" at a certain altitude from the ground not only by the digital computer and the active safety system -- a forward horizontal fin assembly is fixed to its fuselage (it can be seen clearly on the diagram beneath the large tapered wings -- author). This parries and suppresses the bumpy air which arises with any high-speed aircraft at the lowest altitudes and creates additional potential for the pilot and navigator to carry out efficient precision bombing, to maneuver under enemy fire, to suppress enemy fire weapons, and to guard themselves against an enemy missile or a rock face suddenly rising up in their path. Moreover, an armored cockpit has been used on the Su-34 for the first time in the world, with the possible exception of the Su-25 ground-attack aircraft. Its 17mm thickness reliably protects the airmen even against chance hits by bullets, shells, or shrapnel. Mikhail Petrovich Simonov spared no words in describing the new creation of his design bureau. Whereas the Su-24 was created, he said, in response to the U.S. F-111 strike bomber, willy-nilly resembled it in some of its external features, and conveyed a kind of pro-Western image, the Su-34 is unlike anything else. It has its own appearance, its own build, its own boldness, and its own purely Russian unpredictability. It is our own Russian aircraft, which threatens no one but has been created for itself and for our own satisfaction. It really would be possible to speak about the new aircraft at greater length. True, we cannot present everything here to the general public. The majority of the bomber's performance characteristics are classified, and our description of it is being published only after it has been photographed above the deck of the aircraft carrier Admiral Flota Nikolay Kuznetsov and photographs of it have appeared in the foreign press with the puzzling caption: "What is this? Is Russia deceiving us with regard to its weakness?" Incidentally, a recent issue of the British JANE'S DEFENCE WEEKLY carried an article devoted to the Sukhoy Experimental Design Bureau firm and its aircraft. It was published a few days before information on tests of the Su-34. "If the Su-35 (a heavy fighter which flew splendidly at last summer's Dubayy Air Show -- author) appears at the Farnborough Air Show, as Sukhoy is promising," the magazine writes, "the greatest concern will be aroused, so commentators believe, by the aspect that it will have taken the West unawares. Their very best human and technical intelligence resources bear no comparison with Russian craftiness. This at a time when everyone reckoned that the former Soviet Union had been brought to its knees. If this is so, Russia may have still more surprises up its sleeve."
