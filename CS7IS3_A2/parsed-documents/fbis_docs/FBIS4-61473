For us, a peaceful solution to the conflict is of prime importance. There are at present two proposals for achieving peace in Nagorno-Karabakh: The CSCE proposal and the Russian proposal. Armenia has accepted both and what is more, we have convinced the Nagorno-Karabakh authorities to accept them too. But do not believe it was an easy task. [Luzzani] Why? [Papazyan] Because neither proposal guarantees protection for the Karabakh population following the peace agreement, and it goes without saying that the documents do not talk about the enclave's "independence." [Luzzani] Both proposals speak about withdrawal of troops. Is Karabakh willing to withdraw from the occupied Azerbaijani territory? [Papazyan] One should put that question to Karabakh's authorities, but I believe that if they accepted the proposals it is because they are willing to withdraw their troops. Azerbaijan will also have to withdraw its troops from northern Karabakh. The Azerbaijani Government has, however, rejected both proposals. [Luzzani] Is there practically no possibility of a cease-fire? [Papazyan] I would not say so. Azerbaijan is also steeped in a critical situation and sooner or later will have to accept that the solution will not be found through military intervention. There will come a moment when it will have to accept the CSCE's proposal since it does not want Russian troops to return to its territory. Ideally, international troops should be used to ensure that peace will not be broken. Russia will not be able to oppose this. [Luzzani] How are relations between Armenia and Iran at present? [Papazyan] Our relations are those of good neighbors. There are some problems because the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict has spread to its boarders and Iran does not like that at all. Iran is also interested in a peaceful solution. [Luzzani] And with Turkey? [Papazyan] We do not have diplomatic relations with Turkey, which totally closed its border with Armenia and it openly promotes Azerbaijani interests. [Luzzani] Does Russia continue to be Armenia's leading partner? [Papazyan] Russia is enmeshed in a very serious economic crisis. Armenia is Moscow's ally, but the Russian Government finds it difficult to provide aid to its allies. Moreover, we have very good relations with the EC, the United States, Argentina. Our foreign policy is orientated towards a balanced opening. [Luzzani] And with the other former Soviet Republics? [Papazyan] Relations with the Ukraine are not as deep as they should be because Kiev is in an even worse situation than Moscow. We have very good relations with republics in Central Asia, especially with Turkmenistan. From the economic standpoint, I would say our main partners are Russia first, followed by Turkmenistan, with Iran in third place.
