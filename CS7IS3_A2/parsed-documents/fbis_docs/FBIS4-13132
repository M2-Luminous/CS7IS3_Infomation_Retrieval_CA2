Speaking during a meeting with representatives of publications of political parties, Dr. al-Majali said Jordan had been subjected to pressure in a bid to force it to change its principled stand towards Arab issues. Dr. al-Majali rejected Israel's attempts to link Jordan with terrorism and said there could be a linkage between the threats and Israel's attempts to export its internal crises to Jordan. Dr. al-Majali said the siege of al-'Aqabah was part of the Gulf war and that Jordan had been suffering for more than three years from the blockade. He said the siege had so far cost Jordan more than $1.2 billion. The prime minister said the government was exerting efforts with France, Britain and others to explain the dangers posed by the situation. He added that Jordan made intensive contacts with the U.S. administration and the United Nations Sanctions Committee to stop the interception of ships heading for al-'Aqabah. He expressed hope that a solution be reached to this problem soon. Dr. al-Majali said Lloyds Register had made an offer to Jordan to help end the search of ships in the high seas. Lloyds is a non-political and non-profit international corporation whose presence will not have any effect on Jordan's national sovereignty," he said. Inter-Arab coordination, Dr. al-Majali said, falls short of aspirations. "It is regrettable indeed that current events and crises facing the Arab nation have not made them more tolerant or more cohesive, particularly at a time when we realise that Arab negotiators can achieve more when they are united," the prime minister said. On Jordanian-Palestinian relations, Dr. al-Majali said Jordan maintains unique and special relations with the Palestinian people. However, he said, there are several Palestinian factions with different political affiliations. Dr. al-Majali said it was natural for Jordan to establish relations with the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), the Palestinian entity recognised by the Palestinian people, the Arab Nation and most world countries. The prime minister voiced Jordan's support for the PLO to help it regain full Palestinian rights. "We pray to God that the political organisation enters the occupied Palestinian territories and that the Palestinian people restore their legitimate rights on their national soil," he said. "It is then the kind of relation between Jordan and the Palestinians will be determined." On Jerusalem, Dr. al-Majali said while PLO officials had agreed to discuss the issue of Jerusalem in the second phase of talks, Jordan believed that Jerusalem is the major problem, given the current state of inter-Arab division. "There is no peace without Jerusalem," Dr. al-Majali said. On recent incidents aimed at destablising security and stability in the country, Dr. al-Majali said perpetrators of these crimes were trained abroad to use arms.
