What had long been a nondate suddenly became a day with fatal symbolic force. And that is by no means just because the British have called off a national match against Germany that was supposed to take place on this day at the Berlin Olympic Stadium. The fact that much has changed in the republic cannot be described merely through Solingen, Rostock, Moelln, or the firebombing of the synagogue in Luebeck. On the contrary, the suspicion remains that resentment against "foreigners," German national obsessions, and even anti-Semitism are becoming a part of our daily life. When it was pointed out to the DFB [German Soccer Federation] in its collective naivety what is now linked with the date 20 April, the gentlemen answered: all the better! The motive for such intransigence is obvious: to show the world that "we" have changed. In Olympic games in Berlin, therefore, the peoples of the world are supposed to confirm to us Germans the innocence that we have earned. We are constantly craving, begging for, or extorting gestures of reconciliation. We would have been awfully glad to have evidence of normalization. That is what was involved in Bitburg and that is what is involved now when Chief of Staff Naumann definitely wants to provide the war graves in central and eastern Germany with the ranks of the fallen soldiers. First we want to be with the victors and then with the victims. We always want to be good and to have a confirmation of this. One would call this demand for absolution almost neurotic. It is no shame that there will not be a confrontation in Berlin with the British players and their infamous fans. The cancellation came at just the right time. Everywhere in the republic, however, it sounds a lot like Berlin: Show firmness! Do not give in to the Right! No appeasement! But this suggests that the 20th of April brings to mind only a couple of wild militants. The problem attains its real dimension, however, in that the FRG is becoming insecure in its middle because we are losing a sense of what the basic consensus has been. Certainly 1994 is not 1933, and why should it be? But one can also not forbid the question of how illiberal, how forgetful of history, and how national and rightist the republic is becoming. But precisely that is what is being attempted today. It may be that all questions about what must be called "rightist" in Germany are being presented as the furor of a new political correctness that only obeys the old cliche, or it may be with the comment that the perpetual appeal to Auschwitz only serves to give us a good conscience and once again to teach the world what is what. There are arguments and proofs for all objections of this kind. Still, they only distract from the essence of the problem. It is a matter of the center of society. There, in the middle, it is only tiny steps between the world of those who now vote for the CDU [Christian Democratic Union], FDP [Free Democratic Party], or SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] and that of the Republikaner. And the parties know that. They differentiate themselves from the Right but they also give sustenance to the rightists: appeasement did not begin with the decision to call off the national match on 20 April. The language that was used to deal with the right of asylum can be called appeasement. Part of this is how politics accused itself or allowed itself to be accused of being oblivious to power for 40 years. It was a matter of appeasement when most politicians maintained silence in the dispute among historians in the mid-1980's. Will they once again say nothing when Arnulf Baring babbles about the return of Bismarck's empire in Central Europe? For years politics knuckled under and showed its cowardice. That alone is the shame and not the cancellation of a match on the "Fuehrer's birthday." The intellectuals have also taken part in such appeasement. No, Wolfgang Thierse, you did not keep silent too long, you participated too often. The historian Ernst Nolte, promoter of a past that ought to vanish, has gotten more and more space in the newspapers and found more resonance in people's minds. Other thinkers or authors were also involved in this sense. One does not have to go along with Ignatz Bubis and name the dramatist Botho Strauss or some of the changed intellectual rightist radicals from 1968, but their effect on the children of the new rightists is obvious. They voluntarily put themselves in this context. Even Ernst Nolte is now getting support from the Left. After so many years of being taboo, the "rightists" are now becoming a secret fascination for many. And a rightist intellectual coalition is forming around young German historians like Rainer Zitelmann with their songs of impartiality on their lips. It is too late simply to put all that back in the bottle. Certainly one can introduce the denial of the holocaust as a particular criminal offense, but that works two ways. The Auschwitz lie as a taboo and myth? It would be better if German justice had already been more consistent in prosecuting such "national instigation" with the means that it has. The same thing is true for the question of whether the Republikaner should be banned. Even if the judges in Karlsruhe were to decide that, what would it yield other than a deceptive calm and some more legends of victims? And even the dispute about whether or not one ought to talk with the "radical rightists" is ultimately only a distraction. Naturally one would like to have television where Schoenhuber or Hader are not even invited. Still, one must try to talk with young people dressed as Nazis. But real selectivity is lacking. It must also be demonstrated in conversations with politicians, authors, and intellectuals of the "middle," who are just as radical as others when it comes to Maastricht, the "condolatory tourism," and the "pack of asylum-seekers." If the established consensus were not endangered there, then one would certainly not have to fear a seductive force from Leni Riefenstahl or Hoffmann's photos of Hitler. Intellectuals supposed in 1990 that possibly the two half-nations were getting a chance for the first time to face their common past without false accusations and without repression of past actions. That is proving to be an illusion from today's point of view. Nevertheless, we face the first debate since unification about whether tearing down the wall and integration are only the motive for a national reordering of the entire discourse about the past, for a final writing of history, or for an honest definition of our place and republican vigilance in the best sense of the word. One would like to retain a bit of confidence against the prevailing longing for normalcy. And at the same time, one cannot let himself be dominated by the objection that all of that is the lyrics of bewilderment. Such optimism is based on the everlasting nature of the past itself. "There is a wondrous healing power of nature but there is no healing power of history," writes Hans Mayer in this connection in his large book on the symbiosis of the Germans and Jews (Der Widerruf [The Disavowal]) that was finally destroyed on 30 January 1933. And further: "It is said: `Grass must grow over that.' Only the dead still lie under the grass."
