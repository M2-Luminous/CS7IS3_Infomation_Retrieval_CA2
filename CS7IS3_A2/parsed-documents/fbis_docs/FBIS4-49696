Under these circumstances, is the task of price reform already accomplished? Can things be allowed to run their course after freeing up prices? With these questions of general concern in mind, our staff reporter visited Zou Xiangqun, vice secretary general of the State Planning Commission (former deputy bureau chief of the State Pricing Bureau). Freeing Up Prices Does Not Equal Accomplishment of the Task of Reform With 15 years of price reform, the highly centralized government pricing system in China has been shattered and the prices of most commodities are formed by the market. By the end of 1992, government-fixed prices only accounted for 5.9 percent of the gross retail volume of commodities in society; of the gross volume of agricultural produce sold by farmers, government-fixed prices accounted for 12.5 percent; and of the gross volume of capital goods sold by industrial enterprises, government-fixed prices accounted for 18.7 percent. The price relationship between many important commodities has been fundamentally improved, and the pricing structure is continuously becoming more rational. The price scissors between industrial and agricultural products has been greatly reduced, the situation where the prices of basic industrial products were too low has clearly improved, and 95 percent of the domestic sale-prices of imported goods have been directly linked with international market prices by means of the agency system. These have all created important preconditions for the formation of a socialist market pricing mechanism. However, is the task of price reform accomplished? Zou Xiangqun believes there is still quite a distance to go. He said: According to the goal of economic structural reform defined by the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the fundamental task of price reform is to establish a socialist market pricing mechanism. This pricing mechanism is one which relies mainly on market price formation and which includes government macroregulation and control. Its basic requirements are: In terms of price formation, it should enable the majority of commodities to enter the market, with enterprises determining prices according to market supply and demand. In terms of price operations, it should be able to regulate prices through supply and demand, and guide the rational allocation of resources by means of prices in a unified, open market environment with orderly competition. In terms of pricing control, a perfect and effective government regulatory system of prices should be established in order to control the pricing bodies in adopting pricing actions in line with the economic and legal standards of the market. Comparing current achievements with these goals of reform, what would you consider lacking? Zou Xiangqun answered: First, the market system is not sufficiently mature. Currently, the market structure is rather monolithic and the development of the market of production factors has just begun. The market is still relatively small, with imperfect facilities, and the means of transaction are backward. Market regulations are imperfect. Regional and market barriers still exist. Prices formed in this kind of market cannot sensitively reflect the situation of gross supply and demand in society, nor the degree of shortage in resources. They cannot accurately send out signals to guide the allocation of resources. The price fluctuations in December 1993 occurred under a situation in which China's grain production enjoyed bumper harvests for years, state grain reserves were ample, and gross supply and demand were balanced. This, to a great degree, was directly linked to the fact that China's market system is insufficiently developed. Second, reform of enterprise internal operational mechanisms has not been accomplished. As pricing entities, even though enterprises already have the competition encouragement mechanism, in general they still lack a risk control mechanism, lack a perfect internal price management system, and lack the knowledge, experience, and skills to scientifically determine prices. During the first half of last year, some large steel plants took the opportunity of an explosion in the scale of investment, as well as the flourishing market in construction materials, to compete with each other in jacking up prices, or even cooperated in raising prices. Thus, within a short period of time, the prices of steel products doubled, and this was then followed by a sharp price drop and overstocking of steel, making production and turnover difficult for the enterprises. This is a typical example in this respect. Third, a price regulatory and control system has yet to be established. After the scope of direct-management of prices by the government is largely reduced, as far as the prices of the majority of commodities and services are concerned, an effective pricing regulation and control system and a perfect legal system concerning pricing have yet to be established. Although the state has begun building a reserve for some commodities and a few areas have established price regulation funds for a few very important goods, on the whole, the economic means are still weak, legislation lags behind, and control and regulation are limp. These have become a conspicuous contradiction in the current reform. Fourth, the price system has not yet been completely straightened out. The prices of energy, railway transportation, and a few basic products and infrastructure are still relatively low, which is harmful to the optimal allocation of resources. The purchase price of grain is also irrational, the comparative efficiency of agricultural production is down, the scissors difference between industrial and farm products -- which was already reduced after reform -- has again showed signs of expanding in recent years. This is not good for the stable development of agricultural production. All these indicate that in order to accomplish the task of price reform, much hard and practical work needs to be done, especially in the continued development of the market system, in establishing a unified and open market system with orderly competition, in promoting reform of the enterprise internal operational mechanism and the development of market entities, and in the speedy establishment of a healthy price regulation and control system and the continued straightening out of price relationships between important commodities. Only thus can we build a socialist market pricing mechanism. One Must Not Wash One's Hands of Prices Under a Market Economy The main features of market economy are to use economic interest as the basic driving force and to realize the best allocation of resources through the market. This kind of economy has a mechanism to encourage competition and vitality, and is a law-oriented economy which can restrict the spontaneous and blindly generated negative effects of the market. A socialist market pricing mechanism must also fully embody these main features. After the prices of the majority of commodities and services were freed up, manufacturers and businessmen obtained the right to determine prices, and the enthusiasm to produce and operate were greatly uplifted. This has obviously promoted economic development, boosted market prosperity, and improved people's living standards. However, at the same time, in some regions, departments, enterprises, and organizations, certain chaotic phenomena have occurred, such as superseding the power to fix prices, unduly collecting fees, monopolizing prices, seeking exorbitant profits, piggy-backing on price-hikes, raising prices without permission, competing with others in raising prices, asking for unlimited high prices, cheating customers, producing and selling fake and shoddy goods, and so on. Although these problems are expressed in different forms and different degrees in various places and aspects, they are very harmful, and to a certain extent they have pushed the general level of prices up. According to estimates, in the general 13 percent rise of retail prices during 1993, 6.8 percent were spontaneous price rises, of which a fair proportion was caused by chaos in the pricing order. This chaos in the pricing order was, fundamentally speaking, a disorderly action caused by the pursuit of self-interest by various interest groups, with disregard to the social effects during the process of drastic changes in the distribution of interests. It was a reflection of the spontaneity and blindness of the market economy. In order to prevent and overcome the damaging effects this spontaneity and blindness may cause, the state must conduct macromanagement over economic activities and market prices. Western countries with market economies do not completely let prices go. Zou Xiangqun says all the major developed countries have established price management organizations of different levels and different types which adopt direct management, indirect management, and supervision and inspection measures over prices of commodities and services according to different situations. Japan established a national centralized price management organization which has the Cabinet Meeting on Pricing as the decisionmaking organ over pricing, and the Economic Planning Agency's Pricing Office as its central executive organ. France has the National Competition Commission, General Bureau for Competitive Consumption and Antifraud Inspection. Thailand has the Commission for Fair Pricing and Antimonopoly under the Ministry of Commerce in charge of prices nationwide. The United States does not have a national centralized price control organization. Supervision and control on the general level of prices is carried out by the federal Labor Department. Regulation and control of railway freight prices is under the government's Interstate Commerce Commission, while the supervision of consumer interests and enterprise prices is taken care of by the Consumer Bureau. In Germany, commodity prices under the management of the state are normally under the care of economic departments of state governments. Prices that are directly managed by the government in Japan include petroleum, coal, railways, passenger transportation, public housing, land prices, rice, cigarettes, and table salt. These occupy approximately 18 percent of the commodities, calculated according to consumer price indices. In America, these include utilities, electricity, taxis, subways, telephones and telecommunication, cable TV, running water, gas, public rental housing, and museum tickets, which account for 5 to 10 percent of citizens' consumer spending. In France, these include public transport, post and telecommunications, medicine, alcohol, education, military products, agricultural produce, etc., occupying around 20 percent of commodities and fees. In Germany these include railways, pharmaceuticals, coal, farm produce, fees of lawyers, architects, and notaries, and insurance as required by law, which occupy 22 to 26 percent of commodities and utility fees. There are three forms of indirect management of prices: The first is to regulate total supply and demand by using banking and financial policies, adjusting the discount rate of capital reserves and interest rates, using government budgets, and adjusting government expenditures. The second is to use industrial policies to support the development of key industries. For instance, to protect farmers' interests, the United States practices a supporting price and subsidies policy on farm produce, with a total subsidy of over $15 billion. The European Community and Japan also have substantial subsidies on farm produce. The third is social interference measures, namely, supervising price by means of consumer councils or intervening by means of public opinion. Foreign countries also attach importance to supervision and inspection of prices and have special price inspection teams. In some countries price inspectors have guns, and when necessary they can conduct searches. Serious offenders are subject to legal punishment. Looking at the world today, whether developed or developing, not a single country takes a completely laissez-faire attitude toward prices. Zou Xiangqun says, based on rich practical experience gained since China's reform and opening to the outside world and taking into consideration some common methods used in Western countries under a market economy, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee made explicit stipulations concerning the building of a macroregulatory and control system. The "Decision Concerning Some Issues for Establishing a Socialist Market Economic Structure" passed by the plenary session pointed out: "To establish a perfect macroregulatory and control system with indirect regulation and control as the main means, to guarantee the healthy operation of the national economy"; "to further change the operational mechanism of state-owned enterprises"; and "to establish a national, unified and open market system..." are an interconnected and intercontrolling organic whole, composing the basic framework of a socialist market economic structure. Centering on these major points, we must establish a corresponding legal system and adopt practical measures to actively and systematically "push forward reform comprehensively and promote the development of the social productive forces." Establishing a New Price Regulation System Is an Urgent Task of Current Price Reform Under the new situation of intensified marketization of the Chinese economy, to continuously push forward the reform of the economic system, accelerate and improve macroregulation and control, prevent market prices from drastic fluctuations, control excessive price rises, standardize pricing actions, and realize fair competition, fair transaction, and legal operations, one must establish a perfect and effective government regulation and control system over prices. Zou Xiangqun points out, the price regulation and control system must embody the demands of a market economy, and the focus of regulation and control should be on maintaining the economic overall balance, with macroregulation and control as the main means. The objects of regulation and control should be those deciding the prices and the market, with indirect regulation and control as the main means. The means of regulation and control should be mainly economic and legal, supplemented with necessary administrative means. The establishment of such a pricing regulation and control system is a gradual process which, following the deepening of reform, the strengthening of economic power, and the perfection of laws, will continuously enrich and perfect the means of regulation and control. This will take a fairly long time to accomplish. Currently, Zou Xiangqun believes that, in the context of the objectives of stabilizing market prices and standardizing pricing actions, we should tackle the establishment of healthy economic and legal means of price control in the following respects: -- Establish a reserve system for important commodities such as grain, cotton, and oil, so that these can be dumped on the market when fluctuations occur in production or supply. -- Establish grain and nonstaple food price-regulation funds to keep down prices, protect production and consumption, and stabilize the economy when great upheavals and drops appear in prices. -- Perfect price laws and regulations, encourage competition, and oppose monopolies; protect legal gains and oppose exorbitant profiteering; and protect proper business operations, oppose cheating and overcharging customers, and crack down on fake and shoddy commodities. The "Regulations on Clearly Marking the Prices of Commodities and Services," issued for implementation in early March of this year by the State Planning Commission with the approval of the State Council is an important economic legal regulation promoting open transactions in the market, raising the visibility of pricing actions, and opposing cheating in prices. -- Conduct price information services. The pricing departments at various levels should fully make use of the government's information network, and according to the needs of society, extensively collect, arrange, and develop price information; provide, in a timely fashion, information to enterprises concerning the market supply and demand of various important commodities, the pricing situation, and predictions of trends; and they should offer price information services by serving as price consultants, offering consultations on specific topics, issuing publications and other means, to guide enterprises in organizing their production according to market demands and adjusting their operational orientation. -- Strengthen policy direction and professional training for enterprises, and help enterprise managers to master marketing strategies and decisionmaking skills in pricing. -- Undertake appropriate administrative intervention in a small number of important commodities. For the basic means of production and necessities of daily life which easily suffer from price fluctuations, necessary and appropriate intervention should be undertaken according to different circumstances, and price-limiting measures, such as keeping records of any price rises or requiring applications for price rises, should be practiced. Zou Xiangqun says that the State Council recently decided to practice price supervision on 20 types of commodities and services most crucial to people's lives. This is a new measure which makes a breakthrough in important commodities and a new measure for stabilizing people's lives and pushing forward the reform in the price regulation and control system. It embodies the principle of using indirect regulation and control as the main means and combines economic means with appropriate administrative intervention. It is beneficial to maintaining the relative stability of the general level of prices. We should earnestly implement the various measures of price supervision in coordination with the reality in order to render better service to reform, development, and stability.
