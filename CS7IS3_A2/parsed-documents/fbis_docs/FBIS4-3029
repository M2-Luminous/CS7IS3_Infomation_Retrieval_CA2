"I really believe most Hong Kong people, probably 90 percent at least, want 1997 to go through peacefully," said the 81-year-old woman, who has served in the Urban Council for 31 years and is concurrently member of the Legislative Council. In a recent interview with XINHUA, Elsie Tu said, "Hong Kong people work very hard to build up the economy. If we have political disturbance, political instability, it will certainly and eventually affect the economy." "In case it (political disturbance) affected economy, people would move business out of Hong Kong and people lose jobs. That's what the people are worried about," she added. She said that she received both written and oral congratulations from local residents after she was appointed Hong Kong affairs adviser to the Chinese side earlier this month. "Because the talks between China and Britain broke down, I think it's necessary for us to make some kind of bridges with China to have cooperation so as to understand each other's viewpoints," she said. "If the government can't do it, let's the people do it. Then it's the people's idea not the government's idea," she said, adding "that's better than the views of Mr. Patten." "One or two of the press said to me 'whether or not you compromise your position and make you support China'. I said, 'Have you ever seen me compromise?'" "It's not intended to be a honor (to be appointed as the adviser). It's responsibility," she said, adding "since the two governments cannot agree, it's up to us, the citizens, to try to find some ways of helping make the transition smooth," she said. Mrs. Elsie Tu has lived in Hong Kong for 43 years since she came to Hong Kong in 1951. She has served as the supervisor and teacher of a local school, Mu Kuang English school, which she and her Chinese husband set up in 1954. "I understand the grassroots better than I understand the business," she said. Her familiarility with fellow residents has been strengthened since she became a member of the Urban Council in 1963. For 31 years, she has spent most of her time, at least twice a week, interviewing people, usually middle-and-low-pay workers. "The only rest I get is Sunday evening when I go with my husband for dinner and that's my holiday," she smiled. "Probably, apart from very well off people who don't need any help, I had probably some contacts with most families in Hong Kong," she said. "That is the foundation that people trust me because I don't talk politics to them, I only talk about how to improve social conditions," she said. Mrs. Tu is expected to go to Beijing to receive the adviser appointment next month. "As an adviser, I would like to explain China's attitude towards Hong Kong and Hong Kong's feelings to China," she said.
