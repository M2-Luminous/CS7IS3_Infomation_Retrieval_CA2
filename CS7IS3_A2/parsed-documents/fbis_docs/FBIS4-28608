Speaking in Manila, Senator Evans said the situation needs to be handled delicately. Trevor Watson reports. [Begin Watson recording] Senator Evans said he would deplore any decision that drives the North Koreans beyond the point of no return in their dealings with the International Atomic Energy Agency or the world community. Nobody, he said, knows if sanctions will do that or encourage the North to be more open in the future. [Evans] Will it serve the purpose of keeping them committed in the future to ensure that we at least know there won't be diversion of nuclear material in the future, or we would be the trigger which in fact pushes them over the brink to walk away from the non- proliferation treaty all together.
