He will stand as National Party (Blanco Party) candidate in the general elections. Some 600 "Blanco" leaders officially proclaimed him during a rally in the city of Trinidad, located 190 km northeast of Montevideo. Volonte did not participate in this rally as he is banned from engaging in partisan politics while he holds a post within the state's autonomous agency. The new presidential candidate from the ruling party will resign from his post as UTE executive board chairman when the momentum for the 29 November elections, in which the national government, lawmakers, and municipal authorities will be chosen, gathers steam. Volonte had been discarded by President Lacalle, who hand-picked his former Interior Minister Juan Andres Ramirez as his successor. Volonte was proclaimed by a splinter group that broke with the government's top leaders. Volonte's candidacy within the Blanco Party should be added to those of Vice President Gonzalo Aguirre, who was proclaimed candidate in Montevideo last week, and Senator Carlos Julio Pereyra, leader of the second largest faction within the ruling party who has taken a different line from Lacalle, especially with regard to economic policy. In Uruguay, political parties may field several candidacies, which according to the Elections Law, the party is elected first and then the candidate who receives the most votes within the winning party. As for the Colorado Party, the main opposition party, the candidacies of former Presidents Julio Maria Sanguinetti, who heads public opinion polls in voters' preferences for president, and Jorge Pacheco Areco, leader of the right wing, have already been confirmed. It is also believed that Jorge Batlle, a three-time candidate for president, will also run. The Broad Front, a coalition of leftist parties, will field only one presidential candidate, Montevideo Mayor Tabare Vazquez. Public opinion surveys show that the Colorado Party is the favorite choice of voters, with 34 percent, followed by the Broad Front with 27 percent and the Blanco Party with 24 percent.
