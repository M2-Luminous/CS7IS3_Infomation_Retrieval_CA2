Mr Uthai earlier met Malaysia's International Trade and Industry Minister, Dato' Seri Rafidah Aziz. He said Dato' Rafidah wanted him to make clear the Thai Government's view on the EAEC. He told her he supported the move because it was a good concept. However, it was merely an initiative with no action taken yet. At the weekend, officials who asked not to be identified said that Thailand was still not enthusiastic about the EAEC. Mr Uthai said he stressed with Dato' Rafidah that the most important aspect was to strengthen the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to increase the group's bargaining power in international forums such as the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group. Under current understandings, the EAEC would comprise East Asian members of APEC and not the United States, Canada, Mexico or Chile. In November, senior ASEAN secretariat officials said their initial exploratory talks with potential members received a warm response. Mr Uthai said Dato' Rafidah asked him whether Thailand would participate in the first meeting of APEC in Hawaii on March 18 and 19 because she believed the United States would force smaller countries to open up their financial markets further. Mr Uthai said he told Dato' Rafidah that he could not speak on behalf of the Thai finance minister but he thought that Thailand would have a clearer position after Tharin Nimmanhemin met the US Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. Dato' Rafidah said the ASEAN secretary-general had visited countries which would be founders of the EAEC, such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Results would soon be reported to ASEAN economic ministers. She said the private sector would benefit from the loose consultative forum. The arrangement would benefit the private sector in finance, industry and even by linking the stock markets. Dato' Rafidah said the private sector should realise the marketing possibilities as the EAEC would include Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, China, Indochina and all of ASEAN.
