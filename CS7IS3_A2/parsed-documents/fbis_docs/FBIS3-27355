According to the "PEOPLE'S DAILY" [RENMIN RIBAO] (overseas edition) today, the feasibility study of the second phase of the project at Aoshan has passed a technical appraisal. With an investment of 29.96 million U.S. dollars, the phase consists of oil tanks, with a combined storage capacity of 500,000 cu m, and supportive facilities. The base will have an annual handling capacity of more than 10 million tons upon completion. Zhoushan is a harbor with a lengthy coastline suitable for building docks; along 164 km the water is as deep as 10 m. It has a 1,000-sq-km inshore area, about the same size as that of Rotterdam Harbor in the Netherlands. The paper noted that the Zhoushan City Government has decided to develop the port with foreign investment and cooperation. At present, Zhoushan is speeding up the construction of infrastructure facilities to pave the way for the overall development of the port. An airport is expected to open to domestic routes in 1995, the paper reported.
