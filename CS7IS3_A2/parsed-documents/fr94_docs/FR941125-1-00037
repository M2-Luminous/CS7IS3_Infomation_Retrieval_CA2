Slowly misalign the COMS transceiver unit (combined light source and detector unit) by tilting it in the vertical plane until a # 2 percent opacity shift is obtained by the data recorder. Then, following the manufacturer's written instructions, check the alignment. Misalignment should be clearly discernable. Record and report the visual depiction of misalignment as viewed using the optical alignment sight. Realign the COMS and record and report the visual depiction of alignment. Repeat this test for lateral misalignment of the transceiver unit. As an alternative to the lateral misalignment of the transceiver unit, a lateral misalignment of the reflector unit may be performed. 7.1.1.4␣Simulated Zero and Calibration Value Check. Adjust, record, and report the COMS zero alignment response so that the simulated zero output equals the COMS actual clear path zero output established for the monitoring pathlength. Measure and record the indicated upscale calibration value. The upscale calibration value reading must be within the required opacity range (see Definition 2.21). 7.1.2␣Calibration Attenuator Selection. 7.1.2.1␣Based on the required opacity standard, select a minimum of three calibration attenuators (low-, mid-, and high-level) based on the following formulas in Table 1&hyph;3: Table 1&hyph;3._ Required Calibration Attenuator Values 1␣ Low level_20 to 60 percent of the opacity standard. Mid level_80 to 120 percent of the opacity standard. High level_150 to 200 percent of the opacity standard. 7.1.2.2␣Calculate the attenuator values required to obtain a system response equivalent to the applicable values in the ranges specified in table 1&hyph;2 using equation 1&hyph;1. Select attenuators having the values closest to those calculated by equation 1&hyph;1. A series of filters with actual opacity values relative to the values calculated are commercially available.
