Eight UNHCR trucks arrived, carrying everything but food. The authorities of the aggressor 111th HVO [Croatian Defense Council] Brigade have been blackmailing our side by insisting that, before the [food] convoy enters the town, their 34 fighters be immediately exchanged for more than 100 of our civilians, mainly sick and exhausted women, children, and elderly people, who have been in the hands of these criminals for seven months. Previous convoys for Maglaj were sent back. Once because they did not have a permit from the Serbian authorities, another time because of the Croatian authorities, a third time because they were allegedly shot at, and now because of this exchange. Whether accidentally or not, Larry Hollingworth is involved in this dirty matter. He came to Maglaj without the convoy at 0930 yesterday to tell the state and military leadership of Maglaj about the HVO's demands. Mr. Hollingworth returned to Zepce, where he is not being allowed to take the urgently needed food and medicines. Vinko Ivesic, representative of the HVO commission for exchange, and Delaj Krnic, president of our commission, got in touch at 1700. The HVO then revealed its real face. Everything is now crystal clear. They want to get their fighters and ethnically cleanse occupied Zepce of Muslims. They have said loud and clear that they do not care much for their fighters, that they will expel all 860 Muslims to Maglaj, and that they will not allow any convoys to get through in the future, as has been the case so far.
