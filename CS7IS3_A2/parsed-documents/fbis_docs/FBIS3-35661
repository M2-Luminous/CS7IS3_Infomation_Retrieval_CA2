In this connection, the deputy commander in chief of the Russian troops in Transcaucasia, General Vasiliy Terchenko has stated the following. It is totally groundless to talk about this. Russian army units are not intended for this purpose. Moreover, I firmly believe that the Georgian Interior Ministry has enough forces to solve this problem on its own. On the issue of Russian army units' possible peacekeeping role in the conflict settlement in Abkhazia and the participation of troops under his authority in this operation, the general said the following. Let us not overtake the events. However, I think that this is how this issue will be decided and our units will be among other Russian troops taking part in it. Therefore, the number of our units in Georgia will increase accordingly. This and the issue of bringing Russian troops [currently] in Abkhazia under our authority must be solved at a governmental level. It will probably be decided during Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Georgia.
