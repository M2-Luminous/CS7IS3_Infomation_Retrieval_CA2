FR941117-0-00171 FR941117-0-00011 §22.1009 Transmitter locations. The rules in this section establish limitations on the locations from which stations in the Offshore Radiotelephone Service may transmit. (a) All stations. Offshore stations must not transmit from locations outside the boundaries of the appropriate zones specified in §22.1007. Offshore stations must not transmit from locations within 241 kilometers (150 miles) of any full-service television station that transmits on the TV channel containing the channel on which the offshore station transmits. (b) Airborne subscriber stations. Airborne subscriber stations must not transmit from altitudes exceeding 305 meters (1000 feet) above mean sea level. Airborne mobile stations in Zone A must not transmit from locations within 129 kilometers (80 miles) of Lake Charles, Louisiana. Airborne mobile stations in Zone B must not transmit from locations within 129 kilometers (80 miles) of Lafayette, Louisiana. Airborne mobile stations in Zone C must not transmit from locations within 129 kilometers (80 miles) of Corpus Christi or locations within 129 kilometers (80 miles) of Houston, Texas. §22.1011 Antenna height limitations. The antenna height of offshore stations must not exceed 61 meters (200 feet) above mean sea level. The antenna height of offshore surface mobile stations must not exceed 10 meters (30 feet) above the waterline. §22.1013 Effective radiated power limitations. The effective radiated power (ERP) of transmitters in the Offshore Radiotelephone Service must not exceed the limits in this section. (a) Maximum power. The ERP of transmitters in this service must not exceed 1000 Watts under any circumstances. (b) Mobile transmitters. The ERP of mobile transmitters must not exceed 100 Watts. The ERP of mobile transmitters, when located within 32 kilometers (20 miles) of the 4.8 kilometer (3 mile) limit, must not exceed 25 Watts. The ERP of airborne mobile stations must not exceed 1 Watt. (c) Protection for TV Reception. The ERP limitations in this paragraph are intended to reduce the likelihood that interference to television reception from offshore radiotelephone operations will occur. (1) Co-channel protection. The ERP of offshore stations must not exceed the limits in Table I&hyph;1 of this section. The limits depend upon the height above mean sea level of the offshore transmitting antenna and the distance between the antenna location of the offshore transmitter and the antenna location of the main transmitter of the nearest full-service television station that transmits on the TV channel containing the channel on which the offshore station transmits. (2) Adjacent channel protection. The ERP of offshore stations located within 128.8 kilometers (80 miles) of the main transmitter antenna of a full service TV station that transmits on a TV channel adjacent to the TV channel which contains the channel on which the offshore station transmits must not exceed the limits in the Table I&hyph;2 of §22.1015. The limits depend upon the height above mean sea level of the offshore transmitting antenna and the distance between the location of the offshore transmitter and the 4.8 kilometer (3 mile) limit.
