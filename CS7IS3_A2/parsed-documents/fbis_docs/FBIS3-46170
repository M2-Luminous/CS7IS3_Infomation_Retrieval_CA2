Stapleton Roy, U.S. ambassador to the PRC, on the China issue, sparking off media interest in keeping track of the White House's actions on ending China's most-favored-nation [MFN] status five months from now. Stapleton told THE NEW YORK TIMES that the last 15 years of reform had been the best period China had ever had in the 150 years since the Opium Wars. Deng Xiaoping's reforms have made notable progress in China's march toward a society of greater freedom and democracy, noting that the United States should take China's economic and social reforms into account when approaching the China problem. The basic theme of U.S. China policy can be very largely seen from the role played by China's economic reforms in the MFN issue -- the touchstone for Sino-U.S. relations. Sources close to the U.S. Government say that the White House is feeling pressure on this issue from China's enormous economic reforms. Experts explained that the pressure from China's economy comes in fact from demands within the American economy. A foreign policy report by Secretary of State Christopher toward the end of last year already hinted that the Clinton administration was making economic growth a top priority in its foreign policy. At a session of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Christopher described economic security as the top factor in U.S. foreign policy, explaining: "National security after the Cold War will depend on a powerful economy which will function much the same as a powerful military force." Moreover, he stated: "For American businessmen, there is no place as dynamic as the Asia-Pacific region in terms of economic growth and export trade opportunities. The region has an intimate interest for U.S. commerce and employment. The U.S. Department of Commerce estimates that the volume of U.S.-China trade in 1993 topped $35 billion. Wang Tianming, a ministerial-rank attache at the PRC Embassy in the United States, revealed that in the next seven months, China would import 210 key technological projects involving 23 industries. Reports from Beijing say imports over the next seven years will amount to $700 billion. A commentary by Representative Glickman in THE WASHINGTON TIMES represents, to a different extent, the current outlook of the U.S. business sector on China. The commentary states that future U.S. political and economic interests are closely linked to the countries of the Pacific rim. China wields a significant influence in the Asia-Pacific region. The Chinese market has enormous potential. If the United States falls out with China, it will not able to benefit from the opportunities the Chinese market offers to the world. Messages from the U.S. State Department over the last few days following the THE NEW YORK TIMES interview with the U.S. ambassador to China have left the media pondering. In a comment on Roy's statement, a State Department spokesman said that while economic liberalization had raised people's living standards, President Clinton's premise for renewing China's MFN status carried specific criteria and definitions. China had made progress in some areas, but whether it meets human rights requirements depends on the next few months. In an interview with ABC, Secretary of State Christopher said: "From our standpoint, China's praiseworthy economic achievements cannot offset the lack of progress in human rights." He stated that the position of both the president and himself was that the United States will not forget to take into account China's record in human rights due to its excellent economy. Analysts here believe that Christopher's statement represents the U.S. Government's current policies and position, though they also reflect the State Department's attempt to deflect attacks from congressmen in support of human rights policy. Analysts said that on the MFN issue, the White House faces pressure from economic considerations and human rights groups in the Congress. The MFN issue will put the White House in a dilemma shortly after New Year. U.S. Vice President Al Gore has said in media interviews that the United States still seeks common ground and a point of balance between its demands on China to improve its right record and bilateral ties. Against this balance seeking background, THE WASHINGTON TIMES revealed the view of U.S. Government officials on Roy's statement: "Mr. Roy's comments have weakened the administration's position on convincing Beijing that Washington's strong position on the MFN issue is not an empty effort." The views of some U.S. Government officials differ from the official position and media commentaries on the MFN issue have heated up in the last few months. THE NEW YORK TIMES says: Robert Rubin, chairman of the National Economic Council, Bowman Cutter, deputy assistant to the president for economic policy, and high-ranking advisers stated that applying sanctions to China would harm the United States more than China. The report also cited a high- ranking government official saying: We cannot continue to distance, and then patch up with China over and over again on the MFN issue. There are many more complicated affairs to take care of than the MFN issue. THE WASHINGTON POST said in a commentary that the trouble with the U.S. Government is that when, for reasons of international security and economic factors it cannot strike at China with trade sanctions and human rights, President Clinton chose human rights as the decisive factor in considering the problem. The article further says that, if as the administration says, China has not made significant progress in human rights, the administration will then be in a position of having to sever economic ties with China, which will also dash China's wish to cooperate with the United States on the DPRK nuclear crisis. The report cited (Jeffrey Gordon), deputy secretary at the U.S. Department of Commerce, as saying: We do want to see substantial progress in human rights, but putting the MFN issue at the center of the argument between us and China every year is unhealthy for both sides. Haig, former U.S. secretary of state, said in an interview with the media that it was a failure to have introduced the MFN issue, an economic problem, into the world of policy. In dealing with important countries, the United States should not take human rights as a central issue between them. James Lilley, a former U.S. ambassador to the PRC, said at a seminar at Princeton University that economic cooperation was not what propelled the United States to establish diplomatic ties with China in the first place. However, economic factors account for 80 percent of U.S.-China relations today, and the United States should stop using MFN status as a means to improve human rights in China. There are still several months before China's MFN status is ended by the White House, and consultations and debates between the White House and Congress, between Washington and Beijing, and within the Clinton administration have been "warming up." Sources here say that in the next few months, China's MFN status will not be a topic of light conversation in the White House.
