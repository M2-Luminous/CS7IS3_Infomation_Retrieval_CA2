The Chief of Staff of the Moscow Military District, Lt-Gen Leonid Zolotov, tells how things now stand in this most important area in the Moscow Military District. [Oliynik] Leonid Sergeyevich, for the first time in recent years the district military council, at which the problems of military discipline and order were considered individually, certified that the number of military crimes and incidents decreased by a factor of one-and-a-half in comparison with 1992 in the units and formations, and that the number of draft dodgers decreased by a factor of more than six. How was this achieved? [Zolotov] The short answer is that the entire spectrum of problems of strengthening discipline and order in the units has constantly been the focus of activity of the CINC, staff, directorates, and services of the district. As required by the well-known order of the Defense Minister of the Russian Federation of 18 November 1993, we seek to ensure that work to strengthen discipline and organization is not reduced to a short-lived campaign, that in each military outfit an atmosphere of high demands and responsibility is constantly maintained, and that every violation receives a strict and principled assessment. As I see it, this is the main reason for the successes in our foremost units and formations. For example, take the signals brigade where Colonel Aleksandr Semenovich Semakin is the commander. The conditions of service there and the contingent of draftees are the same as in other units. Perhaps even more signal troops have to work away from the unit and participate in various kinds of classes and tactical exercises. But despite this, in the last three years there has not been a single serious incident there. In the military council, incidentally, the CINC Col-Gen Leontiy Kuznetsov analyzed the work style of this foremost commander and stressed that educational work in the brigade is reinforced by an exacting attitude toward the men with respect to regulations, combined with concern for them. Colonel Semakin himself and many other officers and warrant officers are models of industriousness and discipline. Their subordinates see and appreciate that. [Oliynik] What difficulties and problems do the commanders and staffs encounter in working to strengthen discipline and order, and in particular, how does [this work] influence the level of combat readiness? [Zolotov] Today probably as never before it is important to evaluate the status of observance of regulations not from quantitative indices, but primarily from its real influence on the combat readiness of troops, and on the quality of combat training. Close analysis of the state of military discipline in the district's units for last year and for three months of this year showed that the level of organizational work of commanders, staffers and educational structures unfortunately still does not correspond everywhere to the provisions of regulations and to the requirements of the Defense Minister and the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces. The military council and the district staff believe that it is this task of raising the disciplining influence of combat training, guard duty, work details, etc. that has not been fully accomplished. In this regard, I recall the words of the military teacher and leader General M. Dragomirov: "Discipline comes from the sum total of ethical and legal skills covering the entire content of the military goals of the soldier." The chief deficiency is that "the sum total of ethical and legal skills" is now by no means achieved everywhere. [Oliynik] Could you give a concrete example? [Zolotov] Of course. In early March, Pvt. Sergey Komlev from the Taman Division went AWOL from the unit and returned to the Ivanov military commissariat which had drafted him. It was learned that the soldier had been forced to seek protection at home because he could not find it in his company. Here much of the blame lies with the company commander Lt. Aleksandr Ebel, who was indifferent and ignored the soldier's complaints about headaches. The battalion and regimental staffs did not attach much importance to this fact. Nor did the deputy commander of the battalion for personnel work take the requisite steps. Need it be said that such actions by some officers demean the prestige of commanders and discredit military order itself? [Oliynik] And how do you explain the fact that while there is some reduction in the number of crimes and incidents in the district, their seriousness has increased? [Zolotov] Yes, this is a difficult question, which incidentally we also discussed at the military council of the district. To speak the language of numbers, we unfortunately had a 13 percent increase in the number of convictions for various military crimes, although the number of their participants decreased by 50 percent. We do not avoid blame for this, but it is not only a question of us. It is well known what sort of replacements we are getting now in the army. If we look at the statistics, we can see that in recent years every second draftee is not prepared for service either in the physical or in the moral and psychological context. Who is guilty? The army? Every third has serious health problems. The number of persons with previous convictions and arrests has increased significantly. Representatives of various unofficial associations, including those of an extremist and mafioso bent, cause us a great deal of concern. That is, all of the sores that afflict our society necessarily create a heavy burden on the army as well. Here is an example that has already been reported in the press. In the Naro-Fominsk garrison, a solder from Moscow, Pvt. Aleksandr Fedyunin, went AWOL from his unit. What prompted the soldier to do this? It was learned that the notorious "hazing" had been eliminated. There were no complaints against him either from his commanders or from his comrades in service. Now he has been arrested, and the prosecutor is investigating the incident. Of course, everything will be found out, but it takes a lot of manpower and resources, and people are pulled away from their immediate obligations; not to mention the anguish this causes to his parents and loved ones. [Oliynik] In connection with the mixed manning of the troops, I would imaging a new problem has also arisen, the maintenance of order among the contract soldiers. Now they number more than seven thousand in the district, and soon there will be twice that. [Zolotov] You have guessed correctly, there are problems with discipline even among the contract troops. Judge for yourself. Of the 7,360 enlisted and NCOs serving by contract in the district units, the command was forced to nullify the contracts with 1,266 of them within a month or two after signing, basically due to lack of discipline and low moral qualities. Despite all efforts, the commanders and staffs to this point have not managed to ensure that the contract troops are true professionals in military affairs, and serve as an example. Analysis shows that educational and legal work with this category of service members has still not brought the due effect. What is more, in many units there have been sharp conflicts with compulsory-service soldiers on matters of pulling duty in details and guard mounts and in daily life. A whole group of measures was required, involving careful selection of people for contract service and adapting them to the conditions of present-day military service. Perhaps in the future it would be more advisable to man some subunits solely with contractors. [Oliynik] Recently a meeting was held between the Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia Aleksey II and the Defense Minister of the Russian Federation, General of the Army Pavel Grachev. A coordinating council for the resolution of questions of cooperation between the Orthodox Church and the army was formed. In your view, will this help to improve the moral climate in the military outfits, and prevent law-violations in them? [Zolotov] I think so. Now when many moral criteria have been lost and ideals are blurred, as we work to educate personnel we cannot help but use the rich moral and ethical capabilities of the Orthodox Church and other religious faiths. For these purposes, a special plan has been worked out in the units of the district, aimed at close coordination of the units with the clergy in the provinces. In particular, it is recommended that commanders of formations and units define procedures for arranging religious services for believers and members of their families outside the military garrisons in their free time. In the period of reception of the new replacements and on the days when the military oath is taken, priests will be invited to the units, and spiritual literature will appear in the barracks. In short, we hope that reliance on religion will justify itself, and in particular will influence the education of the men and their moral qualities. In conclusion I want to stress that the army, as our entire society, has come up against a whole group of problems that must be resolved within the framework of military reform. And the strengthening of military discipline and order is one of these. Much has already been done toward this end. But whatever the successes, the question of strengthening discipline will never be off the agenda, so to speak. Education is a continuous process, and its ultimate goal is to bring the army together and raise its combat readiness.
