The State Committee of the Russian Federation Committee on the Socioeconomic Development of the North, the Russian Federation Ministry of Economics, and the Russian Federation Ministry of Finance, jointly with the administration of Khabarovsk Kray, shall, before 1 January 1994, present to the Council of Ministers-Government of the Russian Federation a proposal on the inclusion of the entire territory of Khabarovsk Kray on the list of localities that are considered pertaining to the Far North by virtue of the conditions of delivery and transport of output of production and technical designation and of consumer goods. 2. The Russian Federation Ministry of Finance, the Russian Federation Ministry of Economics, and the Russian Federation Ministry of Fuel and Energy, for the maintenance of the cost of one kilowatt-hour of electrical energy at the level of 40 rubles [R] (rated cost), shall provide for the apportionment to the Khabarovsk Kray Administration of R19.6 billion from the Russian Federation's republic budget, as a selective targeted subsidy for November-December 1993, for compensation for the difference between the cost of electrical energy put out by the Khabarovskenergo joint-stock company and the rated cost.... (From the government decree "On Measures for Stabilization of the Socioeconomic Situation in Khabarovsk Kray for 1993-1994." Analogous documents were adopted for Maritime Kray and Sakhalin Oblast.) Khabarovsk--Last August, during a trip around the eastern regions of the country, Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin promised that the state would, without fail, close out its debt to the defense complex in September. And of course, he vowed, the government would not allow the economic potential of the Far East and the Transbaykal region, which occupy more than 40 percent of the entire Russian territory, and which for that reason play an important geopolitical role in the fate of the whole country, to collapse utterly. "We came here in order to examine the problems and to try to come to some solution," said Viktor Stepanovich, at a meeting in Khabarovsk Kray. "Not only have the circumstances in the region after your visit only failed to stabilize, they have gotten worse," reads the address to V.S. Chernomyrdin and signed by the heads of administration of nine eastern krays and oblasts five months later. The authors of the message explain the situation that has taken shape by an inadequate appraisal of the specific features of the region and by a disregard on the part of the central authorities for the interests of the Far East. The ministries and departments are in no hurry to carry out the government decree, which was adopted in October-December of last year with respect to individual territories of this extensive kray. Although there has been little success with the concrete promises that were made during last year's trips, either (at that time, in addition to the prime minister, almost all of his deputies also visited the East). If a few months ago, the defense plants of the Amur region were demanding R30-40 billion of the government for output already produced, today this debt has reached R70 billion. Because of a shortage of financial resources, many enterprises are operating at only 30-50 percent of production capacity. And since enterprises of the military-industrial complex in the Far East have a significant specific gravity, they are objectively turning into a millstone around the neck of the regional economy. Should we be surprised that at the end of last year the slump in production in that same Khabarovsk Kray amounted to 22 percent? Other state programs are also being carried out in an analogous way. For example, in 1993 the Amur region was allotted only 37 percent of the funds it needed from the federal budget for the construction of housing for servicemen who had been released into the reserves. As a result, it was possible here to rent out only 15,000 square meters of new living space, instead of 70,000. The agro-industrial complex received an amount that was short approximately R10 billion from the budget. The large debt that Moscow owes the people of the Amur region is also for the organization of freight deliveries to the northern regions. Last year they delivered everything necessary there on a timely basis. But the government is to this day in no hurry to apportion all of the financial resources promised for this. At the Khabarovsk Kray Economics Committee it was calculated that, in order to resolve the territory's most burning problems today, about R100 billion is necessary. One should take into account the fact that the Amur region, by virtue of its remoteness, must endure the pressure of completely impossible transport rates and must pay more for energy resources. All of this is shifted to the output produced here, which becomes simply noncompetitive because of its high price. How to get out of this dead-end situation--where to find the money necessary for this? At the end of January, Viktor Ishayev, head of the kray administration, was compelled to introduce an emergency regime in the area of financial guarantees. It was not from good living that he, at one press conference, even announced the temporary cessation of tax appropriations to the federal budget. True, Aleksandr Katsuba, head of the finance administration, later hastened to explain to the journalists that they had misunderstood the governor.... Although, if you think about it, the people of Amur region have absolutely nothing to deduct in any case. Everyone needs money today. The deputy head of the Khabarovsk Kray administration, who is also the chairman of the economics committee, Aleksandr Levintal, with whom I talked about today's situation in the Amur region, is convinced that until the government, for populist considerations, just patches up the financial holes, the federal budget will remind us of Trishka's caftan, which unraveled in another place every time a hole was mended. The main thing, Levintal believes, should still be the balancing of the budget, oriented, as much as possible, on tomorrow. At the very least, it is important to the people of the Far East that the offices in Moscow take heed of the specific peculiarities of a region that is compelled, simply by virtue of its remoteness, to bear considerable expenses and outlays. But standing up for their righteousness, the local administration workers must, sometimes not without a fight, overcome rigid barriers of the simply inimitable government bureaucracy. A. Levintal cited this example. In the Decree "On Measures for Stabilization of the Socioeconomic Situation in Khabarovsk Kray for 1993-1996," which was signed by V. Chernomyrdin back on 4 December, the Ministry of Economics and the Ministry of Finance were to work out within a month's time a proposal on the targeted allocation of 20 percent of customs duties for the development of the foreign economic infrastructure of the Amur region. But for the bureaucrats this document of the prime minister's did not signify a call to action. First of all, if that was necessary for the Far Easterners, then they themselves should come to Moscow and collect all the numerous signatures, again independently pushing the necessary documents through the necessary levels. Otherwise, they simply get lost in government folders. So this is already the second month that they are wandering the corridors of power. In the second place, the formula "work out and introduce for approval" by no means signifies that this should be done some time in the future. Today, for example, the negative attitude toward the given point in the government decree of the currency department of the Ministry of Finance is well known. Planning on sending this 20 percent of the collected duties for the construction of border customs crossings in Khabarovsk Kray, it is orienting itself on the interests of Russia. After all, the deductions from the profit received during the exploitation of the customs crossings would be covered by none other than the federal budget. Does Moscow really not understand this? In the end, it must be taken into account that only more than [as published] 10 million people live in the Far East and Transbaykal, which occupy, as I have already said, more than 40 percent of Russian territory. To ignore the interests of people who live under more than specific conditions is more than unwise. Let us just hope that in the near future we will not need a new Dezhnev and Khabarov to again open up and develop in Russia these severe but amazing parts.
