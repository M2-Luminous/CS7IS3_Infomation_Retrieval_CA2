Under this policy, not only laws related to the drug trade and smuggling will be made stricter, but also the administrative units responsible for stopping the drug trade will be made more effective. There is a question about the destructive nature of drugs, however, the involved people manage to avoid arrest using their wealth and legal loopholes. The present government has taken a bold step in deciding to have death sentences for drug smugglers in order to end this curse. However, it is important to catch the major criminals involved in this trade in order to abolish this cursed trade fully. All this cannot be achieved without the cooperation of the army. During the last government's efforts in this direction, some of them had gone underground and some had even established their own gangs. In this situation, a major operation with the cooperation of the army can be successful to wipe out the drug smugglers. The government should not hesitate in implementing such a plan.
