FR940725-2-00117 FR940725-2-00070 [Release No. 34&hyph;34401; File No. SR&hyph;PHLX&hyph;94&hyph;28] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to the Quote Spread Parameters for National Over-the-Counter Index (``XOC'') Options July 19, 1994. Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on June 13, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change Currently, PHLX Rule 1014, ``Obligations and Restrictions Applicable to Specialists and Registered Options Traders,'' and PHLX Floor Procedure Advice (``Advice'') F&hyph;6, ``Option Quote Spread Parameters,'' establish a maximum quote spread of $1.00 for index options with bids of $20.00 or more. The PHLX proposes to amend its rules to establish the following maximum quote spreads for National Over-the-Counter Index (``XOC'') options: $2.00 for XOC options with bids of $20.00 to less than $40.00; and $3.00 for XOC options with bids of $40.00 or more. The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, PHLX, and at the Commission. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change The PHLX proposes to amend the quote spread parameters (bid/ask differential) applicable to XOC options. The current parameters appear in PHLX Rule 1014(c) as well as Advice F&hyph;6. The PHLX proposes to widen the quote spread parameters applicable to higher-priced quotations for XOC options as follows: $2.00 for XOC options with bids of $20.00 to less than $40.00; and $3.00 for XOC options with bids of $40.00 or more. The PHLX states that quote spread parameters, also referred to as bid/ask differentials, govern the width of market quotations; 1 specifically, the maximum widths between the bid and ask for PHLX options are mandated by PHLX Rule 1014(c). Although specific parameters appear in PHLX Rule 1014(c), this rule also permits the Exchange to establish differentials other than those listed for one or more series or classes of options. The Exchange notes that although a violation of the maximum quote spread may result in a fine, 2 the quote spreads are not applicable during fast market conditions, pursuant to Advice F&hyph;10, ``Extraordinary Market Conditions (Fast Markets).'' 3 1 For example, if the maximum quote spread for an XOC option is 1/2 where the bid is $6.00, then the following is an acceptable quotation: 6&hyph;6&hyph;1/2. 2 Violations of Advice F&hyph;6 may result in the issuance of a fine pursuant to the Exchange's minor rule violation enforcement and reporting plan. 3 Advice F&hyph;10 states that in the interest of maintaining a fair and orderly market under unusual trading conditions, two floor officials may declare a ``fast market,'' during which displayed quotes are not firm and the volume guarantees of Advice A&hyph;11, ``Responsibility to Make Ten-Up Markets,'' are not applicable; nevertheless, specialists and trading crowds are required to use best efforts to update quotes and fill incoming orders in accordance with Advice A&hyph;11. Currently, the bid/ask differentials applicable to equity and index options are identical; with respect to higher-priced premiums, where the bid is $20.00 or more, the quote spread parameter is $1.00. The PHLX states that recent volatility in the XOC resulted in temporary floor official relief, pursuant to Advice F&hyph;6, 4 being granted to the XOC crowd allowing for the proposed wider quotation. The Exchange proposes to codify these wider quote spread parameters for higher-priced XOC series. 4 Advice F&hyph;6 states that relief from the established bid/ask differentials may be granted upon the receipt of approval of two floor officials. The purpose of the wider quotations is to reflect the wider bid/ask differential in the over-the-counter (``OTC'') securities underlying the XOC. In order to hedge XOC exposure, positions in these OTC securities are typically purchased and sold. According to the Exchange, the aggregate bid/ask differential for the XOC's component securities is often greater than $5.00 wide. 5 5 The bid/ask differential in the underlying securities is determined by adding the bids for such securities and dividing by 100 (the number of securities comprising the XOC) to arrive at the composite bid; to arrive at a composite, or average, offer, the offers for the underlying securities are similarly added together and divided by 100. The wider bid/ask differential particularly problematic with respect to higher-priced option series because the higher bids represent a greater premium dollar value and thus more risk. Accordingly, the Exchange proposes to widen the XOC quote spread parameter applicable to higher-priced series only. The Exchange believes that this limitation is appropriate because a $40.00 bid, for example, represents a $4,000 premium. The Exchange notes that the XOC series priced at $20.00 or less are most often chosen for investment by public customers ( i.e. , ``customers'' who are not associated with broker-dealer organizations or subject to discretionary authorization by assisted persons of broker-dealers). The PHLX received one letter stating that wider quote spread parameters for XOC options will not benefit public customers and may discourage public customers from purchasing index options on the Exchange. 6 In response to the March 24 Letter, the PHLX indicates that the Exchange's Committee on Options considered the quote spread parameters established by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. for its Nasdaq 100 Index. In addition, the PHLX notes that the XOC trading crowd has increased its minimum volume guarantee to 20 contracts for public customer orders in series with previous-close bid values of $10.00 or less. 7 6 Letter from Barry J.
