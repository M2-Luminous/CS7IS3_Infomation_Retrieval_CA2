FR940805-0-00068 FR940805-0-00022 Because of the exemption of tank vessels of less than 5,000 GT from this final rule and the low cost per vessel, the Coast Guard certifies that this rulemaking will not result in a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This rule contains collection-of-information requirements. The Coast Guard has submitted the requirements to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ), and OMB has approved them. The section number is 160.207 and the corresponding OMB approval number is OMB Control Number 2115&hyph;0557. Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this regulation does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement is not necessary. An Environmental Assessment (EA) and a Finding of No Significant Impact are available in the docket for copying or inspection where indicated under `` ADDRESSES .'' The environmental impacts of the requirements of this rule are sufficiently severable from the operational and structural measures proposed in the NPRM to allow independent evaluation.
