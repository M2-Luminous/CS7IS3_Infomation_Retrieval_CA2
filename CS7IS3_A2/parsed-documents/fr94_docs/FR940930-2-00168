FR940930-2-00168 FR940930-2-00059 The SF 424 is not to be used for the advance notification process. As in the PY 1993&hyph;1994 designation process, DOL will utilize the Advance Notice of Intent to expedite the identification of potentially competitive applicants in situations where waivers have NOT been granted. All organizations interested in being designated as section 401 grantees should submit an original and two copies of an Advance Notice of Intent. The Advance Notice is to be postmarked no later than October 15, 1994, or 15 calendar days after the date of publication of this Federal Register Notice. An organization may submit only one Advance Notice of Intent for any and all areas for which it wants to be considered. The Advance Notice of Intent is to be sent to the Chief, Division of Indian and Native American Programs, at the address cited above. Complete instructions for the Advance Notice of Intent process will be mailed to all current grantees on or about October 1, 1994. Incumbents will also receive a description of their present geographic service area at this time. New applicants may request copies of the Advance Notice of Intent instructions by writing to the Chief, Division of Indian and Native American Programs, at the address cited above. DOL's first step in the designation process is to determine which areas have more than one potential applicant for designation, and whether any waivers have been granted. For those areas for which more than one organization submits an Advance Notice of Intent, each such organization will be notified of the situation, and will be apprised of the identity of the other organization(s) applying for that area. Such notification will consist of providing affected applicants (including incumbents who have not submitted Advance Notices of Intent) with copies of all Advance Notices submitted for their requested areas. The notification will state that organizations are encouraged to work out any conflicting requests among themselves, and that a final Notice of Intent should be submitted by the required postmark of January 1, 1995, deadline (see Part IV, Notice of Intent, below). Under the Advance Notice of Intent process, it is DOL policy that, to the extent possible within the regulations, a geographic service area and the applicant that will operate a section 401 program in that area are to be determined by the Native American community to be served by the program. In the event the Native American community cannot resolve differences, applicants should take special care with their final Notices of Intent to ensure that they are complete and fully responsive to all matters covered by the preferential hierarchy and rating systems discussed in this notice. Information provided in the Advance Notice of Intent process shall not be considered as a final submission as referenced at 20 CFR 632.11. The Advance Notice of Intent is a procedural mechanism to facilitate the designation process. The regulations do not provide for formal application for designation through the Advance Notice of Intent.
