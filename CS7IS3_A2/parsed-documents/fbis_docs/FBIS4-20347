To analyze 1994's macroeconomic regulation and control policy results, we will first review the economic setting that caused the Central Committee to take macroeconomic regulation and control steps. I. The State of the Economy From 1992 to the First Half of 1993 In early 1992, the inspiration of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's southern-tour speeches set off an upsurge of faster economic growth everywhere throughout China so that, once the state of economic stagnation that had been extant since the improvement and rectification campaign was changed, economic growth in all areas steadily jumped to new heights. But as China's new economic system based on a market economy had not yet been established, various flaws of the old system resurfaced. All areas competed to build new shops and stores, reexpanding the scale of capital construction in particular, while "bottleneck" industries, such as power and transportation, did not grow correspondingly, causing a tense situation of supply not meeting demand for both commodities and capital. Statistics show that our 1992 GNP was up 13 percent from 1991's, while this tense macroeconomic state intensified steadily in the first half of 1993, becoming a glaring threat to economic growth. Along with this economic phenomenon of too fast economic growth, our macroeconomic financial order during this period was in chaos, spurring public capital-demand to exceed normal limits. This was seen mainly as: 1. Interbank borrowing was enormous, with quite a few money markets converting to currency markets. As direct central-bank control of the credit scale restricted to a certain extent enterprise loan-demand, while call markets grew rapidly through financial-system reform, borrowing became a key source of capital for enterprises to breach state control. As the central bank and state specialized banks in all areas also wanted, due to a variety of reasons, to do all possible to satisfy these enterprise aspirations, their capital outflow in non-loan forms was huge. It was reported that other state-bank fund-source account-headings in 1992 were down 152.43 billion yuan, or 42.8 percent of the increased loans for the same period. And in the first four months of 1993, they were down another 79.909 billion yuan. Net lending by specialized banks was up 59.32 billion yuan in 1992, as well as up again somewhat for the first four months of 1993. By May 1993, 14.3 percent of loan capital was being used by non-money markets. 2. All types of fundraising activities arose one after another. While these funds were all beyond-plan, making it hard to ascertain their scale precisely, we can see from the results they caused the extent of the fundraising impact. a) This fundraising was without exception through means that promised interest rates higher than those for bank savings deposits, with the widespread extent of the fundraising activities raising real capital prices (interest rates) above 20 percent. b) The huge gap between these fundraising-capital interest rates and official ones caused a large national savings-decline and a bank-payment crisis. It is calculated that real savings deposits were down at least 80 billion yuan from the savings deposit balance trend-value, or 22.4 percent of the 1992 loan increase. 3. Development-zone, real-estate, and stock fevers attracted much construction capital. As much as 75-80 percent of loan funds were loaned at high interest to certain economic subjects that used them for purposes, such as real estate and stock speculation, with many enterprises and institutions even drawing on regular production working capital or high-interest fundraising to take part in speculative selling. So real estate and stock prices climbed time and again, showing a false market prosperity of supply not meeting demand, and forming to a certain extent a so-called "bubble economy." In addition, foreign-exchange conversion prices, also due to many reasons, were speculated in a short period to the boiling point, with the real exchange rate of the RMB to the dollar reaching 11 : 1 for a time. Such a macroeconomic state unavoidably had the following consequences: a) funds were in severly short supply for priority enterprises and construction projects that played a mainstay role in national economic growth, as well as for indispensable farm products and foreign-trade purchasing activities, impacting normal economic activities; b) the "bubble economy" expanded rapidly, tending to flow over into other economic sectors; c) inflation remained high, in danger of high-speed growth under "bubble-economy" conditions; d) high inflation was about to severely obstruct the sound growth of our national economy. So the Central Committee officially decided in June 1993 to apply macroeconomic regulation and control to national economic operations. II. Macroeconomic Regulation and Control Application and Results Directed at the state of operation of our national economy, the state adopted the principles of rectifying the financial order, optimizing the industrial structure, raising economic efficiency, and promoting balanced, rapid, and sustained economic growth, by doing all possible to abandon the indiscriminate method of all-out tight money, in order to ensure the funds needed for farm and sideline product purchasing, normal production by priority enterprises, national priority construction projects, and foreign-trade purchasing and operations. So we adopted mainly the following regulation and control policies: 1. We tightened overall monetary demand, strictly controlling overall credit. The Central Committee instructed all areas to conduct a one-time, all-out examination and verification of our project and fund-use lineup, deciding to halt or slow projects that did not conform to national industrial policy, did not have construction funding, and had not been examined and approved per stipulation, to strictly control the construction of new projects, and to not approve in principle any new construction projects for the last 4 months of 1993. We tightened credit so that all bank loans grew only 99.3 billion yuan for the first half of 1993, 26.3 billion yuan less than for the same period in 1992. 2. We regulated the economy through market-economy means. In May and July 1993, the central bank raised bank deposit and loan interest rates twice, with the finance sector also correspondingly raising 1993 treasury bill interest rates. Based on improving foreign-exchange management, the pertinent state sector gave up some of its foreign-exchange intervention in market exchange rates, stabilizing the rate of exchange between the RMB and the dollar at about 8.7:1. 3. We improved our financial order through administrative means. a) We made a few simple rules to be observed by all concerned in the financial system: all illegal lending was to be immediately stopped and conscientiously cleared up, with deadlines set for recouping illegally loaned funds; no financial institutions were allowed to covertly raise deposit and loan interest rates, or collect kickbacks from loan subjects; the input of credit funds by banks into all economic entities run by them was to be immediately stopped, with banks having to completely dislink themselves from all of their own economic entities. b) We strictly enforced tax-revenue policy. The tax-revenue sector had to strictly control tax reductions and exemptions, strictly control spending, and further cut back the growth of social-group purchasing power. c) We cleared up compensated fundraising activities. Except for the sale per stipulation of stocks, enterprise bonds, financial bonds, investment-fund bonds, and trust-beneficiary bonds, all fundraising activity compensated by repayment of capital with interest or payment of dividends and bonuses to capital contributors was temporarily stopped. We particularly stipulated that compensated fundraising activities by state organs, institutions, and social groups directed at employees and the public were prohibited. Such a large-scale macroeconomic regulation and control policy produced in a very short time remarkable results: 1. Industrial production, while maintaining high-speed growth, fell steadily, with the excessive growth momentun of fixed assets controlled somewhat. State Statistical Bureau information shows that state-unit investment growth, in comparison to the same periods in 1992, was 70.7 percent for the first half of 1993, but 66 percent for the third quarter, down 9 points. As to investment sources, the ratio of self-raised funds at all levels also correspondingly fell from 86 percent to 76 percent, with the industrial growth rate down from its first-half of 25.5 percent to 22.5 percent for September, and down again to 16.4 percent for October. 2. Our financial situation and order began to improve. This could be seen mainly as: a) The currency-input growth-trend slowed. While our money supply growth reached a high of 54 percent for the first half, four consecutive months of lower input in the last half in relation to the same periods in 1992 brought our market money-supply growth down by the end of October to 38.6 percent, 15 points lower than for the first half. b) Specialized bank payment-readiness funds quickly rebounded, reaching about 10 percent by the end of October. In addition, the PBC injected 20 billion yuan of funds into all financing centers, resolving bank-payment problems, and starting to invigorate normal interbank lending; c) The illegal bank-lending phenomenon began to be corrected, with a net of over 30 billion yuan in loaned funds recouped, or one-third of that recoupable. d) All arbitrary fundraising began to be curbed, with actions, such as high-interest fundraising and financial swindling, severely cracked down on. e) The higher interest-rate policy showed marked results, with savings deposits climbing monthly to reach a balance of 1.3867 trillion yuan by the end of September, up 232.2 billion yuan from that at the end of 1992. f) Foreign exchange conversion prices stabilized at the policy-anticipated control level. 3. The development-zone and real-estate fevers in all areas cooled somewhat, with real estate prices in coastal zones down about 20 percent. Correspondingly, capital goods supplies loosened, with investment-product prices back down somewhat. According to a report in ZHONGHUA GONG-SHANG BAO [CHINA INDUSTRIAL-COMMERCIAL REPORT] for October, the domestic commodity market price index was down 2.8 percent, including drops of 6 percent for ferrous metals, 2.3 percent for nonferrous metals, 0.8 percent for industrial chemicals and light industry, and 2.6 percent for machinery and electronics products. 4. Loans to ensure national priority projects increased sharply. As much as 93.9 percent of the funds for 112 state-loan-invested national priority projects were provided. For 65 priority projects in the transportation, post and telecommunications, petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, light textiles, and other industries, all of the loan funds in 1993 plans were provided; 71 percent of technological upgrading funds were provided, up 7.5 points from the same period in 1992; foreign-trade loans grew over 10 points more than foreign-trade exports; farm and sideline-product purchasing loans grew to 12 billion yuan for October, with the Agricultural Bank having specially set aside over 22 billion yuan in preparation for purchasing. While this shows that this macroeconomic regulation and control policy's objectives had basically been or were being realized, many negative regulation and control effects still needed much attention. 1. Enterprise operating-fund difficulties remained quite glaring. In order to alleviate these difficulties, the PBC issued 150 billion yuan in basic money supply to specialized banks from late August to late October, increasing the lending capability of specialized banks. But while this should have improved the overshortage of funds generally, a time-lag was involved, meaning that we still needed to see if the lending structural reform was appropriate. 2. Enterprise inventories grew, with losses up and economic efficiency declining. By the end of September, finished products were tying up 152.67 billion yuan in funds, up 14 percent from the same period in 1992; State Statistical Bureau data on inventories of 75 key manufactured goods showed 54 up from the beginning of 1993, with 11 goods, such as rolled steel, tin, and concentrated nitric acid, up more than 100 percent. By the end of September, inventories were up from the beginning of 1993 by 2.664 million tons for cement, 53,400 vehicles for automobiles, and 4.03 million tons for rolled steel goods throughout China. For October, finished-goods inventories of budgeted state-owned industrial enterprises were up 19 percent from the same period in 1992, with realized profits down 21.8 percent from September. As many as 37.8 percent of enterprises were sustaining losses, which losses were up 9.1 percent from September. "Triangular debt" resurged, with mutual arrears recurring, leaving net accounts-due by the end of October topping 210 billion yuan, up more than 40 billion yuan from the end of July. 3. Fixed-asset investments continued to grow too fast. While the macroeconomic regulation and control steps had controlled new projects that had not yet gone into construction in 1993, the building of new shops that had begun in all areas was certainly not genuinely cut back, with national priority construction projects striving to complete plans, making it impossible to reduce the investment scale in the short term. Fixed-assets investment for the first three quarters was still up over 65 percent from the same period in 1992, leaving market-demand pull and inflationary pressures certainly not markedly lighter. 4. Final public demand showed a weakening trend, with markets slightly soft. For October, overall retail commodity turnover corrected for inflation actually grew only 5 percent; investment-product demand corrected for inflation actually grew less than in 1992; export demand remained slow, with customs exports for October up only 5.1 percent from the same period in 1992. In addition, commercial-purchasing zeal was not high, with net commercial purchases of manufactured goods for October up only 10.5 percent, 16.1 points lower than for June. 5. In clear contrast to the slight downturn in investment-product prices, consumer-goods market prices saw a sustained upswing. For the first three quarters, overall retail prices rose 12 percent, while the cost-of-living price index rose 14 percent, including 18.9 percent for the 35 large and midsize cities, to reach a peak-state since economic reform. Prices in all areas throughout China rose simultaneously in all dimensions, forming a moderate degree of inflation. III. An Analysis of the Macroeconomic Regulation and Control Policy's Effects While this macroeconomic regulation and control policy was generally correct in direction and appropriate in degree, to basically achieve a "soft landing" without a sharp economic retrenchment, such macroeconomic regulation and control through mostly administrative measures would have damaged to a great extent the regular operations of many enterprises. Phenomena, such as the heavier "triangular debt" and soft market sales for enterprises at the time, showed that the macroeconomic regulation and control was too sharp in force, leaving an appropriate easing of the money supply the inevitable option for maintaining a certain economic-growth rate. Our economic operations after the macroeconomic regulation and control showed a seemingly contradictory economic phenomenon. On one hand, higher inventories, declining efficiency, and soft markets showed inadequate market demand; on the other, too high investment growth and rapid retail-price rises showed an abundance of funds and strong demand. As to funding, while the central bank had recently issued 150 billion yuan in basic money supply, enterprises were again forming "triangular debt" on a large scale due to fund shortages. We hold that two basic factors created this situation. a) The macroeconomic regulation and control impact still existed, and was going to for a short time, as the new funds injected by the state had not yet reached all economic players. b) This macroeconomic regulation and control was structurally characterized by a guarantee of priority-project fund demand, with a cutback of nonpriority-project fund demand. But in our current economic operations, nonpriority projects were sharply driving market demand, with the demand inadequacy created by the fund shortage for this sector lasting for quite a long period of time. So as time passed, the conflicts in our economic operations would be bound to improve somewhat. In order to prevent the recurrence of such macroeconomic overheating, the state still had to make follow-up policy adjustments in many areas. As to the factors producing this "bubble economy," on one hand, the severe market imbalance created by administrative monopoly had artificially raised market prices in many fields, thus causing excessive profiteering and speculation; on the other, our financial system's responsibilities were hard to separate, with policies imbalanced, leaving large amounts of funds, induced by market interests, to successfully detour policy restraints. So for our financial system, development zones, real estate market, and securities market, we had to combine administrative regulation and control with market reforms, by clarifying all policy limits, as well as making a timely adjustment in line with economic reform and growth needs, in order to prevent "the exploitation of authority for private market gain," and to control the direct factors driving economic overheating. To keep our national economy growing in a sustained and balanced way, we had to root out the basic factors leading to economic overheating. This grim macroeconomic state caused mainly by changes in the field of finance was essentially part of the economic-fluctuation cycle of expansion -- retrenchment -- expansion of our traditional planned-economy system, being of an unavoidable nature. As current systems, such as investment, finance, tax revenue, and enterprise, still largely placed soft budgetary restraints on enterprises, forcing local microeconomic interests on our conversion to a market-economy system, investment expansion was an inherent demand of enterprises and local governments in all areas. While this demand had to acquire funding support from the field of finance, our banking system per se was still in a reform process, unavoidably still burdened with the dual responsibility for both policy and commercial loans. As commercial loans were consistent with their own interests, banks were bound to transfer some policy-loan funds to commercial-loan funds, through means, such as irregular lending of funds and issuing of IOUs, leaving the priority-guaranteed policy-loan-fund shortage to the central bank, for a bottom-up forcing of the state to increase the money supply. It is thus obvious that the nonmarket-oriented system was the basic reason for the macroeconomic expansion touched off by market reform. So promoting sustained and balanced economic growth under the new conditions meant establishing an effective market-economy system. In addition to investment, taxation, market-circulation, and enterprise-system reform, our currently most important task is to establish a more rational financial system. This will include: 1) Establishing a central bank with independent authority, whose primary task will be to maintain the value of the currency and prevent excessive inflation, while paying attention to policy loans. 2) Thoroughly reorganizing state specialized banks into commercial banks, to carry out businesslike operations with no further responsibility for policy loans. 3) Actively pushing forward with the establishment of a securities market, by increasing stock and bond supply to meet market demand. 4) Appropriately easing restrictions on private financial institutions, to make the financial industry more competitive in regular market operations. In such a financial framework, the state will have a solid system-basis for developing indirect macroeconomic regulation and control, while market restraints between enterprises and banks will correspondingly strengthen. In order to smoothly convert from our existing system to a market-economy system, macroeconomic policy has to pay great attention to quantitative control. In light of China's realities, our macroeconomic policy must curb economic overheating and excessive inflation, by regulating and controlling in line with set quantitative criteria. But in issuing currency, we not only must consider economic growth rates and a sustainable degree of inflation, but also have to accomodate a certain amount of economic-monetarization factors. In China's future economic reforms, two areas will obviously increase our economic-monetarization extent. 1) The commercialization of production factors, such as the rise of the securities market, development of the real estate market, and other forms of market-building, will objectively absorb a lot of capital, absolutely increasing public monetary demand. 2) The oil-price reform already set by the state will be bound to sharply change China's price system. As oil is the major energy source for modern industry, having a huge chain-reaction on downstream industries, price reform involving mainly higher crude prices will inevitably raise all of our prices to new highs. So it will be only by acting on historical experience and real needs to set a rational economic-monetarization rate, that will enable us to prevent severe inflation, while retaining full market-economy vitality.
