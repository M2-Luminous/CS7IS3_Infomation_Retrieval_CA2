Cooperation with France was very interesting for the Czech Republic, Baudys said, because besides Sweden, France was the only country that was increasing its military budget for the purpose of modernising its conventional weapons. The reason for the modernisation programme was not that France had outdated military technology but that "it realises that after the collapse of the bipolar world, that longed-for time when all of us head towards peace has not yet come. There are various pitfalls. They just want to be ready and have a good army, which is France's tradition," he said. Baudys today began a three-day official visit to France at the invitation of his French counterpart Francois Leotard. Baudys told reporters both countries were preparing for the first joint Franco-Czech military exercises, to be held in June this year. Beginning in the Czech Republic and continuing in France, they will represent a very good foundation for future cooperation and resume the interwar tradition of good Franco-Czechoslovak relations in the military sphere which were interrupted by the communist regime, he said.
