Kim met Kakizawa who flew into Seoul earlier and discussed North Korea's nuclear situation, Chu said. They agreed that the situation is at a critical point for not only South Korea and Japan but for the entire Northeast Asia and the Pacific region in terms of peace and stability, the spokesman said. The Japanese foreign minister promised his country's utmost efforts within the boundary of the Constitution to participate in U.N. sanctions against North Korea, Chu said after the Kim-Kakizawa talks. "The foreign minister said Japan takes the problem as its own and explained he will deliver such stance when he visits China and seek Beijing's cooperation in resolving the problem through the United Nations," said Chu. Kakizawa apologized for the controversial remarks by former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano, who said Japan was not an aggressor in World War II but just trying to free Asian colonies from European grip. "It was wrong for former Minister Nagano to say such nonsense and discomfort South Korea," he was quoted as saying.
