In addition, the order prohibits TAALS from maintaining any agreement, understanding, plan or program to: (1) Limit, restrict, or mandate the length of time that interpreters, translators, or other language specialists work in a given period, or for which they are paid for preparation or study; (2) Limit, restrict, or mandate the number of interpreters, translators, or other language specialists used for a job or type of job; (3) Limit, restrict, or mandate the payment or reimbursement for travel or the travel time of interpreters, translators, or other language specialists, or otherwise prevent consumers from receiving any advantages, based on travel arrangements or geographic location, by regulating domiciles of members or by other means; or (4) Limit, restrict, or mandate the equipment used in performing interpretation, translation, or other language services. Under the order, ``fees'' are defined to include all cash or non-cash charges, rates, benefits, or other compensation for interpretation, translation or other language services, including but not limited to, lodging, meals, subsistence and travel allowances, reimbursements for expenses, cancellation fees, and compensation for time not worked, travel time or briefing time. ``Language specialist'' means one who performs ``other language services,'' which are defined to refer to any services that involve the conversion of any form of expression from one language into another or any services incident to or related to interpretation and translation. Consequently, when the order mentions ``language specialists,'' it includes anyone who rents equipment, organizes conferences, performs teleconferencing or pr√©cis writing, supervises or coordinates interpreters, reviews or revises translations, or provides recordings of interpretations.
