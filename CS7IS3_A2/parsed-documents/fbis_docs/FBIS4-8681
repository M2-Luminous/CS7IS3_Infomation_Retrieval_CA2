It appears that all of them were pleased to come and that they regard this meeting as meaningful. [passage omitted] Our discussion was very intensive, and when it was over it seemed to us that it was, in fact, a very short discussion. We do not consider it to be the culmination of the meeting but only its beginning. We will have many more discussions before tomorrow afternoon when we leave. In the conversation we just had, each of the presidents delivered his own opening statement in which he contemplated the position of the Central European region, above all in connection with the processes of European integration. We have arrived at the consensus that while we met precisely in this setup, it does not mean we are colluding against someone else, or even that we consider ourselves better or more advanced than others. We are meeting as representatives of countries that feel their mutual closeness, not only in geographical terms but also in terms of values, cultural traditions, and history. No differences between individual participants appeared in the opening statements we gave. It turned out that there was complete accord among us as far as the most general topic was concerned. So much for the brief opening. The presidents can speak for themselves when answering your questions. [passage omitted]
