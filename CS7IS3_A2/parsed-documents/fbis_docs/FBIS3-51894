He has warned that this phenomenon has been on the increase recently as a result of two separate circumstances. They are the powerlessness of the Venezuelan government to deal with the lack of security on the one hand, and on the second, the indifference of the Colombian government. In view of this situation, he believes not only that the Venezuelan Government is incapable of resolving this problem, but that there is also a need for the cooperation of the Colombian Government for the purpose of developing a coordinated plan for military and police intelligence strategy in these areas, along with a socio-economic program. This is because one of the reasons irregular forces have penetrated the zone and the peasant population living there, including the Yukpa and Bari Indians, is the inhospitable conditions to be found in that environment. This is true in the sectors of health care, roadways, and disease. The Venezuelan children there are even attending classes outdoors, under the trees. They are being instructed in the history of Colombia and are singing its national anthem. "According to information we in the Defense Commission have obtained," Vera said, "there are 50,000 residents who have no country in this frontier area. They are the children of Venezuelans and undocumented Colombians who were born in a no-man's-land where they are recognized neither as Colombians nor Venezuelans. They have become a potential army that could in the short run plunge the peace and labor and productive tranquillity in this region into chaos. "It is for this reason that the kidnappings that previously occurred on the ranches and deep in the mountain areas are now occurring only a few kilometers from urban centers. And the public can be sure that within a very short time, such kidnappings will be happening in the cities as well, with politicians, industrialists, bankers, and other leading personalities as their targets," he warned. For these reasons, he believes that Venezuela should seriously review its process of integration with Colombia, because in connection with the binational agreements, and in the specific matter of the stolen cars, Colombia has in many cases failed to honor its commitment to return assets to the Venezuelan Government. Vera warned that in the specific case of the kidnappings in this frontier area, there is one factor that is a cause of great concern. He painted the following picture for us. "In the course of the peace talks between the government and the Colombian guerrillas in Bogota, there was agreement on certain zones to be spared--areas in which the irregular forces and the authorities agreed that the army will not engage in action. "One of these `neutral' zones," he said, "is on the right bank of the Machiques-Colon. And, naturally, as a result of these negotiations, the Colombian Government is not interested in reactivating its attacks on the guerrilla forces there." According to Deputy Angel Vera, the interests of Bogota will be served, from the strategic and tactical points of view, if the problem in this frontier area continues, instead of having it prevail in the urban zones of its main cities. In the opinion of this parliamentarian, integration with Colombia, seen from this realistic approach, has become a matter of the export of an instability problem to Venezuela.
