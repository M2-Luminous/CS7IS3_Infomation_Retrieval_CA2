The bill received 247 votes "for", 51 "against", and another 87 deputies abstained. The bill fell 53 votes short of the two-thirds approval needed in the 450-member State Duma, the parliament's lower chamber. Liberal Democratic representatives said they abstained from the vote because they believe the regulations concerning the nomination and confirmation of candidates for positions on the Constitutional Court need to be changed. The bill, prepared in accordance with the Constitution, declares that candidates are to be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Federation Council, the upper house. The Liberal Democratic Party would like to see the candidates subject to nation-wide discussion. Deputies from the Communist Party voted against the bill, saying that the price for their support was a series of important amendments. They think that the Constitutional Court should have the power to independently raise the most important issues, that the State Duma should be able to propose court candidates to the president, that judges should be limited to ten years of service on the country's highest court, and that all the court's current judges should be re-elected to the expanded Constitutional Court. The Communists' demands would automatically necessitate a constitutional amendment, since they contradict the basic law, Deputy Chairman of the Duma Mikhail Mitikov pointed out. The State Duma committee on legislation and judical-legal reform has been ordered to continue work on the bill. Committee Chairman Vladimir Isakov announced that there is no "tragedy" in the fact that the document, which has already been agreed upon by all the branches of power and is supported by a majority of the Duma deputies, will have to be refined some more. He expressed his assurance that the Duma would be able to reach an agreement.
