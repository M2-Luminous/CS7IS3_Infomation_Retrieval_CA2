According to the proposal's proponents, such an announcement would enable the three states to be more moderate, less threatening and more careful in the future. This proposal appears in a book published by the Foreign Relations Council and authored by Admiral Crowe, Bundy, and a physicist, Cindy Drill. The book, which deals with lowering nuclear threats, contains a chapter on Israel, India, and Pakistan. This is the first time that such a proposal has been made in print by people with their background in security. Although they do not hold official position in the Clinton Administration, the three, and especially Crowe, are close to the government's highest levels. The authors state that such recognition would require amendment of the international agreement on nonproliferation of nuclear weapons so the three states can become parties to it. Israel, Pakistan, and India are not signatories to the nonproliferation treaty, which identifies as nuclear states only those countries that conducted atomic testing before 1967. The treaty is scheduled to be updated, apparently by amendment, in 1995. In addressing this issue, the authors state that Israel, India, and Pakistan are, in effect, "undeclared nuclear states," and contend that Israel definitely possesses sizable holdings of nuclear warheads. By their estimate, India possesses the know-how and materials required for rapid production of nuclear warheads whenever it wants. Pakistan's situation resembles India's, although at a lower level. The authors believe that when neighboring states contend that these three are nuclear nations, the charge is true. Israel is said to engage in a deceptive and hypocritical nuclear policy. According to the authors, Israel argues that secrecy causes its neighbors less worry, but it also does not want to worry its friends, particularly the United States, by stating that it has nuclear weapons. This position has increasingly led to difficulties, so that many reject it as absurd and even aggressive. The authors believe that the three nations are hurt politically by their claim that they do not possess nuclear weapons and that each of them is paying a heavy political price for it. Israel, as a result, finds it difficult to explain that its neighbors have nothing to fear from its nuclear weapons unless they seek to destroy her. The authors state that in the current situation, in which people shut their eyes to Israel's nuclear arsenal, talks on limiting nuclear weapons in the Middle East are meaningless. In the authors' view, Israel, India, and Pakistan desired nuclear weapons for compelling defensive reasons, whether to deter enemies or to repel major invasions of their lands. One can debate the gravity of this threat, but their neighbors must consider that each of the three, and each one on the way, sees nuclear arms as defensive weapons. The fact that the three nations guard their nuclear weapons in secrecy indicates a degree of moderation. It is certainly true that the nuclear arms in their possession do not represent a threat of aggression. If they now reveal openness, it will be possible to deal with them in a realistic way rather than as though they do not exist. Like the five big nuclear states, India, Israel and Pakistan will be able to display a large measure of moderation. As for Israel, the authors say that if the United States were to announce that it regards Israel as nuclear state, that would place the situation in a realistic light and undoubtedly make it easier for Israel to tell the truth. The problem is that governments do not like it when other nations give away their secrets, and certainly not nuclear ones. Thus, the best way out of the thicket, in their opinion, would be an independent Israeli decision to declare that it has nuclear weapons. Official Israeli sources queried about the proposal said that although it has some interesting and positive features, it clearly is also fraught with possibilities for enormous political complications.
