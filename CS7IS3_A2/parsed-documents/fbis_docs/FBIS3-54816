The authors and proponents of "shock therapy" continue to claim that everything is fine and that, although we may be bogged down for the time being, we will gradually reach terra firma.... So what can we expect in 1994? Even going by the official Ministry of the Economy forecasts, there will be a further drop in the population's real income. And the middle class -- the largest group, on whose shoulders the national economy has always depended -- will be hit hardest. In the new year approximately 33 percent of the population will have a per capita income less than the minimum wage, and the difference in income levels between our poorest fellow citizens and the new fat cats will increase 11-fold. Academician S. Shatalin, the well-known "marketeer," has said the following: "The Russian Government is pursuing a not very well-conceived or responsible policy in this area. Governments throughout the civilized world regulate the population's income, and nobody considers this a violation of the laws of the development of the market economy...." Take the United States, for instance. Business circles there reacted loyally to the ousting of the right-wing Republican government by the center-right Democrats. They were hopeful of tipping the balance between the "market" and "nonmarket" sectors of society toward a better resolution of the social problems which have deteriorated even in that prosperous country as a result of the latest economic crisis. According to information published in BIRZHEVYYE VEDOMOSTI by Yevgeniy Boshnyakov, director of the "Issledovateli Rynka" enterprise, America has its own macroeconomists, whom our "apprentices" imitate. The U.S. Democrats even involved some of them in their election campaign. But, once victory was assured, none of them was taken into the leadership -- electioneering is one thing, while actually running a state is quite another. That is why in America the transition did not result in any shocks or general confrontation between such usually hostile forces as entrepreneurs, workers, and the nonmarket section of society. Russia has done the same as America, only...back to front -- power has been handed over to extremists from science and production. And, naturally, society has suffered a terrible shock, the economy is in an unprecedented crisis, and the executive is meeting with opposition and hostility from such economically different forces as state and private employers, stockbrokers and bankers, the military and pensioners. What now? Despite the fact that the mutual offsetting of debts is anathema to government officials, this will clearly be unavoidable in the new year, otherwise we will have hyperinflation again -- but this time because of the wholesale reduction in commodity supply. In the opinion of the well-known economist Algimantas Lebedinskas [name as transliterated], squeezing the money supply in absolute terms after reducing the supply of goods is a sheer illusion. Moreover, the country can expect mass unemployment -- requiring state spending that the state budget will hardly be able to withstand owing to the tax collection shortfall. So the Russian economy can look forward not to stabilization -- as the monetarist reformers stubbornly promise -- but new upheavals. Perhaps even stronger upheavals than last year.
