Tsutomu Tanaka, vice minister of the Economic Planning Agency (EPA), told a Tokyo audience he personally agrees with the agency's forecast for the year that began this month. But he said the EPA has not ruled that the economy has hit bottom, which Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii and Bank of Japan governor Yasushi Mieno indicated Thursday may be nearing. Noting that the official forecast is more bullish than that of most private economists, Tanaka suggested that they "tend to underestimate the strength of business recovery" in reversing from the nation's worst postwar slump. He also noted that some economists have recently raised their forecasts to 1.4 percent growth for the fiscal year. They previously had predicted about 0.5 percent growth on average. "The overall economy is still sluggish," he said but added that signs of "brightness" have recently spread beyond personal consumption, the biggest single engine for economic growth that has rebounded since late last year. Households have nearly finished adjusting to "excessive" purchasing of consumer durables in the late 1980s boom, and consumer sentiment will continue to improve in coming months, Tanaka said. On another major component for recovery, Tanaka acknowledged that the agency's forecast of roughly flat fiscal 1994 corporate capital spending "contrasts very sharply with private forecasts," which show a third straight year of decline. Tanaka said there are "signs of bottoming out" in machinery orders, which anticipate movements in capital spending. That trend is not clear yet, he said, adding that a fixed investment turnaround is necessary for economic recovery. He cited concern over employment, but said the worst fears for job security are over. Conditions will worsen a bit further before recovering, he said, but predicted little chance of another "major adjustment process." Another area of uncertainty is foreign exchange, with companies needing the yen to fall to around 117 to the dollar to "feel comfortable" about their profits, Tanaka said. The dollar closed Friday in Tokyo at 103.95 yen, up 0.95 yen from the previous day. If the yen stays high, boosting prices of Japanese exports in other currencies and crimping the yen value of repatriated profits, "the impact of that on the economy will not be negligible," Tanaka said. But he played down concerns that the delays in passing the fiscal 1994 budget, due to the nation's political turmoil, could harm the economy. Citing a backlog of investment to be executed from the current provisional budget and the third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993, he said, "There will be a smooth continuation of the budget investment programs despite the fact that the budget process is delayed." Tanaka also predicted no significant inflationary impact from much-criticized hikes in public fees.
