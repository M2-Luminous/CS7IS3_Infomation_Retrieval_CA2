The mechanism of action of ozone on microbial cells is the subject of intense debate. It is clear that most of the ozone, rather than penetrate the cell deeply, reacts with membranes and other surface structures to prevent the development of the microbe, thereby killing the microbe. Noting that other oxidants induce the in-cell formation of a new compound -- 2-methylbutane-1,2,3,4-tetraol-2,4- cyclopyrophosphate -- in a number of bacteria, the researchers here chose to use ozone to determine whether the mechanism of action of that phenomenon hinges on an initial removal of electrons from the active centers of the enzymes containing NADPH or flavin, or on subsequent reduction of some group, or on the triggering of secondary oxidants formed after the single-electron reduction of oxygen to a superoxide radical. The Gram-positive bacteria Brevibacterium ammoniagenes ATCC 6872, Micrococcus luteus of the Fleming 2665 strain, and Mycobacterium smegmatis VKM As-1171 were cultivated to the end of the logarithmic growth phase at 30ï¿½C in flasks with 200 ml of a medium containing 1 percent peptone, 0.3 percent yeast extract, and 0.5 percent NaCl. The cells were then ozonized, which produced ozone via electrosynthesis. The researchers found the most critical feature of the mechanism of action to be the ozone-induced oxidative activation of enzymes for the synthesis of the new cyclopyrophosphate. Membrane permeability was, by and large, left intact, despite major changes in membrane lipids. Lengthy ozonization leads to the disappearance of intracellular ammonigenin hydroxylamine; with short-term exposure, however, redox status is preserved.
