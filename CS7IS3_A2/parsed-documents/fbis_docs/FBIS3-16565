The depressurised plane was flying at a low altitude and might have been mistaken for an alien craft by the warring sides in the enclave, the experts told ITAR-TASS on Friday. They added that there are enough weapons in the combat zone, including the "Stinger" missiles, capable of destroying low-altitude targets. Experts said their fears are also based on the fact that contact with the plane was lost all of a sudden and parts of the craft discovered on the ground show that the explosion had occurred in the air. Such character of damages "happens after a strike of an anti- aircraft missile," experts said. They also said it is necessary to find out why the plane had deviated from the pre-set route. The experts categorically denied a possibility that the plane was going to land in stepanakert as the runway there is too short for such a class of aircraft. The crew undoubtedly knew about that, they added.
