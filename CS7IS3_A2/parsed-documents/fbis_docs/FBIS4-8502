FBIS4-8502 "dreeu072_d_94002" FBIS-EEU-94-072 Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 SLOVAKIA More Deputies Expected To Defect From HZDS More Deputies Expected To Defect From HZDS AU1404134494 AU1404134494 BFN [Editorial Report] Slovak newspapers have recently carried several items dealing with the possibility of another group of Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) deputies leaving the formerly ruling movement, thereby securing for the current government coalition 90 votes needed to pass constitutional laws. Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak on 9 April on pages 1 and 3 carries a 1,100-word interview with Vladimir Bajan, former deputy chairman of the HZDS Club of Deputies in the Slovak Parliament and now a leader of Prime Minister Moravcik's "Alternative of Political Realism," by Martin Krno entitled "Blow Below the Belt." In the interview, the place and date of which are not given, Bajan denounces the "StB [communist-era secret service] methods" practiced in the HZDS Club of Deputies and indicates that another nine deputies are to defect from the HZDS parliamentary group. In the PRAVDA interview, Bajan reacts to the "publication in the press" of "sworn statements" signed by HZDS deputies at a meeting of the HZDS leadership at Horne Plachtince in November 1993, in which they pledged that they would relinquish their mandates as deputies if they ever leave the HZDS. Bajan confirms that he signed such a statement "under threats" last November but denies that he had violated it by retaining his seat in parliament: "I kept it [the sworn statement] because I did not leave the HZDS. I was expelled from it." Speaking about the circumstances of the Horne Plachtince pledge, Bajan says: "All day long we were clarifying the position of confidence, and, in the evening, they presented a statement they had brought finished from Bratislava in the morning. We considered this a blow below the belt. First, 21 persons, including Ivan Gasparovic, chairman of the parliament, refused to sign. We considered this quite normal. Gasparovic is a lawyer and knew that this is outrageous. Then Meciar said he would resign along with the whole government. He said he would call upon his people to take to the streets and oppose the deputies." After the "prime minister's threats," Bajan continues, Gasparovic asked the deputies "not to be foolish because the declaration has no legal validity, and if it calms the situation in the HZDS, it is necessary to sign it." According to Bajan, the statements were then entrusted to Gasparovic in a sealed envelope. Because they have now appeared in the press, Bajan says, "I would like to ask Gasparovic whether someone has broken into his office." Bajan views the publication of the statements, which include the home addresses and phone numbers of the signatories, as "illegal" and a "dangerous precedent" and announces that he will ask the General Prosecutor's Office to investigate the leak: "All day long scores of people are calling, threatening the deputies' wives and children. If the HZDS wanted to achieve this through these StB methods, it really succeeded," Bajan says. In one part of the interview, Bajan confirms that HZDS ranks might be left by social democratically oriented deputies. The passage reads: "[Krno] We have learned from various sources that eight more deputies might leave the HZDS Club of Deputies and establish a Social Democratic Club and that one deputy is planning to reinforce Cernak's National Democratic Club of Deputies. Can you confirm these rumors? "[Bajan] It is difficult to accurately estimate their number. But I do not rule out that your figures might be close to the reality. The Social Democratic current has so far remained in the HZDS parliamentary club. It is only a question of time when these deputies will publicly confirm their disagreement with the policy of the present leadership of the movement. This is connected with the crystallization of the political scene.... Our former HZDS colleagues have one last chance to join parties with a future." Bratislava SME in Slovak on 9 April on page 2 carries a 100-word interview with Ivan Laluha, a parliamentary deputy for the HZDS who is considered to be the leader of the "Social Democratic" current, about the possibility of more defections from the HZDS parliamentary group. The interview, the place and date of which are not given, reads: "[SME] Before the HZDS Assembly in Presov [held on 26-27 March], it was expected that you would establish there a Social Democratic Platform within the HZDS or that you would leave the movement. Why did these expectations from behind the scenes not come true, all the more because it was rumored that you would contest the elections jointly with the Social Democratic Party in Slovakia? How likely is your departure from the HZDS? "[Laluha] If you allow me, I will make a statement on this at a later date." Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak on 12 April on pages 1 and 3 carries an 800-word interview with Ivan Gasparovic, chairman of the parliament, by Martin Krno entitled "No One Has Broken Into My Office." In the interview, which was conducted on 11 April, Gasparovic responds to the interview with Vladimir Bajan in Bratislava PRAVDA on 9 April. He describes how the "sworn statement" of November 1993 came about, stressing that "it is binding morally rather than legally." He also explains the circumstances under which the signed statements became public: "After several deputies left our Club of Deputies and formed the Alternative of Political Realism, Mr. Cabaj, chairman of the HZDS Club of Deputies, came to see me. I handed him the envelope at his request. I did so because it was property of the HZDS and did not concern the National Council. Therefore, no one has broken into my office and, I hope, never will." Asked about the expected departures from the HZDS Club of Deputies, Gasparovic says: "There exist certain indications of that. But even if some more deputies leave, this need not be considered a tragedy. We have clearly stated that only those should remain in our club who trust the HZDS program and want to implement it to the last degree. It would make no sense for people to remain among us who disagree with this program."
