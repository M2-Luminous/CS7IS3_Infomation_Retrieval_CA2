Urban Backstrom sends out conflicting signals. MANADENS AFFARER has mapped out the network that surrounds and influences the new chairman of the Bank of Sweden. The hotel owner's son from Visby has sat down on the Central Bank throne. Nearly 2 meters tall and wearing a dark suit, he welcomes everyone as his guest. He likes business, both theoretical and practical. That interest has led him to doctoral studies in both economics and advanced tax planning. The selection of a Moderate under secretary of state to succeed Bengt Dennis was controversial, and the SDP [Social Democratic Party] registered a protest. But on the surface, he will become everyone's friend, probably including even the SDP in the long run. Few people know what he is hiding under that well-pressed surface. Probably a happy mixture of a kid with a zest for life and a single-minded climber with sharp claws. Politics is a belated discovery for Backstrom. It is true that he was student council chairman at the secondary school in Granna, but he was not an active member of the Moderate Party. Nor was he one when Georg Danell recruited him to be a nonpolitical member of former Moderate Party Chairman Gosta Bohman's staff. Despite his stints with the Association of Share Investors, the Consensus Brokerage Firm, and the Mollberg Hotel in Helsingborg, it was at the Government Office that the new chairman of the Bank of Sweden got his training. But there was integrity there, and he was not regarded as a typical political commissar. At Consensus, however, the tone was different. "Backstrom was a thoroughly political CEO and favored his old buddies," says one of those who was fired. Economists Urban Backstrom became an interest rate dove as opposed to the hawk Dennis following an article in EKONOMISK DEBATT. That earned him praise from, among others, LO [Swedish Federation of Trade Unions] economist Dan Anderson. Backstrom reportedly listens quite openly to both Anderson and his colleague P.O. Edin. The most natural partner for dialogue in that network is Lars Jonung, professor of economics at the Stockholm School of Economics and economic adviser to Carl Bildt. Backstrom also listens to Hans T. Soderstrom, associate professor of economics at the School of Economics and, since 1985, president of the SNS (Industrial Council for Social and Economic Studies), and Lars Calmfors, a professor of international economics at Stockholm University who is active at the Lindbeck Institute. Ingemar Hansson, financial adviser to Anne Wibble in the Ministry of Finance; Lars Heikensten, senior economist at the Trade Bank; and Johan Myrman, professor of economics at the Stockholm School of Economics, are other heavyweights. A couple of Bohman's former associates know the new chairman of the Bank of Sweden well: Jan Herin, senior economist at the SAF [Swedish Employers Confederation], and Ulf Jacobsson, senior economist at the Federation of Swedish Industries. Ebba Lindso is also one of Backstrom's trusted friends. She was formerly CEO of Transferator but is now in business for herself and sits on a good many boards of directors. She is also the KDS [Christian Democratic Party] economic expert. Mentors Lars Tobisson is party secretary and the Moderate Party's gray eminence. Backstrom has a lot to thank him for. Tobisson trained him and helped him in his career. During his days in the Riksdag, Backstrom was rapporteur for Staffan Burenstam-Linder, then chairman of the Moderate Party's finance and tax committee. Burenstam-Linder, a former minister, is currently rector of the Stockholm School of Economics and chairman of the board of governors of the Bank of Sweden. He is probably another person that the 39-year-old chairman of the Bank of Sweden will turn to. Backstrom was senior economist for the Association of Share Investors in 1985 and 1986. In fact, he ran the operation together with the association's pugnacious managing director, Lars-Erik Forsgardh. Like Backstrom, Forsgardh has a background in the hotel business: He was CEO of the Skogsgard Hotel in Sodertalje from 1979 to 1984. Backstrom and Forsgardh have a great deal in common and still see each other. Family His father and mother, Sven-Ake and Maj Britt Backstrom, first operated the main hotel in Visby and then bought the tradition-rich Mollberg Hotel in Helsingborg. The Opera Cafe in Stockholm was the model for the Mollberg in the Backstrom era. But the style was a little more feudal. Among other things, it was considered desirable for the maids to curtsy to the owners. And thrift was the watchword at the Mollberg. Beer was a mixture: half new tap beer and half old foam from the bench under the bar. Both parents thought it was great to have a son who worked for Gosta Bohman. When Sven-Ake Backstrom fell ill, his son moved in as assistant manager from 1983 until 1985, when the hotel was sold. Urban Backstrom tried to get the personnel to take more responsibility -- once he was well established. Once, for example, they ran out of rose wine and a waiter came to ask what to do. The answer was lightning quick: "Mix red and white." Fortunately, the boss was not always obeyed. Backstrom is married to Eva, a stewardess with SAS. They live in a detached house in downtown Djursholm. They have two children -- Catarina, 11, and Filip, 7 -- a housemaid declared on their income tax return, and a dachshund named Hugo. In the summer they like to travel or stay in his mother-in-law's apartment in France. Bank of Sweden The network at the Bank of Sweden is an unwritten chapter. Thomas Franzen, deputy chairman of the bank, was considered a dark horse. But as soon as Backstrom took over, he urged Franzen to stay on and accept another term when the old one expires in May. This despite the fact that Franzen has been largely responsible for formulating the Bank of Sweden's interest policy since the late 1980's -- the very period that Backstrom has criticized. As these lines are being written (at the end of January), Backstrom is already looking for a successor to the other deputy chairman, Claes Norgren, the newly appointed head of the Finance Inspectorate. The bank's extensive international contacts make it necessary to have three people at the top. Banking Industry The banking crisis gave Backstrom access to everyone in bank management. And he feels as comfortable with Bjorn Svedberg and Peter and Jacob Wallenberg at the Scandinavian Private Bank as he does with Hans Dahlborg and Jacob Palmstierna at the Northern Bank or Tom Hedelius and especially Arne Martensson from the Trade Bank. Naturally, the same was true with Gabriel Urwitz and Per Lundberg of the former Gota Bank. Business World Backstrom has close professional contacts with Fredrik Lundberg, chief stockholder and CEO of Lundberg Enterprises. They met each other in 1990, when Lundberg's Ostgota Private Bank bought out Consensus. The deputy CEO at Consensus at the time was Urban Backstrom, and he quickly became CEO. Fredrik Lundberg now lives a stone's throw from Backstrom. Another Lundberg man, Per Welin, deputy CEO of Lundberg Enterprises, was on the Consensus board of directors when Backstrom was CEO. Arne Martensson, CEO of the Trade Bank, and Backstrom met each other in the fall of 1991. They have close and complicated contacts. Martensson was once a member of the Moderate Party's advisory group. Another person that Backstrom esteems in the business world is Melker Schorling, the young and recently appointed CEO of Skanska who was formerly CEO of Securitas. Sten Westerberg is the member of the Liberal Party who was under secretary of state under Gosta Bohman (Moderate Party). Following a banking career, he is now in business for himself. He is considered talented and creative, and he has lunch with Backstrom from time to time. In the ministry, Westerberg succeeded Lars Wohlin, now CEO of the City Mortgage Bank. Wohlin is a quick-witted man who has known Backstrom since the mid-1980's. Olle Wastberg and Backstrom were colleagues in the Ministry of Finance. Wastberg's current job as editor in chief of EXPRESSEN makes him a valuable contact. Inner Circle A few people outside the family are close to Backstrom. Minister of Taxation Bo Lundgren is one of the chosen few. He was also a candidate for the job of chairman of the Bank of Sweden but lost the struggle. Lundgren has become an increasingly important person to Backstrom since their days together in the ministry. Now the two of them meet even away from their jobs as time permits. They usually relax over a drink, sometimes at a nightclub after late meetings, and they play squash and badminton together. Bo Lundgren's poker face conceals more humor than one might imagine. Like Backstrom, he was also a member of the board of directors of the National Debt Office and of Wine and Spirits. Peter Egardt, Bildt's under secretary of state, is the man who gave Backstrom the most support during the years in the Government Office. They are good friends and meet even away from the job. Egardt is the pivotal figure in the government, a chain-smoker, and a tireless worker. His role as coordinator of the four coalition parties is one of today's toughest political jobs. Another of Backstrom's guardian angels is Olof Ehrenkrona, planning chief for the Cabinet Office. But they are not as close to each other. Arne Bjorhn was Backstrom's predecessor in the Moderate-controlled Government Office and once a very good friend. For a long time Bjorhn, Backstrom, and Egardt met every month for a so-called interest rate lunch. But after Arne Bjorhn's and his brother Gunnar's swindle at the Merchant Bank, the relationship was put on hold. (In April 1993, the Svea Court of Appeal sentenced Arne Bjorhn to two months in prison for bribery and tax evasion. His brother Gunnar received a one-year prison sentence for serious tax evasion and violation of the law on corporations. The same scandal resulted in a 1.5-year prison sentence for K.O. Feldt's former deputy assistant under secretary, Thorvald Pettersson, for tax evasion and bribery.) Arne Bjorhn once helped both Backstrom and Egardt with extensive but legal tax planning. Foreigners Backstrom is inheriting contacts in central bank circles from Bengt Dennis, who was chairman of the board of directors of the BIS (Bank for International Settlements) in Basel. Hans Tietmeyer became president of the German Federal Bank in October 1993 after serving as, among other things, under secretary of state in the Ministry of Finance. The same career was followed by Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France. In Italy, Antonio Fazio recently rose to become governor of the Bank of Italy. Fazio was previously a deputy governor, as was Eddie George, who has now become governor of the tradition-rich Bank of England. Alan Greenspan, on the other hand, has been boss of the Federal Reserve Bank since 1987. Backstrom will have more dealings with the head of the Federal Reserve in New York, who acts as the U.S. banking system's "minister of foreign affairs." In Basel, Backstrom will also meet the new BIS chief, Andrew Crockett from the Bank of England, and his predecessor Alexandre Lamfalussy. The latter is the new head of the European Monetary Institute, which is the embryo of the European Union's future central bank. Backstrom will also meet such prominent economists in Washington as Joseph Steiglitz and Alan Blinder of Bill Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers.
