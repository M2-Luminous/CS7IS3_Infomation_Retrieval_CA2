Mr. Juppe announced that France will send in 2,000 to 3,000 of its troops currently in Somalia. This, he said, will be done ostensibly to stop the massacres in Rwanda, and in the event the OAU brokered cease-fire is not implemented. Mr. Juppe's utterances have left the whole world wondering whether France has taken over the role of the United Nations and the OAU, because the action seems unilateral. What has surprised the world even more, however, is the irony of this pretend action by France, since the French Government is directly responsible for the massacres and genocide that have taken place, and are still taking place, in our country. In the past and in the present, France has aided the Rwanda dictatorial clique directly. The very people who are killing men, women, and children in Rwanda have got the support of the French Government. Even before the armed conflict in Rwanda broke out, France was training the Rwanda Government forces, who have had a major role in the killings in Rwanda. Mr. (John Kabonera), a Frenchman and human rights activist, recently lamented that it was shameful for France that its Rwandese military cadres were the very ones who killed, raped, and looted in Rwanda. To use Mr. (Kabonera)'s words, it is a pity our students are the ones doing all this. Immediately after the outbreak of the war in 1990, France, committed to the murderous regime, sent to Rwanda troops to prop up the regime against the onslaught of the superior, better organized RPF combatants, who not only had a just cause, but were sure to expose the French backed dictatorial clique to the Banyarwanda [Rwandans] and the rest of the world. Alongside its legionnaires, France supplied millions of dollars worth of arms and ammunition to the Kigali clique, but all this to no avail. France went into an all-out diplomatic war against the RPF on behalf of the Kigali murderers and lobbied for the Kigali clique, but as expected the Rwandese people and the international community did not pay heed to France's machinations on behalf of the murderers. The French troops in Rwanda then intensified their military campaign on the frontline alongside the Rwanda Government forces, but lost heavily at the hands of the RPF combatants. The French legionnaires in Rwanda man roadblocks in the country, identifying Tutsis, anti-government Hutus, or arrests and harrassments. The French troops in Rwanda, along with government forces, trained the dreaded Interahamwe [Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development, MRND, militia], armed them to the teeth, and posted them throughout the whole country in preparation for the present day holocaust. The French legionnaires in Rwanda raped Rwandese women and were allowed to carry themselves around in the undisciplined manner that characterizes them, as if it is the payment for the support of the murderous clique of MRND-CDR [Coalition for the Defense of the Republic]. It is common knowledge that French troops in Somalia, who Mr. Juppe claims will come to Rwanda, raped and misbehaved in Somalia and may be responsible for the animosity accorded to UN troops by Somalis. Despite its obvious support for the murderous clique, the French Government pretended to moderate talks between the RPF and the Rwanda Government. But because the French Government was not genuine, the talks failed, until finally the OAU and the rest of the international community openly categorized France as a party to the conflict, and therefore not credible as a peace talks organizer. The talks were then organized by the OAU, with the blessing of the UN. France was not, of course, happy, and although it had observer status at the Arusha peace talks [words indistinct] in August 1993, France backed the late Habyarimana in all his moves to block the implementation of the Arusha accord. France helped to arm and train Interahamwe militias, and supplied millions of dollars worth of arms and ammunition to the Habyarimana clique, and this is what facilitated the murderous Interahamwe to carry out the genocide and massacres in Rwanda. Even after the death of Habyarimana, France rushed to evacuate the family and close associates of the late president. France was the first country to recognize, and granted visas to, Jerome Bicamumpaka and Jean-Bosco Barayarwiza, who are known killers, and who had left instructions at home that hundreds of thousands of innocent lives [words indistinct]. France is still supplying arms through the Rwanda Embassy in Cairo to the murderous clique in Rwanda, as evidenced by fax messages from Cairo to Rwanda. [passage omitted] Having said this, it is very clear that France is incapable of making the situation in Rwanda better. The only thing it can achieve is to aggravate the situation. France cannot stop the genocide and massacres it has helped to put in action. France is the mentor of the very clique which is carrying out the killing. The only way it can stop the killing is to [words indistinct] its support for the murderers. Why should France undermine the UN and OAU? The UN and OAU should make their stand clear, and show that they are world bodies with authority. They should not allow France to marginalize them. The intentions of France are very clear. France intends to fight for the murderous extremist clique calling itself government, which is on the run, in the pretext of stopping massacres. After hundreds of thousands of innocent lives have been lost, the French Government, which is responsible for this loss of life, now claims it will send in troops to stop the killings. The intention is clear: The French troops will come to protect the murderers. The French minister claims that France will come with its European and African allies. One wonders who these allies are. France has always been alone and on the wrong side as regards the Rwanda question. It is not about to get allies now. Whatever allies it will get, it cannot in any way replace the UN and the OAU. It will still be a unilateral action by France. Whatever action [word indistinct] France takes, will not absolve France from its contribution to the genocide and massacres which took place, and are still taking place, in Rwanda today. France has no moral authority [word indistinct] to intervene in the conflict in Rwanda.
