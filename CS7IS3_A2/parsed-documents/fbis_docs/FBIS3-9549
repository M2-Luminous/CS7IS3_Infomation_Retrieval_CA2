While he would ensure that continuity was maintained in Slovak foreign policy, the existing problems should be solved fairly quickly, said Kukan, former Czechoslovak and later Slovak ambassador to the U.N. The government of Premier Jozef Moravcik intended to meet the conditions set by the Council of Europe (CE) concerning national minorities, he said. He himself wanted to press for bilingual road signs in the south of Slovakia where 600,000 Hungarians live, but said the decision would ultimately be parliament's. (Slovak-Hungarian road signs were banned by the Meciar government.) Kukan also attached great importance to relations with Austria, adding that the only thing he was "not very optimistic" about was the problems concerning Slovak nuclear power stations. Asked if Austria's attempts to prevent the financing of the Mochovce nuclear power station by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) could worsen relations between the two countries, Kukan said he thought the consequences would be "not at all good." Slovakia had not yet managed to persuade the Austrians that Mochovce would not represent a threat to the environment, he said. "We have no choice but to hold further scientific talks," he added. With regard to Austrian offers to provide supplementary electricity instead, the foreign minister said that he did not have detailed information yet, but nonetheless "these things should be seriously looked into one more time." Kukan said he knew of no specific date for the integration of Slovakia into the European Union (EU), but could imagine it happening "within several years." He said the change of Slovak Government had shown that Slovakia was a democratic country, because it had all happened without problems. The Visegrad countries (Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary) would enter the EU separately, Visegrad being only "a very free union," the foreign minister said at the end of the interview.
