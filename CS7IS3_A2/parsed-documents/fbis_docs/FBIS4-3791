There had been some expectation that China would make concessions ahead of the United States decision on the renewal of trade benefits in June. However, Angelo Gnadinger, who headed the Red Cross delegation of three, said last night there remained "more to be done". "We have not finished all the work. We are just in the midst of it," he said. Three meetings were held during the week with Chinese officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. China gave no indications when another meeting might be held, but did not rule out further talks in May, Gnadinger said. Sources at the Red Cross had thought that China might seek a "quick solution" in light of the U.S. decision on renewing Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status in June. China is understood to want to limit the definition of prisoners to those convicted of crimes, a sticking point with the Red Cross, which seeks to visit "all detainees". Improving conditions for prisoners "such as allowing access to prisons by international humanitarian and human rights organisations" is one condition of Bill Clinton's presidential executive order governing the renewal of MFN.
