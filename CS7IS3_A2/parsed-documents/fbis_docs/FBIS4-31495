The programme was signed here by Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan and European Union Commissioner Rene Steichen today. "The European Union has become the most significant foreign aid contributor to Slovakia," Kukan said. In 1990-93, Slovakia received within PHARE nearly 130 million ECU in support of economic reforms. Steichen said that this aid had brought results in most sectors but that he was not satisfied in all cases. He added that the use of EU aid was regularly checked. The sum of 40 million ECU is to be distributed among agriculture, the private sector, additional training, science and technology, energy, environment, transport, public administration reform and implementing the EU association agreement.
