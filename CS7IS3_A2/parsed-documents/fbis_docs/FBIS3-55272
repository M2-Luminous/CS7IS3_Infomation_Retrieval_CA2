Commenting on the project, he suggested that such a move would make the committee less effective. He said the committee could be more productive under the government's command. But within the presidential administration it would turn into a secondary department. He voiced conviction that the plan had been devised because of his personality and re-emphasized the need for leading the committee by a vice-premier, as usual. Otherwise, in his words, it is impossible to make the finance and other ministries and departments turn their attention to ethnic relations and regional problems. However, he added, "there is every indication that a different decision has been taken." He believes that there must be a body to work out political recommendations for the president on ethnic and regional policies. As for the federation committee, it should implement presidential and government decisions in this sphere.
