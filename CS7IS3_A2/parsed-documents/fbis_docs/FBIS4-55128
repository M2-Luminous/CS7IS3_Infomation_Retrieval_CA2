In a live television debate, Meciar accused Deputy Premier Roman Kovac, a former member of his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), of having embezzled five million dollars. Kovac, also taking part in the debate, said he would lodge a complaint against Meciar. Earlier this week, the parliament failed to pass a vote of no confidence in Kovac motioned by the opposition. But the opposition was unable to submit any evidence to support its embezzlement claim. Meciar pointed out an alleged disagreement between the Democratic Left Party (SDL) and the rest of the government coalition. He told SDL Chairman Peter Weiss, also present at the debate, that he had made him four "serious offers" to create a coalition when the HZDS was at power (until March 11). Meciar also claimed that there were serious disagreements within the SDL and that Weiss had sent to the government people with whom he had been in conflict so that they "discredit themselves by the elections." He specially mentioned Defence Minister Pavol Kanis and Agriculture Minister Pavel Koncos. Elections are to be held on September 30-October 1. Meciar also attacked Premier Jozef Moravcik in connection with the screening (lustration) of government members. He said that it is amoral of Moravcik, "a former member of a Communist Party of Czechoslovakia Leninist group," to demand that the ministers submit a negative screening certificate. Under the screening law of 1991, former high-ranking communist officials, collaborators with the secret police (StB) and members of the People's Militia (the party's paramilitary force) are barred from public posts until 1996. Meciar also criticised the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), saying that it was usurping the right to assert in the coalition solely its own interests. In this situation the cabinet exists only thanks to "a secret agreement" with representatives of the Hungarian coalition of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement-Egyutteles which supports it at the cost of "outrageous conditions." The Hungarian coalition represents an ethnic minority of about 560,000 or 11 per cent of the Slovak population. It has 14 out of a total of 150 seats in the parliament. Meciar claimed that the HZDS had never "dictated" anything in the parliament which, he added, could not be said of the present coalition. "We have never had an absolute majority, we always decently asked for support," he said. Meciar dismissed the arguments of the coalition representatives present at the debate, who said that it was mainly his own fault that he had lost one-quarter of his deputies over one and a quarter years and that he had painted a bad picture of Slovakia abroad. "You are only conceited, you are not strong," Meciar told the present coalition.
