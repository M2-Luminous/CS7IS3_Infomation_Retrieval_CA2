This is the inevitable consequence of the British side's act in undermining the Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's 1994 and 1995 electoral arrangements. In a recent statement, the spokesman for the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office made this point plain so that Hong Kong people could clearly see the development of events and would make joint efforts with the Chinese side to reorganize the three-tiered assemblies in 1997 in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Basic Law. This will be conducive to the smooth transition of Hong Kong. Hong Kong people generally hope for Sino-British cooperation to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and to effect the smooth transfer of government in 1997. When Chris Patten dished out his "three violation" constitutional reform package, many social organizations and activists opposed it and urged him to return to the path of "three conformities" to restore cooperation with the Chinese side. When the Sino-British talks on the 1994 and 1995 electoral arrangements began, Hong Kong people generally hoped that China and Britain would reach an agreement so that the political structure before and after 1997 would converge. However, although the Chinese side made great efforts to strive for the conclusion of an agreement and made a series of compromises, the British side continued to deliberately impede the talks from proceeding in line with the "three conformity" principle. Finally, Patten brought part of his constitutional reform package to the Legislative Council and this led to the total termination of the Sino-British talks. Facts during the past year and more repeatedly showed that the British side had no intention of following Hong Kong people's wishes nor of keeping its own promise and settling problems through talks in accordance with the "three conformity" principle. Hong Kong people's hopes have completely fallen through and the Chinese side's efforts were also in vain. Hong Kong people cannot but discard their illusions of the British side and join the Chinese in doing intensive preparatory work in all fields for recovering Hong Kong. The British refuse to cooperate but the sky will not fall down. In 1997, the reorganization of the three-tiered assemblies may cause certain shocks but Hong Kong people do not need to worry about this. President Jiang Zemin recently reiterated in his new year message to Hong Kong compatriots that "no matter what happens, we shall be of one heart and one mind with Hong Kong patriotic compatriots in all circles and the principle of 'one country, two systems' will remain unchanged, the principle of maintaining the Basic Law will remain unchanged, and our determination to resume exercising sovereignty over Hong Kong will remain unchanged. Hong Kong will certainly be able to maintain long-term prosperity and stability and we have sufficient ability to do this and have full confidence in this." Obviously, the reorgnaization of the three-tiered assemblies in 1997 will certainly be made strictly according to the principles specified by the Basic Law. Therefore, the reorganized three-tiered assemblies will give expression to the principles of the Basic Law and will guarantee the balanced participation of all social strata in local administrative affairs. This prospect should be clear. At the same time, the Chinese side will also listen extensively to Hong Kong people's opinions on the way to reorganize the three- tiered assemblies. It is believed that after the three-tiered political structure of the British Hong Kong authorities is disbanded, members of the three-tiered assemblies elected in 1994 or 1995 may still be able to reenter the assemblies as long as they satisfy the requirements specified by the Basic Law, love China and love Hong Kong, and are willing to continue to serve the local community. In short, as long as the vast number of Hong Kong residents actively support the work of the Preliminary Work Committee and make joint efforts with the Chinese Government, the shock caused by the reorganization of the three-tiered assemblies will be reduced to a minimum and Hong Kong's long-term stability and prosperity will certainly be maintained. Hong Kong compatriots should completely set their minds at rest on this point. The colonial government will come to an end on 30 June 1997. Hong Kong people completely support China's recovery of sovereignty over Hong Kong and the implementation of the "one country, two systems" policy in Hong Kong. They will be masters of Hong Kong and Hong Kong will continue to be their home after 1997. Therefore, they know that the British who will return home after the Union Flag is lowered may not take a responsible attitude toward Hong Kong's prosperity and stability after 1997. Only the Chinese Government shares the same interests with Hong Kong people and really cares about post-1997 prosperity and stability and will inevitably assume a responsible attitude in adopting the transitional measures. Therefore, the sooner preparations are made to get rid of Patten's disruptive role by working out the method of forming the first three-tiered assembly structure of the special adminsitrative region, the more favorable things will be for a smooth transition. As long as the reorganization of the three-tiered assemblies constantly follows the principle of orderly and gradual progress, respects history, and gives consideration to the current reality, then the work can be done in line with the principles specified by the Basic Law and can be suited to the actual needs in maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity. Moreover, the fact of China's vigorous economic development is greatly conducive to Hong Kong's post-1997 stable development. Hong Kong and the mainland are closely interdependent. The Chinese Government will certainly try by every possible means to keep Hong Kong's existing social system unchanged, to ensure the stable and smoth development of democratic politics, and to continuously raise the living standards of the local residents. This will be favorable to China's four modernizations and will also be conducive to the practice of "one country, two systems." The Chinese Government will also give consideration to the performances of foreign companies and Hong Kong enterprises which have made contributions to Hong Kong's prosperity and stabiity in the transitional period and will offer them more favorable conditions to seek future development in the mainland market. Cooperation will benefit both sides. Those who follow Patten in disrupting the order in Hong Kong will have no future. Those who cooperate with China and help keep Hong Kong's stability will have very bright futures. All foreign and local businessmen not support the reform package which just creates confrontation and trouble. Therefore, Patten will have less and less influence as he finds scant support for his unjust cause. On the other hand, China will enjoy abundant support for its just cause of striving for Hong Kong's smooth transition. China will also be able to achieve the goal of preventing any shocks appearing in Hong Kong in 1997.
