This concerned former foreign minister Tofik Gasymov and First Deputy Chairman of the People's Front Ibrahim Ibrahimov. Ragimzade proposed it this morning when the parliament was discussing the social-political situation in Azerbaijan on the initiative of Speaker Rasul Guliyev. The situation in Azerbaijan has become more tense due to the opposition protesting the position of the authorities on the settlement in Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijani Interior Minister Ramil Usubov laid the responsibility for the situation at the door of leader of the National Independence opposition party Etibar Mamedov. In his turn, Mamedov blamed Usubov for misinformation of the Azerbaijani leadership and for actions of the police which, in his mind, were undermining stability in the country. Former foreign minister Gasymov said that Speaker Guliyev was triggering off the tension since Guliyev had refused to discuss the Bishkek protocol on settlement in Karabakh in the parliament. This made the opposition take action.
