The public hearings are being held in response to written requests. The comment period will be extended to accommodate the public hearings and to allow appropriate time for the public to provide further comments. DATES: The comment period on the proposed rule, which was originally scheduled to close on October 11, 1994, will be extended to November 9, 1994. The first public hearing will be held from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Tuesday, October 18, 1994. The second public hearing will be held from 6:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. on Tuesday, October 25, 1994.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jody Gustitus Millar, Bald Eagle Recovery Coordinator, 309&hyph;793&hyph;5800. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The bald eagle ( Haliaeetus leucocephalus ) is listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq. ), in the lower 48 states, except Washington, Oregon, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, where it is listed as threatened. The bald eagle also occurs in Alaska and Canada, where it is not at risk and is not protected under the Act; and in small numbers in northern Mexico. The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposed to reclassify the bald eagle from endangered to threatened in the lower 48 states except in certain portions of the American Southwest and to classify those eagles in adjacent Mexico as endangered. The bald eagle would remain threatened in the five states where it is currently listed as threatened. The special rule for threatened bald eagles would be revised. This action would not alter those conservation measures already in force to protect the species and its habitats. The Federal Register notice announcing the proposed rule was published on July 12, 1994 (59 FR 35584). The original comment period ended on October 11, 1994, and the deadline for receipt of public hearing requests was August 26, 1994. Eight requests for public hearings have been received within the deadline_three from within Rhode Island, three from Delaware, and two from within Arizona, including the Navajo Nation. Those parties wishing to make statements for the record should have available a copy of their statements to be presented to the Service at the start of the hearing. Oral statements may be limited to 5 or 10 minutes, if the number of parties present necessitates some limitation. There are no limits to the length of written comments presented at this hearing or mailed to the Service. Dated: September 26, 1994. Sam Marler, Regional Director.
