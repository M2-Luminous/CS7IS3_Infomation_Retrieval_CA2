With a view to the past and the actions of German troops in the Balkans, Scharping said that, in whatever role, German soldiers might become targets there. Thus, he also rejected the participation of German troops in blue helmet missions in the successor states of Yugoslavia. Scharping called on Chancellor Kohl to make the attitude of the Federal Government clear. While, in former times, Kohl had clearly rejected the employment of German soldiers in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the chancellor recently made "soft" comments. On the other hand, Schaeuble, chairman of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] Bundestag Group, is advancing considerations that Germany should actively commit itself in the military sphere in the Balkans. Scharping called this irresponsible. The SPD chairman concentrated his criticism on Schaeuble. Referring to Franco's dictatorship in Spain, he said that his considerations to also employ the Bundeswehr for internal security is a "game with Francist ideas." In this way, Schaeuble is showing that he only takes the Basic Law seriously if he thinks that this is tactically required. However, with his considerations, Schaeuble gives the following signal to foreign countries: "We are an unstable country." He also expects Kohl to "clarify" this "completely." Scharping accused Schaeuble of having propagated the impression in Washington, during his trip to the United States at the end of March, that a SPD victory in the Bundestag elections will harm German-U.S. relations. Scharping said that his visit to Washington and New York confirmed to him that the "basic orientation" of German foreign politics should also be maintained in the event of his victory in the election. Scharping mentioned European integration, the friendship with France and the United States, integration within the NATO alliance, a reliable relationship with the East European states, and cooperation with the developing countries as elements of foreign policy agreement with the FRG Government. In detail, there are differences with regard to government policy. The prospect of entry into the European Union has to be made clearer to Germany's neighboring states in the East. Improvements are possible in German-U.S. relations, he said. With a view to the Federal Constitutional Court proceedings on the Bundeswehr's participation in missions outside the NATO mandate, which will start in Karlsruhe this Tuesday, Scharping said he expects that the complaint of the SPD and the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] will be successful, so that the Bundestag will have to be involved in relevant decisions in the future. As soon as the questions of constitutional policy are clarified, the political questions will again be in the foreground. The SPD attitude that it will not even participate in "warlike" UN measures will be maintained. However, in the SPD's opinion, Germany can participate in such UN missions as have been the practice in the past. UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's wish that a UN blue helmet troop be established with German participation can be reconciled with the resolutions of the SPD Congress.
