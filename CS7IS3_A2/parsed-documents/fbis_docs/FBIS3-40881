At the same time tax collections need to be raised steadily to increase total state tax receipts, while ensuring that the activities of tax collectors are more professional. This statement was made by Dr. Usman Hasan, chairman of the FKP, in answer to questions from a SUARA PEMBARUAN representative at the Parliament building in the Senayan section of Jakarta. He was talking about the speech by the president to a plenary session of Parliament on 6 January. A similar view was expressed by Dr. A.A. Oka Mahendra, also a member of the FKP, who emphasized the president's call on all members of the community to pay their taxes. He said that this call must also be followed up by increasing the level of motivation among the people. In this way state receipts from taxes will continue to increase in the coming years. He said: "Furthermore, tax revenues must truly be used for clear, developmental objectives." According to Usman Hasan, who spoke of the need to prevent budgetary waste and corruption, we all hope that this will be done. There is a question as to whether graft in the development field takes place because of technical or organizational management factors. He added that the FKP, in its meetings with government officials, will continue to raise the question of waste. He said later that since the First Five-Year Plan was begun the government has continued to emphasize increasing income from taxes. During this period of time tax collections have always met their goals. He stated: "That is, tax income has continued to increase almost every year. As a result, I am optimistic that the tax collection goal in the next RAPBN [state budget] will be achieved and may even be exceeded." According to Usman, although it is generally known that the tax collection target has been achieved, it is still necessary to make preparations now to achieve the target for state tax receipts, that is, by steadily collecting taxes. He added: "This is particularly the case if we recall that the percentage of persons actually paying their taxes is low, compared to the other countries of ASEAN." Regarding the steady collection of taxes, the FKP will always remind the government to apply the tax regulations firmly. It is only right that those able to pay more taxes have a greater obligation than those who are not in this position. Steady tax collections are also in the interests of justice, apart from the consideration of the principles of conflicting subsidies. Broadening the Tax Base Meanwhile, Dr. Oka Mahendra, a member of the FKP, said that the government needs to collect taxes on a more extensive basis. Expanding the number of persons who are obliged to pay taxes will help the process of tax collection. However, the key to success in all of this is the tax collector. Oka admitted that there is an impression among some people that a rather large number of potential taxpayers who avoid paying taxes come from the ranks of the tax collectors. He added: "Therefore, by continuing to stress motivation it is hoped that the people's awareness that they have an obligation to pay taxes will continue to increase. This includes reporting those who have an obligation to pay taxes but who avoid it because they are tax collectors." Regarding the need for criminal penalties for those who have an obligation to pay taxes but avoid doing so, Oka Mahendra, a member of Committee II of Parliament, thought this is not yet needed. He said: "However, if there really are people who have been involved in avoiding their tax obligations, they should face criminal penalties under the laws already in effect." Question of Salaries Meanwhile, T.B. Silalahi, minister of state for administrative reform, stated, in answer to questions from reporters, that if the salaries of state employees are not increased and the matter of service to the public is left to the personal integrity of the individual, who will feel an obligation to serve the people? However, although there have really been people who have engaged in avoiding payment of their taxes, we should not generalize too much in this regard, because many employees can also observed in the areas where they work who really serve the people. After attending a plenary session of Parliament to hear the speech made by the president on 6 January on "Economic Notes" and the state budget for fiscal year 1994/1995, Silalahi said: "We should not look only at the questions of the service of state employees and their salaries, because this matter must be considered from a national point of view. At present, whatever we think of it, development is now going on at an extraordinary pace. Per capita income has been increasing for the past 25 years." He stated that in a national sense our country is not yet able to pay adequate salaries to state employees. If this is the situation at the national level, we must think about it. If we compare the situation in 1965, when we began the First Five-Year Plan, with today, present conditions are far better. He said: "We hope that later, by the end of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, annual income will increase to $1,000 per capita. However, although the salaries of state employees have not increased, the government has continued to raise their level of welfare. For example, he said, in the most remote provinces the total incomes of state employees such as teachers are now twice their salaries. As a result, they can serve the people more effectively."
