[Abu-Middayn] I really do not know what the source of this information could be. In fact, cooperation between us is at its utmost. We hold meetings with the brothers in the security forces every night, particularly with brother Nasr Yusuf and the rest of the security officials. In fact, there is full and comprehensive cooperation because we are approaching a stage in which law should prevail and the Palestinians must be well protected. [Zaydani] There are reports that Tunis and 'Arafat are not satisfied with Ziyad al-Atrash and Yusuf Nasr and that they will be replaced? [Abu-Middayn] I do not know how consultations are understood as differences. This happens throughout the world. Some people might have interpretations that are different from others' interpretations. There is full compliance with the instructions President 'Arafat gave to the army, which is estimated at approximately 3,500-4,000 individuals. There are no major differences. Those who came here are soldiers who carry out the full orders of the leadership. I am not aware of major differences, but people would term consultations as differences. This is new logic and a new understanding of matters. Thousands of kilometers separate us from the leadership, therefore there should be consultations, especially since Israel is monitoring telephones and faxes. Therefore, the leadership summons all its commanders, or most of the decisionmakers, every 30 days. This is quite natural. [Zaydani] Does the departure of Ziyad al-Atrash and Yusuf Nasr for Tunis fall within these consultation? [Abu-Middayn] I believe so. Even if there are different interpretations on the ground, President 'Arafat wants to be in the picture 24 hours a day. So, things cannot always be discussed over the telephone or in written instructions. Therefore, it is no more than consultation. [Zaydani] Mr. Furayh Abu-Middayn, your answers show that there are differences. [Abu-Middayn] There are different interpretations, not differences. The interpretation of the liaison committee was different from that of the brothers in Tunis regarding the issue of prisoners and releasing them in Jericho, as well as other things. Such things should be solved directly between the president and his soldiers. I believe there is nothing more than this. All issues are minor things, and I hope they will always remain so. [Zaydani] We heard that Yasir 'Arafat is mad at Ziyad al-Atrash concerning the transfer of prisoners to Jericho? [Abu-Middayn] It is not anger. 'Arafat had another opinion. We do not want Jericho to turn into another Marj-al-Zuhur. This is the main thing. Israel wants to implicate us in this issue by force. These are not mistakes committed by Ziyad al-Atrash or others. There are things in the agreements that are still unclear. We are assessing these issues and trying to explain them together with the Israeli side each day and each hour. We will reach solution to these issues, God willing. [Zaydani] What is the task of 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya who arrived in Gaza a few days ago? [Abu-Middayn] 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya participated in the Cairo talks and he, more than others, is well versed in the security agreement in particular. Brother al-Yahya arrived to translate this agreement on the ground with the right formula. Not everything written on paper was clear. Therefore, brother 'Abd-al-Razzaq al- Yahya understands the spirit of the agreement more than anybody else. This the task for which he came to Gaza. It is an important and delicate task. [Zaydani] The last question, Mr. Furayh Abu-Middayn, deals with those who collaborated with the [Israeli] authorities. In your capacity as the official in charge of the judicial apparatus in the self-rule areas, are there any instructions to the Palestinian police regarding those people? [Abu-Middayn] Regarding this issue, those who continue to collaborate will find no mercy on our part. There are very clear orders to arrest and interrogate any person suspected of collaborating. We will not be lenient in this regard and it will not be an issue for bargaining with the Israelis, as Mr. Rabin said: If they pursue the collaborators we will delay the prisoners. You cannot compare an honest fighter with a collaborator. Those who were collaborators is a different issue, but those who continued their collaboration will be arrested and stand trial. There is no lenience in this regard. Israel recently activated some cells that it recruited in the past. This is the nature of Israel. It has espionage activities in America and Pollard was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment in America. We will not allow this. We have military and economic institutions, as well as other institutions. We will not be lenient toward their security in any way. Therefore, we say to the Israelis: Keep your hands off those collaborators. They are your victims. We cannot be lenient toward this issue and toward those who continue their collaboration. If they caused heavy damages or the death of a Palestinian they will receive severe punishment, including a death sentence. This should be understood by the Israeli side. We will not be blackmailed on this issue and we will not succumb to Rabin's instructions. Rabin acts with the brain of a general, a bone breaker. He should stop this and know that this is a peace process. He should enjoy good performance and good intention. [Zaydani] Will you pardon those who collaborated with the authorities in the past and stopped it now? [Abu-Middayn] We are thinking seriously of those who stopped collaboration and even those who were killed. We will rehabilitate the children and sons of those who were killed. There is a plan to absorb the families of those killed into the society again. We consider them victims. Therefore, it is easy to resolve the issue of those who stopped their collaboration. However, we cannot be lenient toward those who continue their collaboration. We ask the ones who collaborated with the authorities in the past to report to the security centers and we will give them guarantees, provided that they stop any collaboration with the Israeli intelligence organ. [Zaydani] Mr. Furayh Abu-Middayn, member of the Palestinian Authority, thank you very much. [Abu-Middayn] Thank you.
