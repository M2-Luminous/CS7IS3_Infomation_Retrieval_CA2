The communique states government airplanes released strange gases and bombed areas near the Comitan-Altamirano highway, causing serious fires, at dawn on 19 March 1994. The SDN hereby informs the public of the following: 1. The Secretariat of Defense flatly denies airplanes have bombed the area of conflict, because Army and Air Force troops have not fired a single shot since 12 January, when the president of the Republic ordered a unilateral cease-fire. 2. The SDN hereby confirms the pledge made in Press Bulletin No. 32 issued on 23 March to the effect troop movement in the area of conflict has been strictly administrative. 3. The SDN once again offers assurances it will not execute actions that may hinder the government's resolve to find a peaceful solution to the conflict.
