FBIS4-52406 "dreas090_c_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-090 Daily Report 10 May 1994 North Korea Daily Criticizes South's Policy Meeting on North Daily Criticizes South's Policy Meeting on North SK1005044394 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0431 GMT 10 May 94 SK1005044394 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Unpardonable Treacherous Act" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 10 (KCNA) -- The South Korean puppets at "a unification and security policy coordinating meeting" charged the North with "delaying the settlement of the nuclear issue" and claimed that "sanctions of the UN Security Council are inevitable" and that "the international cooperation system should be strengthened to redouble pressure on the North." This is criticized by NODONG SINMUN today as an unpardonable treacherous act. The news analyst says: We decided to allow inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to be present at the forthcoming replacement of fuel rod at the five-megawatt experimental nuclear power station and promptly issued entry visas to the five inspectors designated by the IAEA. This notwithstanding, the IAEA Secretariat has not sent inspectors to the DPRK, raising an unreasonable demand. This is motivated by its sinister political scheme ignoring the unique status of the DPRK. If the South Korean authorities truly want a solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula for the sake of the nation, they must reject the unreasonable demand of the IAEA Secretariat and do things helpful to the creation of an opportunity to find a fundamental solution to the nuclear issue. But, they are now anxious to do harm to fellow countrymen in conspiracy with outside forces. What anti-communist fanatics they are. Outcries for "sanctions" against fellow countrymen can be let out only by foolish traitors. It must not be overlooked that at the meeting the puppets recklessly tried to decry the North-proposed peace negotiations with the United States for the establishment of a new peace arrangement that will take the place of the present armistice mechanism. By imprudently vilifying the North-proposed peace negotiations, the puppets, who are neither a signatory to the armistice agreement nor have the military prerogative, further revealed their dislike of the establishment of a new peace arrangement and their sinister intention for division and confrontation.
