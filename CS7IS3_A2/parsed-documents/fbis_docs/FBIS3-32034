After Police Chief Fernando Caldera announced he would evict hundreds of members of the transportation sector, who had gathered on the Metro Centro highway, the busiest in Managua, the Sandinist National Liberation Front [FSLN] asked Tomas Borge, interior minister during the Sandinist government, to mediate to avoid a conflict. Representatives of the CNT agreed to avoid confrontation by removing the vehicles that were obstructing traffic, while the authorities promised to remain at a prudent distance. Former Interior Minister Borge said the most important thing is to reach a negotiated solution between the government and the transportation sector. Meanwhile, the FSLN issued a communique supporting the transportation sector demands, which include a decrease in fuel prices and a law regulating the Nicaraguan transportation system. The police released two members of the transportation sector who had been arrested, while a soldier, who had been kidnapped by the strikers, was released. The police were about to implement an operation to evict the strikers, which would have led to a bloody confrontation, according to some media. The CNT reiterated its call to the Violeta Chamorro government to resume negotiations, because the strike is very costly for the country. The Transportation Ministry said there are no plans to negotiate with the CNT because it has reached agreements with four transportation organizations, which represent nearly 75 percent of the sector, that are not participating in the strike. On the streets of Managua, thousands of people have had to walk to work since the strike began or have had to pay high prices for service provided by substitute drivers. It is believed that 20 percent of the transportation sector in Managua is not heeding the strike call.
