According to Kohen, the two leaders met on 2 June to wrap up the details of the negotiations between the two countries. MK Kohen yesterday queried Minister Peres: "I learned from foreign sources," Kohen writes, "that the foreign minister met King Husayn in London on Thursday, 2 June. I was told that during the meeting, the directions of the negotiations between us and Jordan were agreed on." In his query to Peres, Kohen notes that "the efforts to promote the negotiations with Jordan deserve praise and encouragement. I would like to ask: Is this report true? If it is, what can you tell us about the proceedings of the meeting? Does the honorable minister believe that progress on the Jordanian track is linked to progress in contacts with Syria?" Two days ago, Minister Yosi Sarid said he believes that the negotiations with Syria are now in high gear. He believes that Peres met central figures during his tour abroad in order to promote the negotiations. Sarid noted that he does not know of a meeting in London between Peres and Husayn. He stressed that Prime Minister Rabin was the key figure in drafting the understandings between Israel and Jordan. Sarid expressed his certainty that the understandings with Jordan were made with Syria's knowledge, and that the negotiations between Israel and Syria are making satisfactory progress. Moti Bassok reports that the Foreign Ministry determinately refused to comment on the Peres-Husayn meeting. It is worth noting that in the tripartite meeting with the Israeli and U.S. delegations in Washington on 6 and 7 June, the Jordanian delegation showed much openness and willingness to advance which very much surprised its interlocutors. A senior Israeli delegation source noted that there is no doubt that the Jordanian delegation was given explicit instructions from King Husayn to pull the cart of negotiations with Israel out of the mud they have been stuck in since 14 September 1993, and to move forward on many areas, including the sensitive issue of borders. According to the source, Husayn fears that if he continues his foot-dragging policy, the Palestinians and the Syrians would leave him behind without an agreement with Israel and in a very sensitive security and political situation. It appears that Husayn was also given a go-ahead from the Syrians because it is very important for President al-Asad to be portrayed as working toward a comprehensive Middle East arrangement and as caring for the entire Arab world.
