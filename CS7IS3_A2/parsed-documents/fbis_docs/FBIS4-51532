Ideas of the ways to eliminate socialism with "peaceful evolution" had been nurtured since the 40s in this century when the reality of the power balance did not allow the imperialists to use military intervention when it so wished to topple socialism. At the end of the 80's, the imperialists and hostile forces sparked by the successes of "peaceful evolution" in Eastern European countries and the former Soviet Union, pushed forward their activities in the hope of obtaining "victory without war" in the remaining socialist countries. In our country, "peaceful evolution" and the activities of the hostile forces have been and are developing new traits, contents, forms, and maneuvers. They make clear their intentions, aims, and action plan for the peaceful evolution scheme in Vietnam. The contents of the scheme are comprehensive and cover all economic, political, ideological, cultural, and diplomatic areas. Numerous measures and forms are being deployed flexibly. These measures are unilateral and multilateral, with violence and without, and use governmental and non-governmental bodies. They are peaceful and non-peaceful evolution measures, in-depth and wide, vigorous and in careful order using well-coordinated forces. They constantly attack us on the political and ideological fronts aiming to erode trust in the party leadership, separate the party and the people, deny the glorious past of the Vietnam revolutionary party. They also openly criticize Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh thought. Our choice of socialism and the renovation undertaking is denounced with the hope that it will make people lose their confidence and question their ideals. Their maneuvers are virulent and well-organized because they combine secret with overt activities, with the support and assistance of hostile forces to fight socialism in our country as well as in others. As an adjustment to the strategy, the hostile forces use "human rights" as a major striking force against us. They elevate "human rights" and "democracy" into strategic issues. They blatantly accuse us of "religious oppression", "democratic coercion", and "human rights violations". They demand that we release "political prisoners", using it as an excuse to interfere in our internal affairs, and advocate support for dissident forces, while demanding for constitutional amendments, political pluralism, an opposition- type multiparty system, and so forth. The hostile forces are also accelerating their secret activities, especially in intelligence-gathering and espionage such as in stealing national secrets. They also strive to sow discord within our organizations, first within our party, then state organizations, the army, and police. They expect that from the ties forged by investment cooperations and other projects such as cadre training, humanitarian aid, and so forth, they will be able to convert viewpoints and ideals within our party, and entice people with faulty thinking, and those who are undecisive, biased, opportunistic, and greedy for either glory or material gain. They will wait for the right opportunity to plant spies and create "flag" wavers. From there they will form opposition organizations and unite their internal forces to become the opposition of the state in the "peaceful evolution" scheme from within. When the opportunity comes they will quickly turn to violence. In parallel to increasing aid and directing exiled reactionary organizations comprising overseas Vietnamese to carry out sabotage activities from abroad, they are also make contact with reactionary groups within the country to cause disorder, to carry out sabotage activities and political instability. All the methods of non-violence, peace, "reconciliation", "harmony" in the struggle for "democracy", "freedom", "prosperity" will be combined and slowly developed to gain legitimacy, popularity, and internationalization, leading the way for foreign forces to interfere and pressure us. It is obvious that peaceful evolution activities of the hostile forces is the next step of the basic strategy they have been applying so far. But the scheme is now being carried out vigorously, resolutely, with timely adjustments by new and more cunning maneuvers. The success of their scheme, however, is not for them to decide. The destiny and future of our country is decided by our party and people with correct policies and proper measures. In implementing the renovation initiated by the Seventh Party Congress, our people has scored important achievement in all economic, political, cultural, social, external relations, national defense, and security aspects. We have continuously freed ourselves from the obstruction and isolation of the enemy, and created a new position in the international community. Our country is experiencing new opportunities as well as new challenges, and the challenges emerging from opportunities. It is therefore the duty of the entire party, people, and army to fight against peaceful evolution. The prime and urgent duty is to protect the fatherland of socialist Vietnam. To ensure the strength and ability of our country for development, we have to maintain political stability, continue our renovation for socioeconomic development, and fight an enemy taking advantage of our economic reforms. We have to take care of the people's livelihood at the same time while safeguarding security and national defense, expanding external relations, reforming and rectifying the party, and consolidating the party's leadership role, and the flesh and bone relations between the party and the people. We also have to improve the management efficiency of the state mechanism and the socialist legal system, and strive to heighten the people's sense of vigilance by making them understand clearly the enemy's scheme of peaceful evolution. By being alert, flexible, resolute, and determined in our struggle, we will absolutely defeat all "peaceful evolution" plots and maneuvers.
