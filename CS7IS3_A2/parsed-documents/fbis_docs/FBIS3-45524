In the coming year, state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises can occupy a favorable position in the overall economic situation only by continuing their efforts to gear towards the market and to readjust the industrial structure and product mix in accordance with the market's needs . The year 1993 witnessed strong growth in China's industry and economy. But problems in economic performance did not show a marked turn for the better. Where do the problems stem from? Many personages in economic circles believe the fundamental reason for the low economic performance of China's many "quick-profit" enterprises lies in the enterprises themselves. Take enterprise funds as an example. An outstanding problem is long-term expansion of fixed asset investment, which results in excessive input for enlarged reproduction taking the place of the need for simple reproduction. Since 1993 -- the second half of the year in particular -- China's banks have done a great deal of work and have achieved marked results in providing funds on a priority basis to meet the needs of key large- and medium-sized enterprises in production. But an excessive fixed asset investment scale, over-rapid growth rates in industrial production, and decreasing product sales rates are still fundamental reasons for the shortage of funds for enterprises. This thorny problem, which continually troubled us in the 1980's, is still worthy of our concern. Judging from some circumstances in 1993, phenomena began to arise again -- such as some enterprises failing to organize production in accordance with market demand, having no ready markets to sell their products, having poor transportation conditions to ship products, and defaulting on commodity payments -- which caused enterprises to overspend their three kinds of funds [funds occupied by ready commodities of state-owned enterprises, funds on commodities which have been shipped from factories, and funds from receivable and prepaid accounts], therefore stifling the circulation of large amounts of funds. In some localities, state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises experienced increasing losses. They used bank loans for other purposes; they found it difficult to replenish their circulating funds. Such overt and covert losses also caused losses in funds. When we analyze the situation of enterprises on the basis of these causes, we cannot help reexamining the old issue that our enterprises must speed up the restructuring of their industrial operations as well as their product mix. This is because shortages of working funds caused by piling up of unsold goods has been a longstanding problem, the solution of which lies in studying market changes; in readjusting the product mix and output according to market needs; and in carrying out projects to curb production, reduce stockpiles, and promote sales. In this sense, it is still strongly realistic for us to stress every year, every month, and even every day that our enterprises must work hard to achieve higher economic returns through improving their management and operations. According to personnel within financial circles, under the credit policy of "giving preferential treatment to five types of business, tightening funds for five other types of business, and never lending money to eight types of operations," they will continue to ensure that working funds and funds for upgrading technology will be available for those profitable enterprises producing marketable goods. We must use financial pressures to force unprofitable enterprises to speed up dealing with their losses. Deficits by state enterprises are a problem which has never been effectively resolved, and it is obstructing normal economic operations. The national economy as a whole cannot possibly be revitalized unless the burdens created by growing deficits and by increasingly larger numbers of unprofitable enterprises can be cast off. Statistics show the deficits incurred by the nation's industrial enterprises which conduct business accounting independently totalled 44.157 billion yuan in 1992, and the problem was even worse for industrial enterprises whose accounting was part of the state budget. People certainly will pay closer attention to this problem in 1994. The experiences gained by some formerly deficit-ridden enterprises show that to deal with this problem, enterprises must find their own ways to gain market access through reform. In terms of the principle for developing a socialist market economy, the problem of unprofitable enterprises must be resolved through competition in the market where poorly operated businesses will be replaced by efficiently managed businesses, and resources in society will be rationally distributed. However, in real economic life many state enterprises are still alive and insolvent enterprises still manage to function only because they have local government protection and "blood transfusions" from banks. This being the case, we must find a way out for these enterprises, beginning with distributing resources rationally through the market. Under the market economic system, all enterprises must go through a test in which the poorly operated businesses will be edged out by their efficiently operated counterparts. Deficit-ridden enterprises in particular must rely on themselves to upgrade their technology, improve their management, and develop popular goods which the market needs. Those enterprises unable to reverse their deficit status will no longer have government protection, and they should no longer be kept alive with "blood transfusions" from the government or from banks. While the magnitude of problems encountered by state enterprises is unprecedented, the strategic role played by state enterprises cannot be shaken owing to China's economic realities. During the course of building a new, socialist market economic system, the need to build a modern, scientifically managed enterprise system -- which is in line with requirements of the market economy, which clearly outlines property rights and responsibilities, and which separates enterprise operations from government control -- has been placed on the agenda; enterprises must make new moves toward operating themselves autonomously, assuming sole responsibility for profits and losses, seeking development on their own, and exercising self-restraint. Next year China will introduce a series of measures governing reforms in planning, investment, banking, financial operations, foreign trade, and social security. These measures will create an environment favorable for large and medium-sized state enterprises to improve their operations. This will be a new starting point for state enterprises to move toward a market economy. How to adapt themselves to market mechanisms and generate profits and wealth from various angles and at all levels will be a new challenge for large and medium-sized state enterprise during 1994.
