He said all complaints will be investigated, including the case of corpses found in the city of Ocosingo with signs of having been tortured. The corresponding autopsies have already been requested. Madrazo Cuellar indicated CNDH's goal is precisely to ensure respect for the human rights and lives of the civilian population. [Correspondent Juan Carlos Santoyo] While the Catholic Church says that strife in Chiapas has entered a phase that may end the fighting, the CNDH, through its Chairman Madrazo Cuellar, acknowledged the situation in this area of Chiapas State is still abnormal and tense. Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas, clearly stated: I am not responsible for those who come to preach as Catholic Church ministers in Indian regions. After saying that whole familes have begun to flee the fighting and hunger in different towns in upper Chiapas, he reaffirmed the Catholic Church's willingness to open the doors of temples to let in refugees and even rebels who lay down their weapons or are wounded. He was asked very clearly: Does the danger exist that once the conflict is over there will be widespread violations of Indians' human rights? This is his reply: [Begin Ruiz recording] The danger that arbitrary action may occur during a second phase exists. For that reason, I think the CNDH, with which we specifically discussed this second phase, constitutes for the people a very important element so that the largest number of human rights organizations may observe the situation. These groups also provide help through the participation of foreign observers, who may not be directly involved because they are not Mexicans but clearly constitute a guarantee that definite steps are taken to avoid human rights violations. The peril exists, and the CNDH -- this is also the view abroad -- will provide a certain degree of security. We are confident this phase will be conducted in the most proper, reasonable, and due manner. [end recording] [Santoyo] The bishop added the time has also come to put the conflict into the hands of civilians and let the Army out of it. He also said refugee centers have opened in Palenque, Villahermosa, and Campeche, at which the people fleeing the clashes are slowly arriving. After meeting with Bishop Ruiz in his office, the CNDH chairman noted that one indication that the army has acted in accordance with the law is that civil rights have not yet been suspended. The National Indian Institute announced the implementation of different projects and programs to support Indian communities all over Chiapas. It added that priority will be given to prevent outside or foreign influence in the actions and traditions of our countr's Indians from undermining the tranquillity and social peace that reigns in this area.
