What I saw on the ground and based on it I gave the statement that Pakistan had acquired nuclear capability in 1987 and not in 1990. However, for three years, from 1987 to 1989, the US President continued to certify that Pakistan had not acquired nuclear capability, which was contrary to what was stated in a report by Richard Barlow, an American responsible for monitoring our programme in Islamabad, even though, I am sure they must have read it. Pakistan in those days had importance due to the Afghan problem, the Russians were in Afghanistan, and the Americans needed Pakistan and thus a certification had to be given that Pakistan had not acquired the capability, whereas the fact was that we had. In 1989 when Russia withdrew from Afghanistan, Pakistan ceased to be of importance to the US and thus Richard Barlow's Report became valid. Robert Oakley, the US Ambassador in Pakistan declared that Pakistan had crossed the red line, and consequently all the trouble started. It was also in early 1990 that an uprising erupted in occupied Kashmir against India. This resulted in creating tension and the relations between the two countries became very strained. India was at a disadvantage as it had not expected an uprising in Kashmir. To divert attention, it tried to cash in on the tension between India and Pakistan and projected to the world that Pakistan, having acquired nuclear capability, was preparing to launch a nuclear attack against India. This created a commotion and the US took certain steps in a attempt to curb Pakistan. The first step was to send Robert Gates to Pakistan. This was during the first tenure of Benazir Bhutto. Upon his arrival we had a meeting, and I clearly told him that they were talking about something which just did not exist on the ground. I pointed out that was definite tension between India and Pakistan between what was happening and what had been happening in the valley, and with the troops on the Line of Control in Kashmir. The hotline between GHQs of India and Pakistan had been fully functional, every second of the day. We were in conversation with them knowing exactly what was happening without even going to the second stage of tension, which leads to a state of conflict between the two countries i.e., deployment of conventional forces. The US had reached the conclusion that Pakistan was preparing for a nuclear attack on India on the basis of pictures circulated via satellite, showing troop loads of material from Kahuta moving outwards, F-16s from various bases being placed at suitable air bases for striking India, and activity in and around Quetta where they thought there were some nuclear facilities which Pakistan had created. Thus painting a picture as if Pakistan was ready to strike India. What needs to be understood here is the motive behind creating this false image of Pakistan by the Indian lobby. Firstly, it was to divert attention of the world from Kashmir, because if there is a possibility of a nuclear holocaust in the subcontinent naturally everyone will forget about what is happening in Kashmir and all attention will be directed towards this major issue. The ground realities are that in 1989, immediately after Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto took over, a meeting of the National Nuclear Command Authority (NNCA) was held. The NNCA was established by late Mr Bhutto when he first initiated the programme, and he became the chairman, being the chief executive. Later on Mr Ghulam Ishaq Khan, the Chief of the Army Staff and three other people who are involved with the programme formed the Nuclear Command Committee, This committee formulates all the policies. In January 1989 under the then president this committee met, the prime minister was there, I was there and having analysed the problems in detail we thought that there was a need to adopt a policy of restraint to limit our nuclear programme. Because we thought that Pakistan had acquired the maximum deterrence level that is needed to avert the threat that we perceived, and it could also quantify, for example the correlation of forces between India and Pakistan, i.e., conventional forces. Therefore, having reached the minimum deterrence level, the committee took a decision to limit one aspect of the programme which was uranium enrichment. If uranium is enriched to the maximum level of 95 per cent and above it becomes weapon-grade uranium. As there was no requirement of going beyond three to five per cent which is the level needed for our Kanup [Karachi Nuclear Power] plant, from the time this decision was taken, i.e. January 1989, Pakistan has been only carrying out enrichment up to three to five per cent. Whereas the other processes, i.e. the R&D for the development of the device and its refinement and development of the delivery system and refinement of the system, the test that has to be carried out in the lab and finally the safety measures for the security that have to be undertaken to ensure that there is no mismanagement are continuing. Thus, the management, control, and safeguard measures are the responsibility of the National Nuclear Command Authority. Its job was and continues to be to institutionalise policy making and to determine the capability and the criteria as to what capability level we have to acquire. This authority also determines the state of readiness which has to be maintained at all times. By a state of readiness, I mean the device integration that has to be achieved because the device contains so many different items, consequently the preparation of all those items, then the ability to put them together and have a device ready when needed. This is an important decision. Related to this is the delivery system development, which somebody said can be catapulted. I am sorry, it cannot be catapulted. It is a highly technical system and it has to be tested from time to time on computers and in the lab before you can really go in the field and carry out a real hot test. The delivery system, therefore, has to be developed. We already have the F-16s, Mirages and the M-11s which we are now getting from China that can carry, but there had been a problem in the past. Then through the missile programme, which I am sure they have continued with, we should have a delivery system with a very effective, accurate, guiding system, provided on the missiles. There have been doubts about the designation of responsibility both with the country and outside. I would like to make it very clear that the NNCA is very definite in its mind and has very clearly designated the responsibility to joint operations centre (JOC), which is maintained in the Joint Staff Head Quarters in Rawalpindi which commands all the three services during war. The JOC is the first one to be given orders when it comes to deployment and utilisation of this capability. And, of course, the orders are then passed on to the other three services which are to take action, particularly the Army and the Air Force, as these agencies are involved in the development of the device. With regard to safeguard and security measures, because of its sensitivity, foolproof methods have to be adopted for security of the whole system. The authority also lays down in great detail the policy of how the various components will be place, protected, and safeguarded. There are technical and procedural measures which are adopted to ensure that no mistakes are made. These procedures and technicalities are devised by NNCA, as they are a highly guarded secret. Therefore, to the best of our ability, we have developed technical and procedural measures to safeguard and provide safety to the material. This has been the case from the very first day the programme started. There has to be a political chain of command. It was there, it has been there and continues to be there till today. The military chain of command starts from below where it is at the receiving end and carries out instructions as received from the political authority. The person who has the hand on the button is the chief executive. But the term "chief executive" has undergone several changes. When Mr Bhutto was alive, he had his hand on the button. when Gen. Ziaul Haq came to power, his hand was on the button and after him Ms Benazir Bhutto and so on. The question is, now that we have acquired this capability what do we gain from it. In this context, I would like to read two statements. The first one I quote: "Pakistan's possession of Nuclear Weapons makes a large Indian conventional edge unexploitable. "The conventional edge implies the correction of forces, in which the Indian Army is three times, the Air Force five times and Navy ten times that of Pakistan's. They cannot exploit this situation because Pakistan possesses nuclear weapons. This is the first advantage that we have gained. And this is something that a former Indian Army Chief Sunderjeet admits in his statement, "On balance one may conclude that in a general low level symmetry between India and Pakistan a substantial degree of nuclear stability exists." The fact is that if today there is stability, it is due to the possession of nuclear capability by both sides. I can count many advantages. It certainly has reduced the possibility of war. Although the option of going to war is not with the weaker but with the stronger one, but as the stronger's options are limited due to the possession of the nuclear weapon, therefore, India just cannot unleash its conventional weapons against Pakistan. That makes the possibility of war between India and Pakistan much less. The question of cost effectiveness has been raised, which is something very surprising. When our project was at its peak in 1985, 1986, 1987 the annual budget of Kahuta programme was less than the cost of one F-16. We paid about 28 million dollars per aircraft as against 18 million dollars, the actual cost, because we got it out of turn and we had to pay 10 million dollars extra for every aircraft. I am, therefore, talking of 18 million dollars and I say on good authority that the cost of one year's budget programme of Kahuta Laboratory is less than the cost of one single F-16 aircraft. And from the time we received these F-16s, I think we have lost four or five of them and are left with only 34 or 35. So if somebody is thinking exchanging our nuclear programme with the F-16s -- 38 of them -- I am sure he is not aware of this reality. Another advantage that Pakistan has in possessing a nuclear weapon is that India cannot indulge in nuclear blackmail against Pakistan since we have a meaningful capability. We took a decision, a policy of restraint as we thought that since we had reached the minimum deterrence level, we did not have to go beyond it. But it must be remembered that limiting enrichment of uranium does not cap your nuclear programme. If you are carrying out the enrichment of uranium up to five per cent, to take it to 20 per cent, perhaps you need about a week's time. If from 20 per cent, you want to take it to 95 per cent another 10 days or so will be required only. Thus, within 15 days, if you want you can just raise the level to 95 per cent and you will be producing weapon-grade uranium. This should make the difference apparent. First they were talking of rolling back, now they want Pakistan to cap its programme. This is a very major decision which Pakistan has to take, but in my judgement if it comes to that, and if there are great many advantages, then it has to be a move in symmetry with what India is doing. It has to be a simultaneous action guaranteed by the powers and thus bring Pakistan and India to understand the logic to cap their programme. They do not want us to roll back which is a big change, and I think if India agrees, Pakistan may decide to cap its programme.
