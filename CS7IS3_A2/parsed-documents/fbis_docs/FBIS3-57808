The weekly newspaper to be published Sunday [2 January] based its story on German intelligence and diplomatic reports of Zhirinovskiy's reaction following the German government's rejection Wednesday of his application, made in Bulgaria, for a visa to visit Germany again. Just before Christmas the Russian rightwing extremist did visit Germany, meeting with the head of a German far-right party, Gerhard Frey of the German People's Union (DVU). Quoting a secret service tape-recording and a report by the German Embassy in Sofia, WELT AM SONNTAG said Zhirinovskiy threatened that, if he came to power, Russia would break off diplomatic relations and, rather than withdraw its remaining troops, station 300,000 of them in Germany. From a figure of 550,000 in 1990, the number of Russian troops and their families on German soil has fallen to 70,000 today, and they are all due to depart by August 31, 1994. Asked by a member of the German Embassy in Sofia if he wanted to occupy Germany militarily, Zhirinovskiy reportedly said that the soldiers should "ensure the compensation for Russian damages suffered in World War II." Germany would have to pay, to the extent of becoming a "poor country," he said. Zhirinovskiy told the diplomat that Wednesday's rejection of his visa application could lead to a "third World War" by which Germany would be "completely destroyed." According to WELT AM SONNTAG, Zhirinovskiy also made personal threats against German diplomats, vowing that the one who informed him his visa application was refused would soon be "liquidated." He claimed to have such good contacts with Russian intelligence that he could make the official simply "disappear." The newspaper also reported that the German intelligence services were stepping up their surveillance of the international and German activities of rightwing extremists such as Zhirinovskiy and his party. To the surprise and consternation of Western governments, Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party won 23 percent of the vote in the Russian legislative elections held December 12, making it the second strongest party in the Russian parliament. Zhirinovskiy has widely been portrayed as a fascist with ideas akin to those of Adolf Hitler. He and the DVU leader Frey embraced warmly when they met at Munich airport last month.
