This figure "is and remains our basic position," Kohl said today at a conference on security policy in Munich. The actual Bundeswehr strength will average 361,000 during the current year, and probably higher at the end of the year. The personnel level of the Bundeswehr had fluctuated by 30,000 in previous years, Kohl said. The goal must be "to stay around the 370,000 level." Account will be taken of this trend in drawing up the 1994 budget, Kohl announced. At the same time, he countered criticism from the United States that Germany is doing too little for military defense. In this context, account also has to be taken of the other achievements Germany has contributed to European stability. Kohl drew attention to statistics from the Canadian Government, according to which: since 1989 Germany has provided $341 per capita to support the countries of the former Soviet Union, while Canada has provided $67, France $34, Italy $31, the United States $30, Japan $5, and Great Britain only $1. Kohl responded with annoyance to reproaches that Germany is primarily promoting the dissemination and development of chemical weapons. It is "disproportionate" for Germany to be cited on every occasion of this kind, while in the shadow of this discussion,others are able to continue their deals, the chancellor said. In addition, Kohl drew attention to the "time bombs" in the form of dangerous nuclear reactors in eastern Europe. It is "astonishing" which countries are concluding energy supply agreements with the countries where such plants are located. Indeed, the "degree of strange calm" with which Europe and Japan are accepting these time bombs is generally "incomprehensible." Kohl strongly rejected the view that the Russian people are "incapable of democracy in the long term." It is "completely absurd" to expect Russia to introduce democracy and the market economy overnight, Kohl said. If the West denies the Russian people these opportunities from the outset, "nothing can come of it." The chancellor again called for western markets to be opened up to products from eastern Europe. It is a "fairly hypocritical policy" to hold out the prospect of involvement in NATO, but to cut oneself off from products.
