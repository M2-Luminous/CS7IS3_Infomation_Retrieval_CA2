Looking back and ahead, how, facing the new circumstances and new tasks, shall we accomplish the province's economic targets for 1994 in a better way? With this question in mind, our staff reporter Guan Qizhi interviewed acting Governor Zhang Wule on New Year's eve. Acting Governor Zhang Wule gave a systematic explanation of the economic approach and measures mapped out for 1994 in this province. Today, we bring you the first of the three parts of the recorded interview. [Begin recording] [Guan] Governor Zhang, the year 1993 has now passed. What is your comment on our province's economic work in the past year? [Zhang Wule] In 1993, the economic operation in our province has been basically normal. It has maintained a steady and healthy development momentum. If measured by the major economic growth indexes, the provincial GNP was 39.42 billion yuan, the growth rate being 10 percent; the second major index, the provincial income, was 28.44 billion yuan, the growth rate being 10.5 percent; and the prescribed target for total industrial and agricultural output value was fulfilled. In particular, our economic efficiency has been improved to some extent this past year: The production-marketing rate of industry reached 94 percent; the speed of funds circulation also accelerated; and the growth of sales income and deliverable profits and taxes obtained was faster than that of output value. In agriculture, the whole province attached great importance to grain output, which registered 14.8 billion jin this year. The past year has also witnessed the fastest growth of township and town enterprises in recent years, as their total output value reached 16.8 billion yuan, the growth rate being over 50 percent. The net income of peasants was 550 yuan per capita. The actual financial revenue of the province, after all the above-mentioned data are factored in, is estimated at 4.58 billion yuan, the original target being 4.32 billion yuan. This represents a 14.6 percent increase over last year. Using these major indexes, one should say that our economy has maintained a sustained and healthy development momentum. But, in my opinion, we should recognize that there are problems in our economic development. Where are the major problems? I think I can sum them up with one point, that is, comparing our province's current level of economic development with the macroenvironment of the whole country, we can see that our main problem is the slowness in economic development, which calls for efforts to change through deepening the reform by various means. [Guan] Governor Zhang, the year 1994 will be the first year for our province to achieve our next five-year objectives. It will also be a year when the largest number of reform measures will be promulgated. One can call it a year for solving key problems in the reform. Faced with this situation, what measures will our province adopt to boost its economy? [Zhang] You are quite right to call next year a year for solving key problems in the reform. On a nationwide scale, the depth and breadth of the reform policies and measures to be promulgated next year will be unprecedented since 15 years ago when the reform and opening up began. Therefore, I feel we should pay attention to the following points when carrying out economic work in the coming year. First, we should conscientiously analyze the situation facing our province in terms of economic development. Second, we should find out the impact of the reform measures to be promulgated by the state on our province and work out matching policies and measures that we should adopt. Third, in light of such overall circumstances, we should establish and improve the basic strategies of our economic development. [passage omitted]
