The good thing was that the tragedy produced by extremism, terrorism, and violence has made everyone realize that the issue is not only the result of religious or ideological deviation or incitement by foreign countries and forces that do not like to see us enjoying stability and progress, but that the origin and roots of the problem have something to do with the social and economic situation in which we live and from which we suffer. We sometimes deny the existence of the problem and sometimes we do not read and interpret it correctly, claiming that everything is fine and nothing better could be done. But the bitter truth remains, does not disappear, and does not change in the eyes of those who really are afraid for the future of the country and the nation. I say very humbly that we have frequently drawn attention to the fact that violence, extremism, and terrorism would not have broken out, grown strong, and spread had they not found the proper environment and fertile ground among the unemployed, the poor, the frustrated, the desperate, and people without hope who are ready to dismiss this society which did not provide them with work, housing, clothing, and hope for the future, as is necessary. We have often attacked the inciters, provokers, and liars, claiming that extremism and terrorism are imported commodities that have no basis in our society and we have pursued a policy of concealment and deception until one day we woke up to the sound of explosions and this terrifying bloody clash. We now follow the deterioration of the situation with concern. At any rate, thank God that we have awakened after a long sleep, distractions, plays on words and slogans, and deception in interpretations and justifications to place our fingers on the cause of the disease. It is clear that the problem is due to the existing social and economic inequality that has created sharp divisions among the people, disturbed the structure of society that has been maintained over the ages, and produced abnormal conditions, values, and traditions that respect money more than intellect, sanctify wealth more than work, and exercise deception more than ethics. The result has been social division and economic disparity that have no logical basis. [passage omitted]
