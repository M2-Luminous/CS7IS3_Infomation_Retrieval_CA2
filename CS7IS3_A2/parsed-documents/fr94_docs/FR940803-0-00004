FR940803-0-00004 FR940803-0-00002 The assessment rate recommended by the TVCC is derived by dividing the anticipated expenses by expected shipments of oranges and grapefruit. Because that rate is applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate which will provide sufficient income to pay the TVCC's expected expenses. The TVCC met on May 10, 1994, and unanimously recommended total expenses of $1,141,944 and an assessment rate of $0.16 per 7/10 bushel carton for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year. In comparison, the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year expense amount was $984,319, which is $157,625 less than the recommended $1,141,944 for this season and the assessment rate was $0.15, which is $0.01 less than that recommended for the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year. Assessment income for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year is expected to amount to $960,000 based upon estimated fresh domestic shipments of 6 million cartons of oranges and grapefruit. This, in addition to a withdrawal of $181,944 from the TVCC's reserve fund, should be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. In comparison, the assessment income for the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year was estimated at $825,000 based upon anticipated fresh domestic shipments of 5.5 million cartons of oranges and grapefruit. Funds in the reserve at the end of the fiscal year, estimated at $276,468, will be within the maximum permitted by the order of one fiscal year's expenses. Major expense categories for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year include $132,444 for shared administrative expenses with the South Texas Onion and Melon Committees, $650,000 for advertising, compared to $723,425 for the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year, and $174,000 for the Mexican Fruit Fly support program. While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs should be significantly offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted by the TVCC and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule as hereinafter set forth will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register because: (1) The TVCC needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis; (2) the fiscal year for the TVCC begins August 1, 1994, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment for the fiscal year apply to all assessable oranges and grapefruit handled during the fiscal year; (3) handlers are aware of this action which was recommended by the TVCC at a public meeting and which is similar to budgets issued in past years; and (4) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will be considered prior to finalization of this action.
