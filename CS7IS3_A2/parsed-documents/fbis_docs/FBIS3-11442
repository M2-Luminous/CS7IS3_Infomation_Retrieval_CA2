All this discussion has an undeniable political content at its core, although many of those promoting it are trying to create overtones of a personal nature, with excessively ideologized undercurrents. The FSLN should not be ideologically labeled immediately after a verbal battle in which one of every two or three groups tries to lord it over the others by means of demagogic blustering or by resorting to slanted attacks, rhetorical euphemisms, or personal criticisms without any political foundation. Instead, the political and organizational structure of the front should be transformed substantially from top to bottom, and adapted efficiently and coherently to fit new circumstances. William Ramirez, an FSLN guerrilla comandante, party deputy in the National Assembly, and member of one of the committees (bylaws) created to prepare for the Extraordinary Congress, reflects in this interview about the diverse angles from which the debate has been approached. Decorated with the "Carlos Fonseca" order, the supreme honor his party awards to its best militants, Ramirez speaks here of the type of party which, in his view, the FSLN should now become. [Aguirre] Does the FSLN still carry, or should it continue to carry, the baggage of a political-military guerrilla organization? [Ramirez] I believe the FSLN should not renounce its history. The FSLN's formation obviously had both a political and military origin; we cannot turn our backs on that, because it is something that actually happened; it is a part of history. It should be preserved as a historic landmark, to teach new generations what we human beings are capable of doing when all our options have been closed off and all the outlets for making our voices heard and our rights respected have been denied us. Starting from the basis of that historic experience, the FSLN should now adapt and adjust to the new political circumstances which the world is now experiencing, which Nicaragua is experiencing. I think we need to maintain and reemphasize those moral values and develop them in today's new circumstances. [Aguirre] What does being a revolutionary mean to you now, at this point in history? [Ramirez] More than anything else, it means identifying with and serving the interests of the poor, but it does not necessarily mean excluding other people who may contribute to the nation's development. It seems to me that injustice must be a spur that moves us to do battle constantly. The consequences of the inhumanity that the world's present circumstances are provoking must be another cause of sadness, another spur to move us to take action and fight. To me, being a revolutionary today means accepting a form of behavior and a theory identified with the interests of the downtrodden. [Aguirre] How revolutionary is the FSLN today? [Ramirez] I believe the FSLN is a revolutionary party, and we need to continue to keep it revolutionary. I believe it is dangerous for us to start dividing it into categories or to express strictly ideological positions, for we know that the front has always been full of a variety of political views. If people here start to say that the FSLN needs to consist solely of "pure Marxists," leaving no room for "liberals," or if we take strictly ideological positions and begin to divide the FSLN between haves and have-nots, between atheists and believers, rich and poor, finally, if we create categories among Sandinists, we will also be creating the germ of a split in the FSLN, for the FSLN has always been a front and it has never been a "pure" political party. There has always been a diversity of elements in the front, believers, nonbelievers, landowners, and workers, and there has always been respect for these different beliefs. That must be preserved in the FSLN. [Aguirre] Does that mean that calling itself revolutionary now is more a matter of practical actions than of ideological concepts that seem very confused and seem to lack strong support...? Is that it? [Ramirez] For many of us, what happened in socialism and with socialist ideas came as a sort of new discovery, and we realized that many values were not what we had been taught. Today things are seen in another way. I believe in humanity and I believe in socialism, and it seems to me that we have to try to help everyone to live better, to offer the technical and material conditions for the advancement of all the Nicaraguan people. I want a society in which all citizens have jobs, land, access to health care and education, where the capacity exists to produce material goods and where spiritual resources are expanded. But in reality, there is a specific crisis that we need to resolve, and until it is resolved it would be utopian to make promises while overlooking that reality. It would not just be utopian, but demagogic. We cannot offer the people something we know we cannot do. That would be irresponsible. [Aguirre] In recent days, as we have learned from the diatribes and controversies recounted in the media, a more definite division of the waters of the currents of political thought in the FSLN has begun.... What is your position on all this? [Ramirez] I do not think this is an ideological discussion; it is a personal attack aimed at one of the leaders, Sergio Ramirez. In order to discredit him as a presidential candidate they have begun to seek out his weak points, and so they have created an entire pseudo-ideological language that is nothing more than a coverup for an ideological discussion. People have started to say he is a social democrat, etc., with the intention of a priori discrediting him as a candidate. The truth is that in the FSLN we all share a program, Sandinist rules of behavior. I can ask any militant to support the front's program with me, and if he backs it I will expect that he act in accordance with that program. I will not be too concerned about whether or not he may own property, whether he is a believer or not. What interests me is that he does what the program says, so we can work together in the struggle. If we start to talk about categories, we need to remember that that is going to create divisions within the FSLN. [Aguirre] Does it seem to you that the FSLN's present National Directorate is capable of guiding this process toward a full, popular, and pluralist democracy? [Ramirez] Everybody agrees that the FSLN needs renewal, and in that renewal, its leaders must be included. I support that position. It seems to me that the present National Directorate played a great role in its leadership during the war, while we were underground, and while we were in office. Now we need to make room for new leaders. On whether or not they are capable of leading the front in these new circumstances, many of us know how they are currently working, and I feel there is no way at this time that the present national leadership can continue operating as it is doing, which is in a totally irregular manner. I think it is healthy not only to change the FSLN program based on the new circumstances and for the approaching election campaign, but also the bylaws, the internal regulations, and party officers. [Aguirre] In your view, should a party like the present FSLN consider the possibility of once again turning to an armed uprising at some specific moment? [Ramirez] That depends. In the Somoza era, our voices were heard on the radio only when we attacked, we were in the newspapers only when we were taken prisoner or we were dead, because we had no space. Today's conditions are different. Now we have room for political action, we have newspapers, radio stations; we cannot say the political conditions are the same as they were in the past. I believe we need to continue using political methods, civic and electoral routes to work out our internal disputes and bring about government changes in this country. In reality, the possibility of an armed uprising is not desirable for me, nor do I believe it would be for the rest of the Nicaraguan people. I definitely support a civic and electoral approach. I believe that is the best heritage we can give our children. [Aguirre] I remember seeing Sandinists leading the fight against the Somozist guard, holding important posts in the Sandinist government, dealing with difficult situations (a government minister, along with the entire population, facing a hurricane like Joan, for example), always as Sandinist cadres; it would be said such people were proven Sandinists.... What sort of FSLN does a man like you expect at this time? [Ramirez] I want a FSLN for all Nicaraguans. I would not like there to be an FSLN that excludes anyone, I would like an FSLN whose aspiration is to serve and fight for the interests of the poor. I want an FSLN that will reclaim the mystique that many of us have lost, a mystique that is practical and not a matter of speeches or party lines. I want this country to live better, I want the Nicaraguan people to live better. I want my party to be a united party, a party of men and women capable of keeping their nation free, with a moral quality that will serve as an example to all of Central America and the world. [Aguirre] How does a Sandinist guerrilla comandante deal with a world like today's, with today's Nicaragua? [Ramirez] It has been a difficult transition phase on a personal level. My first year in the National Assembly was very hard for me because I am not a man used to talking or giving speeches. I have always been more a man of action than a theoretician, but I realized that things have changed, that we had lost the elections, that my new place was in the National Assembly. It was not until the second year that I came to understand that that was where I should be fighting my political battles. I think that is still happening to many of our comrades. We have not yet realized that we are now something different. We want to continue being Sandinists and recover the best values of Sandinism. Now our struggle is not advanced by setting fire to this country, but by taking part in politics, by debating issues and expressing demands politically. Still, I do not reject popular struggle, union, or even political demonstrations. We need to combine all possible forms of civic struggle so this country will have the opportunity it has never had to move forward. [Aguirre] This is obviously another context, another scenario. So, how do you view your time as a "guerrilla comandante"? Do you look at it with nostalgia, or does it seem only a romantic image? [Ramirez] I view it as a recognition of something that happened. We were where we were, we did what we did. It was something that happened. I believe it was for the good of our country. I do not regret doing what I did or having been involved in the FSLN, but it seems to me that I should not--none of us should--live on past glories. We have to live in the present and play a new role in this society.
