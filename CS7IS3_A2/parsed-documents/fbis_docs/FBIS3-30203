Speaking at a press conference in Ljubljana where he arrived on Thursday [27 January] on a short private visit, Zhirinovskiy resolutely opposed any military action in former Yugoslavia. Any further foreign involvement in the Yugoslav crisis, especially in war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina, would inevitably trigger world war three, he argued. The first precondition for resolving the crisis in the Balkans is to withdraw foreign troops from the territory of former Yugoslavia. Otherwise, the conflict would continue for another 20 or 30 years, said Zhirinovskiy. At the press conference attended by over 100 reporters from Europe, Japan and the United States, Zhirinovskiy said he would present his plan for resolving the Bosnia crisis during his visit to Belgrade on Sunday. TANJUG learns unofficially that Zhirinovskiy will be visiting Belgrade at the invitation of the Russian-Serbian Friendship Society. In Slovenia, Zhirinovskiy was highly criticial of the disintegration of the Slavic states into a host of city-statelettes. If this trend continues, the entire world will break up because the retailoring of borders in one case will encourage the same practice in another. Slovenia violently seceded from the former Yugoslav Federation in 1991. Asked whether he had his own ideas for the formation of a new Yugoslav community, Zhirinovskiy said a confederation of Slovenes, Serbs and Croats could not be ruled out.
