I would like to talk about this with you. [Kim Sang-ul] The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique recently raved that in the event the adventurous Team Spirit joint military exercise is suspended, it will stage large scale exercises of a northward nuclear war of aggression, including Ulchi-Focus Lens, in August with the United States. THE WASHINGTON TIMES referred to remarks of the South Korean hard-liners against the North and of military experts and reported that to fill the vacuum caused by suspending the Team Spirit joint military exercise, other types of joint military exercises may be conducted by South Korea and the United States. This single fact alone shows that traitor Kim Yong-sam is going to further intensify North-South confrontation and war maneuvers this year. [Kim Myong] Two years ago, the United States and the South Korean puppets announced that they would suspend the Team Spirit war exercise in a bid to help North-South dialogue. However, they conducted exercises of a northward nuclear war of aggression under a different name, claiming that they should fill up the vacuum. Thus, they led the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war. The people still clearly remember this. Even before one year passed since he came to office under the veil of civilian politics, traitor Kim Yong-sam is going to stage, on a larger scale, a northward nuclear aggressive war exercise with the United States under a title other than Team Spirit. This shows that traitor Kim Yong-sam is a warmonger more vicious and vile than previous military dictators. [Kim Sang-ul] Yes. You are right. While staging the 93-Ulchi war exercise in July last year, traitor Kim Yong-sam directed that this exercise should be conducted in the atmosphere of a real war. The puppet prime minister also stressed that the exercise should be conducted by stressing the importance of a strong sense of national security, thus instigating war hysterics. Furthermore, hundreds of thousands of South Korean puppets and U.S. Forces in South Korea, and tens of thousands of troops from the U.S. mainland participated in the Ulchi-Focus Lens joint military exercise, which was staged for as long as 15 days last August. In addition, a number of lethal weapons, including nuclear weapons, were mobilized in this exercise. At that time, public opinion pointed out that this joint military exercise is another version of the Team Spirit war exercise -- only in different name. This is not an accident at all. If they conduct a large-scale South Korean-U.S. joint military exercise this year, and even add the Ulchi war exercise, people will doubt the significance of suspending Team Spirit. [Kim Myong] You are right. Facts illustrate that the Kim Yong- sam puppet clique is a group of warmongers and national traitors, who are dashing along the road of war, going against the trend of the time, not toward peace. The facts also show that the so-called Kim Yong-sam civilian government is deceptive and that it is in actuality a more vicious and cunning bellicose regime than previous military dictatorial regimes. As this civilian regime emerged from the root of a military fascist dictatorial regime, there cannot be any change. [Kim Sang-ul] The whole world, not to mention fellow countrymen, unanimously wish that the North and the South on the Korean peninsula will advance toward detente and cooperation, instead of confrontation and division as seen last year. This year we are also making all sincere efforts to improve North-South relations and open a new aspect for national reunification in conformity with the desire of all fellow countrymen. Nevertheless, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, turning its back on our patriotic proposals and magnanimous efforts since the early stage of the year, is recklessly running amok continuously with anticommunist confrontation maneuvers by instigating the atmosphere of war. The Kim Yong-sam clique is indeed a group of rash war maniacs. [Kim Myong] It goes without saying that the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is a group of war maniacs. This was proven by a single fact that it increased 1994 military expenses -- so-called national defense expenditures -- to 10 trillion won. As shown by this, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique increased the scale of 1994 military expenses by 9.6% from last year, thus amounting to more than 10 trillion won. [Kim Sang-ul] I think it is the first time that the amount of South Korean military expenses has exceeded 10 trillion won. What do you think? [Kim Myong] You are right. Even under the oppressive military dictatorship of the Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u military fascist clique, so-called military expenses were not increased on such a drastic scale. This again proves clearly that traitor Kim Yong-sam is a warmonger outshining former military dictators. It is not difficult to imagine how frantically traitor Kim Yong-sam will run amok with reckless war provocation maneuvers against fellow countrymen this year by spending a greater amount of money. [Kim Sang-ul] That is right. From the beginning of this year, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique has been running wild with military provocation maneuvers by making violent gun powder-reeking remarks. On 21 January, traitor Kim Yong-sam visited the puppet Defense Ministry as part of his annual inspection tour and handed out a so- called instruction. This rascal made violent bellicose remarks there, such as establishment of a new national defense policy, strengthening of quality-oriented military power, and so forth. On the other hand, the Kim Yong-sam clique staged frantic war exercises aimed at a northward invasion in South Korean areas with outside forces and constantly perpetrated grave military provocations along the demarcation line area. [Kim Myong] The civilian regime cannot be consistent with war. The puppet regime, composed of bellicose elements who pursue war, cannot be called a civilian government. The Kim Yong-sam puppet regime is driving North-South relations into a grave aspect by aggravating confrontation and tension. As long as this regime remains intact, national interest will be infringed upon more seriously, and the whole nation will suffer nuclear disaster and will inevitably become the victim of big powers. Stressing that nothing can be hoped for and expected from the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, the people from all walks of life in South Korea courageously rose in an antigovernment struggle by upholding the slogan calling for the overthrow of the Kim Yong-sam regime. It is quite natural. The Kim Yong-sam puppet regime, which betrayed the nation and turned its back on the people, should be deservedly overthrown. [Kim Sang-ul] You are right. Officers and men of the South Korean Army should not blindly follow the order of the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, which has frantically run amok with war maneuvers since the beginning of the year. They should precisely look straight at the trend of the time and should join the fierce step of the people to achieve peace and peaceful reunification of the nation through great unity of the whole country. They should no longer be driven into such war exercises that go counter to the nation.
