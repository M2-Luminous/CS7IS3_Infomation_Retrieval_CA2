Wang Qun, secretary of the autonomous regional party committee and chairman of the regional people's congress standing committee, pointed out at the meeting: Since this year, the economic development, social stability, and nationality unity in Inner Mongolia have forged ahead very well, and, especially, the adaptability to and control over the transition to a socialist market economic system have continuously strengthened. Inner Mongolia has boundless prospects to speed up development and great hope to be ranked among the best. Attending the meeting were Qian Fenyong, Bai Enpei, and Wang Zhan, deputy secretaries, and Wuyunqimuge, standing committee member of the autonomous regional party committee. Also attending were leaders of the regional people's congress standing committee, government, and committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC]; responsible persons of the departments of the regional party committee; responsible persons of the standing committee and various committees of the regional people's congress; responsible persons of the regional departments in charge of overall responsibilities; and responsible persons of the regional press and propaganda units. Wang Qun expounded the region's current excellent situation from 10 aspects. He held: In the first five months of this year, party committees, people's congresses, governments, and CPPCC committees at all levels and the cadres and masses of various nationalities in the region did a great amount of fruitful work and achieved a marked success in conscientiously implementing the 20-character guideline of "grasping opportunity, deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, promoting development, and maintaining stability," which was issued by the party Central Committee. Inner Mongolia has maintained a good developing situation in the process of establishing a socialist market economic system. Generally speaking, the situation of Inner Mongolia is very good. Wang Qun pointed out: First, a good situation has prevailed in the region's economic development of industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry. Rural and pastoral areas have been prosperous; the people have been intent on advancement; and animal husbandry has reaped another bumper harvest. In agriculture, sown areas have been expanded, and the farming structure has been positively readjusted, making it most possible for peasants and herdsmen to increase their income by 100 yuan over last year. A more gratifying achievement is that new headway has been made by the broad masses of peasants and herdsmen in adapting themselves to the socialist market economic system. Although industrial production confronted many difficulties and problems on the way of reform, Inner Mongolia's enterprises at and above the township level achieved an output value of 10.594 billion yuan in the January-April period, up 11.1 percent from the corresponding period of last year. The ranking of our development speed rose from 24th in the country to 16th as compared with the corresponding period of last year. State-owned medium and small-sized enterprises have developed more rapidly than large and medium-sized enterprises; and the development speed of collective enterprises, the "three types of foreign-funded enterprises," joint-stock enterprises, and individual enterprises has outstripped that of the enterprises owned by the whole people. Especially the township enterprises have increased by a large margin, showing their characteristics of strong adaptability and flexibility to the market economic system. The large-scale increase of the tertiary industry, commodity circulation, service trades is also heartening. Second, tax revenue has increased synchronously. The financial revenue of the whole region in the January-April period of this year increased by 12 percent over the corresponding period of last year, and taxes increased by 20.5 percent. Commodity prices have been stable basically, and the level of commodity prices has been lower than the national average. This proves that the reform of the state's financial system has developed steadily and yielded good results. Third, urban and rural people have made gratifying progress in adapting themselves to and controlling over the socialist market economic activities. The concept of "finding the market instead of the mayor" has been accepted by more and more people. People have come to understand more how to follow the guidance of the market to readjust the structure of farming and livestock breeding, to take the road of merging into groups and exploiting small areas, and to develop a coordinated economy. In this aspect, many typical examples have sprung up in many areas, and a wealth of experiences have been accumulated. Fourth, the accelerated development of the state's key industries and basic industries in Inner Mongolia will certainly push the region's economy to develop fast. At present, the state is accelerating the pace in implementing the preferential policy in minority nationality areas. We should grasp the opportunity, make use of the party and state's preferential policy to minority nationality areas to speed up the region's economic construction by every possible means, make efforts to construct the region into China's largest base of agriculture, animal husbandry, sideline production, and foodstuff industry, and construct it into the state's important energy base. The central authority's policy to enrich the country and to strengthen the border area will certainly bring very favorable opportunity for Inner Mongolia's development, and Inner Mongolia's prospect is boundless and full of hope. Fifth, reform, opening up, and the endeavor of bringing in investment from abroad and developing lateral cooperation at home have greatly pushed forward the unconventional development of the region's township enterprises, "three types of foreign-funded enterprises," and individual enterprises. Township enterprise is the promising and the only means to enrich the broad masses of peasants and herdsmen and also to develop the region's economy. The increase rate of the region's township enterprises in the first four months of this year was registered at 119 percent. Township enterprises have slashed a road of development characterized by little input, high yield, and high efficiency, thus demonstrating their great vitality. The region has also the six large backbone industries, such as coal, electricity, chemical, and light and textile industries. As long as our understanding is unified and the leadership and the rank and file are of one mind and do their utmost together, the development of Inner Mongolia will certainly be accelerated, and it is very possible for it to be "ranked among the best." Sixth, the 3 million people of all nationalities have fired the first shot of the fight to shake off poverty and to get rich, and the victory in shaking off poverty and getting rich in six years is within grasp. The key is that the higher and lower levels should take the matter seriously and unite and work hard. To unite in the fight is the key to winning victory. This fight should be made successful at any cost. We may adopt the means of coordinating state's support with the self-reliance and arduous efforts of the masses, supporting the poor with intellectual resources, science, and technology, and sending persons to selected poverty-stricken areas to help improve their work. People at higher and lower levels of the whole region should unite as one, work hard together, and put into effect the party, the state, and the region's every support-the-poor policy and measure. Seventh, the endeavors to rejuvenate the region with science and technology and to do a good job in comprehensive service are developing from the past decentralized pattern characterized by each doing his own way into a new pattern suitable to the market economy, which is characterized by a broad sphere, a merging into groups, coordination of agriculture, industry, animal husbandry with trade and technology, and combination of companies with peasant households. What the market demands is what technology will serve to produce. The concept of the victory belonging to the superior in market competition is being accepted by more and more producers and managers. Winning by superior quality and aiming at improving efficiency have become the irresistible development trends in rejuvenating the region with science and technology and improving comprehensive service. Eighth, being built on a fine basis, the ecotypic agriculture and animal husbandry of good economic efficiency are developing more rapidly. The region's agriculture and animal husbandry have already had a nice basis, and the ecotype and good economic efficiency are the higher demands on the development of agricultural and animal husbandry production. In ecological construction and environmental protection, the region has the precious experiences of "growing trees, growing grass, and growing shrubs," and "turning cultivated land back to forests or pastures." We should further spread these experiences to have them yield positive results throughout the region. Party committees, people's congresses, governments, and CPPCC committees at all levels in the region should, according to their own duties, do a good job in the work which has a strategic meaning to benefit future generations. Ninth, to be actively intent on advancement and to be united and stable are another characteristic of the region's situation. That people of all nationalities in the region help each other and achieve progress and prosperity together has become a common practice. Cadres of all nationalities and the broad masses of the people have shared comforts and hardships, communist party members have set the example of carrying on the fine tradition of the party, and the socialist style has been carried forward. A number of heroes and models have emerged in this. Organizational departments and propaganda departments at all levels should make great efforts to carry forward the new practice of the times and publicize advanced and heroic deeds to further develop the good situation characterized by active efforts in making progress, unity, and stability. Tenth, the leadership has been strengthened, style of work has been improved, and the guideline of attaching equal importance to and achieving success in two tasks at the same time has been carried out further. When building the socialist material civilization, leaders at all levels have had high enthusiasm for building the socialist spiritual civilization, and their measures have been powerful and achievements conspicuous. Stressing lofty ideals, morality, styles, and discipline has become the common wish and action of cadres and masses of all nationalities. Comrade Wang Qun pointed out that the ten aspects described above were the major indicators of the region's excellent situation. Wang Qun pointed out: We should attach much importance to the existing problems and difficulties, though facing the good situation. Problems such as the development of enterprises, banner and county's finance, and commodity prices should all be taken very seriously by leaders at all levels. As long as the people at higher and lower levels of the region work hard together, these problems that have occurred in the process of progress and development can be totally overcome and resolved. The whole region's cadres and masses of all nationalities should persistently carry out the basic line of the party, take the 20-character guideline of the party Central Committee as the guide, uplift spirit, work hard together, adopt positive measures to solve the practical problems we have faced, and consolidate and develop the region's excellent situation which has been hard-won.
