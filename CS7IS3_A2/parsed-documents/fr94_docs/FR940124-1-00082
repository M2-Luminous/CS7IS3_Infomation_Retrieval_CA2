FR940124-1-00082 FR940124-1-00009 In implementing their role under the State Postsecondary Review Program, the Secretary expects States to develop rigorous educational, administrative, and financial review standards and to conduct thorough, impartial reviews of referred institutions under those standards. Therefore, the Secretary anticipates that SPRE reviews will lead to increases in the quality of education and training provided by institutions that comply with or ascribe to the State's review standards. The Secretary also anticipates that, through reviews of referred institutions, SPREs will help to reduce fraud, waste, and abuse in the Title IV, HEA programs by taking actions to effect the termination of institutions that (1) fail substantially to meet the State's review standards, and are recalcitrant in taking actions to come into compliance with those standards, or (2) are involved in fraudulent practices. These proposed regulations were subject to the negotiated rulemaking process in accordance with section 492 of the HEA. Under the negotiated rulemaking process, the Secretary convened four regional meetings in September 1992 to obtain public involvement in the development of these proposed regulations. The meetings were held in San Francisco, Atlanta, New York, and Kansas City. Before convening the meetings, the Secretary held a meeting in Washington, DC in August 1992 to invite comments from interested parties as to the key issues that should be addressed at the regional meetings. At the four regional meetings, the Secretary provided attendees with a list of issues that needed to be addressed in these proposed regulations. A summary of the responses of the attendees is contained in Appendix A to these proposed regulations. Individuals and groups who attended the regional meetings nominated individuals to participate in the negotiated rulemaking process. The Secretary selected negotiators from the list of nominees to reflect all the groups that are involved in the Title IV, HEA programs. With regard to these proposed regulations, the Secretary chose negotiators who reflected the diversity of State higher education authorities, the interests of accrediting bodies, national organizations of student financial aid administrators, institutions of higher education, and students. In accordance with section 492(b) of the HEA, the Secretary prepared draft proposed regulations and negotiated provisions of the draft with the negotiators. Two negotiating sessions were held: one in April 1993 and one in June 1993. During the second session, the negotiators elected not to reach consensus on any of the provisions included in this notice of proposed rulemaking until they had an opportunity to review all the proposed regulations implementing the Program Integrity Triad. On September 20, 1993, the Secretary convened a meeting and distributed to the negotiators the proposed regulations for each part of the Program Integrity Triad. The negotiators who attended this meeting could not reach consensus on the provisions included in this proposed regulation. However, several negotiators submitted written comments on the draft regulations, and many of those comments were incorporated in this notice of proposed rulemaking. Provisions Proposed by the Regulations The following discussion reflects the proposed provisions governing the State Postsecondary Review Program. The provisions are discussed in the order in which they appear in the proposed regulations. If a provision applies to more than one section or is included in more than one section, it is discussed the first time it appears with an appropriate cross-reference to its other appearances. In addition, each section of the proposed provisions references or contains a description of the applicable statutory requirements. In developing these provisions, the Secretary has regulated narrowly to the statute, except where the Secretary was required by the statute to promulgate specific regulations or where the Secretary determined that regulations were required to implement the statute. In this regard, the Secretary requests respondents to comment only on provisions where the Secretary has made a regulatory proposal that interprets or implements the statute, rather than on provisions that are statutorily required and cannot be changed by the Secretary.
