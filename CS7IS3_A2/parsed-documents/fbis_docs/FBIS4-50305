China maintains that developed countries should take the indispensable responsibility to help developing islet states realize sustainable economic development. Speaking of the unique situation and difficulties that developing islet states encounter, Jiang Chengzong said: Islet states encounter difficulties common with other developing countries, such as debts, unfavorable trading conditions, a lack of capital, and a low level of technology. In addition, they are restricted to such unique unfavorable conditions as a bad ecological situation, a lack of transportation facilities, the small scales of their economies, and a single product. Islet states are the first to be affected by changes of climate, the rising of the ocean's level, and ocean and seashore pollution. Islet states' economic development is seriously restricted by those developed countries. He said emphatically: Islet states' sustainable development is an inseparable part of global sustainable development. The international community should take feasible measures to help developing islet states overcome difficulties and march toward the road of sustainable development step by step. Jiang Chengzong maintained that over the past two years since the conclusion of the UN environment and development meeting, the international community and other relevant international organizations have done a great deal in implementing the meeting's resolutions. However, much greater efforts are still needed. The unfavorable international economic climate which has seriously restrained very large developing countries from realizing their economic development and environmental protection targets has not yet improved. Commitments concerning capital and the transfer of technology made at the environment and development meeting need to be carried out. He said: To change the situation fundamentally, we need strong political will and a complete set of concrete and effective measures, accompanied by such things as capital and the transfer of technology, so as to ensure the implementation of these measures. The global meeting of islet states which opened in Bridgetown, the capital of Barbados, on 25 April will conclude on 6 May.
