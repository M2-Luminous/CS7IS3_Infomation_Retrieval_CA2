Today was an unusual Sunday for the inhabitants of the Silvio Caro community in Bahia Honda Municipality. At mid-morning, an air raid drill broke the people's routine and daily chores. Without panic, well disciplined, and well organized, each citizen occupied his or her place in the people's tunnels. Students and the children from a childcare center also demonstrated their preparation and knowledge, finding safe shelter in a few minutes. Silvio Caro, with 2,000 inhabitants, is the first military community declared protected against a possible enemy air raid. In an act of revolutionary reaffirmation, the Western Army community staged an emulation action. Division General Nestor Lopez Cuba [rank as heard], head of the Political Board of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, congratulated the inhabitants of Silvio Caro and asked them to keep up their efforts toward readiness preparation.
