He agrees to speak with L'INDIPENDENTE only on the understanding that he will remain anonymous. "It is becoming difficult to launch an attack on Gorazde because our positions are now very close to the Muslims," the minister reveals. "If they decide to bomb us they could miss the target and hit their friends. NATO is ready to attack other targets such as electric power plants, telecommunications centers, government buildings, and obviously military detachments." An Gulf-style escalation of the war is therefore emerging. Meanwhile, in the streets of Pale, the capital of the self-proclaimed republic of Srpska, the loudspeakers from the police cars are asking people to donate blood to build up the stocks in hospitals. "We are getting ready for the worst," the L'INDIPENDENTE source assures. "We do not have antiaircraft bunkers for the civilians, but there are plans to evacuate the people quickly to the hills, far from military objectives, as our grandparents did during World War II." Over the past few days, fathers of a certain age and government personnel are being drafted, even for very short periods of duty and in the zones behind the front, but in a kind of general mobilization. "Bosnia is not the Iraqi desert and it will not be easy to hit us," maintains the Bosnian Serb government representative. "The NATO pilots rely on computers, but when they have to find the objective in these impervious areas, they are obliged to fly at minimal height and at low speed. At that moment they are vulnerable to our antiaircraft weapons." According to the minister, NATO has scarce and often outdated information: "In one raid on Gorazde they hit a civilian house. A command had in fact been installed there, but 15 days earlier." Another possible NATO target is a series of bridges on the river Drina dividing Serbia from Bosnia. "They can forget about cutting off our supplies and logistics by destroying the bridges," maintains the government source. "We have several alternatives ready. It would be a psychological move instead, designed to isolate us from the rest of the world, but in any case Serbia will not remain neutral in this war." The Russians instead are viewed with suspicion after Yeltsin's warning to the Serbs to withdraw from Gorazde. The people are starting to think that their "Slav" friends are turning their shoulders on them and more than one person, even in government circles, has made it known "that there are 400 Russians in the Serbian quarter of Sarajevo. If Moscow were to give the Americans and the Europeans the go-ahead to bomb us, they would not be able to escape that quickly without our giving them a lesson first." On the Serbian side the deadly game with NATO is being carried out by two people: president Radovan Karadzic [of the republic of Srpska] is playing the political game using a carrot, while General Ratko Mladic [commander of the Bosnian Serb army] is playing the military game using a stick. "Mladic leads the Serbian forces at Gorazde in person," the L'INDIPENDENTE source notes. His charisma among the soldiers is increasing by the hour and this improves the morale of the troops." Everybody is wondering whether NATO will also bomb Pale and the L'INDIPENDENTE source answers: "There are no military targets here, but there would be a symbolic value in the bombing of Pale. I am certain that it would be the last card that the allies could play."
