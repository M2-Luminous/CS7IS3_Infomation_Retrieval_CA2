He was speaking during a lecture at the Davies Institute of Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin, who also spoke at the gathering, cited an article from the London-based paper AL-HAYAH, which is considered a reliable source on Syria. The newspaper's editor wrote that peace talks between Israel and Syria are not frozen. He recalled that former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger shuttled between Jerusalem and Damascus 41 times to help arrange the separation of forces agreement after the Yom Kippur War. Israel and Syria have shared outlooks, Beilin said: a desire for a peace agreement; recognition of the need for withdrawal and U.S. involvement in the process.
