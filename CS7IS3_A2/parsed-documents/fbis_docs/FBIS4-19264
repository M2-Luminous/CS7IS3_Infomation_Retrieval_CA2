"28 November is a good tip. This is the date which looks most likely according to the wishes of a majority in the Storting," Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland said. Yesterday she had invited the parliamentary leaders of the various parties and representatives of the "yes" and "no" movements to make their views known on the date for the EU referendum at a "summit" in the government building. At the meeting, it emerged that the Conservative Party, the Labor Party, and the Progress Party want the referendum to take place after the one in Sweden -- which will be held on Sunday, 13 November. The date of 28 November was proposed. Theoretically it is possibile that a different date could be selected. The government will take a few weeks to decide. But yesterday it was at least confirmed that the referendum will take place after Sweden's. Gro Harlem Brundtland stressed that this will give the many people, who want to know what choice Finland and Sweden make, an opportunity to take this into account. The Conservative Party's Anders Talleraas said that Norwegian voters must have "maximum information" before the reach their decision. The "no" side wanted the referendum either on the same day as Sweden's -- or before. The Christian People's Party's Kjell Magne Bondevik wanted Norway to be the first of the Nordic countries to vote. "We knew that the `yes' side would act ruthlessly to manipulate the referendum," said "No to the EU" leader Kristen Nygaard, who was also present. "Might is right," said the Socialist Left Party's Erik Solheim. Gro Harlem Brundtland, who was dressed in red and did not allow herself to get in the least bit aggravated by the allegations, said that it was most natural to take account of the view which had the backing of a majority. The others in the "yes" camp took the same line, and wondered what the situation would be like if the minority were to decide. "This news will gladden that section of voters who are interested in knowing what choice the other Nordic countries have made," said Inge Lonning, leader of the Europe Movement. The exact question that will be asked in the referendum has not been decided yet. There has been speculation about whether it is the package of results negotiated in the membership talks about which the people will be asked to make up their minds. In 1972 the wording was: "Should Norway become a member of the European Community?" A carbon copy of the formula then would point toward: "Should Norway become a member of the European Union?" The reason why the "no" side in particular is concerned on this point is that there have been fears of a "Danish solution." Norway could then begin to renegotiate if the voters said "no" to the actual negotiated package as a result of the wording of the question asked in the referendum. Kristen Nygaard said that he was fairly satisfied with the indirect assurances he has received to the effect that this will not happen, and said that it was a useful meeting. But it is possible that a reference to the actual negotiated package could be included in the overall wording -- without being the main question. This will now be discussed in government circles. Another question is whether there will be a majority in the Storting for a referendum after Sweden's when the votes of those deputies in the Labor Party's Storting group who support "Social Democrats Against the EU" (SME) are subtracted. Assuming that all SME supporters will vote against the 28 November date, there will be pressure on the Progress Party's deputies. Not many votes are needed to tip the scales. Carl I. Hagen told AFTENPOSTEN that he is sure that the Progress Party's deputies will back a date later than that of the Swedish referendum. This is something that he has already raised in the Storting group, and there were no objections, he claimed.
