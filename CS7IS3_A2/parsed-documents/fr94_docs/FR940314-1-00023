FR940314-1-00023 FR940314-1-00007 The Commission proposes to assign licensees implementing code-division multiple access (CDMA) systems to 11.35 MHz of shared bandwidth at 1610&hyph;1621.35 MHz. It further proposes to assign a frequency division multiple access (FDMA)/time division access (TDMA) system to 5.15 MHz of dedicated bandwidth at 1621.35&hyph;1626.5 MHz. When a system is launched and read to begin operating, it will be permitted to operate over the entire assigned bandwidth for that technology. Any in-orbit CDMA system will be required to operate compatibly with any newly launched CDMA system. If only one CDMA system is implemented, the plan proposes to adjust the assignments for the system to 8.25 MHz at 1610&hyph;1618.25 MHz, leaving the freed spectrum available for possible reassignment to the FDMA licensee or for new entry. The Commission believes that 8.25 MHz should be ample to support a first-generation system and should provide some flexibility in coordinating the system internationally. The plan includes the 1.6 GHz band only. While CDMA systems will use the 2.4 GHz band for downlink transmissions, an FDMA/TDMA system will use the 1.6 GHz band for both uplink and downlink transmissions. This may free some spectrum in the 2.4 GHz band and provide some flexibility in assigning specific downlink spectrum segments to CDMA licensees. For example, the Commission may decide to avoid licensing in those portions of the 2.4 GHz band that are especially susceptible to inter-service interference. Thus, while the Commission proposes to license CDMA operators to share the same amount of 2.4 GHz downlink spectrum as 1.6 GHz uplink spectrum, it does not propose specific frequencies for downlink operations at this time. The commission requests comment on all aspects of its sharing proposal. Other Alternatives if Mutual Exclusivity is Not Resolved If the Commission's spectrum sharing plan, or some variation of it, does not permit the applications of all qualified applicants to be granted, the Commission must devise a procedure for choosing among those applicants. Possibilities include a comparable hearing, an auction, or a lottery. These alternatives are briefly discussed and, to expedite licensing if mutual exclusivity is not resolved, the Commission proposes structures for both an auction and a lottery. The Commission's experience with comparative hearings has shown they usually are prolonged. Here, they would not only delay the provision of needed service to the United States public, but the delay could disadvantage the United States in coordinating a licensed system internationally. For these reasons, it may not be advisable to hold a comparative hearing. The 1993 Budget Act gives the Commission the authority to employ competitive bidding procedures to select licensees from among two or more mutually exclusive applicants provided that certain criteria are met. The Commission believes it mutual exclusivity among the applicants cannot be resolved, an auction may be considered. Specifically, MSS licensees will be providing a commercial subscription-based service that will enable subscribers to transmit or receive MSS transmissions in the frequencies on which the MSS space stations will be licensed to operate. A competitive bidding system should permit a new service to be more rapidly introduced than would a comparative hearing. It should also allow the public to recover the value of the public spectrum resource being made available for commercial use. Further, it should encourage efficient use of the electromagnetic spectrum by encouraging applicants to bid on only the minimum amount of spectrum needed. The Commission recognizes that the statute also directs it to promote economic opportunity by disseminating licenses to a wide variety of licensees, including small and minority businesses. It requests comment on the manner in which this statutory obligation can be taken into account. The Commission also recognizes that an auction may have unintended consequences internationally by encouraging other countries to impose licensing costs on MSS systems. The Commission will carefully consider these concerns. The Commission envisions that if an auction is employed, it will be conducted pursuant to the general framework adopted in its Competitive Bidding Implementation Proceeding (PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253). The Commission also proposes service-specific criteria. To maximize multiple entry and to encourage applicants to bid only for the minimum amount of spectrum they require, the Commission proposes to auction the 16.5 MHz of bandwidth in each transmission direction in eight paired 2.0625 MHz uplink and downlink segments. Based on the applicants' proposals, it appears that some MSS systems could be implemented with as little as 2 to 4 MHz of spectrum in each transmission direction. To afford licensees some flexibility, however, the Commission proposes to allow applicants to big successfully on up to four segments, for a total of 8.25 MHz of bandwidth in each transmission direction. Given the CDMA applicants' proposals to share spectrum, the Commission also questions whether it should permit successful bidders to agree to pool their spectrum and implement co-frequency systems. Section 309(i) of the Budget Act also authorizes the use of a lottery to select from among one or more mutually exclusive applicants if the applications are accepted for filing before July 26, 1993. The Commission tentatively concludes that if mutual exclusivity cannot be resolved, the statutory requirements for a system of random selection are met. The Commission proposes to implement a lottery in a manner similar to its proposed auction framework. Specifically, eight 2.0625 MHz paired segments would be offered, and each selectee would be limited to four segments. The Commission questions whether it may be advisable to permit applicants to agree among themselves that they will implement co-frequency systems if one of them is chosen as the tentative selectee, allowing the Commission to grant licenses to all qualified applicants in the pool. The Commission requests comment on all aspects of these alternative processing mechanisms.
