"In addtition to arresting Kurosh Nik Akhtar, who was apprehended because of the full awareness and prompt action of our courageous people on the first of February, a large network of his accomplices and cohorts have been identified," Fallahian said. According to the minister over 20 persons who have been part of this network have been arrested so far. The minister added that Nik Akhtar had changed his name from Kamareh'ee [name as received] and that the investigations had revealed that he and his accomplices had organized a meeting on the night prior to the assassination attempt to fully discuss the details of the plan to assassinate Iran's fourth president. After the victory of the Islamic revolution in Iran in the February of 1979, the Islamic Republic was established. Mohammad 'Ali Raja'i, the second president in the history of this nascent republic, was killed along with Prime Minister, Hojjat ol-Eslam Mohammad Javad Bahonar, by a bomb that was planted in their office by a terrrorist MKO member. Terrorist Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization (MKO), a group sponsored by Saddam Hussayn, also targeted Iran's third president, Ayatollah Seyyed 'Ali Khamene'i, now the supreme leader of the Islamic revolution. During his term as the president Ayatollah Khamene'i was injured while addressing a crowd at a mosque. President Rafsanjani, the fourth president of the Islamic republic who won his second term in the office by a landslide, was the target of a failed assassination attempt by forghan group in 1979, a group responsible for the death of many of the ideologues of the Islamic revolution such as the late Ayatollah Morteza Mottahari. President Rafsanjani in an interview with Tehran radio after the assassination attempt said that he did not recognize at first what was going on, mistaking the gun shots for the explosion of a light bulb in the mausoleum of the late Imam Khomeyni.
