In Tianjin, the north China's biggest industrial city, the number of college students who have taken part-time jobs is estimated at more than 50 percent. Many of the students are likely to take part-time jobs on campus, as laboratory and library assistants or as tutors, receptionists, door keepers and porters. Tan Huijun, a senior student of the Management Department of Nankai University, has netted a monthly pay of 100 yuan offering a daily two-hour service at a roller-skating court. Wei Shangfeng, a sophomore of the Thermal Energy Department of the Tianjin University, gets a monthly pay of 50 yuan by doing cleaning in the campus. A student affairs official with Tianjin University said great changes have taken place among today's students. More and more students believe that they should try their best to support themselves through their own labor, he said, adding that they are not willing to rely on their parents entirely. To encourage students to work hard on their subjects while taking part-time jobs, the authorities of Tianjin universities and colleges have formulated relevant regulations governing part-time work.
