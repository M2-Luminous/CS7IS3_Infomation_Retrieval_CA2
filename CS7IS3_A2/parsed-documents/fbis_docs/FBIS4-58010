Herrera said he does not believe that stepping up the embargo or resorting to military intervention to force Aristide's return are solutions for the neighboring country. "I believe the solution will be for the military to leave power and for Aristide to resign, thereby making way for a provisional government and, in turn, general elections," Herrera said in a domestic television interview. According to Herrera, if the Haitian military is crushed by way of a military intervention, then Aristide would have to rule with a government guarded by foreign troops. The Dominican deputy foreign minister, who is considered an expert on Haiti, reiterated his disagreement with the embargo because Haiti "has become a huge concentration camp." Herrera also said that it was "impossible" for the Dominican Republic to prevent contraband fuel from trickling into Haiti "because we have 300 km of border which is very difficult to patrol." Herrera also rejected the idea presented by Western powers that Haitian refugee camps be set up in Dominican Republic. This topic, as well as the issue of border patrols, was discussed with President Joaquin Balaguer by President Bill Clinton's special envoy William Grey on Wednesday night in Santo Domingo. Following the meeting, Balaguer announced that he "would seal" the border. According to information received today, Balaguer met yesterday afternoon with the Armed Forces High Command to instruct them to redouble border vigilance. According to Army sources, more than 10,000 soldiers are deployed in the impoverished border region to prevent contraband and Haitians crossing into the Dominican Republic. Armed Forces Secretary General Constantino Matos told the press that "we are conducting strenuous and honest work" along the border in an effort to comply with UN decisions. Nevertheless, he admitted, "it is possible that some gasoline is still being shipped" into Haiti, but "not with the consent of the Armed Forces." Matos also announced that border troops will soon be relieved by fresh troops, and he gave assurances that if officers or soldiers are found to have permitted contraband to cross the border into Haiti, they will be severely punished. [In a related 210-word, Santo Domingo-dateline report, Paris AFP in Spanish at 1335 GMT on 27 May notes, "The presence of Haitians in the commercial sector of downtown Santo Domingo, where they secure supplies to meet demands for various goods in their country, has been reduced to a minimum." The report adds: "A similar drop in the presence of Haitians was noticed in the border province of Pedernales, 350 km south of Santo Domingo. According to reports from the border region, many Haitians are gathering along a small river on the border, waiting to establish contact with Dominicans wanting to sell them food."]
