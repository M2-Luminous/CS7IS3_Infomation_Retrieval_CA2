Three Sunkyong subsidiaries succeeded in buying a total of 1.27 million KMT shares through competitive bidding yesterday, securing the conglomerate a controlling 23-percent stake in the cellular monopoly. State-funded Korea Telecom said 292 investors had competed for 2.44 million of its KMT shares put up for sale Monday and Tuesday but no other bidders were successful. Korea Telecom said it will invite new tenders for the remaining 1.17 million shares. After the sale, Korea Telecom, left with a 20- percent stake in KMT, will hand over management control to Sunkyong. Sunkyong offered 427.1 billion won, paying an average 321,000 won per share, a Korea Telecom spokesman said. Although long anticipated, the result of yesterday's bidding gives Sunkyong, already the nation's fifth largest conglomerate, a vital niche in the nation's potentially lucrative cellular industry. The nation's cellular-phone industry has been growing 80 to 100 percent a year and reached over 470,000 subscribers at the end of last year. Since it was established in March 1984, KMT has grown into a 498.3 billion-won cellular monopoly employing 2,000 people. The company generated 420 billion won in sales last year. Its net profit that year was 71.9 billion won. Given the business opportunities involved, it has long been said that the successful bidder for KMT will likely emerge as a major business empire. KMT is currently the nation's only cellular operator. A second cellular network is to be formed later this year. The Communications Ministry has timed the sale of KMT shares so as to cool a fevered tug-of-war among major business conglomerates currently bidding for the second network. In December, the government gave the Federation of Korean Industries, the nation's largest business organization, the task of forming a single consortium to build and operate the new cellular network. The federation's decision is due Feb. 28. Yesterday's auction was a sweet victory for Sunkyong. Although it won a cellular license in 1992, Sunkyong had to relinquish its successful bid in the face of embarrassing charges of nepotism. The son of Sunkyong chairman Choe Chong-hyon is married to a daughter of then President No Tae-u.
