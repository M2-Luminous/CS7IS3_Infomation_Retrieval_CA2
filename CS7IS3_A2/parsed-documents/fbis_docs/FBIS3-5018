Lisandro Abadia admitted yesterday the AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines] continues to be plagued by factionalism within its rank and file. Without identifying the supposed factions, the retiring AFP top man was obviously referring to the rebellious Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa [RAM], Soldiers of the Filipino People, and the Young Officers Union (RAM-SFP-YOU). The group which is headed by cashiered Army Col. Gregorio Honasan has been responsible for the series of attempts to overthrow the former Aquino Government. "Factionalism still hounds the AFP. The RAM, for instance, is still making the rounds among AFP personnel. Umiikot pa rin sila [They are still moving]," Abadia said when interviewed during yesterday's commemoration of the February 1986 Revolution. Abadia was referring to the series of consultations of RAM in various military camps aimed at popularizing the ongoing peace process among soldiers and military personnel. He likewise scored the persistence of the "bata-bata [patronage] system" in the military establishment which, he said, contributes to the harboring of discontent among AFP officers. "We should really go back to the merit system in the promotion of our officers. We should do away with the bata-bata systems," he said. Abadia recently revealed he had been asked by several politicians and businessmen to stage a coup before the national elections in 1992. But he said he flatly refused the overtures made by the group saying he wanted to give democracy a chance. [passage omitted] In a related news, Justice Secretary Franklin Drilon said the government should not be faulted for the delay in the release of six RAM members contrary to complaints aired by the RAM. Drilon, in a memorandum for President Ramos said Sergeants Alberto Caoili, Fernando Casanova, and Victoriano Cordova have been confined in respective local jails pursuant to the order of the courts and can only be released upon the order of said courts which acquired jurisdiction over their respective cases. He said that appropriate motions for the temporary release of the three on recognizance were filed but the courts concerned denied the said motions. Clearly, he said, the prosecution cannot be held responsible for their continued detention. Caoili and Cordova are facing charges of illegal possession of firearms and ammunition. The nature of Casanova's case was not established, though it was reported to be a bailable one. On the other hand, Drilon said Sergeants Antonio Soriano, Orlando Ayeras, and Willy Marayag were not among the RAM/SFP/YOU members in the list which was the subject of the president's order for release dated 23 December 1992.
