Cargo planes fly from Romania to Yemen through Turkey's airspace twice every night. The flights and the weight of cargo have led officials to consider the possibility that arms are being supplied from Romania to Yemen. Gigantic Russian-made Ilyushin-76 cargo planes have taken off at night from Otopeni Airport in Bucharest to fly to Sanaa in north Yemen for the past 20 days. The next day they returned empty. The aircraft reportedly obtained permission to transport vegetables through Turkey's airspace. The aircraft maintained the same flight route. They entered Turkey's airspace from the "Rixan" air corridor over the Black Sea and left it over Antalya. The Ilyushin-76 aircraft, the largest cargo planes in the world, fly at 24,000 feet (8,000 meters) when they cross through Turkey's airspace, although that altitude is not economic for such aircraft on long-distance flights. Considering the planes' altitude, military aviation experts have said they may be carrying arms. An expert said: "Cargo planes may fly at a higher altitude even if they are fully loaded with tomatoes. I do not believe the cargo they transport exceeds 150 tonnes. A cargo that heavy can only be made up of arms." Turkey has no right to place the cargo aircraft under its control, because there is no UN ban on arms to Yemen. But the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe gives it the right to search any aircraft in its airspace that it believes to be carrying a cargo of arms.
