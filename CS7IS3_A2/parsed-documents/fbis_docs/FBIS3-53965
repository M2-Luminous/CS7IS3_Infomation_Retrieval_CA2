Ambassador Rabinovich also told reporters in Washington that a national referendum would force Syria to take Israeli public opinion into account because voters would not support any kind of withdrawal unless they were certain of getting real peace in exchange. The message to the Syrians was that they would have to do more if they wanted Israeli society and Israel's political establishment to meet them half way, Itamar Rabinovich explained.
