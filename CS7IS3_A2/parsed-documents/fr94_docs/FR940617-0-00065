FR940617-0-00065 FR940617-0-00013 Office of Foreign Assets Control 31 CFR Part 550 Libyan Sanctions Regulations; Definition of ``Government of Libya'' AGENCY: Office of Foreign Assets Control, Treasury. ACTION: Final rule; amendment. SUMMARY: This rule amends the Libyan Sanctions Regulations to remove from the definition of ``Government of Libya'' a provision stating that an entity will not be deemed a part of that government solely because it is located in, organized under the laws of, or has its principal place of business in, Libya, and to make an additional change to the definition. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 17, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Steven I. Pinter, Chief of Licensing, tel.: 202/622&hyph;2480, or William B. Hoffman, Chief Counsel, tel.: 202/622&hyph;2410, Office of Foreign Assets Control, Department of the Treasury, Washington, D.C. 20220.

By modem dial 202/512&hyph;1387 or call 202/512&hyph;1530 for disks or paper copies. This file is available in Postscript, WordPerfect 5.1 and ASCII. Background This rule amends the Libyan Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 550 (the ``Regulations''), to remove paragraph (b) from ยง 550.304, the definition of the term ``Government of Libya.'' Paragraph (b) of ยง550.304 provided that a partnership, association, corporation, or other organization shall not be deemed to be within the term ``Government of Libya'' solely by reason of being located in, organized under the laws of, or having its principal place of business in, Libya. In addition, former paragraph (a)(2) is revised to remove the word ``substantially,'' which was used to describe the extent of Libyan government control of an entity required to qualify that entity as a part of the Government of Libya, and to add the words ``directly or indirectly'' to describe the nature of the governmental control. Because the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay in effective date, are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, does not apply.
