We asked presidential candidates and hopefuls, if elected, how would they confront the problem? How would they fight drug trafficking in the country? [Begin recording] [Liberal Party presidential hopeful Ernesto Samper] The policy that President Cesar Gaviria has been implementing is the best: demobilizing the drug cartels and subjecting them to the law by offering them a safe prison and a fair trial. Legalizing drugs in Colombia is not viable right now because people might interpret it as granting amnesty to drug trafficking. [Conservative Party presidential candidate Andres Pastrana] I insist it cannot be legalized. Statistics from the countries that have legalized drugs or from the U.S. states that have legalized marijuana always show that consumption has increased. This is why I insist on education and prevention programs. [Liberal Party presidential hopeful Humerto De la Calle] I say we should broaden drug trafficking policies to ensure that developed countries, in particular, become more efficient at controlling consumption, money laundering, precursor chemicals, and weapons.
