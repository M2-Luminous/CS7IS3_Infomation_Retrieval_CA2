The question has not been solved even after the latest round of negotiations in Sarajevo, although both sides presented legal and political arguments in favor of their representative, Bosniak or Croat, respectively. Since the matter will not be resolved even after the 30-day deadline for the elections stipulated by the Constitution, this could cut deeply into future negotiations and significantly influence the (non)implementation of the Washington Agreement, that is, of what was agreed in Sarajevo. Regardless of that, Kresimir Zubak and Haris Silajdzic both said the Sarajevo negotiations had been "extremely constructive and positive." The Question of Outvoting The reason behind Zubak's and Silajdzic's optimism is, first of all, the successful negotiations on the organization of the future federal government. It was agreed that, in the period that follows, the reconstructed government shall act both as the Bosniak and the federal government and that it will be composed of 12 department ministers and another three members, one of whom would be the president of the Federation (although they still have not agreed on which departments would be run by Croats and which by Bosniaks). Furthermore, the heads of both delegations said that they were well satisfied with the progress of the negotiations about economic and humanitarian questions. However, it would be difficult to speak about progress in Croat-Bosniak relations until the most important problems that are crucial for the future federation are solved. As for the "crucial" arguments about the election of the president and the prime minister, reliable sources report that, in spite of diplomatic words like "constructiveness," with regard to some problems, the Bosniak-Muslim side will not relinquish principles that in no way promote the spirit of the Washington Agreement. Quite the contrary, they keep saying that the Bosniaks are "the most populous" nation and that "most victims in this war have been Bosniaks." If such is the case, it will be very difficult to reach a mutually satisfactory solution and form (any kind of) federation. Perhaps this is a bit too pessimistic a statement, but insisting on the fact that one nation is in the majority (while the Washington agreement speaks only about equal, constituent, and sovereign nations) is evidence of a stubborn streak in sticking to views which are usually present with regard to a civic, that is, unitary Bosnia-Herzegovina, which the Muslim-Bosniak leaders have advocated all the time and which has been the bone of contention in relations between the two nations. Therefore, it does not make much sense to repeat something like that after Washington. The question of outvoting, which was thought to be history after adopting the Constitution of the Federation, seems to have reappeared and is reaching its desired goal, which was one of the main causes of the Croat-Muslim conflict. President for Life Moreover, concern over the (too) slow implementation of the agreement is amplified by the fact that the Bosniak-Muslim side is relentless in waging a media war, and Sarajevo Radio and the Mostar "War Studio" are cases in point. The specially established UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] commission had many complaints with regard to that. In the eyes of the Bosniak-Muslim media, Alija Izetbegovic is still the (only possible) president (of the federation as well), and he gets most support from the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. Its corps and brigades simply compete in giving public support to Izetbegovic, who could enjoy a full five years of the presidency with a one-year mandate only. Evidently, there is a preponderance of his followers among the Sarajevo leadership and, as opposed to the "reconcilable" Silajdzic, Izetbegovic wants both leading positions in the future Federation, probably thinking that they can form a federation "with themselves." It is high time that Sarajevo realized that their political partners are legally elected representatives of the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina and that they must reach a democratic agreement on everything. For, if there is a lack of will to do this (and the Bosniaks have not proven themselves prepared for this so far), the entire project of the joint Federation may fall through, which can lead to (another) situation that is difficult to solve, especially as the third side (the Bosnian Serbs) are again militarily active on all the fronts trying to cause complete chaos in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
