In their second summit meeting at the official Guesthouse, Kim and Hosokawa also discussed the need for their countries to jointly cope with the new round of global trade negotiations. The expanded summit was attended by their cabinet ministers concerned with economy and trade. The two leaders' wide-ranging discussions included the North Korean nuclear issue, expanded and balanced bilateral trade and technology cooperation. The two sides also touched on joint projects involving South Korea, Japan and China, co-action in the APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) forum, and multilateral security arrangements in northeast Asia. Seoul and Tokyo agreed to strive for an early resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue, including concerted efforts at the United Nations Security Council, Kim said in a press conference he gave jointly with Hosokawa after the summit. "If North Korea changes its attitude even now, South Korea is ready to take appropriate steps," Kim said. Kim is to wind up his three-day visit to Japan and leave Tokyo for Shanghai Saturday to start a five-day tour of China. Earlier in the day, Kim and Hosokawa had a breakfast meeting and reaffirmed their commitment to cooperate on the North Korean nuclear problem. They also shared the opinion that China's active participation and cooperation are essential for the interests of the entire Northeast Asia, said South Korean presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik. Touching on the trade imbalance in his talks with Hosokawa, President Kim asked Japan to buy more Korean products and send a mission to Seoul to help increase Japanese investment in Korea. Noting the need for increased exchanges between small- and medium-sized companies in the two countries, Kim requested that Korean firms be allowed to participate in construction projects in Japan. Kim also proposed that Korean and Japanese builders bid jointly for construction projects in third countries. In addition, Kim proposed that South Korea, Japan and China undertake joint endeavors including development of oriental medicine, standardization of Chinese characters and formation of a Northeast Asian environmental consultative organization. Hosokawa said he was agreeing in principle to the proposal. Moreover, South Korea asked Japan to jointly cope with the new round of international negotiations on environmental issues.
