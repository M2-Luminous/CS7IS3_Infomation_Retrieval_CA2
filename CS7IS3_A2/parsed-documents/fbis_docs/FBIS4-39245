Shortly before a Chechen opposition congress, which was set for 4 June in Nadterechnyy Rayon, which does not take orders from the president, the republic's state security department stated that this congress was prepared by Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service as yet another stage in the "stage-by-stage occupation of Chechnya." In Groznyy's view, the preceding stages included the introduction of a state of emergency on part of Sunzhenskiy and Malgobekskiy Rayons of Ingushetia, which border on Chechnya, and the failed attempt on the life of Dzhokhar Dudayev. The congress, according to the forecasts of Chechnya's state security department, was supposed to lend legal status to the Temporary Council created by the opposition in winter 1994. This was to be followed by the opposition's appeal to Russia that it recognize this organ and support it with military force under any pretext. The "puppet" Temporary Council would then sign the Federal Treaty of the Russian Federation which would amount to Chechnya's becoming part of the Russian Federation. Shortly before the congress, as Chechnya's Foreign Ministry maintained, Russian troops were brought to the republic's borders, while on the territory of North Ossetia 26 combat helicopters with special subunits ready for aggression were on full combat alert. The opposition congress, however, did not take place on 4 June "due to the absence of a quorum," according to a representative of the Chechen Republic president's staff. [passage omitted]
