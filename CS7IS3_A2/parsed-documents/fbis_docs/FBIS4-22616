The Americans, for instance, understand very well that any prospective economic niche will be filled by their competitors. Even Austria did not remain out of the action. Its government delegation signed an agreement on construction of various communications projects. I cannot cease being amazed by the powers of observation and wit of my friend Linh Van Nhan. A specialist on Russia, he regularly watches information programs on the "Ostankino" channel. And once in a while comments on them. His latest comment: "The ghost of the unforgettable Leonid Ilich has returned to the Kremlin." "What makes you think so?" I ask, perplexed. "From watching Clinton's visit," replies Linh Van Nhan, without blinking an eye. "You know very well how such historic visits used to be covered in the past on the 'Vremya' program." Needless to say, the dean of the Russian language department had me flat on my back. True, in those "stagnation times" that have already become part of mythology, when Linh Van Nhan was a student at Voronezh University, Central Television was under the direction of Suslov, the country's chief ideologist. Naturally, all events involving our general secretary "for life" were presented as historic milestones. Whenever someone visited Moscow, "Vremya" expanded beyond any size. For the Vietnamese press, television, and radio that are not infected with "Ostankino" syndrome, the main news is still closer to Vietnam. For instance, much has been written about the visit to the Vietnamese capital of prominent French political figure Jacques Chirac. The mayor of Paris, who has his sights on the presidency, decided--as did current president Mitterrand--to build a solid bridge with the countries of Indochina, on the reasonable assumption that in the future they will take their proper place in the dynamically developing Asia-Pacific corridor. In conversation with the Vietnamese leadership, Chirac emphasized many times that France attaches priority significance to developing relations with Vietnam. And this is not a mere declaration. In terms of investment in the Vietnamese economy, France is third in the world after Hong Kong and Taiwan, and first in Europe. One of the permanent foreign policy topics in the Vietnamese mass media is the host of American delegations that have descended on Vietnam. Congressmen, senators, and businessmen have begun to frequent it. Still, business rules politics, no matter how the latter may try to subordinate it. Representatives of IBM, General Motors, AT&T, Kodak, and a number of other companies held consultations with Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai as part of the research group of American industrialists and political scientists. At a meeting with journalists, Ho The Lan, a representative of the SRV Ministry of Foreign Affairs press department, read out a long list of foreign delegations planning to visit Vietnam. There were no delegations from Russia and the CIS countries on that list. I have to admit that I am tired of repeating the reasoning regarding the potential benefits of cooperation with Vietnam. Therefore, today I will not do so. Let those Russian officials who visited Vietnam last year do it. They promised cooperation to the Vietnam side. And they were not the only ones. Prime Minister Chernomyrdin himself talked to Vietnamese Minister of Foreign Affairs Nguyen Manh Cam last fall in Moscow. It is hard to tell, though, how much these promises are worth. But should we become like those Russian diplomats in Hanoi who, in a pique of temper, accused local journalists of not being objective in their coverage of Russian realities? The discouraged Vietnamese colleagues, deprived of the propaganda materials they used to get from the now-abolished Hanoi bureau of RIA-NOVOSTI, are hurt by this allegation flung at them by the diplomats. "Is what we publish about Russia or show on television not true?" one of the journalists asked me. "Unfortunately, it is," I replied.
