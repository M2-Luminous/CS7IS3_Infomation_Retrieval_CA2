FR940617-2-00189 FR940617-2-00103 The State single points of contact and other interested State and local entities are expected to advise the relevant SBDC of their comments regarding the proposed refunding in writing as soon as possible. The SBDC proposal cannot be inconsistent with any area-wide plan providing assistance to small business, if there is one, which has been adopted by an agency recognized by the State government as authorized to do so. Copies of such written comments should also be furnished to Ms. Johnnie L. Albertson, Associate Administrator for SBDC Program, U.S. Small Business Administration, 409 Third Street, SW., Fifth Floor, Washington, DC 20416. Comments will be accepted by the relevant SBDC and SBA for a period of 90 days from the date of publication of this notice. The relevant SBDC will make every effort to accommodate these comments during the 90-day period. If the comments cannot be accommodated by the relevant SBDC, SBA will, prior to refunding the SBDC, either attain accommodation of any comments or furnish an explanation of why accommodation cannot be attained to the commentor prior to refunding the SBDC. Description of the SBDC Program The SBDC operates under the general management and oversight of SBA, but with recognition that a partnership exists between the Agency and the SBDC for the delivery of assistance to the small business community. SBDC services shall be provided pursuant to a negotiated Cooperative Agreement with full participation of both parties. SBDCs operate on the basis of a state plan to provide assistance within a state or designated geographical area. The initial plan must have the written approval of the Governor. As a condition to any financial award made to an applicant, non-Federal funds must be provided from sources other than the Federal Government. SBDCs operate under the provisions of P.L. 96&hyph;302, as amended by P.L. 98&hyph;395, a Notice of Award (Cooperative Agreement) issued by SBA, and the provisions of this Program Announcement. Purpose and Scope The SBDC Program is designed to provide quality assistance to small businesses in order to promote growth, expansion, innovation, increased productivity and management improvement. To accomplish these objectives, SBDCs link resources of the Federal, State, and local governments with the resources of the educational system and the private sector to meet the specialized and complex needs of the small business community. SBDCs also coordinate with other SBA programs of business development and utilize the expertise of these affiliated resources to expand services and avoid duplication of effort. Program Objectives The overall objective of the SBDC Program is to leverage Federal dollars and resources with those of the state, academic community and private sector to: (a) strengthen the small business community; (b) contribute to the economic growth of the communities served; (c) make assistance available to more small businesses than is now possible with present Federal resources; (d) create a broader based delivery system to the small business community. SBDC Program Organization SBDCs are organized to provide maximum services to the local small business community. The lead SBDC receives financial assistance from the SBA to operate a statewide SBDC Program. In states where more than one organization receives SBA financial assistance to operate an SBDC, each lead SBDC is responsible for Program operations throughout a specific regional area to be served by the SBDC. The lead SBDC is responsible for establishing a network of SBDC subcenters to offer service coverage to the small business community. The SBDC network is managed and directed by a full-time Director. SBDCs must ensure that at least 80 percent of Federal funds provided are used to provide services to small businesses. To the extent possible, SBDCs provide services by enlisting volunteer and other low cost resources on a statewide basis.
