Voting on the entirety of the 1994 draft budget law is scheduled for Friday. The committee also accepted government-proposed amendments to the budget law, under which spending and revenue was increased by 3 trillion zlotys to 696 trillion and 613 trillion respectively. On the motion of deputies of the ruling coalition, the committee did not vote on motions providing for increasing revenue except for one motion filed by the Health Committee envisaging increased excise tax on cigarettes and alcohol. The planned price rises would bring in revenue of 6 trillion zlotys but the motion was rejected by the committee. The committee did not accept either any motion for decreasing spending and made only minor shifts in funds between ministries. The Labour Ministry was granted additional 1.5 trillion zlotys, while over 0.5 trillion was earmarked for Walbrzych, Lodz and Katowice provinces. In the near future, the committee is to vote also on "guidelines for privatisation in 1994" and on "guidelines for monetary policy in 1994". At a joint meeting on Wednesday, the Sejm Legislative Committee, the Committee for Education and for Agriculture accepted deputy-proposed amendments to the law on the system of education including amendments sponsored by the government.
