Nos. 171&hyph;125, 172&hyph;134, 173&hyph;237, 174&hyph;76, 178&hyph;102, 179&hyph;48] RIN 2137&hyph;AC46 Transportation of Hazardous Materials; Miscellaneous Amendments AGENCY: Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule incorporates into the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) a number of changes based on rulemaking petitions from industry and RSPA initiative. These changes are necessary to recognize recent editions of certain matter incorporated by reference, to eliminate certain inconsistencies and typographical errors, and to reinstate a shipping description. The intended effect of these regulatory changes is to improve clarity and, consequently, reduce confusion. DATES: Effective: July 5, 1994. Compliance date: Compliance with the regulations, as amended herein, is authorized immediately. Incorporation by reference: The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in this final rule is approved by the Director of the Office of the Federal Register as of July 5, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Diane LaValle, (202) 366&hyph;4488, Office of Hazardous Materials Standards, Research and Special Programs Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, Washington, DC 20590&hyph;0001. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This final rule makes changes to the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR; 49 CFR parts 171&hyph;180) based on either requests from industry or agency initiative. These changes clarify and correct certain inconsistencies appearing in the HMR, add a specific shipping description currently authorized by approval, and update certain standards incorporated by reference under ยง171.7. These changes impose no new requirements on persons subject to the HMR and do not adversely affect safety. The following is a discussion of the changes made under this final rule. Section 171.7 RSPA received several requests to update various standards currently incorporated by reference in the table contained in ยง171.7(a)(3). These standards are as follows: The Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education requested RSPA to incorporate into the HMR the latest American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) pamphlet, ANSI N14.1&hyph;1990, entitled ``Uranium Hexafluoride_Packaging for Transport.'' Incorporating the 1990 edition of the standard into the HMR will enhance uranium hexafluoride transportation safety by recognizing the use of packagings fabricated to certain updated industrial specifications and standards. The 1990 standard also contains specific information on the reuse of valves and various editorial clarifications. Section 173.420 of the HMR permits uranium hexafluoride to be transported in packagings designed, fabricated, inspected, tested and marked in accordance with certain DOT and industry standards that include packagings fabricated to the ANSI N14.1 (1987, 1982, or 1971 edition) in effect at the time the packaging was manufactured. This section also provides that, before initial filling and during periodic inspection and test, the packagings must be cleaned in accordance with the ANSI N14.1 requirements. The American Pyrotechnic Association (APA) petitioned (P&hyph;1174) to update APA Standard 87&hyph;1, entitled ``Standard for Construction and Approval for Transportation of Fireworks and Novelties,'' from the September 1987 edition to the April 1993 edition. APA Standard 87&hyph;1 contains procedures for construction and approval for transportation of new fireworks and novelty items. In the revised standard, the shipping descriptions, hazard classes, and section references are consistent with the current HMR. The revised standard also has been expanded to offer guidance on conducting the fireworks stability test, and to address packaging requirements, EX-number markings, and transitional provisions. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) petitioned (P&hyph;1193) to update ``AAR Manual of Standards and Recommended Practices, Section C_Part III, Specification for Tank Cars, Specification M&hyph;1002,'' from the 1988 edition to the September 1, 1992 edition. The revised AAR publication contains updated discussions of matters such as repair of cracks, weld overlay, inspection of rubber-lined tank cars, and the renewal of approvals for valves and fittings. The Compressed Gas Association (CGA) petitioned (P&hyph;1196) to update CGA Pamphlet C&hyph;7, entitled ``A Guide for the Preparation of Precautionary Markings for Compressed Gas Containers, appendix A,'' from the April 15, 1983 edition to the 1992 (sixth) edition. In the 1992 edition, revisions have been made to the shipping descriptions for consistency with the current HMR. The Institute of Makers of Explosives (IME) petitioned (P&hyph;1171) to update IME Safety Library Publication 22 (IME Standard 22) entitled ``Recommendation for the Safe Transportation of Detonators in a Vehicle with Certain Other Explosive Materials,'' from the January 1, 1985 edition to the May 1993 edition. This standard contains information relative to the use and construction of IME&hyph;22 containers or compartments for the transport of certain detonators. Section 173.63 authorizes the use of these containers and compartments for packaging detonators and ยง177.835(g) authorizes the transportation of these packages on the same transport vehicle with other explosives. The IME standard is used extensively by safety personnel in the commercial explosives industry for training purposes and by users of explosives. In the revised standard, the shipping descriptions, hazard classes, and section references have been revised for consistency with recent changes to the HMR. RSPA has reviewed these updated standards. RSPA found no provisions that would impose additional requirements and agrees that they should be incorporated by reference.
