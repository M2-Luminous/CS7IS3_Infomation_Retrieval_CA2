He pointed out that the Palestinians will not be the only party to lose from this disorder. He said that failing to implement the agreement will have a serious impact on the overall regional situation. In an interview with the Algerian newspaper AL-SHA'B published today, 'Arafat announced that the world must know that this agreement is not merely a Palestinian-Israeli agreement, because it was signed by the U.S. secretary of state and the Russian foreign minister representing the sponsor countries and supervised by President Clinton. 'Arafat voiced regret that the peace sponsors have failed to act. He reiterated his praise of the Egyptian role in promoting the peace process, declaring that it helped to resume the negotiations after they reached a deadlock in Oslo, Paris, and Cairo. 'Arafat hinted that Israel obtained full reward from the United States in return for signing the agreement, illustrated by fresh supplies of modern weapons, the largest computer in the world, "the giant computer," $240 million to cover its redeployment costs, and $10 billion in loan guarantees. Noting that it also obtained recognition by various countries, most recently the Vatican, he said it is now seeking to avoid what it has signed after getting the reward. 'Arafat remarked that the negotiations reached a deadlock because of Israel's ploys and its erroneous interpretations of the agreement's clauses. He explained that the Israelis maintain that withdrawal means redeployment and want to control the border crossings on the pretext of protecting their external security, which would mean that the Palestinians would live in "Bantustans," something that is unacceptable. 'Arafat continued: The Israelis cannot set traps for us. We know how to deal with these issues. We tell them that if they believe they can shirk implementing the agreement, then the region will go up in flames. He pointed out that the attempt to resume settlement activity in Jerusalem with the Israeli Government's total support violates the agreement. 'Arafat remarked: They want to change Jerusalem's landmarks to make it Jewish. I say it belongs to Muslims and Christians everywhere. This is the first Qiblah [direction in which Muslims turn to pray] and the third holy mosque. Commenting on the forthcoming summit between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton, 'Arafat said it seeks to reach an agreement on the Golan Heights and Lebanon and that it will carry no surprises. Asked about inter-PLO relations, 'Arafat explained that the Palestinian democratic model is known. Every party, he said, has the right to express its view. He added: We are dealing with each other well. No one should try to outbid the Palestinian sacrifices in blood. He declared: We have endorsed pluralism and democracy. We defend them and fight for their sake. In this context, every party can express its views. Asked if the Israeli stance might be backed by some Arab parties, 'Arafat said it could be, because the Israelis are trying to benefit from inter-Arab differences. The Palestinian president revealed that the Palestinian leadership expected Israel to try to back away from the Washington agreement, noting that the first sign of a retraction occurred during the Israeli election, which brought down Shamir and his political program. 'Arafat declared that when he concluded an agreement with the Israelis he meant a "peace of the brave," adding that if they don't understand what "the peace of the brave" means, then there are many ways of making them understand.
