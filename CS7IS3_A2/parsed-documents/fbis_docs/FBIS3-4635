FBIS3-4635 "dreas039_j_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-039 Document Type:Daily Report 28 Feb 1994 Indonesia * Government To Examine Revenue Levels 94SE0066A Jakarta ANGKATAN BERSENJATA in Indonesian 26 Jan 94 p 3 94SE0066A Jakarta ANGKATAN BERSENJATA Language: Indonesian Article Type:CSO [Text] Jakarta, ANGKATAN BERSENJATA--Minister of Finance Mar'ie Muhammad has stated that, if state receipts for the 1993/1994 fiscal year are not as large as were estimated in the 1993/1994 budget, reductions in expenditures will be made, so that the budget will remain in balance. He had just finished speaking at a symposium on increasing the role of BEPEKA [state financial supervisory board] during the Second Development Era, held in Jakarta on 25 January on the 47th anniversary of the establishment of BEPEKA. Later on, the minister of finance told reporters that state receipts must equal expenditures for the budget to be in balance. It is now estimated that the petroleum price will not reach its goal. Therefore, to resolve this problem, the government will make reductions in the budget. He stated: "At present reductions have been made in several government departments, for example, by reducing official travel. The BPEN [National Exports Development Board] is reducing the number of trade missions sent abroad." According to present estimates, the average petroleum price during the 1993/1994 fiscal year will be $16.64 per barrel, whereas in the 1993/1994 budget it was estimated at $18 per barrel. As is known, the budget for fiscal year 1993/1994 is 62.322 trillion rupiahs. Some time ago the minister of finance stated that every decline in the petroleum price of $1.00 per barrel results in a loss of $600 million in state receipts. As a result, if the average price of petroleum is $16.64 per barrel during fiscal year 1993/1994, whereas the budget estimate was $18 per barrel, the decline in the petroleum price of $1.36 means that state receipts will decline by $16 billion. When he was asked about the possibility of using funds from the Development Reserve Budget, Minister of Finance Mar'ie did not answer. He said: "I will speak about all of that in Parliament." Meanwhile, in his speech at the symposium Mar'ie said that if, as a result of investigations, it is learned that there are indications that criminal acts have been committed, the matter should be reported directly and without prior permission to the police and the public prosecutor for further steps to be taken. He said: "It is not necessary to ask for permission. That is the law. If no action is taken by the individual's superiors, he should report the matter to the director general. If action is still not taken, he should report the matter to the minister concerned or even to the president. In this matter we must be absolutely correct," he said. Reports to intermediate level supervisory officials are made only for their information. The legal basis for this problem is quite broad, both in the Constitution as well as in the basic explanatory section of Paragraph 23 of the Constitution of 1945. The matter of reporting indications of criminal actions is referred to in the explanatory section of Paragraph 3. Mar'ie said that, to obtain the desired results, more harmonious cooperation is needed between BEPEKA and supervisory authorities. He remarked: "I am not saying that BEPEKA must start its investigations from zero. However, we must stand on the principle of effectiveness, except for very large-scale projects. BEPEKA must investigate matters from the beginning. I do not wish to reduce the authority of BEPEKA. I am only saying what I think." He said that we must also keep in mind that we have limited powers and facilities. He said that, in addition, there must be good cooperation between government agencies. He stated: "Even what is investigated must be open and aboveboard, and there must be `full disclosure.' If the PAN [state administration investigative body] has completed its investigation but Parliament does not clearly understand the matter, Parliament can ask for a clarification from BEPEKA, because the agency that conducts the investigation is better informed about it." Meanwhile, in connection with increasing efficiency, Minister of Finance Mar'ie gave the example of the establishment of a new office in a given department. He said: "BEPEKA must investigate whether the new office is really necessary and whether its functions do not `overlap' those of another office." At the same time, in a discussion in the corridors, J.B. Sumarlin, chairman of BEPEKA, said that the function of BEPEKA, among other things, is to collect more complete evidence. This places BEPEKA in the position of investigator of state financial responsibility. He said: "If BEPEKA functions properly, it can optimize the use of public funds." Furthermore, BEPEKA also investigates the use of state financial resources to determine whether they are properly and effectively employed in carrying out approved programs. Regarding the view that only smaller projects should be investigated, Sumarlin said that this is not true. He stated: "It is not true that large-scale projects are not investigated. Investigations of these projects have not been completed, and the government is sufficiently open." He said that state financial investigations use the device of an audit. At present state financial investigations in countries overseas cover 30 percent of budget volume, whereas in Indonesia only 10 percent is covered by BEPEKA, while the remaining 90 percent is handled by other institutions, such as the BPKP [Finance and Development Supervision Board] and other agencies. On this occasion Kwik Kian Gie, an economic observer, said that BEPEKA should conduct state financial investigations of 60 percent of the budget volume. The role of BEPEKA as an investigative body should be considered from its technical ability to handle cultural questions, such as overcoming "embarrassment" in pursuing its inquiries. It must have the courage to say what is true and to discuss corruption as a whole, even if what it reviews under the law causes the financial foundations of the state to shake because of the amount of money involved. Meanwhile Aberson Marle Sihaloho, a member of the Committee on the Budget in Parliament from the FPDI [Indonesian Democracy Party Faction], said that to strengthen the role of BEPEKA, it must be an "independent" agency. It must be separated from the functions of investigation and supervision. Investigation of state financial management is handled by BEPEKA. The authority of BEPEKA only covers formal truth. Meanwhile, Parliament, which examines the substance of truth, has no function in this matter. He said: "This is because what BEPEKA investigates is only a sector or subsector and is not an entire program and activities under it." Hamzah Haz, a member of the Committee on the Budget from the PPP [United Development Party] Faction, stated that in approving the state budget the position of Parliament is stronger than that of the government. Parliament is the supreme budget authority. Therefore, in this matter Parliament truly exercises the authority of the MPR [People's Consultative Council]. This function of Parliament is different from that of BEPEKA, however, in carrying out its duty separately from the government. However, BEPEKA does not stand above the government. Recalling the fact that BEPEKA is a budget supervisory agency established by Parliament to work with the government, while the position of Parliament is stronger than that of the government, BEPEKA should be closer to Parliament than to the government.
