ACTION: Final policy. SUMMARY: EPA has issued a national policy statement entitled ``Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) Control Policy.'' This policy establishes a consistent national approach for controlling discharges from CSOs to the Nation's waters through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jeffrey Lape, Office of Wastewater Enforcement and Compliance, MC&hyph;4201, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460, (202) 260&hyph;7361. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The main purposes of the CSO Control Policy are to elaborate on the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) National CSO Control Strategy published on September 8, 1989, at 54 FR 37370, and to expedite compliance with the requirements of the Clean Water Act (CWA). While implementation of the 1989 Strategy has resulted in progress toward controlling CSOs, significant public health and water quality risks remain. This Policy provides guidance to permittees with CSOs, NPDES authorities and State water quality standards authorities on coordinating the planning, selection, and implementation of CSO controls that meet the requirements of the CWA and allow for public involvement during the decision-making process.
