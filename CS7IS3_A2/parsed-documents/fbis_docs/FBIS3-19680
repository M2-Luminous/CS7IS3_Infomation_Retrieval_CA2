Speaking after Friday's [18 March] cabinet meeting, he said that it was better for the war refugees themselves to be received in Macedonia for example, rather than in the Netherlands. "After all that is ideal," he said. "The same language, the same customs." Lubbers said that the cabinet wanted to make more money available to expand reception capacity in the region. The prime minister referred to the reception of East Africans in the Middle East as a second example of the reception of refugees in their own region. "It is good that the world is accepting Somali, but why does that have to happen on humid Netherlands soil?" he said. "After all, would that not be better in Saudi Arabia or Yemen? For example they have the same religion there." On Friday the cabinet agreed with the Justice Ministry plan to stop and send back asylum-seekers entering the Netherlands overland as quickly as possible after they cross the border. These refugees will usually be told that they must apply for asylum in the so-called first country of reception. This refers to the first of the 22 member states of the Council of Europe which the asylum-seeker entered. The decision copies one of the underlying measures of the Schengen Treaty. Because the Netherlands is "closed off" by the Schengen countries Belgium and Germany, asylum-seekers who come overland are to no longer be granted asylum in the Netherlands. But because this would put an unfair burden on Germany in particular, agreements will have to be made in a European context about a fair distribution, Lubbers said. Lubbers gave a cautious answer to the question of whether he thought it was sensible for Housing State Secretary Heerma to talk in parliament this week about the possibility of perhaps 70,000- 80,000 asylum-seekers coming to the Netherlands this year. "Mentioning these figures could have a dramatic effect," the prime minister said. "But neither could the cabinet walk away from the facts," he said. "And these facts are that partly because of tighter asylum policies in Germany, more asylum-seekers are coming to the Netherlands."
