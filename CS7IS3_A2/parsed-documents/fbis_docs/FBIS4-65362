Judging from the Geneva meeting on Friday, 13 May, the answer can only be negative. While the United States agreed to the approach advocated by the Europeans with respect to the Bosnian crisis, it was once more with plenty of reservations and unresolved contradictions. One may say that, since World War II, Europe has never appealed so forcefully to the United States. And never has it had to deplore such a noncommittal and inconsistent policy by the United States. Behind the contrived consensus arrived at in Geneva there remain two different approaches to the Bosnian crisis, which boil down to a clash between America's moralism and Europe's realism. For the United States, there is no question of imposing on Bosnia's Muslims a settlement that they would not agree to, as in this war they are the victims. For Europe, what matters most is stopping the war, even though there cannot be a settlement that does justice to the victims. According to [French Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe, the U.S. Administration is now beginning to understand the limits of its "moral" arguments and the danger of leaving the belligerents free to fight it out to the last instead of intervening directly. However, because of domesitc considerations, U.S. officials will not say this aloud; while off the record they reject the notion of lifting the arms embargo which has been requested by the Senate, they do not say so publicly6 and they simultaneously issue contradictory statements on the partition of Bosnia between the various communities. However, without a clear U.S. stand, Alain Juppe's already fragile "realistic" line collapses: Judging from what has been going on in the field, one can clearly see that the belligerents will opt for peace only if they feel the international community is ready to force it on them. While in the last few weeks the Serbs could appreciate the limits of Western threats regarding air strikes, Bosnia's Muslims will have noted how unconvincingly the United States called upon them to lay down their arms. The Europeans did no better than the United States on the outset of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. And both the Europeans and the United States are still paying for those initial errors inasmuch as they cannot control the crisis. In this respect, things are unlikely to change as a result of this latest episode in Geneva.
