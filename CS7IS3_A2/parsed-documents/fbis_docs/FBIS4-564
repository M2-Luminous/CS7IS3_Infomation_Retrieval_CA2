Toure Carlos Yerekpin reports: [Yerekpin] The bills adopted after being studied by the deputies should enable the government to adequately control personnel spending through a more rigorous management of the civil service, the departure of workers who have reached the age of mandatory retirement, and the acceleration of voluntary retirement. A total of 4.9 billion CFA francs was provided for this. A bill to streamline the recovery of state revenue through the decentralization of the tax department and another to readjust operating expenses to take into account the tasks of the various ministries and the new conditions were also adopted at the session. The new allocations greatly favor ministries involved in human resources development such as health, social affairs, national education, higher education, and scientific research. The general operating budget bill also provides for the gradual divestiture of state ownership through accelerating the privatization program for 54 companies and the strengthening of primary health care. The bills adopted also provide for creating jobs by estabilishing a more flexible and appropriate institution -- the Research and Promotion Agency -- to replace the Ivorian Labor Office; the continuation of the training policy by maintaining and stepping up grants -- an amount of 10.3 billion CFA francs was allocated, representing an increase of 25.6 percent while subsidies amounting to 11.1 billion were allocated to private schools, representing an increase of 26.1 percent; and the continuation of domestic debt repayments through the part payment of liabilities to the tune of 3.591 billion CFA francs. The special capital budget for the 1994 fiscal year, which was presented to our deputies, was balanced at 220.728 billion CFA francs, an increase of 56.24 percent over last year's. To stimulate activities in rural areas and promote local agricultural production, four special budget items were created: an agricultural diversification and exports promotion fund with 1.25 billion CFA francs; an animal production promotion fund with 450 million CFA francs; an agricultural guarantee fund with 1 billion CFA francs; and a mechanized farming support fund with 1.3 billion CFA francs. [passage omitted] In light of the extensive program launched to provide television and radio coverage nationwide, the allocation for this department amounted to 25.543 billion, seven times the usual amount. The problem of license fees for the special parastatal, Cote d'Ivoire Radio and Television, was permanently resolved by our deputies. The rural electrification sector and the roads program were also given special attention at the National Assembly. The creditors of the former National Agricultural Development Bank could soon have the smiles back on their faces with the adoption of the repayment plan. Studies are under way on the high cost of the new national identity card, as well as on penalties for late payment of bills from the Ivorian Electricity Company, Cote d'Ivoire Telecommunications, and the Cote d'Ivoire Water Supply Company. The deputies would like to see the penalties removed. [passage omitted]
