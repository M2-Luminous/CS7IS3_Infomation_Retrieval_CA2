He was the last commander of the Soviet expeditionary corps which fought in Afghanistan and was the last to leave it, in the wake of his 40th Army, crossing the border Amu-Darya at the now-celebrated bridge in Termez. This was five years ago. Since that time General Gromov has been a convinced opponent of Russia's involvement in such wars, in which neither victory nor glory are to be found. But the general has not forgotten against whom his Afghan vets were fighting. The Mujahidin remain his enemies today also. Boris Gromov is now deputy minister of defense of Russia. For his subordinates the Afghan Mujahidin have become the enemy once again. They are being fought by a Russian expeditionary corps which is now in Tajikistan. They and combatants of the Tajik opposition. Now, the corps is called not a "limited Soviet military contingent," it is true, but a part of the coalition peacekeeping force of the CIS. But this does not alter the essence of the matter, albeit languid, a war is under way in Tajikistan, nonetheless, and Russian soldiers are fighting on one side for the Tajik Government in Dushanbe and against the Afghan enemy and Tajik combatants. Turadzhonzoda Was Surprised It is any wonder that the meeting between General Gromov and an acknowledged leader of the Tajik opposition, Khodzhi Akbar Turadzhonzoda, deputy chairman of the Islamic Resistance Movement of Tajikistan, which took place in Moscow at the end of last week, was held in a less-than-diplomatic atmosphere, to put it mildly. No, it was not Gromov who had sought this meeting, the former spiritual leader of Tajik Muslims had requested that a head-to-head meeting with the general be arranged. Turadzhonzoda had come to Moscow at the end of the first round of inter-Tajik peace negotiations. He and his movement colleague, Mukhammad-sharif Khemmatzoda, chairman of the Islamic Revival Party, who are the official leaders of the Tajik opposition delegation, refused to sit at the negotiating table until Dushanbe was officially represented thereat by some top person of the Tajik Government. For the opposition leaders, the visit to Moscow meant an opportunity familiarize the Russian leadership with its position in personal contact with it for the first time. It is hard to say whether this meeting was useful for the deputy defense minister.... But for his interlocutors--undoubtedly. To their astonishment, they learned that they were being taken for some others. The point being that General Gromov began the conversation with accusations that the opposition was demanding the withdrawal of Russian troops from Tajikistan and an end to all relations with Russia, and this was unacceptable. "You are mistaken, you have, evidently, been misinformed," Turadzhonzoda responded. "We recognize Russia's geopolitical interests in Tajikistan and are not demanding the withdrawal of the Russian, more precisely, coalition, peacekeeping force, provided that the command staff, which does not occupy a neutral position and which supports the present Tajik Government, is replaced. As far as relations with Russia are concerned," Turadzhonzoda observed, "we do not envisage the future of Tajikistan without the closest and most friendly ties to it. This viewpoint should be well known to the Russian leadership, the Tajik opposition has conveyed it to Moscow in its messages, and the Russian press has expounded it also," the former chief qadi of Tajikistan added in surprise. "We would like to know where you came by this misinformation," he asked Boris Gromov. "From the opposition," the general replied. "We represent the opposition, it is important, therefore, that we know from whom this comes...." "Do not interrupt me," the deputy defense minister stopped his guest.... This tone of the exchange did little, evidently, to contribute to its productiveness. General Gromov asked that it be conveyed "back there" that the Russian army would, in spite of everything, defend the Russian-speaking population. Turadzhonzoda replied that this was not how the issue should be framed, that no one was intending to attack the Russian speakers, and that their safety could be secured only by peace in the republic. And if some people do have a bad attitude toward the Russians, it is because, possibly, they are treating Tajik refugees badly in Russia.... Do not treat them badly here, do not attack them, and no one will touch Russians either.... "You should not try to frighten us," Gromov said, "otherwise you will be duly repulsed...." This was how the discussion went. It would be hard to call it a peacemaking discussion. One Out of Every Five Tajiks in Exile? The meeting between the leaders of the Tajik opposition and Russian diplomats was at somewhat of a different level. Khodzhi Akbar Turadzhonzoda termed the conversation with Albert Chernyshev, deputy minister of foreign affairs, "friendly" even. The deputy minister inquired, the deputy chairman of the movement responded. "Can the opposition be reconciled with the government in Dushanbe? Should it not join in the process of preparation for the elections to the new Tajik parliament scheduled for this year?" "How is this possible when political parties are banned, political opponents are jailed or wanted by the police, there is no free press, and the principal 'authority' in the republic is the man with the gun? What kind of elections are they if one out of every fifth Tajik is in exile?" Turadzhonzoda answered the question with a question. "The present government should be replaced by a new leadership made up of professionals who were not involved in the Tajiks' civil war, the opposition is not laying claim to political power today, and we want the leadership of the People's Front, which came to this power in illegitimate fashion, to do the same...." "But then there would be a power vacuum," the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, "especially since the government in Dushanbe was elected legally at a session of the Tajik parliament in December 1992 in Khudzhent." "Can a government elected by deputies under the threat of death be legitimate, we should not deceive ourselves.... Could it otherwise have been possible for the government to have been made up of 13 representatives from Kulyab Oblast alone, more precisely, from just one of its rayons--Baldzhuvanskiy. We cannot recognize such a government," Turadzhonzoda said. "If Russia wishes to defend its interests in Tajikistan," the former qadi continued, "it could do so at a far smaller cost in terms of human and material resources: It has only to put pressure on Dushanbe for it to agree to our proposals. And as soon as a new government is formed, we guarantee the disarmament of our armed formations, if the same is done with 80 percent of the government formations." The functions of maintaining order, the opposition believes, could be assumed by the CIS peacekeeping force, if states bordering Tajikistan are not members of it. And only then, 18 months to two years hence, when the refugees have returned to their homeland, Turadzhonzoda maintained, could elections be held and a new Constitution of Tajikistan adopted. The Hot Breath of the `Irreconcilables' "And what would your plans be were you to win the elections," the deputy minister of foreign affairs of Russia asked. "We understand your concern," his interlocutor replied, "you are afraid of the scarecrow of Islamic fundamentalism being shoved onto you.... We propose that Russia and other countries of the CIS be the guarantors of the preparation of a constitution which excludes the possibility of the formation of a theocratic state. We aspire to a secular, democratic regime, in which religion would be separate from the state," the former leader of Tajik Muslims emphasized, "and the constitution should contain a provision prohibiting its revision for 30-50 years." The Tajik opposition is convinced that the government in Dushanbe will never relinquish its power as long as Russia supports it by its military presence, and for this reason the success of the inter-Tajik negotiations depends, in its opinion, on Moscow alone. Otherwise, the leaders of the opposition say, we will be compelled to prove that we are right by force, and Russia will be drawn increasingly into a "dirty" war, the outcome of which is determined in advance: Russia would be forced to withdraw from Tajikistan in disgrace, repeating its Afghan path. Turadzhonzoda acknowledges that "we are unpracticed at diplomatic negotiations," and this is why he came to Moscow, endeavoring to achieve understanding and support. It is possible that the difficulties of the opposition leaders who came here amount additionally to the fact that they feel the "hot breath" of the radical and irreconcilable armed opposition or of the Islamic circles that are backing it. The position of Khodzhi Akbar Turadzhonzoda and his closest associates who resolved to agree to negotiations is still quite influential today, it would seem. But what will be the case tomorrow? Dushanbe is content with the results of the Moscow round. They are speaking there about a "psychological turning point" in relations with the opposition. If this is even the "desire," it is hardly "reality." The Kulyab clan, which controls the main power structures in the government and which has the most hostile attitude toward the opposition (this is mutual, for that matter), has no intention of ceding its positions. According to certain information, the attempts made this February to remove from the government Yakub Salimov, minister of foreign affairs (the most odious figure among the leadership and a leader of the disbanded People's Front, who has, in addition, a criminal past), was unsuccessful. Salimov declared that he would resign only together with the top leaders of the republic. His departure would undoubtedly enhance the image of the official Tajik leadership, but there are fears there, not without reason, of the republic splitting in this case into not two but three hostile camps. The Chief Banker of Tajikistan Rebukes Russia It is naive to imagine that Moscow does not see this, and we should not be deluded as to its readiness to put pressure on Dushanbe under these conditions. The Tajik regime has no intention of capitulating to the demands of the opposition. Especially since it has managed to pull itself into the orbit of Russia's economic and military-strategic attraction. The situation appears amusing at times. Kayum Kavmiddinov, chairman of the National Bank of Tajikistan, recently rebuked the Ministry of Finance of Russia for delay in the payment of R60 billion promised the republic last year on account of a loan of R120 billion, thanks to which Tajikistan was permitted to join the ruble zone. What demands can be made of Dushanbe here, it will be a case of apologizing, more likely.... And of printing hundreds of billions of rubles with Tajik symbols as quickly as possible until the R70 billion of real rubles which have already been allocated are finally "washed" out of Tajikistan. There is, meanwhile, about a month to go before the next round of inter-Tajik negotiations. It will take place, most likely, in Tehran, where the official Tajik delegation will head in the same composition as before. And this means that the opposition leaders will once again fail to show at the negotiating table. But whereas in Moscow their absence did not prevent agreement being reached on the future 27-point agenda, in the Iranian capital the delegations' authority for adopting decisions on these points will be manifestly insufficient. After all, it will be impossible to decide questions of a political settlement including an end to mutual hostilities on the Tajik-Afghan border and within the republic, the attitude toward the various military formations of both the government and the opposition, and measures of mutual trust in the absence of the political leaders from both sides. A situation where these leaders are unofficially present alongside and determine the tactics of their delegations, as was the case in Moscow, say, where Rashid Alimov, minister of foreign affairs of Tajikistan, was present at the time of the negotiations, is possible. But it is hardly likely that the decisions adopted in that case could be deemed legitimate for both parties. A `Second Afghanistan' Still Looms ...Making forecasts, even for a month ahead, is a thankless task. Nonetheless, some things may be anticipated. As a result of the change of commander of the CIS peacekeeping force in Tajikistan (General Valeriy Patrikeyev, who was prior to this commander of the Transcaucasus Military District, has been appointed in place of General Boris Pyankov, who attempted to don the garb of peacemaker and simultaneously called one side "gangsters," whom he contrasted with the "constructive government forces") a softening of the threatening rhetoric in respect to the opposition may be expected for a certain length of time. Especially since the inflaming of military hysteria by Patrikeyev's predecessor in connection with a powerful opposition offensive expected in the spring has not been justified. There will be a revitalization of the propaganda campaign in Dushanbe designed to show on the one hand the peaceful aspirations of the government and, on the other, the perfidy of an opposition wishing only to return to power. The preparations for elections, which are to substantiate the legitimacy of the current regime, will be rapid. And with the introduction, in May, presumably, of the transitional Tajik-ruble currency in the republic the government could establish itself as the guarantor of economic stability. All this put together could force the Tajik opposition to take a chance on other than peaceful means of struggle. Unless, of course, it proves to be prepared for a negotiating process which is long and exhausting and not without forced compromises. Moscow also will be thinking that the threat of a "second Afghanistan" is far from ephemeral.
