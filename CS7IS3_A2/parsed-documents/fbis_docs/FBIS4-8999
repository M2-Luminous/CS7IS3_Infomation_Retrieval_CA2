FBIS4-8999 "dreeu076__a94017" FBIS-EEU-94-076-A Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria Press Comments on BSP Ministerial Ambitions Press Comments on BSP Ministerial Ambitions AU1804103794 Sofia BTA in English 0825 GMT 18 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1804103794 Sofia BTA English BFN [From BTA's 18 April "Press Review"] [Excerpt] Sofia, April 18 (BTA) -- "BSP Wants More Than Half of Ministries for Itself" (OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK), "BSP Expects Prime Minister To Make Personnel and Structural Changes" (DUMA), "Communists Give Week to Prime Minister Berov" (DEMOKRATSIYA), "BSP Gives Prime Minister Berov 7 Days To Overhaul Cabinet" (24 CHASA), "Socialists Demand From Prime Minister Berov Scapegoats for Corridor" (TRUD) -- these are samples of the headlines capping reports on yesterday's extraordinary sitting of the former Communists' Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) Executive Bureau. The Socialists gave Prime Minister Berov a week's time to make his proposals for structural and personnel changes in the cabinet, BSP's DUMA daily says. This is the deadline given the principled differences displayed and unpopular action taken by the cabinet during the prime minister's sick leave, this daily goes on to say quoting BSP spokesman Nikolay Kamov. Yesterday's conference was "another reminder that what the Socialists look for is more pragmatism and a stronger political instinct", DUMA says in a signed commentary. The demand for replacing 70 percent of the ministers comes to show that the Socialists are well aware of the incumbent cabinet's inefficiency, the private OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK says commenting on this matter. "Even the unprejudiced can now see that the Socialists played a political action about the convoy issue (the request for transit of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]-bound UN equipment via Bulgaria,)" reads a signed commentary in this daily. "The Socialists are now about to play their trump-card and push Prime Minister Berov to the wall where he should either accept the condition for cabinet changes or step down," the commentary goes. A protest rally yesterday in Sofia burned Uncle Sam's top-hat taken as a symbol of the U.S. foreign policy, DUMA reports. Several hundred people chanted "Peace in the Balkans!" and "Yankees out!" in protest against the cabinet and parliament's decisions to grant a Bulgarian corridor for UN military equipment and against the Balkan policy of the United States, NATO and the United Nations. "BSP once again showed that the national concern is nothing but a mask covering its commitment to Moscow and to Moscow's servants in Belgrade," DEMOKRATSIYA says commenting on the BSP leaders' decision to demand that the cabinet make detailed account for its decision to endorse the transit of UN equipment and that President Zhelyu Zhelev offer an explanation for his failure to inform the Consultative Council on National Security about the UN request. After the attempt at ruling this country without a cabinet, the only way out for Bulgaria is the salvage policy of the Union of the Democratic Forces (SDS), this commentary says further. A story on this matter in STANDART NEWS quotes Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov as saying "a greater number of blue helmets in Macedonia gives more guarantees for Bulgaria's security". The dissent on the transit seriously damaged confidence within the cabinet and the parties of the parliamentary majority, TRUD says. BSP's demands were coordinated with other parliamentary factions, this daily says quoting the BSP spokesman. [passage omitted]
