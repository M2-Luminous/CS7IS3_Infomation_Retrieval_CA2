Almost a Criminal `Sorting Out' in the Kremlin"] [Text] In the 18 March issue of NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA, "Now It Is Clear Why Ilyumzhinov Relinquished the Post of President," we published a "report" of Minister of Internal Affairs V. Yerin which discusses the "shady" origin of funds of President of Kalmykia Kirsan Ilyumzhinov. It was noted in the editorial commentary that the shady origin of Ilyumzhinov's funds and his open disposition to engage in ventures in the reformation of Kalmykia absolutely did not interest either President Yeltsin, his circle, or the MVD-FCS [Ministry of Internal Affairs-Federal Counterintelligence Service] as long as Ilyumzhinov was considered one of them and a politically loyal leader of the republic. Today, we are continuing publication of the documents. On the one hand, those that throw light on the commercial activity of the president of Kalmykia, and on the other hand, those that demonstrate the mechanism for bringing Kremlin pressure to bear on the "formerly best, now fallen out of favor" marksman. So, Document No. 1 This is a note by P. Filippov, manager of the Analytical Center of the Administration of the President of the Russian Federation. We are publishing the note in abridged form, and an exact copy of B.N. Yeltsin's endorsement on the first page of the document. To President of the Russian Federation B.N. Yeltsin Analytical Note The socioeconomic and political situation in the Republic of Kalmykia--Khalmg Tangch. Kalmykia is one of the most backward republics of the Russian Federation... The standard of living of the population is one of the lowest in Russia (the average wage in the republic in July of this year was 57 percent of the average Russian wage, and the housing fund is the worst in the Russian Federation). The political situation is stable. Until very recently, the president of the republic enjoyed popular support. Numerous populist steps (the invitation to Dalai Lama XIV to take up permanent residence in the republic and to Ye. Gaydar regarding the post of premier) enable the president to maintain a high rating. Unfavorable trends: 1. Concentration of power in the hands of the president. After disbanding the former Supreme Soviet, K. Ilyumzhinov formed a controllable parliament of 25 persons that could be dissolved in accordance with the constitution of the republic. After abolishing the soviets at all levels, the president introduced the institution of his own representatives in the localities. For all practical purposes, there is no opposition. 2. There is single control of the president over the economy of the republic. A big businessman with funds of an unclear origin, K. Ilyumzhinov even earlier controlled the economy of Kalmykia through the San corporation, the Steppe bank, regional departments of the Revival fund (of which he was president), and others. The plan of reorganization of Kalmykia into a single corporation is being put into effect by the president: A republic investment-industrial company has been created with a charter fund of $1 billion for the conduct of oil and gas extraction and securities operations. 3. Lack of detailed work on ambitious projects. Despite the announced reduction in the organs of state authority, expenditures on their maintenance increased in the refined budget for 1993 up to 4.6 percent against 1.9 percent in the initial variant.(...) Given the lack of progress in the socioeconomic sphere, K. Ilyumzhinov chose the path of seeking rapid results in the sphere of foreign policy: activation of contacts with the diaspora, mediation in the Ossetia-Ingush conflict (...), an active position in the Federation Council and in the events of 3-4 October of this year. The most probable outcome of K. Ilyumzhinov's unsuccessful debut on the Moscow scene is the final switch to the opposition camp. What is to be done, in the opinion of analysts? 1. Considering the full dependence of the republic on federal subsidies (in 1993, the share of subsidies in the income part was 86 percent, against 72 percent in the initial estimate), it is recommended: --not to assume any kind of long-term obligations for granting subsidies and credits from the federal budget, benefits, and export licenses; build all financial-economic relations with the republic on a short-term basis; --not to fix the extent of financial resources allocated from the federal budget in each succeeding interval; --create a mechanism (possibly a negotiating one) that makes it possible to effectively correct assistance to the republic, depending on existing circumstances; 2. Distance ourselves from the personality of the president, temporarily reducing official contacts to a minimum; conduct all contacts with K. Ilyumzhinov exclusively as with the president of Kalmykia. 3. Introduce clarity in the origin of the personal funds and capital controlled by K. Ilyumzhinov (...) [Signed] P. Filippov, director of the center Thus, remaining distant from Ilyumzhinov, publishing compromising material, and making the financing of Kalmykia dependent on Ilyumzhinov's behavior--this is only a small arsenal of means of political pressure on a "component of the Federation." Further, B.N. Yeltsin affixes his endorsement: "To V.S. Chernomyrdin. Very seriously. I request that you draw conclusions. Yeltsin. 18 November 1993." V.S. Chernomyrdin circulates the note to the Cabinet of Ministers. Especially emphasizing instructions to V. Yerin. V. Yerin, understanding everything, sends a letter to the Ministry of Economics with an enumeration of K. Ilyumzhinov's machinations, which have been known for a long time, but which are being kept quiet for the time being. The machine has been cranked up. Chebotarev, deputy chief of the Main Administration for Organizational Crimes, dispatches a paper to First Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank Kulikov. We quote in an abridgement (numerous firms have been omitted through which Ilyumzhinov put state money "to work"). On Designating Inspections In September and November 1992 the Government of the Russian Federation, by petition of the Ministry of Economics and the Rostekstil concern, allocated a special favorable credit in the sum of R14 billion to the Steppe commercial bank of the Republic of Kalmykia... The date of payment of the credit was set for 26 April 1993. The Steppe association, instead of using the money specially for the purchase of wool, sold R9.4 billion to various commercial structures in the cities of Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Nizhnyy Tagil at an interest rate of 80 percent and higher. The sale of credits was conducted by the Steppe association under the pretext of contracts concluded with commercial structures on joint activity. In April 1993 the Steppe KB [commercial bank], after presenting documents that the credit resources received were being used as designated, albeit slowly, in connection with objective difficulties, submitted a petition to the Central Bank of the Russian Federation for an extension of the date for return of the credit until December 1993. The petition was supported by the National Bank of Kalmykia and the joint-stock company Rostekstil. As a result, the date for returning the credit was extended to 1 December 1993, even though wool for monetary resources in the sum of R9.4 billion allocated to the Steppe association has not even now arrived at enterprises of the Rostekstil concern. (...) On 18 December 1992 the Steppe association, with payment authorization No. 8, transferred R914 million to the joint-stock company TIM according to a contract for joint activity in wool purchasing. The TIM joint-stock company used the received monetary resources to purchase citrus fruit in Spain and sell it in CIS countries. On the instructions of the association, part of the monetary resources of $250,716 in currency was transferred by the TIM joint-stock company in May 1993 to Warsaw to the People's Bank of Poland, account No. 62828, and the rest of the monetary resources, after the sale of the citrus fruit, was returned with interest to the Steppe association. (...) (...) On 25 December 1992 the Steppe association, on the basis of the contract on joint activity, transferred R1 billion for the purchase of wool to the joint-stock company Aquarius Systems Interface. After converting the given sum to $2,328,605, the joint-stock company Aquarius Systems Interface, according to a contract for the purchase of canned products, transferred the aforementioned sum to Warsaw to the People's Bank of Poland, account No. 628288. According to the contract, the Steppe association was supposed to receive the products. However, there are no documents in the Aquarius Systems Interface joint-stock company that confirm the receipt of products by the Steppe association. Moreover, there are data at the present time indicating that about R2 billion were converted to $2.9 million and transferred to foreign banks through other commercial structures. Thus, the acquired credit was not used for what it was designated: Examinations conducted earlier were not objective, which made it possible for the aforementioned structures to extend the credit contract to 1 December 1993. In connection with the aforementioned, I request an examination of the issue of cessation of the prolongation of credit, the imposition of penalty fines for nonfulfillment of obligations to the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, and a decision on the possibility of designating and conducting a bank inspection for verification of the grounds for the receipt of credit, its extension, and the further movement of these resources. [Signed] First Deputy Chief G.F. Chebotarev We do not know how the "sorting out" ended. K. Ilyumzhinov, who is passionately striving for the independence of Kalmykia, calling it "the second Kuwait," unexpectedly for everyone, suddenly, abrogated the republic's constitution, stripped himself of the title of president, took the modest title of governor, and returned the entire "gulped" sovereignty. And no criminal case is being brought with respect to Ilyumzhinov. It is interesting: If Ilyumzhinov had not gone with a white flag to Rutskoy, would he remain president, or not? And what would his questionable financial operations be called? Perhaps, "an ability to manage economically and live in a new way?" And some analytical note most likely would say that "despite the dubious origin of funds (...) Ilyumzhinov's high degree of loyalty to the existing authorities should be taken into account..."
