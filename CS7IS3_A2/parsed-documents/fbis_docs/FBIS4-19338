The bomb, containing between 50 and 70 kilos of explosive material, was deemed too complicated for defusing manually by police explosives experts who examined it yesterday evening. The terrain on which it had been left was too rough to allow a robot to disconnect the many wires on the device. A strong jet of water was therefore pointed at the bomb, in a move which should have deactivated it, but instead it blew up, leaving a crater six metres by four metres across and almost two metres deep. In their initial examination of the bomb, which was spotted under a pile of branches by the side of a road north of Rome by a local petrol station manager, police experts came to the conclusion that the device was to have been detonated by a radio command, possibly from as far away as a kilometre. By blowing up the device "with surgical precision" as the operation to deactivate it began, the bombers may have "wished to destroy all the evidence," said investigators. The three cardboard boxes, full of synthetic explosives, were linked by a mass of wires and connected to two batteries and a voltmetre, which measures the volts of a battery. The detonator was believed to be inside one of the boxes which explosives experts decided to leave unopened. A remote control aerial was sticking out of one of the boxes which were still relatively dry when found by police, despite the wet terrain on which they had been placed. The attempted attack was the work of "true bombing professionals," investigators said. The bomb was intended for an ordinary, rather than an armoured, vehicle, but even a large car would have been blown many metres into the air, with little hope for those inside, said well-informed sources. The target of the attack is believed to have been Mafia supergrass Salvatore Contorno, who lives nearby the bomb site.
