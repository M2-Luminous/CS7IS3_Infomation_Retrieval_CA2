FR940606-2-00101 FR940606-2-00067 Order Adjusting International Cargo Rate Flexibility Level Policy Statement PS&hyph;109, implemented by Regulation ER&hyph;1322 of the Civil Aeronautics Board and adopted by the Department, established geographic zones of cargo pricing flexibility within which certain cargo rate tariffs filed by carriers would be subject to suspension only in extraordinary circumstances. The Standard Foreign Rate Level (SFRL) for a particular market is the rate in effect on April 1, 1982, adjusted for the cost experience of the carriers in the applicable ratemaking entity. The first adjustment was effective April 1, 1983. By Order 94&hyph;3&hyph;54, the Department established the currently effective SFRL adjustments. In establishing the SFRL for the two-month period beginning June 1, 1994, we have projected non-fuel costs based on the year ended December 31, 1993 data, and have determined fuel prices on the basis of the latest available experienced monthly fuel cost levels as reported to the Department. By Order 94&hyph;5&hyph;41 cargo rates may be adjusted by the following adjustment factors over the April 1, 1982 level: ␣ 1␣ 1␣ Atlantic 1.0936 Western Hemisphere 1.1079 Pacific 1.5627 For further information contact: Keith A. Shangraw (202) 366&hyph;2439. By the Department of Transportation: May 27, 1994. Robert S. Goldner, Special Counsel to the Acting Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs.
