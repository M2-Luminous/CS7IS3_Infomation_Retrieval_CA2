Compared with past budget deliberations in the Diet, the 1994 budget was deliberated in the Diet for a very short time. The 1994 budget, that directly affects the livelihood of the people, was enacted today in the Diet. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to both the ruling and opposition parties for cooperating with each other in enacting the budget. I believe it is important to implement the budget steadily and early to stimulate the economy. Taking advantage of this opportunity, I would like to state my views. The situation at home and abroad is very grim. I believe that in order to overcome the difficult situation, it is very important to establish an administration based on a solid foundation. The ruling coalition parties have begun policy discussions with the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and other parties. I intend to leave issues, including the question of my resignation as prime minister, to the policy discussions. In any case, political parties that share the same political beliefs and policies should cooperate with each other in overcoming various obstacles while setting the final conclusion of the political reform as their biggest goal. I believe this is the way to overcome the present difficult situation and meet the people's wishes. I have stated my views. [Dean of the Press Corps] As dean of the Press Corps, I would like to ask you some questions. The current Diet session has only a few days left, and political parties have begun moving at long last. The opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] formally submitted a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet at the Diet this evening. Mr. Prime Minister, how are you going to deal with the no- confidence motion? [Hata] I have served as prime minister for about two months. Since I took office, I have said things must be done the same day. I, my cabinet members, and other officials have worked together to sincerely tackle tasks facing us every day from early morning to late night. I believe what I have tackled, proposed, and actually implemented deserve the people's approval. I also believe that my cabinet members and I have done our best to meet the people's goals or wishes. [Dean of the Press Corps] Now, the ruling coalition parties are engaged in policy discussions with the SDPJ. SDPJ Chairman Murayama, however, has said the SDPJ Central Committee has decided to demand a general resignation of the Hata cabinet, and the general resignation of the Hata cabinet is a precondition for the SDPJ to return to the ruling coalition. Mr. Prime Minister, you have just said you would leave the question of your resignation as prime minister to the policy discussions. How do you plan to deal with the SDPJ's demand for the general resignation of your cabinet? [Hata] As for how to deal with the SDPJ's demand for the general resignation of my cabinet, both the ruling coalition parties and the SDPJ are discussing the question. I believe that I will have an opportunity to discuss the question with Chairman Murayama. I intend to hold frank and sincere talks. I would like you to understand my feelings when I say that I will entrust all the issues, including my future course for political career, to the talks. In any case, I intend to seek to make Chairman Murayama understand my position by telling him that I will leave the question of my resignation as prime minister, and other issues, to the policy discussions. [Dean of the Press Corps] Sakigake stated today [23 June] that it agreed to the policies presented by the SDPJ, and called for the establishment of an administration headed by SDPJ Chairman Murayama. What do you think of this? [Hata] Well, I think each has its own view. Therefore, I would like to refrain from commenting on the question. I think Sakigake members have various views. However, when my cabinet was formed, Sakigake stated they would support the cabinet from outside the coalition, and that its position is not that of an opposition party. I will not say anything more about this. [Reporter] You said you would leave everything, including your future course as prime minister, to the policy talks. I dare to ask you: If the situation concerning voting for a no-confidence motion against the cabinet becomes delicate, do you have any intention of a voluntary cabinet resignation en masse as one option? [Hata] The question is not whether I have such an intention or not. As I said, I would leave my future to the decision of the policy talks, I believe that a direction will be indicated through future talks. [Reporter] The SDPJ reportedly has a view that, if the cabinet resigns en masse voluntarily, it will support you, Prime Minister Hata, as the next prime minister. I think, in this case, the resignation en masse itself is a ruse in a bid to take power. What do you think of the SDPJ's idea? [Hata] I have not yet had direct talks with the SDPJ. Through talks with SDPJ leaders, including Chairman Murayama and Secretary General Kubo, I intend to inform them of my feelings. However, tasks that we have to tackle from now on include: political reform, economic restructuring, tax reform, administrative reform, the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, the DPRK issue -- progress has now been made on this issue -- Japan's stance on the Naples summit, and policies toward the agricultural agreement under the Uruguay Round talks. All of these are very difficult issues. I believe it is necessary to form a stable administration to deal with them. I would like to explain my frank views on this point [to SDPJ leaders]. [Reporter] There was an argument within the ruling coalition that it would cope with the political situation by carrying out a drastic cabinet reshuffle. At present, do you rule out this possibility? [Hata] If I answer the question now, this will please you. However, I intend to convey my views to them at policy talks from now on, while hearing their opinions. As I intend to leave the question of my resignation to the policy coordination talks, I would like to deal with the talks with a clean slate. [Reporter] I dare to ask you this question. If the future policy talks decide to name Mr. Hata as the next prime minister after the cabinet resigns en masse, would you accept the offer to become the prime minister? [Hata] I am sorry but I cannot answer the question now. At any rate, this is an issue that will decide the future course of Japan. There will be opportunities for party representatives with various views to talk with each other. Since the discussion on the framework of a new administration are now in progress, I believe a direction will be indicated through this discussion. [Reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, the LDP says that underlying its presentation of a no-confidence motion against your cabinet is the fact that the Cabinet is a minority, and therefore is not able to meet the people's expectations. What is your view of the LDP's reasoning? [Hata] On this issue, I want to say that the reason the SDPJ separated from the coalition is not policy matters. As I have stated at Diet sessions, although I regret to say it, the SDPJ separated from the coalition in such a short period due to misunderstanding each other and a matter of wording. Therefore, I realize that the reason for the SDPJ's separation from us is not its sharp conflict over my policies as prime minister. To this day, I have managed the government while sincerely maintaining each of the policies agreed with the SDPJ. Therefore, I believe the SDPJ will be understanding in that respect. [Reporter] You said you would like to leave everything, including the issue of your resignation, to the decision at the talks. I think what you have said is very important. I want to ask you again what the primary reason is that you have decided so. Also, did you make the decision today? [Hata] Concerning this issue, well, as I said earlier, the issues that we are facing now, or those we will face in the future, are all very difficult problems. They include political reform, economic reform, which I mentioned earlier, and administration and financial reforms. Administration reform includes decentralization of power. There are also external problems in connection with the Uruguay Round of talks and agricultural agreements. These are really difficult problems. However, no matter how difficult they are, Japan should not avoid them. To make progress in these issues, it is necessary to establish a stable administration. The most important thing is for the government to work to make progress in these issues while seeking again an agreement with others in the process of talks on basic ideals and policies. I decided to leave everything, including the issue of my resignation, today, just before this news conference. [Reporter] You said you need to establish a strong government to tide over difficulties. But I think it is normal for you to decide to dissolve the House of Representatives for a general election. Why did you not decide so? [Hata] I did not because I have doubts about the need to dissolve the house now. There is another reason. I attended the meeting of the House of Councillors' Special Committee on Political Reform yesterday and the meeting of the House of Representatives' Special Committee on Political Reform the day before yesterday. As you know, political reform bills cleared the Diet under the former Hosokawa cabinet. But to enforce them, electoral constituencies have to be redrawn. The electoral redistricting panel on new constituency boundaries has submitted to the Diet a list of basic standards for redrawing. While observing Diet deliberations and arguments over the standards, the panel will soon start work to draw new boundaries. I think it is inappropriate to ignore this development and hold a general election under the current medium constituency system. If the election is held under the current system, the political reform laws, which we have finally enacted, will mean nothing. The government will not be able to seek cooperation in resolving the issues I mentioned earlier if it avoids carrying out tasks that entail pains. In this context, it is necessary for the government to work out a bill to draw new constituencies based on the panel's recommendation, submit it to the Diet for deliberations, and enact it. I think the election should be held after these tasks have been completed. Otherwise, we will repeat the same thing over and over again. [Reporter] If a no-confidence motion is submitted to the plenary session and is adopted, will you still choose resignation en masse, not the dissolution of the house? [Hata] I would like to refrain from answering your question. Anyway, what I have always said is that the Japanese prime minister is not given the veto power as the U.S. President, who uses the power when he wants to kill bills. Therefore, the final resort for the prime minister to confront the Diet is the right to dissolve the House of Representatives. I do not deny the right to dissolve the house. I am just worried that if the election is held not in accordance with the political reform laws despite the fact that we have held much discussion on them, we will repeat the same thing again. Although I do not deny the right, I would like to avoid using it, if possible. Allow me to use the word 'if' in answering your question. [Reporter] Mr. Prime Minister. You have said that you have not so far made mistakes in running the government and have dealt with issues in all sincerity in the belief that what must be done has to be done the same day. But you said that you have made a decision to leave everything, including your resignation -- taking it like a man -- to negotiations between the ruling parties and the SDPJ. What is your honest feeling now? [Hata] Well, looking back, I have suffered considerable criticism. But in the past two months, my cabinet has made great efforts every day to tackle new issues and to seek new policies. From early in the morning -- from 7:30 AM or 8:00 AM for example -- and almost every day I have attended various councils or meetings. Even with regard to the issue of public utilities charges or the issue of the prices of goods, as well as improving the people's living conditions and creating our nation's diplomatic policies that can win the international community's understanding, I am personally confident that I have taken considerable leadership, and that those who sincerely supported my action appraise what I have done. The issues the government has to deal with are very important. There is the fact -- although it was regrettable -- that when my cabinet was inaugurated, it failed to take action in concert with the SDPJ, and now my cabinet -- it may be inappropriate for me to say my government is fragile -- is in a very difficult situation. To settle this issue, I think I should give up my position and leave the matter to negotiations, and then the door to a new course for the government will open. [Reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, you have said that you hope to form a more stabilized foundation for the government. In connection with bringing new political forces together, there has reportedly been a strong view -- particularly within Shinseito -- calling for creating a conservatives-conservatives alliance, in addition to another view calling for the SDPJ's return to the ruling coalition. Although you seemed to have been calling for the SDPJ's return to the coalition, what is your view on such a call for forming an alliance with other conservatives? [Hata] Underlying the call is the hope to form a new group with those who seceded from the LDP. For example, right before I was chosen as prime minister there was a call for forming a group with those led by Mr. Watanabe of the LDP. I think it is alright for us to get along with other conservatives in such a framework. However, I do not mean that I have a hostile feeling against the LDP itself but I honestly felt that if we formed an alliance with the LDP itself, Japan's politics would return to that established in 1955. Although you said there was a call within Shinseito, I think the members of Shinseito had the same feeling. If some members should leave the LDP to work for carrying out new politics, we are ready to frankly talk with them. In this sense, I think forming an alliance with the LDP will lead to bringing Japan's current politics -- which is drastically changing -- back to that created in 1955. Although I do not fully know what you mean by conservatives- conservatives alliance, this is what I feel about the idea of forming an alliance with other conservatives. [Unidentified moderator] It is time to conclude the press conference. [Hata] Thank you very much.
