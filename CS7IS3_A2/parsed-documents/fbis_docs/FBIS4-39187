Their joint action stems from the fact that in recent days the sociopolitical situation in Dushanbe has deteriorated slightly. Several military servicemen have fallen victim to bullets fired by criminal elements. This is why joint security groups are observing the sociopolitical situation in the city at the orders of the republican leadership and also observing the agreement of the military leaders of the Russian Federation in Tajikistan. According to the press office of the Internal Affairs Ministry, criminal incidents have decreased compared to several days ago as a result of joint efforts by the joint security bodies.
