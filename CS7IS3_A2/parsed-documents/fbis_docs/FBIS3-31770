It is obvious that the word "not" is omitted after the word "Macedonia," without which the sentence makes no logical sense. Crvenkovski had explicitly stated in The Hague that Macedonia is ready to continue the negotiations with Greece, regardless of the Greek trading blockade imposed on Macedonia, the Foreign Ministry underlined.
