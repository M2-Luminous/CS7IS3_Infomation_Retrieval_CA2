FR941128-1-00020 FR941128-1-00003 First, OSHA proposes to add the parenthetical ``(outside rescuers)'' between ``employees'' and ``perform'' in the introductory text of paragraph (k)(2), and to add the words ``ensure that'' to the end of the introductory text to paragraph (k)(2). That introductory text would then read: When an employer (host employer) arranges to have persons other than the host employer's employees (outside rescuers) perform permit space rescue, the host employer shall ensure that: The parenthetical ``(outside rescuers)'' is proposed to be added to clarify and simplify what is meant by the phrase ``persons other than the host employer's employees''. The words ``ensure that'' at the end of the introductory text are proposed to be added to clarify and strengthen the requirements in paragraph (k)(2). Second, OSHA proposes to add new paragraphs (k)(2)(i) and (k)(2)(ii). Proposed new paragraph (k)(2)(i) specifically requires host employers to ensure that arranged-for rescue services can effectively respond in a timely manner to a rescue summons. The proposed paragraph clearly indicates that a host employer must take into account a rescue service's capability in terms of response time and may only select a rescue service which satisfies the pertinent criteria. Proposed new paragraph (k)(2)(ii) specifically requires host employers to ensure that arranged-for rescue services are equipped, trained and capable of functioning appropriately to perform permit space rescues at the host employer's facility. The proposed provision clearly indicates that host employers must evaluate a prospective rescue service's capabilities and verify that the needed capabilities are present before selecting that rescue service to perform permit space rescues. The host employer would be clearly prohibited from selecting any rescue service which does not meet the criteria of proposed (k)(2)(i) and (k)(2)(ii). Third, OSHA proposes to redesignate existing paragraphs (k)(2)(i) and (k)(2)(ii) as paragraphs (k)(2)(iii) and (k)(2)(iv), respectively. The language of these two provisions has been modified slightly to fit the revised introductory text of paragraph (k)(2), but no changes to the existing requirements have been made. OSHA emphasizes that the intent of proposed paragraphs (k)(2)(i) and (k)(2)(ii) is to clarify the existing requirements in paragraphs (d)(9) and (k)(2) of ยง1910.146, as these requirements have been interpreted by the Agency. As discussed earlier, OSHA believes that, even under the current rule, an employer must take timeliness and accountability into account if that employer is to have a truly effective rescue capability. The Agency acknowledges, as discussed in the preamble to the permit space standard (58 FR 4527), that the rescue provisions of the standard will not ensure that all incapacitated entrants will be successfully rescued from permit spaces. The fact that a host employer has done all that it can, before any arrangements for using an outside rescue service are finalized, to ensure that a rescue service is fully capable of performing a timely rescue at its workplace does not guarantee that an actual rescue attempt by that rescue service will be successful. Thus, OSHA's measurement of a host employer's compliance with proposed paragraphs (k)(2)(i) and (k)(2)(ii) will not be based solely upon a rescue service's actual performance during any single instance, but instead upon the host employer's total effort prior to arranging for an outside rescue service to ensure that the prospective rescue service is indeed capable, in terms of overall timeliness, training and equipment, of performing an effective rescue at the host employer's workplace. OSHA is also proposing to amend paragraph (k)(3)(i) so that the provision dealing with the point of attachment of a retrieval line becomes more performance-oriented. The existing provision requires that the point of attachment be either at the center of the entrant's back near shoulder level or above the entrant's head. OSHA specified those points of attachment because the Agency believed that their use would enable the entrant to present the smallest possible profile during retrieval. However, OSHA acknowledges that there may be circumstances under which alternate body harness attachment points may be at least as safe and effective as either of the specified locations. Accordingly, The Agency proposes to allow any other point of attachment which enables the entrant's body to present the smallest possible profile during retrieval. As amended, the first sentence of paragraph (k)(3)(i) would read as follows: Each authorized entrant shall use a chest or full body harness, with a retrieval line attached at the center of the entrant's back near shoulder level, above the entrant's head or other point which assures that the entrant will present the smallest possible profile during retrieval.
