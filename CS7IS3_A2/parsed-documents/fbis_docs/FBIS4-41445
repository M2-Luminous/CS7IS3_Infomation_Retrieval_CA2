The group had been monitored by the interior ministry bodies over four months. Moldovan citizens Ion Petcu, Alexandru Budoianu, and Simion Tarlev, in collaboration with a Russian citizen, were attempting to sell for $20,000 a tank with 1 kg of the radioactive substance called Gamma Cobalt-60 to a foreign merchant. According to the experts, this quantity would have been sufficient to pollute the entire territory of Moldova. Simion Lacramioara, the chief of the mentioned department, declared that recently Moldova has faced an increase in the smuggling of radioactive substances and drugs. In his opinion, this trend is caused by the lack of strict customs controls on the western borders to Romania and by the lack of borders themselves in the east, with Ukraine. According to Lacramioara, the radioactive substances are stolen from Russian military bases and then smuggled into Western Europe.
