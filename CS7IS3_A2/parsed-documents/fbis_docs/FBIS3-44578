He is Anatoliy Lukyanov, who once served as the president of the former Supreme Soviet of USSR and has been accused of being involved in the August 19 coup attempt in 1991. Lukyanov was elected into Russia's new parliament "The State Duma" last December as a candidate of the Russian Communist Party. He failed to appear before the special military tribunal in recent trials for health reasons. In his letter to Lukyanov, Yeltsin said that there exists a "possibility of fruitful cooperation" between them. Yeltsin suggested that Lukyanov "share the responsibility for the destiny of the Russian Federation and its citizens" and offer his advice on the relationship between president and parliament. The episode was revealed today when the military tribunal resumed the trial of the accused in the August 19 incident, Ostankino State Radio and Television Broadcasting Company reported. Since Lukyanov was elected into the new parliament, the tribunal has received letters calling for his immunity from trials. The tribunal rejected the appeals on the ground that there is no special provisions in the Constitution concerning the criminal immunity for members of parliament.
