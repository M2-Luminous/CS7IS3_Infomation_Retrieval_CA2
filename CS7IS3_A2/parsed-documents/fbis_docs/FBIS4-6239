The U.S. Defense Secretary, William Perry, some time ago let loose an impudent blast, threatening that the U.S. "will not rule out a preemptive strike" at the DPRK over its fictitious "nuclear suspicion." Signalled by this, the U.S. military is making a massive shipment of military hardware including Patriot missiles to South Korea, massing its naval force in the waters around Korea and frequently staging military drills with the South Korean puppets in their intensified military actions. Viewing this as dangerous provocative acts intended to carry into practice the war scenario which it had rounded off through the "Team Spirit" joint war games from long ago for the purpose of stifling the socialism of the DPRK with "strength," the military analyst says: The escalation of the U.S. military actions against the DPRK is an offspring of the strategy of the expansion of arms market which had been worked out through "back-door dealings" between the U.S. administration and the U.S. war industrial monopolies. The officials of the U.S. administration are, without exception, servants of big monopolies, especially munitions industrial monopolies. Hence their manoeuvres to ignite a war on the Korean peninsula and fatten the munitions industrial monopolies which find themselves in a sorry plight with the shrinkage of the arms market after the end of the cold war. Motivated by these interests, the U.S. military raised the curtain of the Korean war scenario and buckled down to its full- scale promotion. Now a very grave situation which might touch off a war for a slightest casual factor is prevailing on the Korean peninsula. The U.S. military is shameless enough to harp on "a patient diplomatic solution," describing its harebrained anti-DPRK military actions as "for self-defense." It is well-known a fact that the United States has down through history cried for "a diplomatic solution" before invading other countries and then tried to justify its military actions. The "active and patient diplomatic solution" vis-a-vis the DPRK advertised by the U.S. is nothing but a war diplomacy to bring it to its knees and overpower it by armed invasion and the socalled "defense" on the lips of the U.S. is no more than a smokescreen to conceal its bellicose and aggressive nature. Behind the smokescreen of "self-defense" the United States is scheming to mass armed forces in and around South Korea and venture a military action against the DPRK. But they are committing a mistake. No strong arm works with us. Should the United States and its lackeys dare provoke a war, we will answer it with a decisive counter blow to defend our socialist system and the dignity of our republic. The United States would be well advised not to act rashly or forget the bitter lesson of the past Korean war.
