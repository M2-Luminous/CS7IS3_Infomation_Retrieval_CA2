Speaking to journalists, Kovac said that DEUS was to be founded on April 23 through a merger of the government parties Alliance of Democrats (AD) of Milan Knazko and the Alternative of Political Realism (APR), the leadership of which includes, besides Kovac himself, Premier Jozef Moravcik. Referring to DEUS's programme of economic transformation, Knazko said that certain of its principles were in general more similar to the Czech variant of transformation than to "what has been called economic transformation in the past 21 months (during the previous government of Vladimir Meciar, which fell in mid-March)". Differences between DEUS's programme and the Czech one lie in Slovakia's changed situation after it became independent on January 1, 1993, Knazko added. Kovac said that DEUS would stress the right of citizens as the only people who can decide on the country's problems. DEUS will also strive to secure the economic development in Slovakia, as well as the development of the educational level. "A state which does not understand how important the education is, loses its chance to compete with the advanced world," Kovac said. Reacting to the description of DEUS as a liberal party to the right of the centre, Kovac said that "there exists one millimetre distance to the right of the centre as well". On the forthcoming merger of the AD and the APR, Knazko said that "it is a merger following on from certain political experiences." He said that the deputies' group of the two parties was today joined by a new member. However, he declined to give his name. "He will certainly announce it himself," Knazko said.
