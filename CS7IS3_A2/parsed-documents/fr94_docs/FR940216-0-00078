FR940216-0-00078 FR940216-0-00010 Fifth, augmentations are not permitted for parameters not contained in the complex model but for which measurements exist in the complex model database. Including such parameters in an augmented complex model is likely to result in large changes in complex model coefficients due to the interrelationship between fuel properties. Such changes would complicate enforcement and might introduce fungibility problems that would diminish the in-use effectiveness of reformulated fuels. Further, EPA's experience in developing the complex model suggests that including such parameters would introduce collinearity problems and exacerbate the risk of test program gaming. Since such parameters were considered for inclusion in the complex model but were rejected based on input from affected parties and EPA staff, EPA has decided not to permit augmentations for such parameters. However, the Agency will consider including such parameters in subsequent revisions to the complex model. Interactive terms were not permitted to enter EPA's complex models for exhaust toxics, as discussed in Section IV and the RIA. Hence interactive effects on toxics emissions are not permitted in augmentation petitions, unless the test program was intended and specificially designed to investigate such effects. The preceding discussion assumes that the interactive effects identified through testing cannot be traced to a specific cause. If the cause of the interactive effect can be identified, it may be appropriate to determine a greater beneficial augmentation due to the parameter in question than the effects identified through the procedure above or to include an interactive term in the complex model. Therefore, EPA will allow testing of additional fuels to identify the cause of the interactive effect and the magnitude of the effect for representative in-use fuels (again subject to Agency approval regarding the appropriateness of the petitioner's definition of representative gasoline). Petitioners will be required to obtain approval from the Administrator for the proposed additional testing before beginning such testing. Petitioners will be permitted to claim larger benefits for the parameter in question based on the results of such tests, subject to the approval of the Administrator. For a more complete description of these procedures, the reader is referred to section 80.57 of the regulations and to Section IV of the RIA. d. Acceptance criteria. As discussed in Section H, EPA reserves the right to evaluate the quality of testing data submitted in support of petitions to augment the models, to reject test data or analyses submitted to the Agency if such data or analyses are found to be insufficient, flawed, or otherwise deficient, and to include test data or analyses from other sources when evaluating the proposed augmentation to the model. VI. Phase II (Post-1999) Reformulated Gasoline Performance Standards and NO X Standards for Reformulated Gasoline A. Introduction The Clean Air Act (the Act), as amended in November 1990, establishes a more stringent minimum level of control of ozone-forming VOCs and air toxics emissions from reformulated gasoline beginning in the year 2000 than is required prior to that date. For the first five years of the reformulated gasoline program (Phase I; January 1, 1995 through December 1999), Congress established a minimum requirement of 15% reduction of ozone forming VOCs and toxic air pollutants [CA section 211(k)(3)(B)]. 6 Starting with January 1, 2000 (Phase II), the 15% minimum required reductions are increased to 25%, with the provision that EPA may increase or decrease this level based on technological feasibility, considering cost, but may not decrease it below 20% [CA section 211(k)(3)(B)]. The restriction on increases in NO X emissions continues to apply during Phase II of the program. 6 The numerical performance standard of ยง211(k)(3)(B) sets the minimum level of reductions, as it is more stringent than the reductions achieved by the formula fuel in ยง211(k)(3)(A). The regulatory negotiation conducted by EPA for this rulemaking did not address the Phase II VOC and toxics standards, nor did it address a reduction in NO X emissions beyond the statutory cap imposed under section 211(k)(2)(A). After analyzing the costs and benefits of various controls, along with other relevant factors, EPA proposed a range of possible Phase II standards for VOC and toxics. Furthermore, based on EPA's view that NO X reductions were important to achieve attainment of the ozone NAAQS in many nonattainment areas, EPA also proposed a NO X reduction performance standard for Phase II reformulated gasoline relying on EPA's authority under section 211(c)(1)(A). A more detailed discussion of EPA's Phase II proposals for VOCs, toxics, and NO X is provided in subsection 2 below. For the reasons described below, EPA has decided to establish per gallon Phase II VOC performance standards of 25.9% for VOC control region 2 (northern areas) and 27.5% for VOC control Region 1 (southern areas). 7 EPA is also promulgating a per gallon toxics performance standard of 20% for all reformulated gasoline. Reformulated gasoline will also have to meet a 5.5% per gallon reduction in emissions of NO X . EPA has also established more stringent VOC, toxics, and NO X performance standards where a refiner or importer complies on average, as well as minimum per gallon standards, as explained in section C below. 7 The 27.9% VOC performance standard for VOC control region 1 is measured against the statutory baseline gasoline, which has an RVP of 8.7 psi. This amounts to a 17.7% VOC reduction when measured against a baseline gasoline with RVP of 7.8 psi. 1. Statutory Requirements Section 211(k)(1) requires that reformulated gasoline achieve the greatest reductions possible in volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and toxics emissions, ``taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reductions, any nonair-quality and other air-quality related health and environmental impacts and energy requirements. Specifically, section 211(k)(3)(B) of the Act requires that, in the year 2000 and beyond, ``aggregate emissions of ozone-forming volatile organic compounds from baseline vehicles 8 when using reformulated gasoline shall be 25 percent below the aggregate emissions of ozone forming volatile organic compounds from such vehicles when using baseline gasoline 9 .'' Similarly, a 25% reduction in emissions of toxic air pollutants is required. The Act also specifies that the Administrator may adjust the 25 percent reduction level to provide for lesser or greater reductions based on technological feasibility, giving consideration to the cost of achieving such reductions. In no case can the required reduction be less than 20 percent. The Act further provides that emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NO X ) cannot increase as a result of the use of reformulated gasoline. These VOC and toxics reductions and NO X limit are known as the Phase II reformulated gasoline standards. 8 According to section 211(k)(10)(A) of the Act, ``baseline vehicle'' means representative model year 1990 vehicles. 9 The formulation for summertime baseline gasoline is defined in section 211(k)(10)(B) of the Act. See further discussion of baseline emissions in section IV. Section 211(c) of the Act allows the Administrator to regulate fuels or fuel additives if ``any emission product of such fuel or fuel additives causes, or contributes to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger the public health or welfare.'' Section 211(c)(2) further provides that EPA cannot control these fuels and fuel additives ``except after consideration of all relevant medical and scientific evidence available * * *, including consideration of other technologically or economically feasible means of achieving emissions standards.'' In addition, EPA must find that the prohibition ``will not cause the use of any other fuel or fuel additive which will produce emissions which will endanger the public health or welfare to the same or greater degree than the use of the [regulated fuel/fuel additive].'' EPA has elected to use this authority to require reformulated fuels to also achieve NO X reductions in order to reduce ozone formation, based on scientific evidence regarding the benefits of NO X control and on the cost-effectiveness of NO X reductions. The determination of the need for, scientific justification of, and cost-effectiveness of NO X control is presented in the RIA and summarized in subsection C.2 below.
