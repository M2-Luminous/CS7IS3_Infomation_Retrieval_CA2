FR940203-1-00009 FR940203-1-00002 The proposed rule consists of five changes: (1) Deletion of the definition and use of the term ``Controlled area,'' (2) deletion of the phrase ``in a restricted area or'' contained in the definition of occupational dose, (3) revising the definition of ``Unrestricted area,'' (4) modification of the training requirement contained in 10 CFR 19.12, and (5) restoring a requirement that individuals members of the public be notified when they are identified in reports to NRC on exposures in excess of the limits. The deletion of the definition of controlled area is a corrective change. The term was originally added with the 1991 revision of part 20 to acknowledge the need for licensees to control access to areas for purposes other than radiation protection. The use of the term was not intended to be mandatory. Numerous questions from licensees regarding implementing Controlled areas have arisen. Since the staff believes that the use of a controlled area has no radiation protection function other than potential use in estimating the occupancy time for demonstrating compliance with the 100 mrem/year limit, it is being proposed that the term be deleted from part 20. For those reactor licensees who have already formally implemented the revised standards or who have a need for the additional flexibility afforded by the use of the concept of controlled area for purposes of radiological protection, the provisions for exemptions from the NRC's regulations provide an avenue of relief. The NRC currently believes that the elimination of the concept of ``Controlled area'' will have such a small impact on most power reactor licensees that it does not constitute a backfit as envisioned by 10 CFR 50.109. The action removes flexibility but does not directly impose new procedures. However, the NRC welcomes comments on whether this action does in fact constitute a backfit, the degree of burden imposed by the action, particularly for licensees who have already implemented the revised 10 CFR part 20, and on whether in the limited matter of ``Controlled area'' provisions for grandfathering should be provided in the final rule to avoid such burdens. The deletion of the phrase ``in a restricted area or,'' contained in the definition of occupational dose is to ensure that the Commission's intent to apply the dose limits of 10 CFR 20.1301 to members of the public regardless of their physical location, is properly implemented. Currently, only workers are subject to the higher occupational dose limits and just because a member of the public is permitted entry into a restricted area does not mean that he or she should be allowed to receive an occupational dose and exceed the public dose limit. For this reason, the reference to a restricted area is being removed from the definition of occupational dose. Revising the definition of ``Unrestricted area,'' would make the current staff position clear that for purposes of radiation protection, areas are either restricted or unrestricted. This change is consistent with the former 10 CFR part 20 and conforms to removing ``Controlled area'' from the rule. The change to 10 CFR 19.12 will be consistent with the proposed revised definition of occupational exposure. Since occupational dose is to be based upon the individual's activities involving radiation and/or radioactive materials, rather than the location of the work (e.g., restricted area), a conforming change in part 19 is needed to ensure that workers who receive an occupational dose are appropriately trained regardless of the physical location where the work is performed. This is also needed so that members of the public, such as delivery persons, who occasionally enter a restricted area will not be required to receive occupational training merely because they entered a restricted area when their potential exposures do not exceed the 1 Msv (100 mrem) public dose limit and their activities, therefore, would not subject them to any significant risk. The NRC staff believes that the impact of the change to 10 CFR 19.12 is negligible for 10 CFR part 50 licensees, given that the expected numbers of additional occupationally exposed individuals requiring training is small relative to the number of workers already receiving training at these facilities. The NRC staff also believes that these licensees have been providing training to these individuals, even though not specifically required by the regulations. The addition of 10 CFR 20.2205, ``Reports to individuals of exceeding dose limits'' is considered to be the restoration of a previous requirement. Section 20.409(b) of part 20 requires licensees to notify an individual worker or member of the public whenever a report to the NRC is required regarding an exposure of the identified individual. This requirement was inadvertently omitted from the revised standards. Although few incidents occur that involved exposure of a member of the public in excess of dose limits, restoring this provision to part 20 will ensure that licensees are aware of their obligation to notify the individual if, and when, they are required to submit a report to NRC of an occurrence that identifies that individual as having received an exposure. The Commission believes that these proposed changes to 10 CFR part 20 will have some, albeit minor, impacts on reactor licensees. Licensees who have already implemented the revised standards, or who have written procedures to do so, will need to revise those procedures to reflect the proposed changes if promulgated. Benefits such as simplifying the use of restricted and unrestricted area designation, making it clear that only workers can receive occupational dose, tying training requirements to the potential to receive occupational exposure and ensuring that overexposed individuals are notified, are considered by the Commission to far outweigh the impacts. However, these benefits are qualitative in nature, and are expressed in terms of reduced uncertainty in regulatory requirements, clarity of regulatory intent, and consistency of regulatory approach. Thus the NRC believes that the modifications proposed are not backfits. However, the NRC invites comments from affected licensees on whether these proposed changes impose significant burdens and whether or not the actions constitute a backfit.
