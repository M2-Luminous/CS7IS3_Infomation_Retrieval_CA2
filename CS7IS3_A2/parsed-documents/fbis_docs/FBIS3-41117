Police spokesman Maj Bala Naidoo said on Wednesday the dagga was compressed in 127 packages hidden in two pool tables. Its South African street value was about R[rand]150,000, but it would have fetched R4 million in The Netherlands. Durban Narcotics Chief Maj Piet Meyer said Tuesday's arrest was part of an investigation into a drug syndicate. The same people had been implicated in about five similar cases in the past three years. "We are still busy with further investigations to see if we can close down the syndicate once and for all," Maj Meyer said, adding that the organisers preyed on unsuspecting people, manipulating them into doing the "dirty work" for a portion of the profit. He said South Africa's superior quality dagga was much sought after overseas. Amsterdam's got most of its dagga from South Africa and Morocco, but "South African dagga is more potent and it's in demand because the quality is better," Maj Meyer said. The man is expected to appear in court this week.
