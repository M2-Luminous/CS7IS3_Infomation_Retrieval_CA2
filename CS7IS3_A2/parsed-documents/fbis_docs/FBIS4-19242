In the second quarter of 1994 most sectors expect a net output considerably higher than that of the same quarter last year. This is the result of a poll conducted by Ifo [Institute for Economic Research] in Munich among 352 industrial companies at the beginning of the year. Compared with the corresponding period last year, Ifo calculates growth rates of more than 1 percent for the second to the fourth quarter of 1994 based on information provided by the companies. In total, an increase of industrial net output by 1.25 percent is expected for 1994. Next year, the growth will probably go up even more and the average growth rate will increase to 2.5 percent. In August 1993 the companies feared a decline in output of 0.5 percent in 1994. Most sectors of the raw materials and producer goods industry recovered in the course of 1993. According to Ifo, a growth rate of 1.5 percent in 1994 and 1 percent in 1995 is certain for this main industrial group, even without a production index that clearly continues upward. The producers of investment goods expect the most dynamic development. From their information it is possible to calculate a 4.5-percent increase in output for 1995, following 1.75 percent in 1994. The upswing is essentially supported by machine-building, road vehicle construction, and electrical engineering. In contrast, the consumer goods sector is still weak, showing negative rates of change this year (in total minus 1.25 percent) and only a slight increase by the end of 1995 (plus 0.25 percent). Obviously, the companies do not see any factors that could compensate for the renewed decline in spending on consumer goods as a result of tax increases. Despite the expected strong recovery, by the end of 1995 the investment goods sector will have reached only the level of mid-1989. The consumer goods sector, where the slump was considerably less pronounced, will also reach this level, while it continues to stagnate. As a result of its stability shown during the period of its downturn, only the basic materials and producer goods sector can reach its so far highest annual average level of 1992 by the end of 1995, assuming that the companies are able to implement their assessments.
