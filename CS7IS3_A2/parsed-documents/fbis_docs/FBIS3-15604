Fearing that something similar might happen in Tajikistan, Moscow has decided to preempt the events, and on the night of March 4 Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin left for Iran to conduct talks with the Tajik opposition. The purpose of the mission is to persuade the opponents of the current Tajik leader, Emomali Rakhmanov, to sit down at a "roundtable" of national reconciliation. Moscow's rush to reconcile the Tajiks is entirely explicable -- the preservation of "social peace" in Tajikistan has cost Russia dear. As early as last September, during Andrey Kozyrev's visit to Dushanbe, the Russian foreign minister recommended that the Tajik authorities agree to a dialogue with that part of the opposition "holding a constructive stance." Your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent has been told at the Russian Foreign Ministry that at present the Tajiks are closer to a dialogue than ever before. In fact, what remains is to determine the location and the lineup of participants in the "roundtable." Currently, Moscow is also pinning hopes on Tehran's assistance. A couple of years ago, the Iranians, drawing on their close linguistic and cultural ties with the Tajiks, tried to reconcile them without Russia so as to get certain dividends. Tehran leaders have fairly quickly learned, however, that there is no "struggle of the Muslims against the infidels" in Tajikistan: The conflict has a clan bottom-line. Having realized that its mediation has been in vain, Tehran recognized Moscow's interests in Tajikistan and suggested that they act together. Russia, for its part, relies on pragmatic Iranian leaders, who are more concerned over the maintenance of peace along the Iranian borders than the export of the Islamic revolution. As they are not interested in escalating tensions inside Afghanistan, these politicians may have certain influence on pro-Iranian groups deployed in the area of the Tajik-Afghan border (particularly those taking orders from Afghan President Borhanoddin Rabbani or the Islamic Unity Party). Although the question of how willing the field commanders are to pay heed to Tehran's advice is still open, Mr. Adamishin is going to discuss with Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati the possibility of coordinating the two countries' efforts to stabilize the situation on the border.
