FR940617-0-00195 FR940617-0-00026 (a) Measurement of the air flow and the fuel flow by suitable metering systems (for details see SAE J244. This procedure has been incorporated by reference. See §89.6.) and calculation of the exhaust gas flow as follows: G EXHW =G AIRW +G FUEL ␣␣(for wet exhaust mass) or V EXHD =V AIRD +(^.767)×G FUEL ␣␣(for dry exhaust volume) or V EXHW =V AIRW +.749×G FUEL ␣␣(for wet exhaust volume) (b) Exhaust mass calculation from fuel consumption (see §89.415&hyph;96) and exhaust gas concentrations using the method found in §89.418&hyph;96. §89.417&hyph;96 Data evaluation for gaseous emissions. For the evaluation of the gaseous emission recording, the last 60 seconds of each mode are recorded, and the average values for HC, CO, CO 2 , and NO X during each mode are determined from the average concentration readings determined from the corresponding calibration data. §89.418&hyph;96 Raw emission sampling calculations. (a) The final test results shall be derived through the steps described in this section. (b) The exhaust gas flow rate G EXHW and V EXHW shall be determined (see §89.416&hyph;96) for each mode. (c) When applying G EXHW the measured concentration shall be converted to a wet basis according to the following formula, if not already measured on a wet basis. E:GRAPHICSER17JN94.011 F FH =1.783 if air/fuel ratio is 1.00 1.865 if air/fuel ratio is 1.35 1.920 if air/fuel ratio is 3.50 (d) As the NO X emission depends on ambient air conditions, the NO X concentration shall be corrected for ambient air temperature and humidity with the factor K H given in the following formulas. Equation (1) of this paragraph is to be used when testing in uncontrolled dynamometer rooms or at other sites with uncontrolled temperatures and humidities. Equation (2) of this paragraph is to be used for all testing when performed in controlled condition rooms. For engines operating on alternative combustion cycles, other correction formulas may be used if they can be justified or validated.
