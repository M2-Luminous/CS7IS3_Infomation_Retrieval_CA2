"Irrefragable." At the end of a six-week in-depth investigation, the fact-finding mission arranged last 28 October by the Defense Committee of the National Assembly reached this conclusion: The "unrefutable, something that cannot be challenged" (that is the definition according to the Petit Robert dictionary) conclusion is that "France must be able to conduct nuclear testing." This "requirement" is called for "whether from the standpoint of weapon performance, safety, and reliability, the sign of deterrence, or, in any event, from that of perfecting a simulation system." Written by Rene Galy-Dejean (RPR, Paris) and unequivocally approved by the members of the fact-finding mission--Jacques Baumel (RPR), Jean Michel Boucheron (PS [Socialist Party]), Daniel Colin (UDF [Union for French Democracy]), Pierre Favre (UDF), and Pierre Lellouche (RPR)--the 60-page report opens, for the first time at the parliamentary level and therefore publicly, the scientific and technical dossier of nuclear armament. It is its first characteristic. It shows that, without revealing national defense secrets, it is possible to extend the debate on such an essential issue, affecting the independence and security of France, to others than groups of experts. Without useless polemic--and that is its second major characteristic--this report has, nonetheless, political scope. It must be read according to the two "goals of the French defense policy," recalled on 6 October by the communique published simultaneously by the office of the president and that of the prime minister: One of the goals is "to participate in the arms limitation effort within the international community"; the other is "to have always available a believable and adequate deterrence force to protect its vital interests, which is currently the case and which must remain the case tomorrow." New Methods of Calculations This second goal assumes the "maintenance and development of France's technological capability," the implementation of "safeguarding measures making it possible to arrange at any moment a new testing campaign," and finally the acquisition of "techniques of simulation which, alone, can guarantee the continuity of our deterrence once testing has been definitely stopped." It is in that context that the Galy-Dejean report concluded that nuclear testing is "essential." How many tests? Some 20, according to the experts, of which 10 or so could be assigned to the PALEN program (which means, let us recall, "aid program for the limitation of nuclear testing"). Within what delays? The report has sought to be particularly careful on this issue: "If perfecting the PALEN program were the sole purpose of the testing, it is not at all sure that a quick resumption of the firing tests would be necessary. On the other hand, it is conceivable that the majority of the tests related to this program will be truly useful after 1995." It so happens that the perfecting of the PALEN program, not before the year 2000, is not a minor matter. It demands new methods of calculations, that is to say, "computers, at least 50 times more powerful and rapid than the current ones, which do not yet exist on the marketplace, not even in the United States." The Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) should be able to acquire some in 1997. It demands also radiographic methods that will not be "put into service before 1998" and lasers (for a minimum cost of 5 billion francs) "delivering an energy of two megajoules," whereas the CEA's largest laser delivers only 20 kilojoules. It remains that the PALEN has its own limitations ("It will never be possible to simulate nuclear tests.") and, above all, that tests have objectives other than the perfecting of this program. It is necessary, among other things, to develop the TN-100 intended for the future M-5's. Whereas any new product--car, electrical appliances, machine-tool, etc.--is always tested before its final utilization, "is it possible to believe that a nuclear weapon would be the only thing that could be completed without being tested? In this case, how could its reliability be believed, as much from the standpoint of its military effectiveness as of its safety and security?" In this context, the American experience of a moratorium precedent, between 1958 and 1961, is rich in lessons. Today still, "no one knows how to foresee the aging of nuclear matters at the end of 20 years." In his report, Galy-Dejean took great care to mention the international context of the French problematics: The technological advance of the United States which, alone, knows how to carry out experiments that cannot be detected and the strategic objective of which is clearly to dig irretrievably the ditch between itself and the other nuclear powers; the will of China to acquire high-level nuclear armament; Japan's technological competence which, some day, could stop excluding the nuclear option; and the diplomatic agenda that features the renewal of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1995 and the signing (in 1996?) of a treaty prohibiting nuclear testing. Resuming nuclear testing is, therefore, the inner conviction of the fact-finding mission. This does not prevent some of its members from adding their own commentaries to express subtleties or reservations. Thus, Jean-Michel Boucheron, a Socialist, retains only these sections of the report that would not displease the president of the Republic. Thus, Jacques Baumel and Pierre Lellouche would have liked to see "clearly" indicated "the absolute necessity of resuming the tests between now and 1995." Beyond these opinions, as revealed by the chairman of the Defense Committee Jacques Boyon (RPR, Ain), there remains the confirmation of a real consensus around nuclear deterrence.
