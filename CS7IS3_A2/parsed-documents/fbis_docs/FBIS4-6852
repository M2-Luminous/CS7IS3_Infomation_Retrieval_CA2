"I want to see him work toward dispelling the people's distrust in politics," said Yohei Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). "I heard the ruling coalition say repeatedly that it should follow through on promised political reform in order to restore the credibility of politics," Kono told reporters. Earlier in the day, Hata was elected prime minister to succeed Morihiro Hosokawa, who announced his resignation on April 8 over financial improprieties. The LDP chief said his party may or may not cooperate with the coalition, depending on whether the new administration will do things for the benefit of the people. "If they carry out steps that bring profits to the people, we will cooperate, but if they take a stance that is not beneficial for the people, we should stand firmly against them," he said. Kono also said at a meeting of LDP legislators that his party should take a firm stance against the coalition's "forcible" handling of Diet business. "The coalition's forcible way in its handling of Diet business could destroy Japan's democracy...we should firmly oppose that," he said. Kono earlier criticized the coalition for a delay in selecting Hata as their candidate for premier. "It took too long since Hosokawa announced his intention to resign," Kono said. "The coalition should do some serious soul searching for the political vacuum," he said. On the LDP's intraparty affairs, Kono said he had agreed with former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe over joint efforts for party reform. During the political uncertainty following Hosokawa's resignation announcemment Watanabe expressed his intention to leave the party to become a candidate for the premiership, but later dropped the plan after he failed to secure enough support among the coalition members or among his followers for the move.
