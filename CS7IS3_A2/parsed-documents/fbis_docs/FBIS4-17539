He told the "Ukraine" world service radio on Monday that it is "inappropriate" to hold the presidential elections as the status of the president had not been determined and the constitition was not adopted. Kravchuk added that the former parliament adopted the decision on holdng the presidential polls "under the pressure of opposition." Kravchuk's intention to move up elections is shared by the nationalist opposition Rukh movement, the Green Party and the Christian Democrats. They decided at their congresses that it is dangerous to hold elections in Ukraine at present and did not nominate their candidates. Vyacheslav Chornovil, the major opponent of Kravchuk, also refused to run for the president so far. However, the leftist forces became active in this respect. The Socialist Party nominated its leader Alexander Moroz, while the communists, who ensured a major success at the latest parliamentary elections, nominated Petr Simonenko. Other candidates are Speaker Ivan Plushch, former prime minister Leonid Kuchma, Vladimir Lanovoi, Vladimir Pilipchuk, Yuriy Kostenko, Larisa Skorik.
