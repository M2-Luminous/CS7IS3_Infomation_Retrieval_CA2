Ennan, Physical Chemistry and Environmental Protection Institute, Odessa; UDC541.183:661] [Abstract] The ecological use of carbon fiber sorbents for effective removal of toxic gases and vapors from atmospheric air has become pressing. Vapors of organic solvents, such as benzene, are present in the vented wastes of various chemical enterprises, and the study of the sorption dynamics of these compounds is essential for the development of sorption methods of air treatment and the design of ecological equipment. In the present work some results are presented on a study of the sorption dynamics of benzene vapors on carbon foam fibers. The lengths of the mass transfer zones, the unused layer heights, and the coefficients of protection for various through-put rates and benzene vapor concentrations were determined. The dynamic characteristics of the sorption process as a function of the vapor-air mixture were determined by Forsythe approximation of the data. Figures 3; references 10 (Russian).
