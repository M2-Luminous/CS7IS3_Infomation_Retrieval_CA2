On 4 May, the French press agency AFP urgently circulated a misleading report saying that the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] had raped scores of women and then killed them. The NADK spokesman categorically rejects the French press agency's disgusting and base propaganda, which arises from nasty and dark political motives. II. The NADK's morality and virtue is far different -- as different as sky and earth -- from that of the communist Vietnamese lackeys and their alliance, with the United States, France, and Australia acting as proxies. The Cambodian nation and people are well aware that it is the communist Vietnamese puppets and the U.S., French, and Australian lackey puppets who are the bandits and criminals and who have shot and beheaded people without mercy. They have also raped and executed women, elderly people, children, pregnant women, and women who are giving birth to their babies in accordance with the fascist and barbarous nature of their masters. As for the NADK, they are the people's children; they have arduously struggled and shared weal and woe with the nation and people to defend their localities and prevent the enemies of the nation and people from acting at will. The NADK has never done the disgusting, base, and barbarous things that are being slanderously alleged in this propaganda. Look, why do the Cambodian nation and people support Democratic Kampuchea? Why do the Cambodian nation and people oppose the communist Vietnamese and U.S. puppets and their masters? III. It may be asked: What is behind the slanderous reports carried by the propaganda machines of France and the alliance? They have painstakingly acted in this way for the following reasons: A. They are attempting to slander and discredit the NADK, which is vigorously supported and assisted by the Cambodian nation and people in both the northern and western parts of Cambodia -- presently the scene of fighting against invading forces from the two-headed Phnom Penh government and abroad. In view of this situation, the communist Vietnamese and their alliance are extremely anxious. They have been anxiously running around. They have ordered their lackeys to kneel at the feet of the communist Vietnamese and ask them to send troops to keep the puppets from collapsing entirely. Along with this, they have intensified their political and diplomatic maneuvers and stepped up these accusations, which are part of their propaganda and psychological warfare. B. They have strived to commit this slander with the aim of further denigrating us and instigating conflicts within Cambodia's national community. This will enable them to intervene without difficulty and further stir up and inflame the war of aggression, thereby allowing them to come in and secure their respective vested interests. This is what they call respect for human rights and the people's right to self-determination. They are the criminals and warmongers, (?joining) the communist Vietnamese to do away with the Cambodian nation and race. Yet they have hurled accusations against the NADK, which has arduously struggled to protect the people and nation and prevent the criminals from acting at will. This is clear evidence that the alliance -- with the United States, France, and Australia as proxies -- does not want Cambodia to achieve national reconciliation, national compromise, and peace. They have actively launched their propaganda and sought all available military, political, diplomatic, propaganda, and psychological means to inflame the war further and destroy Democratic Kampuchea at all costs. IV. Nevertheless, concrete experiences since August 1993 have clearly demonstrated and brought into broad daylight that even though the communist Vietnamese puppets and the American and French puppets have been combined; even though millions of dollars have been spent to buy guns, tanks, and so on from the communist Vietnamese and Russia; and even though they have strived to provide assistance in the technical field and in psychological warfare, they can never prevail over the nation, people, and NADK. We have joined forces to carry out the struggle to crush the invasion by the communist Vietnamese and their puppets and the alliance and its lackey puppets, causing them to scatter and suffer a shameful defeat. They are currently being forced by the nation and people as well as the king to terminate their war and accept his majesty's five-point policy to achieve genuine national reconciliation and unity, thereby allowing Cambodia to restore peace and survive. [Signed] The NADK spokesman [Dated] 5 May 1994
