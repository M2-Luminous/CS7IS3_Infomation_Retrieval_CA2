Britain and Germany have already overtaken Russia in terms of the quantity of resources invested in the republic's economy. The former communists headed by Algirdas Brazauskas abandoned their former dogmas, renamed a section of the Communist Party of Lithuania the Democratic Labor Party, and won back the people's trust. At the 1992 elections they won a majority in the new parliament, known here as the Seimas. In February 1993 their leader became president. Our conversation with A. Brazauskas began with his heavy burden and the prospects facing the republic on its difficult road. [Stroganov] Mr. President, in a public opinion poll conducted in Lithuania at the end of 1993 you were voted "man of the year," with opposition leader Vytautas Landsbergis, your perpetual adversary, a long way behind. Why was that? [Brazauskas] Presumably it was because of our party's political line, which is to do everything to ensure that the predominant factor in society is stability based on mutual understanding and respect for different opinions. And second, to carry out reforms at the least possible cost. It seems that people find this line acceptable. [Stroganov] Is your workload as president different from that which you bore prior to the proclamation of independence, when you were head of what was then still the Lithuanian Soviet parliament and the Communist Party? [Brazauskas] On 25 February, incidentally, it will be one year to the day since I entered office as president. The result of that year is this: Lithuania is living according to the Constitution adopted by universal suffrage. Almost all the institutions of power have been created according to the fundamental law: The Constitutional Court, the Seimas, and the government are functioning and there is now a new institution which did not exist a year ago -- the President's Service. It goes without saying that the president's workload is considerably different from my past work. Because you bear the responsibility not for such matters as the construction industry, for example, or the whole economy, but rather you feel responsible for the prosperity and the future of all Lithuania's citizens, all the republic's population. The people's trust cannot be compared with the trust of the party Central Committee. [Stroganov] One of the main arguments used by the opposition as it increases the pressure on the republic's authorities is that in the past year Lithuania's economic situation has not only not improved but has actually continued to worsen. Is that so? [Brazauskas] Let us compare the figures. During 1993, when the government was being formed, the president was elected, and the Seimas began to operate, we managed to stop the national economy moving toward catastrophe. In the second half of 1993 signs of stabilization appeared. Income rose at approximately the same rate as expenditure. The rate of inflation slowed sharply. Recently it was in the range of 1-7 percent a month. Wages and pensions have risen monthly. The national currency has stabilized: A steady rate is being maintained. Of course we have many problems. Take agriculture, for example. We did not have time to create an alternative to the former collective farm system. Everyone voted and we are voting for individual farming and the return of property. But this property must be used in such a way as to guarantee people incomes and the state a product. Unfortunately this has not been achieved yet. We have made some adjustments to the agricultural reform as it was previously conceived, but unfortunately this was late. [Stroganov] On the subject of agriculture, a republic farmers' strike is being prepared. What is the background to this: Is it political or economic? [Brazauskas] The opposition is demanding early elections. The Constitution and other laws do not rule out that possibility. However, I personally do not see any need for that. And I doubt that the people will support the idea of early elections. However, the strike's organizers are trying to show the people that such questions are not being resolved and are arousing interest in fresh elections. A strike will not help matters, rather it will aggravate the situation for people in the countryside. [Stroganov] Mr. President, in your view what is the present state of Russian-Lithuanian relations? How can they be developed further, in your opinion? [Brazauskas] I regard our relations with Russia as normal. Agreements were signed on a whole series of questions, economic questions first of all, when Mr. Chernomyrdin visited Lithuania in mid-November. These agreements form the basis for the further development of relations. We are ready to deepen and improve those relations, bearing in mind that there is a situation here which does not exist in any of Russia's former Soviet republic neighbors. I mean the matter of Kaliningrad Oblast. I believe that the questions which the Russian Government is raising about ensuring the oblast's vital activity will be resolved and that talks will continue. This question is important both to Russia and to us -- for our normal relations. [Stroganov] Russia is first in terms of the number of joint ventures in Lithuania -- there are almost 900 of them. But in terms of investments Russia is only in third place. This means that there are lots of small enterprises. I know that there are plans for the creation of large-scale joint ventures. But at the same time the Lithuanian opposition is actively working against them because it is afraid of the powerful influence of the Russian economy on the republic. What course will your government opt for? [Brazauskas] The opposition's reacts touchily to this problem because it thinks that we are going to "sell Lithuania off lock, stock, and barrel." But I think that partnership in the economy and the development of economic ties with Russia will continue. We do not intend to discriminate against it in the process of the flotation of enterprises either. The more foreign capital from different countries of the world that there is in Lithuania and the more economic and other ties there are with other states, the stronger it will be economically and the more guarantees of the country's independence there will be. [Stroganov] In your letter to NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner you expressed Lithuania's will to join that organization. What do you think about Russia's reaction to that? [Brazauskas] We expected such a reaction from Russia. However, I certainly do not believe that this reaction will change the good mutual relations between Lithuania and Russia. I want to reiterate what I said in my statement on 4 January. Lithuania's position toward NATO is not directed against neighboring countries or any other states in Europe. We believe that both the character and the aims of NATO have changed since the Warsaw Pact ceased to exist. In addition, Lithuania does not seek isolation from its eastern neighbors and neither expresses nor encourages the psychology of bloc thinking. We believe that the more countries there are under the umbrella of European collective security the more calmly we shall enter the 21st century. [Stroganov] Do you link Lithuania's destiny with Russia's? [Brazauskas] You know that one can talk about shared destinies only in the sense of the extent to which our countries use mutually beneficial ties to enable them both to emerge from the economic crisis as quickly as possible. I would like to recall here the Lithuanian Republic's constitutional act of 8 June 1992, which says that we will develop mutually beneficial ties with each state which used to belong to the USSR. However, we will never enter into any kind of new political, military, economic, or other state unions or commonwealths created on the basis of the former USSR. I should like to wish Russia's citizens fortitude on their path toward prosperity: May the strengthening of democracy and the creation of the market economy bring real benefit as quickly as possible.
