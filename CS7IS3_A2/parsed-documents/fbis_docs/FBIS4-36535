This followed a report broadcast on Israel's second television channel that the two leaders last week held talks in Washington. When later asked by reporters if a meeting with King Husayn took place, Rabin responded: I did not meet him this week. Sources close to the prime minister refused to deny or confirm the report. The Prime Minister's Office would not comment on the matter. Sources in Washington said Rabin had not been in the United States since last March. Meanwhile, the office of Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has denied claims that he met King Husayn earlier this month in Europe. Knesset Member Ra'anan Kohen raised the question two days ago in the Knesset.
