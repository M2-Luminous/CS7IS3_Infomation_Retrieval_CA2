A southern military spokesman in Aden said elite northern Republican Guards "resumed criminal actions against elements of the (southern) third armoured brigade," deployed in the 'Imran region, 60 kilometers (36 miles) north of Sanaa. The northern troops wanted to dislodge the brigade from positions it had occupied since ferocious tank battles Wednesday and Thursday that left nearly 200 dead and dozens of others wounded, according to journalists. The defence ministry in Sanaa said 79 people were killed and 119 wounded in the 'Imran fighting, while an unknown number of others had fled or disappeared. A ministry spokesman quoted by the official news agency SABA' blamed "rebel elements in the (southern) Yemen Socialist Party" for the clashes, saying they were part of a plan "aimed at the partition of Yemen." He said 159 homes were damaged in the fighting. The clashes were the heaviest since former North and South Yemen were unified in May 1990. In the latest fighting the northern forces were backed by tribesmen "hired by Sanaa," according to the southern spokesman. The Bakil tribe has traditionally supported the south, while the Hashid has backed the north. Both are well equipped and can together raise forces of about 100,000 men. The armies of north and south, each totalling about 30,000, have never merged since unification. The southern troops were "still resisting the attacks," the southern spokesman said, and were backed by local people and "patriotic tribesmen." Yemen's political crisis erupted in August, when Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, a southerner, refused to take up his duties in Sanaa, demanding major economic and military reforms. Yemeni political observers said the chances for reconciliation between al-Bid and his rival, President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, were diminishing as each side accused the other of separatism. Al-Bid urged Arab countries to intervene to prevent the conflict escalating Saturday. In a telephone conversation with Libyan leader Mu'ammar al Qadhdhafi, quoted by the Libyan news agency JANA, al-Bid said he was "worried about the deteriorating situation" in Yemen. "The Arab nation should intervene to save Yemen from civil war and fratricidal massacres," he said. Meanwhile, Yemen's Planning Minister 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani arrived in Riyadh with a message for King Fahd from Salih on the situation in Yemen and a bilateral border dispute. The Saudi-Yemeni disagreement centres on the provinces of Assir, Najran and Jizan, which were handed to Saudi Arabia under an agreement signed in 1934. Yemen, which claims the provinces, says the accord expired in 1992. Saudi-Yemeni relations soured following Iraq's August 1990 invasion of Kuwait, when Yemeni leaders voiced support for Iraqi President Saddam Husayn. Prior to unification North Yemen maintained close economic ties with Saudi Arabia, while South Yemen was staunchly Marxist. In Sanaa Saturday six small Yemeni opposition parties called for a "national salvation government" to be set up to implement a reconciliation agreement signed by Salih and al-Bid in Amman on February 20. They accused the northern and the southern leaders of "plotting against unity." Meanwhile the YSP accused President Salih of personally "directing the war" against supporters of al-Bid, and demanded that Salih's brother, Colonel 'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar, be tried for "war crimes." In a statement broadcast on Aden radio and television the YSP said Salih had "ordered the destruction" of the southern brigade based in 'Imran by northern forces led by Ahmar.
