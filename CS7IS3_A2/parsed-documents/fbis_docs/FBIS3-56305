There are plans to produce them at a joint enteprise in Moscow set up by ZiL and the U.S. firm Packard. The agreements on starting this production are largely ready, your ITAR-TASS correspondent was told by ZiL First Deputy General Director Valeriy Saykin. "ZiL-Packard" is the proposed name of the powerful truck capable of carrying over 20 tonnes of freight. The vehicle plus the freight and trailer weighs over 40 tonnes altogether. The first step toward this cooperation was the creation of the "Novotrak" joint enterprise, which sells diesel-engined ZiL trucks and ships some types of heavy truck from the United States; the second was the signing of the documents of association creating the "Novodizel" Joint Enterprise, which will manufacture more sophisticated fuel equipment for ZiL trucks. In the opinion of U.S. specialists, using this equipment will help make annual fuel savings of around $200 million. "In addition to joint production of heavy trucks," Valeriy Saykin concluded, "we intend to organize production of diesel engines in conjunction with the Caterpillar firm, first using foreign spare parts and subsequently switching to producing all the necessary components in Russia."
