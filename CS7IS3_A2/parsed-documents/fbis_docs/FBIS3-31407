As a result, the date will be decided by referendum. A petition with at least 350,000 signatures is necessary to call a referendum. Premier Vladimir Meciar said he was ready to start collecting the signatures starting Monday [21 February]. 83 of 147 present deputies voted for the bill, while 49 were against and 15 abstained.
