A Bosnia-Herzegovina Army soldier has been killed by a sniper bullet while another was wounded. One member of the civilian police and one woman have also been wounded, which confirms that the enemy, following its murderous instincts, does not differentiate between civilians and soldiers [no date given]. HVO fired two artillery rounds and seven 60-mm shells on positions held by units commanded by Avdija Rozajac in the region of Smailovici and Vasino Brdo on 11 March. Intensive sniper and small arms fire was opened along the entire defense line manned by this unit, particularly in the area of Zavrtaljka and Smailovici. Shortly after 1900 hours yesterday evening, HVO extremists carried out combat actions from M-84 machine guns, the so-called death- sowers, and anti-aircraft guns from the region of Brestovica, while they were noticed to be entrenching themselves intensively above the village of (?Gagve), which is a clear indication of their future intentions. While UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] military observers were trying to mediate in the exchange of the body of one Bosnia-Herzegovina Army soldier which the HVO has held for a long time, small arms fire was opened on the international military observers from HVO positions. UNPROFOR members assessed this as a serious indicent. [passage omitted]
