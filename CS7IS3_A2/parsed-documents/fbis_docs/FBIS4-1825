The selection of Mr Tsang drew heavy criticism even from China's own-appointed Hong Kong people's deputies. Actually, Hong Kong deputies wanted to elect another person to the Standing Committee rather than Mr Tsang. The Chinese government chose to ignore the opinions of the Hong Kong deputies. If the Chinese now ride roughshod over the opinions of its own rubber stamp parliament, what hope is there that the Chinese government will even pretend to listen to the people of Hong Kong and respect Hong Kong's democratic institutions and the rule of law. In a recent RTHK television program on the Basic Law, the host asked me what was the most important article in the Basic Law. I answered instinctively, that article 45 on the selection of the first SAR chief executive was by far the most important. There are two reasons for this choice. One, under the existing Hong Kong political structure, all the powers of government are concentrated in the hands of the Governor. He is, in fact, a potential dictator with no effective constitutional checks and balances and does not have to be responsible to anyone or any political organisation. The Executive Council is entirely appointed by the Governor. The partly-elected Legislative Council has very limited powers. The Legislative Council can exercise some form of restraint on the government only through the finance committee. Otherwise, the Legislative Council is an advisory body in fact. Fortunately, the Governor has not resorted to dictatorial powers to govern Hong Kong, up to now. On 1 July 1997, the existing dictatorial powers of the Governor will automatically pass to the first SAR Chief Executive. If the first chief executive was to be democratically elected, Hong Kong would have some control over the first chief executive. Unfortunately, under Appendix I of the Basic Law, the election of the first Chief Executive is by a very undemocratic process. The first chief executive is to be selected by an election committee of 800 members, selected by the Chinese government through the Preparatory Committee. Out of the 800 members, 200 members are selected from the business and finance sector; 200 from the professional ranks; 200 from organised labour and social welfare groups, and 200 from Hong Kong's people's deputies to the NPC and local members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. These 800 members will be selected by the Chinese government and not elected by the people of Hong Kong, directly or indirectly. In the first group, all businessmen for their own self-interests bend toward Beijing. In the second group of professionals, we can be sure that Martin Lee will not be among them. In the third group of labour leaders, we can be sure that Lau Chin-shek and Lee Cheuk-yan will not be among them. In the final group of rubber-stamp Chinese parliamentarians, even the so-called democrat Law Cheung-kwok, voted against his own democratic principles. What credibility is there that the election committee will respect and reflect the wishes of Hong Kong people, and defend democracy and the rule of law in Hong Kong? From Mr Tsang's selection, we now have a pretty clear idea of what qualifications the first SAR Chief Executive must have to suit the Chinese government. First of all, he/she must be a business tycoon. Second, he must have enormous investments in China. Third, he must donate huge sums to the Chinese government. Fourth, he must be obedient to the dictates of the Chinese government. Anyone can tell you that all tycoons are dictators because democracy does not exist in corporations. The Chinese government will get a dictator in line with their thinking. In fact, Mr Tsang got selected right after he donated $100 million to the Chinese government. I believe maybe there is a better method of selecting the first chief executive. Why don't we hold a public auction in June 1997, to see which tycoon will pay the highest price to be Hong Kong SAR's first chief executive? The reward is enormous. The Hong Kong government's annual expenditure is now over $170 billion. Including the exchange fund, retained earnings, Hong Kong's reserves by 1997 are likely to exceed $400 billion. The Hong Kong government is one of the world's richest. Any person who can get his hands on this huge reserve can do a great many things. The temptation is just too great. I often think of Hong Kong as a financial Bosnia, just waiting to be carved up in 1997. When the international community starts to take note of what is happening, I fear that Hong Kong will be like Bosnia now, with very little of anything left. The Tsang Hin-chi saga tells us that, like Bosnia, Hong Kong is just waiting to be pilfered, pillaged and carved-up. This scenario could be avoided if the chief executive was democratically-elected as provided by the Joint Declaration and accountable to the people of Hong Kong.
