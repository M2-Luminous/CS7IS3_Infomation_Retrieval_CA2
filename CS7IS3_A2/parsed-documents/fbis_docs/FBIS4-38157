[passage omitted] In a statement to the Jordanian News Agency, al-Masri added that his majesty believes that cohesion on the internal front, overcoming economic difficulties, and promoting Jordan's democratic, economic, and development march cannot be ignored in any political move and that Israel's recognition of Jordan's sovereignty over its usurped territories, as well as returning its full water rights, will be useful for our Arab brothers in their negotiations on the other tracks. If the Arab rights are recognized on their tracks--a matter that has taken place on the Jordanian track--then this principle would apply to other tracks and all aspects of Arab rights. He also said that the House of Representatives always supports any accomplishment and policy that enables Jordan to restore its rights, promote its development, and achieve the utmost Arab coordination with the other Arab brothers in order to reach a concerted comprehensive solution. Al-Masri added: I understand the extent of doubts and fears of many of the sons of our people, but stagnation and the lack of movement in the international arena, as well as allowing fears and points of weakness to overwhelm confidence and the points of strength in the Arab Islamic society in Jordan and abroad, will only lead to more Zionist control of the region and the international circles. Jordan's move toward negotiations and peace issues, he added, has not come in a vacuum, has not been hasty, and will, with God's help and King Husayn's wisdom, pursue this course to achieve the goals in which our loyal Jordanians believe and for which they are working.
