FR940812-0-00058 FR940812-0-00018 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 675 [Docket No. 931100&hyph;4043; I.D. 080594A] Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for sablefish by operators of vessels using hook-and-line and pot gear in the Bering Sea subarea (BS) of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the share of the sablefish total allowable catch (TAC) assigned to hook-and-line and pot gear in the BS. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), August 8, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, 907&hyph;586-7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. In accordance with ยง675.24(c)(1)(i), the share of the sablefish TAC assigned to hook-and-line and pot gear in the BS was established by the final groundfish specifications (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994) as 229 metric tons. The Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined, in accordance with ยง675.24(d)(1), that the share of the sablefish TAC assigned to hook-and-line and pot gear in the BS subarea will be taken before the end of the year. Therefore, to provide adequate bycatch amounts of sablefish to ensure continued groundfish fishing activity by hook-and-line and pot gear, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for sablefish by persons using hook-and-line and pot gear in the BS effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., August 8, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at ยง675.20(h). Classification This action is taken under 50 CFR 675.24 and is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . Dated: August 8, 1994. David S. Crestin, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;19682 Filed 8&hyph;9&hyph;94; 9:18 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;F
