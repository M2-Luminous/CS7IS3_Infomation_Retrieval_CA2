FBIS4-65388 "drweu095_q_94002" FBIS-WEU-94-095 Daily Report 14 May 1994 TURKEY U.S. Plan on Oil in Turkey-Iraq Pipeline Noted U.S. Plan on Oil in Turkey-Iraq Pipeline Noted NC1605194694 Istanbul HURRIYET in Turkish 14 May 94 p 14 NC1605194694 Istanbul HURRIYET Turkish BFN [Report by Serdar Turgut and Mihrishah Safa: "A U.S. Suggestion for Violation of the Embargo"] [Text] Washington-London--The U.S. Administration has drawn up a plan and submitted it to Ankara in the form of a "nonpaper" on flushing the oil in the pipeline between Karkuk and Yumurtalik. The plan indicates that the United States may agree to the withdrawal of all the 12 million barrels of oil from the pipeline on the condition that Ankara "temporarily" use 100 percent of the profit from its sale. Considering Iraq's sensitive approach on the embargo, however, Ankara wishes to resolve the pipeline problem in a way that will also be acceptable to Baghdad. Any consensus between Turkey and the UN Security Council must also take into account Baghdad's approach. It will be recalled that Iraq has rejected the UN condition for the sale of $1.6 billion worth of oil on grounds that it infringes on its sovereignty. Only 3.8 million barrels of the oil in the pipeline belongs to Turkey. There is no problem on how Turkey's share will be used after it is drained. However, 60 percent of the profit to be made from the sale of the remaining 8.2 million barrels of oil will have to be transferred to the fund which will be under UN control. Another 30 percent will be registered with the UN as profit. Meanwhile, the remaining 10 percent will be used to provide humanitarian aid to Iraq. The United States wishes to block any approach that may be regarded as violating the embargo on Iraq. In view of that, it seems that it is prepared to have Turkey use the profit from the sale of the 8.2 million barrels of oil and pay it back to the UN later on the basis of the 60-30-10 percent formula. However, Britain has informed Washington that it is opposed to that approach. It called for the use of only 60 percent of the profit to be made from the sale of all the oil in the pipeline. Deputy Under Secretary for Political Affairs Bilgin Unan has held talks with British officials on the pipeline problem. He has left Britain for Moscow after being informed that London will agree in principle to the removal of the oil in the pipeline.
