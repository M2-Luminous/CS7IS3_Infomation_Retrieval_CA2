His doctors obliged him to wear an eye patch to cover the treated area. Consequently, Peres decided not to appear in public. Peres did not participate in the cabinet session on Friday [25 February] nor in the meeting Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin held yesterday with the heads of the diplomatic corps in Israel. The foreign minister is working from his home in Jerusalem and even granted an interview to Qol Yisra'el. It has been learned from his office that he will return to work within the next few days.
