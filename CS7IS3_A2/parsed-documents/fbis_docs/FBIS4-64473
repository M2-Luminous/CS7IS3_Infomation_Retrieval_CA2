"This is a very clear promise," Scharping stated in Bonn on Tuesday [3 May] after the session of the SPD Party Council, which was harmonious, according to participants in the meeting. The body that includes representatives of the land and district organizations discussed the draft of the government program that was adopted by the SPD Executive Committee one week ago with one abstention. Scharping added that even unpleasant surprises when counting the cash after a changeover of power in Bonn would not change anything. The limit of burdens has been reached. Within the existing system, however, he considers a number of changes necessary. [passage omitted]
