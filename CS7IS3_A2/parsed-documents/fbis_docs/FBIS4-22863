Samoylov (OKBM [expansion not given]); received August 9,1992; UDC 621.039.577 182.3.003] [Abstract] The urgency of developing projects of low capacity AESs for remote regions is stressed. But first one must solve a number of specific problems, such as reducing the cost of power produced at these AESs and providing skilled personnel for operating small AESs in remote regions. The first goal can be achieved by simplifying the design (making it modular), building the modules in a manufacturing plant and assembling them on the AES site. To achieve the second goal the design must permit prolonged AES operation in an automatic mode remotely controlled from a center that serves several such AESs. The article describes technical requirements to and schematic and design solutions of elements of low-power AESs developed at the OKBM. AESs built using these principles will meet requirements of self-sufficiency and there will be no need for permanent on-site presence of the operating personnel. Based on presented information it is contended that low-power AESs can have substantial technical and economic advantages over power sources that use organic fuels. Figures 3, references 2.
