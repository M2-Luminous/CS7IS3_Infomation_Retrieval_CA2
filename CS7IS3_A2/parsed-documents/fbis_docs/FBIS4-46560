Born in 1923. Went through the Great Patriotic War, signed his name on the Reichstag, was seriously wounded. Devoted his labor activity to nuclear powered ships. He has been in the Kurchatov Institute since 1949, beginning as a laboratory assistant working on a degree thesis, and now is a department director. He is a professor, academician, Hero of Socialist Labor and Lenin and State Prize laureate. As his colleagues say, "From the first tholepin to today on nuclear powered ships--surface and submarine, civilian and military." As he himself says, "This is interesting work and a long and difficult search, the meaning of which lies in arriving at reliable simplicity after having mastered the incredibly complex." [End box insert] [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Nikolay Sidorovich, the first nuclear powered submarine went on alert status three and a half decades ago, and a year later the first nuclear powered icebreaker was placed in operation. Now the attitude toward these events is contradictory and at times even negative... [Khlopkin] Our time generally is full of contradictions. All and everything is criticized without sufficient argumentation. It would be naive to assert that atomic energy does not have its dark sides, but how can one perform the missions facing the Navy without it? Only nuclear powered submarines can keep from coming to the surface and can perform their assigned missions during an entire independent deployment. And how can we turn the Northern Sea Route into a permanently operating artery without nuclear powered ships? The logic of developing marine nuclear power engineering depends to a considerable extent on the country's financial capacities, which must be used wisely. [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Alas, to this day we have not learned to count money; more precisely, to count the options in order to see the real prospects. But returning to submarines. What has been done during these years? [Khlopkin] A great deal, although we succeeded in creating a fully unusual construction already for the first submarine--I have in mind the small, powerful plant. This was done under the direction of Academician A. P. Aleksandrov. Many solutions found here proved very successful and were used in subsequent design projects... Now, thanks to powerful, compact plants our submarines as a rule have higher speeds than foreign ones, while being inferior to the latter in concealment. Already in 1970 we had nuclear powered submarines with a submerged speed of over 40 knots. A further reduction in noise of combatant ships is expected, which will ensure concealment of their operations. Integrated acoustic designing, where design solutions are aimed at reducing acoustic emissions to the minimum, will become a mandatory component in creating the new submarines. In other words, the submarine should become a unique acoustic "black hole" in the sea which will not succeed in being detected by any method. I am setting forth only my own opinion. Quiet submarines have been developed with powerful fourth-generation plants. Concepts for fifth-generation plants are being developed... This is no simple task. Replacing the propeller with a water screw and making the transition to full electric propulsion similar to that used in diesel submarines open up prospects. One other kind of electric propulsion is worth mentioning--without screw or water-jet. A propelling pressure is created for the ship by passing a current through sea water in strong magnetic fields. Superconducting cables and superhigh magnetic fields are needed for such a motor... [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Nikolay Sidorovich, what main directions does science see here today? [Khlopkin] There are several such directions. Safety of marine power engineering is coming to the foreground. Increasing the reliability of plants and the self-protection of their reactors by creating negative feedbacks in the core, excluding losses of the heat-transfer agent, additional barriers preventing a spread of radioactivity... These are only some of the measures aimed at precluding both accidents themselves as well as their consequences. Safety at sea has its specifics, for a reactor on a ship is not only a source of danger, but also a means of saving the ship in extreme circumstances. Then there is the search for new areas of applying atomic energy and its improvement. There are numerous interesting prospects here. To some they may seem unrealistic, but the fact is, even the nuclear powered submarine was considered a fantastic concept in the late 1940's. Special mention should be made of control. Anatoliy Petrovich Aleksandrov demanded that it be just as simple as in the automobile--step on the gas or take your foot off... And such a reactor was created. Reactor power increases when you increase the feed water flow rate and power drops when you decrease the rate, and this without any shift in the absorbers controlling reactivity. [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] You mentioned technical measures, but does the so-called human factor also exist?.. [Khlopkin] It does, and its importance is very great. And I am thinking not just of operator errors at the console in a stress situation. The question posed is broader. The entire safety management system is being examined in order to preclude the possibility of making incorrect decisions back in the design stage and not allow poor quality in manufacturing equipment or unsatisfactory operation. This is a very complex problem, but it is solvable. Also among questions which must be solved by scientists are ecological ones, not just in the course of operation, but also when removing reactors from operation... Very strict monitoring is important here. We have developed supremely sensitive gear for researching radioactivity of sea water. The sunken submarine Komsomolets was inspected with its help. The result was that the leak was less than 0.1 curie per year. At a distance of a few meters from the submarine hull, the level is so low that it is not detected. [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Nuclear powered ships are sending an SOS, equipment is aging, appropriations are being reduced, and yards are standing idle. But on all corners one hears one and the same: conversion, conversion... But the fact is, words and actions do not always coincide. How are things with you? [Khlopkin] There is much that is contradictory here, and not in the idea itself, which is indisputable. Conversion is not only the result of disarmament, but also its stimulus. There are a multitude of questions here: scale, time periods, state support, consistency and thought-out nature of programs... Conversion... We still did not know that word, but we began engaging in it around 40 years ago. Nine nuclear powered civilian vessels were built and the tenth had been launched. By the way, speaking of reasonable approaches, it is advisable to replace today's diesel powered icebreakers, which have exhausted their service life, with nuclear powered ones. This will be cheaper for Russia. Now yards are free for a number of reasons. It would appear they should be loaded down with orders, but we give these orders for icebreakers to foreign firms. I can illustrate the parity of prices with the following example. Taymyr with a single reactor unit was built together with Finland and cost $140 million. Sibir, more powerful with a double reactor unit, was built here and cost 120 million. But that was rubles! Here is another example. Floating atomic electric power stations for supplying heat and electricity to northern coastal cities and mineral enterprises. The degree of necessary construction for a building site in this case is enormously less and the area of condemned lands is less. Such atomic electric power stations can be shifted to any spot... We have created small, unique power plants without analogues in the world. They have no moving parts, current is produced without a turbine--by a thermoelectric generator operating from an atomic reactor. Self-adjusting thermoelectric power stations with a minimum of servicing are intended for supplying small settlements and military posts with electrical energy. Thermal output can be taken to five megawatts, electrical output to 150 kilowatts, and the service life is up to 25 years. Here is another example. The Rosshelf Joint-Stock Company has been established. It proposes to use the potential of defense sectors to carry on oil and natural gas production on the shelf. The initial settling-in of enterprises in areas with an ice situation, where enormous reserves of hydrocarbons already now have been discovered, can be done with the help of nuclear powered icebreakers. They will give the enterprise electrical energy and will protect it from ice. Submarines can survey deposits, map the bottom, and select routes for laying pipelines. Atomic plants successfully solve the problem of distilling water, they are very promising for use in outer space, and they are being purchased willingly abroad. In short, the peaceful atom is not a phrase, but action. [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Today the question is heard more and more often: With disarmament going on, is it necessary to upgrade combatant ships and their power plants? The country is growing poor... [Khlopkin] Yes, a considerable reduction is going on in the Navy now. Orders for new nuclear powered ships are being cut back sharply. Some of them, which were just not completed, are being scrapped. And this is not only in Russia, but in other countries as well. But again, let us proceed from the realities: war, as the last means of solving conflict situations, is not excluded from consideration by a single state. Russia is a maritime power, and this year its Navy celebrates its tricentennial. The Navy was its glory, it guaranteed its safety, and that is how it should remain even now. It is another matter that the might of a maritime power is determined not so much by the number of ships as by their fighting qualities. The motto of Admiral Makarov, "Remember the war," is pertinent even now. [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] And the final question, Nikolay Sidorovich. You went down the front roads. What was the most memorable in those years? [Khlopkin] The war itself, with its horrors, its losses, its distorted fates, but also the joy of victory... The war mercilessly shoved customary concepts together, transferring people's lives into another dimension often inconceivable in its tragedy. The last terrible battle was on 1 May 1945, when our division was holding back an avalanche of German divisions heading for Berlin. We held out... Later came the meeting with the Americans, but already beyond the Elbe... I took off my greatcoat and captain's shoulderboards in 1945 and since then have been a civilian and have been very busy with civilian matters. But Russia's military interests are dear to me, and so I say: The nuclear powered fleet is to be! There is for now simply no alternative to nuclear power engineering for the oceangoing submarine fleet.
