Japan was asked to make stepped-up efforts to stimulate its domestic demand in order to make a dent in its 100 billion dollar current-account surplus, the sources said. Finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven (G-7) economic powers convened in the Frankfurt suburb of Kronberg to discuss aid to Russia and world economic growth. During the meeting, Japan sought to obtain support from its G-7 partners for cooperation to put a cap on the yen's uptrend, which quickened its pace after Japan-U.S. trade talks got bogged down two weeks ago, they said. Japan's Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii and Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno tried to extract commitments from their G-7 counterparts to the agreement last April against any excessive volatility on the foreign exchange market. They emphasized Tokyo's efforts to enliven the groggy domestic economy and thereby curtail its mammoth trade surplus, while arguing a sharp upswing of the yen would offset the effects of such efforts, the sources said. Fujii detailed the government's steps to shore up the economy, including a 15.25-trillion yen stimulus package unveiled earlier this month, they said. After discussions on macroeconomic issues, the G-7 finance ministers and central bankers invited Russian delegates, including Acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin and Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokin, to join them for talks over the West's financial assistance to Russia. The Russian delegates briefed the G-7 officials on the Russian economic policy under the new cabinet. The meeting came amid heightening tension over the trans-Pacific trade dispute on how to ensure a substantial reduction in Japan's towering trade surplus with the U.S. With Washington moving toward a tougher posture in the trade row by President Bill Clinton threatening sanctions, Japan has pledged to draft a trade package by the end of March to speed up deregulations and boost imports. Prior to the G-7 meeting, however, U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen expressed strong dissatisfaction about Japan's achievements so far in slashing the surplus.
