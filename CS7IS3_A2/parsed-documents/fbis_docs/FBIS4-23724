The Mozambican state has now (re)privatized about 300 small, medium, and large scale enterprises since the reintroduction of the market economy in 1987, replacing the centrally controlled one which was in place until 1986. Eneas Comiche, who has been on a working visit to Portugal for two weeks now, told AIM [MOZAMBIQUE INFORMATION AGENCY] that current legislation practically rules that out because it puts foreign investors, including former Portuguese proprietors, on equal footing. He said everyone expressing an interest in investing in Mozambique have been doing so under the terms of the current law, through tenders. He noted that potential Portuguese investors, including former proprietors, understand this factor. The finance minister recalled Law 13-91, which confers on former share-holders and proprietors of enterprises the means to apply for the cessation of state intervention, with justifiable reasons of a financial, technological, or commercial nature, which they may be willing to render. They may be able to propose the continuation of its activities in association with Mozambican businessmen. He said, "those who had any reason to benefit from what has been stipulated in the current law certainly did so at an opportune time." Eneas Comiche said he expects Portuguese businessmen to be more effective and that they will take advantage of their knowledge of Mozambique and the common language, so that Portugal may once again become the main investor in Mozambique. He recalled that "a number of Portuguese nationals have been involved in a study on agricultural and mineral resources among others, to which we have no access," noting that "this study is valuable." Available figures state that the main foreign investor in Mozambique is Great Britain, followed by South Africa and Portugal. About 25 countries invested $700 million in Mozambique over the past few years, of which some $27 million is Portuguese capital. Italy and France are also ahead in economic cooperation, and Eneas Comiche argues that Portugal is not taking courageous steps to advance further, that its political willingness has not been characterized by concrete actions, but he believes that the peace process will dissipate some concerns. Comiche believes that South Africa, which occupies the second place in terms of the volume of direct investment in Mozambique, could do much more if there were no foreign exchange restrictions. He said investors from that neighboring country, although willing to invest in Mozambique, are unable to get authorization from financial institutions for exporting capital. The minister said this issue was discussed with South Africa before the democratic transition and will still be discussed with the South African authorities, particularly with the banks so that restrictions on the transfer of capital, particularly for investment in Mozambique are removed. In terms of commercial transactions, Comiche said over the past few years there has been an increase in trade with South Africa, and there has also been an increase of imported goods from South Africa, but, "unfortunately, not in exports to South Africa." He said, "it will be necessary to guarantee that there is not a big imbalance between what we are exporting and what we are importing from that country." If from a political standpoint the success of the democratic process in South Africa confers stability to Mozambique and southern Africa, it is also true that from an economic point of view that historical event also creates conditions for a new plan of regional development and integration. Similar to what is happening all over the world, Eneas Comiche gives priority to partners from southern Africa, "an area of enormous future regarding natural resources and competitive laborers, so that it may have a say in the continent and the world." He said the economic situation in the country was recovering following the launching of the Economical Recovery Program in 1987 which sort to correct the decline in production which was especially apparent between 1981 and 1986. The worst year was 1992 when GDP was only one percent. In 1993 GDP increased by 19 percent, the biggest rate since independence. Growth of more than 6 percent of GDP between 1994 and 1996 is expected. Comiche also said that a restrictive policy is underway to reduce inflation from 44 percent in 1993 to 30 percent this year and 15 percent in 1996. This will also include products which are not traditionally exported, such as electricity, which is scheduled to be supplied to South Africa from 1996, and the production of natural gas in Pande from 1998. The finance minister also mentioned the National Reconstruction Plan, which is aimed at strengthening national reconciliation and democracy until 1994, and the normalization of the lives of the refugees, displaced people, and demobilized soldiers, for a period of about three years. The minister says that it is estimated that $400 million will be spent per year on the National Reconstruction Plan. Eneas Comiche has been in Portugal for about two weeks now and has already attended two seminars in Lisbon and Porto on opportunities for investment in Mozambique. The focus of these meetings with Portuguese financial institutions and businessmen has been the restructuring of the business sector in Mozambique and the opening to the private sector of agriculture, tourism, mines, and banking, as well as the reduction of bureaucracy in the process of decision-making on foreign investment and the establishment of fiscal incentives for private investment within the framework of the economic opening underway in Mozambique.
