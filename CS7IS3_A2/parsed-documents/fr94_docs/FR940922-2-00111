FR940922-2-00111 FR940922-2-00075 MT has agreed that before the link becomes operational, MT will appoint a registered agent in the U.S. for service of process and will provide ISCC with proof of such appointment. MT also has agreed that it will be subject to jurisdiction in New York for the resolution of disputes under or arising from the link. Operationally, MT will be assigned one number for use on behalf of its members. ISCC will apply to DTC on MT's behalf to establish MT as an ISCC-sponsored DTC participant. ISCC on behalf of MT will initiate book-entry deliveries for no value. ISCC on behalf of MT also will accept receipts of securities by book-entry for no value. Both the receive and deliver functions will be pursuant to instructions received from MT, and such instructions will identify, among other items, the MT member for whom the receipt or delivery is being effected. In special circumstances and at ISCC's discretion, DTC's withdrawal-by-transfer service also may be utilized. In such case, the securities will be delivered as directed by MT. Relevant DTC notices and corporate action data relating to the issues held in the MT/ISCC account at DTC will be provided to MT. To the extent that any money settlement is required, ISCC will receive payment in the form of an official bank check or a wire transfer through the MT designated correspondent bank. ISCC will receive dividend and possibly interest payments from DTC with respect to shares on deposit. Dividend and interest credited to MT's account at DTC will be reflected in MT's ISCC settlement statement. 3 The settlement statement also will reflect a debit for the total dividends and interest paid to MT's account at its withholding bank. 4 3 On each business day, ISCC will transmit to MT a settlement statement detailing the net amount due to ISCC from MT or from ISCC to MT. 4 A withholding bank is a bank approved by the Internal Revenue Service that withholds and pays the tax applicable to dividends and interest on U.S. issues paid to non-U.S. entities. The proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder in that it will promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions. ISCC believes that the provision by ISCC to MT of the services descibed above will further the purposes of Section 17A of the Act. Specifically, it will promote the delivery and safekeeping of certain U.S. issues through a book-entry environment thus avoiding the need to move securities physically to settle trades. It also will standardize in accordance with U.S. practices and procedures the processing of U.S. securities traded on a foreign exchange. In addition, the interests of the U.S. investing public and the U.S. financial community will be served by the performance of such services by ISCC, a registered clearing agency subject to Commission supervision. (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition ISCC does not believe that the proposed rule changes will have an impact or impose a burden on competition.
