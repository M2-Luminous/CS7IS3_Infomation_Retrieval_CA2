"The coalition will strive to win the elections. It represents a chance for Slovakia," SDL Chairman Peter Weiss said after the signing of the document. Leaders of the three remaining parties, Jaroslav Volf, Jozef Klein and Jozef Pokorny backed Weiss's view, saying they believed that their election grouping was the most acceptable for Slovak voters. Under the agreement, the new coalition will share places on the lists of candidates in the ratio 24-6-5-3 (SDL-SZS-SDSS-Farmers' Movement), which, according to Weiss, corresponds to the results of both pre-election polls and the latest, June 1992 elections. The left-wing coalition wants to form a broader social democratic stream on the Slovak political scene, the policy of which would ensue from left-oriented traditions and "the green philosophy." The coalition also wants to try to gain international support, mainly from the Socialist International member parties and the Party of European Socialists. Polls show that the left-wing coalition now can count on 15-23 per cent of the vote in the elections slated for the autumn. According to latest popularity ratings, the coalition has been gaining upon the preferences of the opposition Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) of Slovak ex-premier Vladimir Meciar.
