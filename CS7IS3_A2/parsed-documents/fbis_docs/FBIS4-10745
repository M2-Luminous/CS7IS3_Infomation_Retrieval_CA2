In the name of pluralism (a concept that in Cuba does not really apply), some criticism has been heard over the small amount of attention the executive branch reportedly intends to give him, as well as some favorable comments on restoring diplomatic relations between the two governments. It can be assumed Mr. Robaina is coming to our country with a clear goal. Therefore, it is right -- as scheduled -- for the Paraguayan Foreign Ministry to receive him and listen to him. As there are no diplomatic relations with the current Cuban regime, there are no protocol reasons for any other official attention. There are no special reasons why Paraguay should restore relations with the Cuban regime. Relations presuppose a certain level of affinity or, at the least, some very specific and dynamic interests that make them necessary. It is abundantly clear that neither of these two factors stimulate Paraguay's restoration of diplomatic relations with Cuba. The only possible interest worth mentioning would be limited to some direct trade. Diplomatic relations are not essential for such trade. It is enough to establish trade bureaus like those used by Taiwan to maintain their very dynamic and significant trade operations with a number of nations with which it does not have any formal diplomatic ties. The meaning of a Cuban diplomatic mission in Paraguay remains unknown, but it may well be assumed that establishing a Paraguayan mission in Havana might be viewed by the Cuban people as a gesture of approval and -- eventually -- support for its regime, one of the last and strongest dictatorships still remaining in the continent. Paraguay should be interested in friendship with the Cuban people, but not with a government and political system that has made hundreds of thousands of Cubans choose, whenever possible, to go into exile and to force many others to continue to challenge the regime's ironclad surveillance and the sea's perils to seek in a foreign land the liberty denied to them in their own. As a nation with a long experience in the restriction and denial of liberties and political harassment and repression -- involving widespread fear, imprisonments, and exile -- we should not be interested in dealing with any tyrant, regardless of his leanings. Out of respect for the liberty restored in our country -- as well as the respect that any nation deserves even though deprived of such liberty -- it would be inappropriate to take any step that might even be viewed as tolerance of an unmistakably dictatorial regime like the Cuban regime. So, let us use our inevitably limited efforts to strengthen friendly ties with free nations.
