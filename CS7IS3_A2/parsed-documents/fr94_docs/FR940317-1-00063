FR940317-1-00063 FR940317-1-00013 (b) The heads of area claims offices and the chiefs of command claims services are responsible for ensuring that a prompt and thorough claims investigation is conducted of all claims for or against the Army arising in their area before they take or recommend final action on a claim. The investigation of incidents and claims arising out of the activities of the Corps of Engineers (COE) is the responsibility of the appropriate COE district or division Counsel. On claims in excess of $25,000, the claims JA/attorney assigned to the case should consult with the action officer at USARCS on the extent of the investigation (see ยง536.21). (c) The initial investigation by the unit claims officer is supposed to be completed promptly after the accident and may not be sufficient for final resolution of the claim. The unit's investigation will often be completed before a formal claim is filed and before all information about the full extent of the damages is available. An interview of the claimant may not have been possible or advisable. New information submitted with the claim may require further investigation. The more extensive investigation usually required for final action on a claims will often require the use of not just unit claims officers but also claims JA's/attorneys and investigators within the area claims office, experts within and from outside DOD and personnel from USARCS. ยง536.19 Transfer of responsibility. (a) Transfer of responsibility is authorized when the investigation may be more practicably conducted or completed by the claims officer of another installation or unit. When two or more commands are involved, the common superior commander or the Commander, USARCS will decide who will conduct the investigation. The commanding officer whose personnel or equipment is involved will furnish to the authority responsible for conducting the investigation all available information concerning the incident. (b) Transfer will be accomplished by direct transmittal of a report of the incident in writing, with all available evidence (or orally, later confirmed in writing). (c) When more than one Federal agency is or may be involved, the claims office receiving the claim will contact, at the field level, all other affected agencies in order to obtain the designation of a single agency to investigate and determine the merits of the claim. If such a designation cannot be agreed upon, USARCS will be notified in order to attempt to resolve the matter at agency level or to request the Department of Justice to make a designation. If the DA is the designated agency, the claimant will be notified to correspond only with the DA. This is not to be construed to preclude assistance in the investigation from other Federal agencies. (d) If a claim is received that arises solely out of the activities of another Federal agency, the claim will be transferred to such agency and the claimant notified of such transfer. If the appropriate agency cannot be identified, the claim will be returned to the claimant informing him or her of this fact. (e) When an incident occurs where the Army has no unit or installation conveniently located for conducting an investigation, but another U.S. military department does have an installation or unit in the vicinity, the responsible officer may request the commanding officer or commander of any organization of another U.S. military department to conduct or assist in the investigation. Similar requests from another military department will be honored if possible. ยง536.19 Investigative procedures. (a) General. A claims investigator will be guided by policies, procedures, and guidance set forth in DA Pam 27&hyph;162 or furnished by the Commander, USARCS. For other than routine incidents, guidance should be obtained from the claims approval or settlement authority who will have jurisdiction based on the probable value of the largest single claim arising from the incident. The extent and nature of the investigation should be guided by the specific requirement of the situation. If it is considered in the best interest of the Government, the Commander, USARCS, or the chief of a command claims service, may grant authority to deviate from the specific requirements contained in this regulation in a particular investigation, except as to procedures that are based on statute or have the force of law. (b) Information from other investigations. (1) The investigator should obtain a copy of the report of any prior investigation that was made for purposes other than claims; for example_ (i) Police reports. (ii) Line of duty reports.
