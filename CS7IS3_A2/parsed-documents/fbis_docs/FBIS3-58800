But before negotiations with Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden can be concluded, the Twelve's existing members must decide how far they are prepared to see the political centre of gravity shift, too. The Union's Mediterranean members are worried that embracing the four rich, and principally Protestant, northern states will move the political agenda away from their own priorities. Which gives Malta and Cyprus -- also queuing up for membership -- an opportunity to argue that making them full members soon would keep the current north-south balance more or less intact. Yet the Mediterraneans -- who count only two large countries, Italy and Spain, in their number -- could find the northern newcomers allies when it comes to deciding the balance of power between large and small countries. Large countries have more votes in the Council of Ministers than small ones -- a legacy of the old European Coal and Steel Community, in which France, West Germany and Italy were not prepared to be outvoted by Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Yet with votes based only roughly on population size, the minnows look overrepresented in terms of the ratio of votes to population. Luxembourg's two votes mean one vote for every 200,000 of its citizens. Britain and France's 10 give them roughly one vote per 5.8 million people. It's a voting formula which has survived the successive incorporation of new members and ensures that large countries can't be outvoted in the Council by a motley alliance of mini-states. Even so, the way that votes are evaluated has changed. By the 1980's, Brussels had almost ground to a halt. The Community, hit by recession and a decision-making structure requiring unanimity, was in the grip of Eurosclerosis. The response was the 1987 Single Act. This aimed to kick-start the EC by allowing binding decisions on a majority vote in a wide range of policy areas. Small members were protected from intimidation by larger ones by a system of weighted -- or "qualified" -- majority voting. Under this procedure, it takes 54 of the Council's 76 votes (a difference of 22) to get a qualified majority, so small countries need only pool 23 votes to successfully block a move. The compromise has worked well. To reach a qualified majority, the Big Five need at least two small states on their side. Alternatively, small countries need the support of three heavyweights. Any combination represents roughly 70 percent of the Union's population. Still, each wave of new members into the EU means readjusting the balance of power. EU leaders agreed on the number of votes for new members last month. Sweden and Austria will get four each, with three apiece for Finland and Norway. But they have still to agree on the formula for blocking minorities. If the equation used to decide on votes is extended, eight of the tiddlers -- representing less than one eighth of the combined population -- would be able to block decisions affecting the remaining seven eighths. Karl Lamers, a German Christian Democrat, has proposed a complex formula that would ensure decisions are taken by a majority of member states which among them represent a majority of the EU's citizens. A new category of "super-qualified" majority could be introduced in areas now requiring unanimity such as taxation and foreign policy. A new formula could be agreed by EU leaders in Corfu in June, or at a special summit, possibly in March or April. And yet any solution will be a stopgap. Germany -- the biggest member state and, since unification the most grossly under-represented per head of population -- may push for a redistribution of votes at the Union's next round of institutional reform in 1996. There may be a redistribution of commissioners, too. Today, the Big Five have two each and the rest -- including the four new members -- one each. One suggestion is that the Big Five each have a permanent seat in Brussels, while the minnows rotate the remaining places. The issue could be more complex if the Union brings in micro-states Malta and Cyprus. Maltese diplomats have indicated privately that their country may not take up its right to hold the EU's rotating presidency, perhaps missing a turn at the helm, as Portugal did. Such a concession might alarm medium-sized members. For them this would be a slippery slope, dangerously eroding their comparative power against the big battalions.
