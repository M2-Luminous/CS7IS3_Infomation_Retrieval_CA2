During his half-hour speech the commander in chief briefed the journalists in great detail on the progress of the Russian troop withdrawal from FRG territory and the problems associated with it. Housing construction in Russia for the families of the WGF servicemen being withdrawn is the most painful problem, M. Burlakov stressed. As you know, this has been exacerbated because the units' withdrawal to new basing locations has been speeded up. The withdrawal has been speeded up, but the pace of apartment construction not been stepped up, indeed it has even slowed down. At present there are still 13,000 servicemen's families without housing. This year's plans make provision for the commissioning of around 45,000 apartments; however, given the current lag, I have my doubts, the commander in chief said, that these plans will be fulfilled. The press conference also touched on the subject of the planned celebrations to mark the Russian troop withdrawal from Germany. They have been given the "go-ahead" in principle, notably during a recent telephone conversation between H. Kohl and B. Yeltsin. And the Russian side has put forward a concrete plan for these celebrations. What adjustments will the Germans make to it? And when? M. Burlakov was hopeful that an answer is in the offing. Of late, according to the commander in chief, there have been plenty of articles in the German press concerning the state of the WGF and the withdrawal of its units home. Whereas most of these articles reflect the true state of affairs, there are also obvious falsehoods. DER SPIEGEL and DIE WELT are particularly guilty of this. And another point. Millions of our compatriots have served in Russian garrisons in Germany. How can we preserve the memory of the good that has come of our relations? According to the commander in chief, units are today discussing the idea of setting up a public organization to continue the history of the WGF.
