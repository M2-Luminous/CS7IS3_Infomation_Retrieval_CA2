FR941003-1-00004 FR941003-1-00001 IV. Exemptions Under FOIA The Freedom of Information Act contains nine exemptions from its mandatory disclosure provisions. These exemptions permit an agency to withhold a requested record in certain circumstances. Section 2604.401 in subpart D of the proposed rule generally references the nine classes of records that may be exempted from disclosure under FOIA. Proposed §2604.401(a) states that OGE will not withhold a requested record unless it falls within a FOIA exemption and that in deciding whether to withhold material, OGE will consider whether another statute, Executive order or regulation prohibits release or, if not, whether there is a need in the public interest to withhold it. Further, under proposed §2604.401(b), the Office with withhold information which falls within an exemption if the information was furnished on a pledge of confidentiality authorized by statute, Executive order or regulation. Section 2604.401(c) also provides that certain information compiled for law enforcement purposes may not be subject to the requirement of FOIA. Additionally, proposed §2604.401(d) provides for partial application of the exemptions to a record. Proposed §2604.402 contains OGE's procedures for disclosure of business information provided to the Office. Generally, §2604.402 would require submitters of business information to designate those portions of their submissions they believe may be exempt from disclosure under any exemption of the FOIA. If records so designated are subsequently requested under FOIA, in most cases the submitter will have an opportunity to provide a written objection to disclosure. V. Fees Subpart E of the proposed rule contains provisions relating to the fees which will be assessed for services rendered in responding to and processing requests for records under FOIA. Fees are to be based on the type of service provided (e.g., search, review, duplication) as well as the category of person making the request (e.g., commercial user, educational institution, news media). Generally, commercial requesters will pay the full amount of permissible fees; educational and noncommercial scientific institutions and news media will pay only duplication costs. As a matter of policy, OGE will not change fees for any individual request if the total charge would be $10.00 or less. Additionally, under the proposal OGE may furnish records without charge or at a reduced charge where disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. In making this determination, OGE will apply the factors suggested by the Department of Justice in the Attorney General's Memorandum on the 1986 Amendments to the Freedom of Information Act dated December, 1987. These factors have been incorporated in proposed §2604.503. Section 2604.504 as proposed contains a number of miscellaneous provisions concerning fees, including a requirement that requesters pay in advance fees likely to exceed $250.00. However, advance payment may not be required in the case of a requester who has a history of prompt payment. VI. Annual Report to Congress On or before March 15 of each year, the Office sends a report of OGE's FOIA activities for the prior calendar year to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate. Section 2604.602 of the proposed rule lists the information included in this annual report. VII. Fees for the Production and Mailing of Public Financial Disclosure Reports
