FBIS4-24040 "drafr120_b_94002" FBIS-AFR-94-120 Daily Report 21 Jun 1994 EAST AFRICA Kenya Government Denies Press Reports on Killings in North Government Denies Press Reports on Killings in North EA2106183994 Nairobi DAILY NATION in English 21 Jun 94 EA2106183994 Nairobi DAILY NATION English BFN [Excerpt] The Kenya Government yesterday dismissed as "trash" reports by the British press that up to 10,000 people have been killed in the Turkana region of Kenya by raiding parties from the Toposa and Pokot tribes. A report by the DAILY TELEGRAPH says that the future for the Turkana people is under threat from the raids and that the Turkana have been forced to flee into the central deserts "where their cattle die of starvation, leaving the fugitives with no choice but to turn to the government for relief". However, when the permanent secretary in charge of internal security, Mr. Wilfred Kimalat, was contacted for comment, he said: "Why write such trash? There is nothing like that." Quoting correspondent George Monbiot, the DAILY TELEGRAPH said: "in the north, the Sudanese Government has armed the Toposa tribe with submachine guns and rocket launchers, hoping they will fight the Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA)." And, in the south, writes Mr. Monbiot: "The Kenya Government has supplied automatic rifles to the Pokot people, to cleanse their lands of tribes opposed to the administration." [passage omitted]
