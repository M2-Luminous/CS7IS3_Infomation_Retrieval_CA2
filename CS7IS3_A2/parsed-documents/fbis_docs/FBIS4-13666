The IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] recommendation has not been made public, but the fact the Yitzhaq Rabin does not see eye to eye with the present General Staff and that he is prepared to say as much to the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee is curious and noteworthy. To what point and what line does Rabin believe the IDF can withdraw from the Golan Heights without harming Israel's security? It should be remembered that the prime minister promised U.S. President Bill Clinton last month that Israel would provide Secretary of State Warren Christopher with "a peace package," to be conveyed to Hafiz al-Asad during Christopher's upcoming visit to Damascus. Ever since Israel deviated from the Madrid format at the Oslo talks, official Washington has been painstakingly avoiding interfering too much in the negotiations between Israel and the PLO leadership. Although Clinton welcomed the Declaration of Principles, the handling of its implementation was entrusted to lower ranks. Conversely, the President and the secretary of state have shown great interest in promoting the Israel-Syria peace process; Rabin cannot help taking this U.S. trend into consideration. Therefore, he tasked Major General Ilan Biran with organizing the preparatory work for a peace package that will be addressed to Syria. The Foreign Ministry, which the prime minister avoided in this context, has also lent a hand to the task. Yet on 19 April, the prime minister described all these papers as materiel ("data") for discussion; he was referring both to the papers prepared by the Foreign Ministry and to the document produced by Gen. Biran and his advisers. Rabin stressed that the final decision will be made by the political echelons; he made it clear that as a military man, he would have preferred a status quo on the Golan Heights, but, he said, "there is a political reality which binds us." In other words: Israel cannot evade making a commitment in principle to effect some withdrawal. Rabin still speaks of withdrawal "on the Golan," not "from the Golan." He did not discard this stand at the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. Yet he must have sensed that with regard to the extent of withdrawal, the Israeli fist should not remain as close as it has been to date. The prime minister is aware of the weight of the precedent of the peace accord with Egypt, and he would like that weight to be reduced, because he is not eager to give up conquered land, because he would like to avoid confrontation with the settlers, and because he wants to demonstrate adherence to the Labor platform advocating territorial compromise. Yet he seems to be readier than in the past to meet Syria halfway, and his remarks of 19 April seem to be sending a signal in al-Asad's direction. Two questions arise in the wake of the revelation that Rabin is more flexible than the IDF General Staff: Will Clinton and Christopher perceive his attitude as an appropriate recourse to persuade al-Asad to meet Israel halfway? And, if the Americans are pleased, will the Syrian president be prepared to heed the secretary of state's coaxing -- if the latter indeed makes such an effort -- and withdraw his demand to receive back the entire Golan? Yitzhaq Rabin has marched a step forward. In a sense, he has passed the ball over to the Damascus court.
