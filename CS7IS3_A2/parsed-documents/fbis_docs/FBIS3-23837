In one week the price of regular domestically produced analgesic went up on average across the country by 15 rubles [R]. On 1 February it cost R810 in Yakutsk, R650 in Ukhta, and R336 in St. Petersburg (in many cities--Vorkuta, Cherepovets, Yelets, Naberezhnyye Chelny, and others--this medicine was not available for sale altogether). Nitroglycerin, which a person with a heart condition must always have on him (his life may depend on it) was not available on 1 February in the pharmacies of Belgorod, Tambov, Astrakhan, and Norilsk. In Naberezhnyye Chelny this medicine cost R144, and in Chita--R153. I am leafing through a thick reference book prepared by the Goskomstat [State Committee on Statistics] of Russia, which lists prices in different cities as of 1 February. A color television set in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk--R1 million; regular children's cotton socks in Ulyanovsk--R800; shoe repair in Magadan--R7,500. Of course, prices are not like this everywhere; in other cities they are lower, but still the magnitude of the figures is disheartening. The average price of beef is almost R2,500 (R2,414), but in Yakutsk it costs more than R5,000, and in Khabarovsk--about R4,000. In Krasnoyarsk the price of butter in the stores over one week went up by almost R600, crossing the R5,000 mark. In Kyzyl it costs even more: R5,972 per kg; in Moscow--R7,400 at the farmers market and R2,842 in retail trade outlets (a R180-increase over the week). All prices are rising, but it is especially noticeable looking at foods that in the past used to be part of Russians' daily nutrition. In Apatity the price of rye-wheat bread went up by more than one-quarter over the week and now costs R525. The average (across the country) price of 10 hen eggs exceeded R1,000 (R1,023.70) in retail trade; at the market they cost R1,290. A liter of milk in Severodvinsk already costs R1,000, in Kemerovo--R790, and in Moscow R2,170 at the market and R458 in retail trade (by now, closer to R500 and up). These are not at all cheerful statistics. Prices rose in January much faster than the leadership of the government had anticipated. Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said in December that in the first quarter "the rate of inflation will drop to 15-16 percent." But prices in January "disobeyed" the prime minister and increased by 21 percent. This shows that the economy is still sick; it has a long way to go to get healthy, and a new wave of inflation may hit us in March-April. It was not too long ago that statements of a number of ministers and the deputy prime minister sounded very optimistic: the worst is behind us, they said; inflation is receding; the economy is on the upturn. They quoted figures to support these contentions: in October 1993 the inflation rate was 20 percent, in November--16 percent, and in December--13 percent. But at the same time they somehow failed to mention that the country was living sort of on credit, because the state moved many payouts from the fourth quarter of last year to the first quarter of the current one. Which amounted to no more, no less, than R7.8 trillion (for grain delivered to state storage facilities; state orders fulfilled by defense enterprises; payouts in the budget-financed sphere, including back pay; etc.). That is, the budget deficit was in a way artificially reduced. But one cannot postpone debt repayments forever. They have to be paid, except that now current payments will be added to them. The amounts being mentioned now for the expense part of the budget are in the tens of trillions rubles. This means that with a certain time lag (a month and a half or two) a new avalanche of money will descend on the marketplace, and prices will start rising like yeast. It is possible that inflation in February will slow down somewhat (to 18-19 percent), but in March-April it may rise to 22-25 percent. And then our economy will enter a period of new severe trials. There Is No `Uncle' To Keep Us Fed and Clothed Is it possible to avoid these tribulations by conducting, for instance, an even tougher monetarist policy, by delaying payments until the next quarter, and then again the next one, or, on the contrary, by handing money out right and left? I think that neither option is the best solution; they will only exacerbate the ills of our economy. Until full-scale structural restructuring begins in industry and all sectors of the national economy, we will not see any success. Yes, most of our goods are not competitive in the world market. This means we have to install new technologies and modernize shops and plants. This requires enormous money and investors. Meanwhile, however, we cannot allow all of light industry to grind to a halt, and "close down" domestic agriculture. There is no "uncle" to keep us fed and clothed. Meanwhile, production continues to decline. I will quote perhaps the most alarming figures over the two years of reforms. In "shock" January 1992 production declined by 15-16 percent, in the difficult January 1993--by 17-18 percent, and in January of the current year--by 23 percent. The solvency crisis and the disarray in the economy provoke increasingly new rounds of decline, and it looks as if the economy, like an aircraft out of control, is entering a tailspin. Had the appropriations not been used for consumption, had they not been turned into dollars and channeled abroad but used instead for structural restructuring, refurbishing and modernization of industry, one could at least understand 20-percent inflation. But a new round of inflation against the background of a deteriorating economy is too much. Unless the government in the very near future finds effective levers to radically change the situation, it will not survive until the fall. Such levers do exist. Take for example the defense complex. The directors of many idling plants with first-class equipment are begging (and not for the first year) for just one thing: Tell us precisely how much military hardware will be needed for 1994, 1995, 1996, and subsequent years? There is such a notion--mobilization capacities. This is the foundation of the national defense. A plant director, under the threat of severe punishment, cannot take even a bolt off an assembly line, let alone dismantle the line itself. So shops stand idle for years (or operate at 10 percent of capacity), and no one will take the responsibility to decide their fate. Another lever is to attract investors. Guarantees for businessmen in the form of Russian real estate abroad (in the event of loss of investment in political cataclysms) would open the road for capital to our market, which has a skilled labor force and ready infrastructure (buildings, communications, etc.). There are other options as well. But so far nothing moves beyond endless discussions, The state even has no interest in its own enterprises as the owner, and is not conducting structural restructuring of those that are very promising. Meanwhile, credit liability amounted to R48 trillion as of the beginning of the year, of which past due arrears comprise R17 trillion. The most acute solvency crisis is in Vologda, Leningrad, Kemerovo, Omsk, and Kamchatka Oblasts and a number of other regions. Wages: Millionaires and Paupers The solvency crisis not only paralyzes the economy--for many Russians it means delays in labor remuneration. Of course, the picture is far from uniform in this respect. It is one thing when a nonstate enterprise (a potential bankrupt) accumulates back pay because all it has is debts--this is, after all, its problem; and it is a completely different thing when workers in the budget-financed sphere are not paid because the state does not keep its word and does not pay its debts. Unfortunately, no statistics are kept as yet that separate back pay into budget and nonbudget debt. But judging by reports from localities, the budget debt is very substantial. Does the government not understand that by such actions it not only discredits itself but also provokes a rapid rise in social tension in society? By holding back labor remuneration and thus "slowing down" the rate of inflation with this uncivilized, savage method, the government loses much more than it gains. The total arrears with respect to labor remuneration in industry, construction, and agriculture alone amounted to R766 billion as of 1 January. This means that millions of people are making do without money, borrowing and selling their belongings. The greatest arrears in wages have been registered by statistical organs in Tyumen Oblast (R60 billion), Krasnoyarsk Kray (R39 billion), Tatarstan (R35 billion), and Chelyabinsk Oblast (R32 billion), as well as Kemerovo, Saratov, Irkutsk, Sverdlovsk, Magadan, Volgograd, and other oblasts, and Altay Kray. Wages delayed by 20 or more days account for almost three-quarters of the total amount. In many regions of Russia wages are not paid for two months. The greatest incidence of such occurrences is in the Central and Far Eastern regions. How can one live without money for two months? Do they understand this at Staraya Square and in the White House? I would propose this experiment: hold back salaries of members of the government for two months; perhaps then the urgency of the problem would be more clear to the powers that be. There are, however, instances in which wages (or part of them) have been held back for three or even six months. Do we need to spell out who the workers of these enterprises voted for? All in all, 24,000 enterprises owe their workers back pay. Among the debtors are 5,000 enterprises in industry, 4,000 in construction, and 15,000 in agriculture (the state's indebtedness to agriculture is the greatest). Now let us look at how the average wage has increased over the past year and how it was correlated with the rising prices for goods and services. For the year as a whole prices continued to lead this race; they increased at an anticipatory pace, but not by much. In my calculation, over 12 months the average wage increased 8.8-fold, and prices--9.4-fold. However, taking into account production decline in industry (16 percent) and cutbacks in for-pay services, the rise in wages is nevertheless excessive and does not correspond to the product produced. That is, on the whole Russians produced less and got paid more (even taking into account the inflation factor). Unearned money undoubtedly contributes to price rises. We will see more of it when the state pays off its debts. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Average December Wages in Different Sectors and Regions in the Country (in t-| |housands of rubles) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Overall in the national economy |141.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |All industry |145.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Gas industry |648.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |including: | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |in Tyumen Oblast |975.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |in Krasnoyarsk Kray |584.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Coal industry |335.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Oil industry |333 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Light industry |86.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Instrument building |76 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Agriculture |88.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Construction |194.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Transportation |212 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Health care, physical culture, and so-|112.5 | |cial security | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Education |98.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Culture and arts |84.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Science and science-related services |95.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Credit and insurance |473 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Administrative organs apparat |163.4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Per capita monetary income per worker in December (including dividends paid | |on securities, and so on) (in rubles) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Gas industry |838,545 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |including: | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |in Krasnoyarsk Kray |2,398,934 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |in Tyumen Oblast |1,209,103 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Coal industry |358,541 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Oil production |383,601 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |including: | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |in Tyumen Oblast |571,325 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Another serious item to contemplate is the growing differentiation in wages. The gap between the average wages of the highest- and lowest-paid 10 percent of workers measured by the end of the year a factor of 27 (!)--no developed country has anything like this. Some were paid more than R1 million a month, while more than 1 million Russians got less than even the minimum wage (R14,620). In this respect the gap is measured by a factor of 100 or more. With respect to per capita monetary income, one of the poorest is Ivanovo Oblast (R57,000), and one of the richest is Tyumen Oblast (R245,000). At the same time, among gas industry workers in Krasnoyarsk Kray the average per capita income in December amounted to no more no less than R2.4 million. Such an income policy only increases the danger of a social overheating of society.
