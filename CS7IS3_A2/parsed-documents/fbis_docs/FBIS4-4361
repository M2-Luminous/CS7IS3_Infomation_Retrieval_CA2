The rate of increase in the number of new enterprises in these two spheres is almost double that of 1992. If the 288 joint enterprises and 2,208 private enterprises carry on operations simultaneously, they will certainly consume a huge amount of electricity. If Ho Chi Minh City's electricity distribution network can't satisfy the needs, everyone knows what will happen. According to data disclosed by the Ho Chi Minh City Electric Power Service, the carrier capacity of the city's existing power net is approximately 420 megawatts, which is about 80 megawatts below consumption needs. Thus, there is already an imbalance between needs and carrier capacity. This is one of the things that has led to a drop in pressure and unexpected power outages, which has caused large losses for many production, business, and service installations. The Ho Chi Minh City Electric Power Service has calculated that electricity consumption in the city will increase to 600 and 700 megawatts by the end of 1994 and 1995 respectively. Because of this, unless immediate action is taken, Ho Chi Minh CIty will find itself in a situation in which it "doesn't know whether to laugh or cry." Because on one hand, the supply of electricity will have increased greatly, but on the other hand, electricity needs will have increased but the carrier capacity of the distribution network will not have the capabilities to satisfy those needs. Managers are aware of this, but it is beyond their power to do anything about it. Fortunately, since 1993, financial capabilities have allowed Ho Chi Minh City to begin implementing plans to make improvements on a large scale. On 31 March 1993, the Ministry of Energy finished examining the economic and technical arguments concerning the project to improve and expand the municipal electric power network, 1992-1995 phase. At the beginning of September 1993, the city decided to spend 151 billion dong to implement eight projects in the plan to improve and upgrade things in order to increase the carrier capacity of the electric power network to 700 megawatts. The project got underway during the 4th quarter of 1993 and will be completed by the end of 1994. Tran Minh Quy, the man in charge of implementing the electric power network improvement project of the Ho Chi Minh CIty Electric Power Service, said that this is a major improvement project. The electric power sector is urgently implementing this. The things that must be done include: Building thirty 15-kv lines from the intermediary stations, which includes 4.7 km of underground cable and 61.5 km of above-ground landlines. Improving and upgrading 195 km of 15-kv landlines and laying another 40 km of new landlines. Upgrading the low voltage from 100 volts to 220 volts for 600 zones. Replacing 60 breakers and installing 91 controllers and 70 relays in order to improve eleven 15-kv breaker stations. Besides this, in order to improve electricity safety among the people, the electricity sector will install an additional 5.9 km of 15-kv landlines and 48 km of low-voltage landlines, improve the other 55 km of low-voltage landlines, and build 62 low-voltage, 9,885 kva, stations. As part of the project to improve the electricity network, electrification will be carried out in six villages in six rural districts: Xuan Thoi Thuong in Hoc Mon District, Long Hoa in Can Gio District, Phuoc Kien in Nha Be District, Trung An in Cu Chi District, Binh Hung Hoa in Binh Chanh District, and Long Truong in Thu Duc District. In the villages in Xuan Thoi Thuong and Long Truong districts, construction got underway at the end of 1993. As mentioned above, once the improvement project has been completed, the capacity of the Ho Chi Minh City electricity network will increase from 420 mw to 700 mw. But according to Tran Minh Quy, with just 151 billion dong, only one of the five problems now facing the city's electricity network can be solved, that is, the problem concerning carrier and distribution capabilities to satisfy electricity consumption needs and receive power from the new sources of generation. Only minor improvements will be made with respect to the other problems, that is, the quality of the electric power supplied, the confidence in the power supply, safety in electricity supply and use, and losses. In order to solve the above problems and ensure that consumption needs, which will reach 1,300 mw by the year 2000, are satisfied, the electricity sector has about 10 more projects that must be built, which will require investment capital of more than 2.4 trillion dong. The work to be done in 1995 will cost 470 billion dong. The year 2000 is fast approaching, and the requirements imposed on the electricity sector are rather great. Obtaining capital to implement the plans is still a difficult problem. At present, the electricity sector is looking only at supplemental power funds and a small sum allocated from the municipal budget. Recently, representatives from the World Bank came to Ho Chi Minh City to survey things and study the capabilities for financing the projects to improve the municipal electricity network as part of the general financial program for the Vietnamese energy sector. In December 1993, World Bank representatives returned and issued a notice that the World Bank will send specialists to study the plans for improving and expanding the electricity network at a total cost of $44 million, of which the World Bank will finance $33 million. The draft study phase will conclude in 1994, and preparations for actually implementing things will get underway in 1995. With this financial aid, when added to the efforts of the locality, it is hoped that by the year 2000 Ho Chi Minh City will have the desired electricity carrier and distribution network.
