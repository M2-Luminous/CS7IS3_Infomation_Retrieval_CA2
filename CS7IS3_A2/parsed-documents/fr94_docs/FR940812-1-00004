SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background This document contains proposed amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under section 274 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (Code) as amended by section 13210 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 1993) (107 Stat. 469). These rules relate to the definition of club for purposes of the disallowance of a deduction for club dues under section 274(a)(3) of the Code. Explanation of Provisions OBRA 1993 amended section 274 of the Code by adding section 274(a)(3), which disallows a deduction for amounts paid or incurred for membership in any club organized for business, pleasure, recreation, or other social purpose. Prior to the enactment of section 274(a)(3), membership dues or fees paid to three types of organizations were specifically excepted from the dues disallowance provisions of section 274 because these organizations were not considered to be social, athletic, or sporting clubs within the meaning of section 274(a)(2)(A). The excepted organizations were: (1) professional organizations such as bar associations and medical associations, (2) civic or public service organizations such as Kiwanis, Lions, Rotary, Civitan, and similar organizations, and (3) business luncheon clubs described in ยง1.274&hyph;2(e)(3)(ii) of the regulations. See Q & A 56 and Q & A 57 of Rev. Rul. 63&hyph;144, 1963&hyph;2 C.B. 129, 138, 139; H.R. Rep. No. 1447, 87th Cong., 2d Sess. 22 (1962), 1962&hyph;3 C.B. 426; S. Rep. No. 1881, 87th Cong., 2d Sess. 33 (1962), 1962&hyph;3 C.B. 739; and H.R. Rep. No. 1278, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 32 (1980). The legislative history of section 274(a)(3) indicates that the enactment of that section eliminated the third exception listed above for membership dues or fees paid to business luncheon clubs. The legislative history further indicates that airline and hotel clubs are subject to dues disallowance under section 274(a)(3). H.R. Rep. No. 103&hyph;213, 103d Cong., 1st Sess. 583. However, the legislative history does not indicate that the enactment of section 274(a)(3) had any effect on the first and second exceptions listed above for professional organizations and civic or public service organizations. Accordingly, the proposed regulations provide that the dues disallowance provisions of section 274(a)(3) of the Code apply to business luncheon clubs and airline and hotel clubs, but generally not to professional organizations (such as bar associations and medical associations) or civic or public service organizations (such as Kiwanis, Lions, Rotary, Civitan, and similar organizations). The proposed regulations further provide that certain organizations similar to professional organizations are also generally excepted from dues disallowance, specifically, business leagues, trade associations, chambers of commerce, boards of trade, and real estate boards. Although the proposed regulations generally provide exceptions from dues disallowance for civic and public service organizations, professional organizations, and certain organizations similar to professional organizations, the exceptions are not available if a principal purpose of the organization is to conduct entertainment activities for members or their guests or to provide members or their guests with access to entertainment facilities. Also, as under prior law, the allowance of a deduction for dues paid to these organizations may be precluded or limited by provisions of the Code other than section 274. For example, the dues would not be deductible unless the ordinary and necessary business expense requirements of section 162 are satisfied. The regulations are proposed to be effective with respect to amounts paid or incurred after December 31, 1993. Special Analyses It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business. Comments and Public Hearing Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments (preferably a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are submitted timely to the IRS. All comments will be available for public inspection and copying. A public hearing has been scheduled for November 29, 1994, at 10 a.m. in the IRS Auditorium, Internal Revenue Service Building, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC. Because of access restrictions, visitors will not be admitted beyond the Internal Revenue Building lobby more than 15 minutes before the hearing starts. The rules of 26 CFR 601.601(a)(3) apply to the hearing. Persons that wish to present oral comments at the hearing must submit written comments by October 11, 1994 and submit an outline of the topics to be discussed and the time to be devoted to each topic by November 8, 1994. A period of 10 minutes will be allotted to each person for making comments.
