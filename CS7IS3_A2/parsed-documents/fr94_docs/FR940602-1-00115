FR940602-1-00115 FR940602-1-00014 (a) At any time during the application process for a RCRA permit, the Director may require the applicant to establish and maintain an information repository. The purpose of this provision is to make accessible to interested persons documents, reports and other public information developed pursuant to activities required under 40 CFR parts 124, 264, and 270. (See §270.30(l)(12) of this chapter for similar provisions relating to the information repository during the life of a permit.) (b) The information repository shall contain all documents, reports, data, and other information deemed sufficient by the Director for public understanding of the plans, activities, and operations of any hazardous waste facility that is operating or seeking a permit. (c) The information repository shall be located and maintained at a location chosen by the facility that is within reasonable distance of the facility, and within a structure with suitable public access, such as a county library, courthouse, or local government building. However, if the Director determines the location unsuitable, the Director may specify a more appropriate location. The repository shall be open to the public during reasonable hours, or accessible by appointment. The information repository shall be located to provide reasonable access to a photocopy machine or alternative means for people to obtain copies of documents at reasonable cost. (d) The Director shall specify requirements for informing the public about the information repository. At a minimum, the Director shall require the facility to provide a written notice about the information repository to all individuals on the facility mailing list. (e) Information regarding opportunities and procedures for public involvement, including the opportunity to be put on the facility mailing list, shall be made available at the repository. (f) The facility owner/operator shall be responsible for maintaining and updating the repository with appropriate information throughout a time period specified by the Director, unless existing State regulations require the State to maintain the information repository.
