That is, if it knows how to settle the settlements issue swiftly and without dilution. Anyone who hears international reports on "terrorism" tends to think that it is a tradition which was born Arab, lived Arab, and is going to die Arab. It is most likely that its definition and classification will remain so for some time. But Barukh Goldstein and before him the perpetrator of Rishon LeZiyyon...through to Menahem Begin, "hero" of the King David Hotel operation -- we do not want to make a long list -- confirm that terrorism is not necessarily Arab. It is actually a serious phenomenon which needs to be studied, reexamined, and radically tackled with an open mind that does not condemn haphazardly or use double standards. We have heard so much about Arab "terrorism" that we are now tired of this tone. We realize that it is actually a planned bias designed to conceal right and the demand for it. If we are today promised responsible international action on an ugly massacre like the Hebron massacre, the first signs in the Security Council have not been encouraging, as positions have -- as expected -- split between those who are content with verbal condemnation and the advocates of practical measures. Goldstein's crime is a state rather than an emotional individual reaction. It is a state stemming from a political strategy, a conditioned upbringing, and convictions which are dangerous in their extremist and closed-mindedness and see others' obtaining of humanly acceptable minimum rights as a direct threat to them. In view of this situation, it is impossible to divide a solution or camouflage a settlement. The world has avoided tackling the problem in the occupied territories and senior politicians have deliberately ignored what is happening, using numerous excuses all of which cannot paper over the cracks or convince a child. And today the present Israeli government claims that it is not responsible for the convulsions of radical settlers like Goldstein, whom the Likud government supported for years. But the ruling Labor Party will not be able to wash its hands of its responsibility -- both during its rule before and after Likud -- for planting scores of "security" or "religious" settlements whose residents believe the Palestinians have no right to coexist with them. So any compromise attempt for a settlement that does not include a solution to the crux of the question is doomed to failure. It is futile to talk today about containing reactions without moving quickly to remove the settlements. Their continuation is unacceptable politically because it recognizes the legitimacy of occupation and its implementation and rewards occupation by force. It is also unacceptable at the security level because it does not guarantee any peace for unarmed Palestinians or secure credibility for their promised "local authority." It is also unacceptable demographically because it is simply a population time bomb.
