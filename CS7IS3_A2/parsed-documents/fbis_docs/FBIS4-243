A military source says MPLA-PT [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party] troops equipped with M-46, 85-mm, 46-mm, and 30-mm guns, and various BM-21 multiple rocket launchers, have left Dange- ia-Menha. Today, the troops shelled villages along the Dange-ia- Menha-N'Dlatando road. The source added that the Luanda government intends to disembark special forces behind UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] lines in Cuanza Norte Province. Measures have been taken to defend civilians. The Luanda regime is also involved in offensive operations in Huila and Cuando Cubango Provinces. MPLA-PT troops are fleeing in disarray after failing to storm the capital of Quibala District from positions in Ebo. Yesterday, UNITA repelled MPLA-PT troops led by Lieutenant General Antas after seven hours of fierce clashes in Conde region. Our correspondent reports that the enemy abandoned two BMP-1 amphibious vehicles, two 76-mm guns, one 14.5-mm antiaircraft gun, one RPG-7, several tonnes of assorted war materiel, and large quantities of commodities carrying World Food Program labels. The MPLA-PT offensive in Cuanza Sul Province has claimed the lives of more than 200 innocent civilians in Conde. The area was shelled by Lt. Gen. Antas' long-ranging artillery pieces. These are preliminary figures.
