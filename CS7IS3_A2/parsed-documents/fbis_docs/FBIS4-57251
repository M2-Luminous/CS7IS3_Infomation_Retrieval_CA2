Extensive meetings were held throughout this morning at Government House to discuss Gen. Stange's announced return to duties as Carabineros director general. After a briefing by the ministers in charge of political affairs, they informed the presidents of the different parties that make up the CPPD [Coalition of Parties for Democracy] about the steps the government will be taking in this regard. Here is what Defense Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma had to say: [Begin recording] [Perez Yoma] The latest report the Defense Ministry has on hand is that Gen. Stange will resume his post on 17 May sometime in the morning and that he will be leaving on a tour of the northern region the following day. That is the latest official information the Defense Ministry has on hand. [First unidentified reporter] Does the government have any hopes that this situation will change...? [Second unidentified reporter, interrupting]...Has there been any specific request submitted by Carabineros to repeal the decree that sent Stange on a two-month leave? [Perez Yoma] I believe that [Defense Ministry Under Secretary for Carabineros Affairs] Luciano Fouilloux clearly explained everything on 15 May pertaining to any decrees issued, and which the government believes are unimportant. [Third unidentified reporter] The truth is that Gen. Stange resumes his duties on 17 May. [Perez Yoma] The truth is that the Defense Ministry has received a notice in which Gen. Stange reports his intention of resuming his duties on 17 May and of starting a tour of the northern region. [end recording] Defense Minister Perez Yoma said that ties between the government and Carabineros at this time are smooth. Carabineros has reasserted that Gen. Rodolfo Stange will resume his duties on 17 May. Unlike what happened last week, today Gen. Stange did not visit his Carabineros headquarters office. Despite his announced return, there was no unusual activity here today aside from the Santiago Garrison Generals Corps' routine Monday morning meetings. We learned this morning that Gen. Stange remained at home, where he met the Carabineros legal adviser, General Carlos Pecchi, who was again approached by the press. [Begin recording] [Pecchi] Everything already has been said. Don't insist. All right? [First unidentified reporter] General, but did you discuss today the tour that was announced by the under secretary?... [Pecchi, interrupting] ...I am not allowed to answer anything. [Second unidentified reporter]... How is Gen. Stange? [Pecchi] Very well, very well... [Second reporter, interrupting]..Yes? [Pecchi, interrupting] ...Very well, very well. [Second reporter, interrupting] .. What has he done during the past few weeks? [Pecchi, interrupting] .. Very well, very well... [Second reporter, interrupting] ... Calm? [Pecchi, interrupting]...Calm, very well... [Second reporter, interrupting] ...How about Carabineros?... [Pecchi, interrupting] ...Everything is very calm. Thank you. [end recording] Despite recent government statements, the Carabineros corps takes it for granted that Gen. Stange returns on 17 May. Carabineros sources reported that details are being discussed for his official return.
