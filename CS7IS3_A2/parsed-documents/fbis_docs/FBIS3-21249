Concerning etching techniques and equipment, as a wafer aperture becomes larger, increasingly it becomes difficult to ensure uniformity and to reduce etching damage. In etching process which utilizes ECR plasma, formation of a uniform-particle plasma is essential in solving the problems mentioned above. As the methods of obtaining uniformity in plasma, what have emerged thus far consist of the use of multi-pole magnetic field[.sup]1)[/] in the ECR plasma currently under research, improvement in uniformity of a magnetic field in the direction of wafer surface in the ECR region, and other such methods based on arrangement of a magnetic field.[.sup]2),3)[/] The plasma particle density distribution is dependent not only on arrangement of magnetic fields but also on a microwave's electric field mode. In the vicinity of walls inside the plasma generation chamber, the above-mentioned microwave's electric field has a low-level strength. Moreover, diffusion of the plasma toward its interior walls results in lowering of plasma particle density. Therefore, by keeping walls of a plasma generation chamber away, namely, by enlarging the aperture of the plasma generation chamber, we can maintain the uniform particle density in plasma at the center of the plasma generation chamber involved in etching. This paper will evaluate change in plasma density distribution, caused by the enlargement of a plasma-generating chamber, by measuring ionic current density. Also covered will be a large-aperture diameter ECR plasma etching technology, making a high-aspect ratio etching feasible through the application of the above evaluation result to the process of oxide film etching. ECR Plasma Etching Equipment Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of a divergent magnetic type ECR plasma etching equipment. Microwaves will be introduced into the plasma generating chamber through a tapered waveguide and a granite entry window of the chamber. Around the plasma-generating chamber, 12 multi-pole magnets are attached. The main coil magnetic field has been structured so as to be able to achieve approximate uniformity in the ECR region in the direction of a wafer surface. Moreover, the secondary coil attached to the area surrounding the reaction chamber is structured in such a way that it is possible to print a mirror magnetic field. Figure 1. ECR Etching Equipment Components The plasma generated in the plasma chamber is irradiated on the specimen table inside the reaction chamber through an aperture. We measured ionic current density by using the single probe method, arranging a probe on the specimen table approximately 170mm away from the aperture. Effects of Expansion of Plasma-Generating Chamber Figure 2 shows a distribution of ionic current density when the plasma generating-chamber's inner diameter is changed from 200mm to 270mm while maintaining the aperture diameter at 190mm. Although enlarging the plasma-generating chamber's inner diameter will lower ionic current density centering around the specimen table, in the peripheral area, almost no change has been noted. Figure 2. Ionic Current Density Distribution When Plasma Figure 3 shows the distribution of ionic current density affected by the change in the aperture diameter. Change in the plasma chamber's inner diameter to 250mm increased the ionic current density, thereby improving the degree of its uniformity. Figure 3. Ionic Current Density Distribution When Aperture Figure 4 shows the ionic current density distribution when the degree of the magnetic mirror impression is changed by the secondary coil. Although the effect of plasma confinement by the mirror magnetic field does appear, insofar as density distribution is concerned, no significant change is noted. Figure 4. Ionic Current Density Distribution When From the foregoing result, we have concluded that enlarging the diameters of both the plasma-generating chamber and the aperture not only expands plasma inside the reaction chamber but also reduces effect upon the plasma in the region of the irradiated specimen table by the diffusion and attenuation of the plasma at the plasma-generating chamber's inner walls. These effects enabled us to achieve the uniformity of density distribution. Figure 5 shows the ionic current density distribution when 12-electrode multi-pole magnets are attached to the region surrounding the plasma-generating chamber area so as to prevent scattering of the plasma toward the inner wall and to lower ionic temperature. We used a permanent magnet with a surface magnetic flux density of 3500 gauss and 45mm-block for the multi-pole magnet. In the surrounding area of the plasma-generating chamber, it is possible to attach up to 3 blocks. As shown in Figure 5, the distribution of density is greatly influenced by the number of blocks attached. When only one block is attached, without the magnet, density distribution hardly changed; the tuning region of the incident microwaves, however, expanded, stabilizing plasma discharge. In the future, it will be necessary to ensure the optimal number of magnetic poles and blocks, as well as to optimize magnetic flux density. Figure 5. Distribution of Ionic Current Density When the In the following section, we will describe the oxide etching technology which uses a large aperture ECR plasma source, characterized by a 270mm-diameter plasma-generating chamber, a 250mm-diameter aperture, and a multi-pole magnet (with a 1-block attachment). Application [.sup]4),5)[/] to Oxide Etching Process Figure 6 [figure not reproduced] is a SEM photo showing a cross section form of a contact hole when a high-frequency bias potential is impressed and a thermal oxide film is etched using a C[.sup]4[/]F[.sub]8[/] gas plasma. With the etching condition producing [tai] resist selection ratio of approximately 10, a 50% overetching was performed. The only differences between (a) and (b) in Figure 6 are the inner diameter sizes of the plasma-generating chamber and the aperture. Other parameters (gas pressure, microwave electrical power, bias potential, and magnetic field) are the same. In the past, even under the condition in which etching normally was halted, the expansion of plasma generation chamber made it possible to continue, thereby making a high aspect ratio possible. This is due to the enlargement of the aperture, which improved the degree of uniformity of the plasma density distribution in the direction of the diameter and reduced backward drift caused by the density difference. Figure 7 shows the etching velocity and the in-plane distribution of [tai] resist selection ratio based on an 8-inch diameter wafer. We were able to obtain the thermal oxide etching velocity of 340nm/min and etching uniformity within 5%, plus or minus, which are sufficient for handling an 8-inch wafer process. Figure 7. Distribution of Etching Velocity and [tai] Figure 8 [figure not reproduced] shows the shape of a cross-section of a 1.6-micron-thick BPSG film when a 50% overetching was applied. We were able to achieve the type of etching which produces the same form whether in center or in a peripheral area of the wafer. Conclusion By expanding diameters of both the internal part of the plasma generating chamber and the aperture, we were able to obtain the uniform distribution of ionic current density on the specimen table. This is due to reduced effect on the specimen table's irradiated plasma of plasma diffusion in the direction of the plasma generating chamber walls. As a result of application of the large aperture diameter ECR plasma to oxide etching process, even under the high-selectivity condition (under which etching did not progress when the conventional small aperture diameter plasma generation chamber was used), we were able to obtain good etching form. Moreover, with respect to the 8-inch diameter wafer, we were able to achieve uniform etching with its velocity uniformity within 5%, plus or minus. Since the large aperture ECR plasma etching unit can generate uniform particle plasma in the low gas pressure region, it can be expected to serve as an etching device offering uniformity, high aspect ratio, and low damage features.
