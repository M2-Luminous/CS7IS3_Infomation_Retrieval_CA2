FBIS4-28649 "dreas113_a_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-113 Daily Report 11 Jun 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Reports on Issues Related to DPRK Continue Reports on Issues Related to DPRK Continue IAEA Action `Unlikely' To Affect DPRK OW1106004694 Tokyo KYODO in English 0023 GMT 11 Jun 94 OW1106004694 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, June 11 KYODO -- North Korea is unlikely to change its hard-line stance with the resolution adopted by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to suspend technical aid for its refusal to accept full nuclear inspections, Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] sources said Saturday. The IAEA action could affect the UN Security Council, however, on its deliberations on possible economic sanctions on North Korea, the sources said. In an overwhelming vote of 28-1, the Vienna-based IAEA adopted the resolution, setting in motion the first punitive step by the UN nuclear watchdog agency against North Korea. The Japanese Government welcomed the IAEA action as the international community's expression of concern against the North. But Pyongyang could "not care less" about the suspension of the IAEA's technical aid, which amounted to 270,000 dollars in 1993, the Foreign Ministry source said. The government expects the action will have some influence on potential UN sanctions against North Korea, and Japan is determined to persuade China not to exercise a veto if the measure is put to a vote at the Security Council, the sources said. China, a key ally of North Korea, has a veto power on a resolution as one of the five permanent security council members. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said Friday night he thinks the row over North Korea's suspected nuclear development program has become increasingly tense, saying, "we cannot put off (taking actions) forever." Hata told reporters, however, that the IAEA measures are not "a punishment" and that Japan still hopes the issues will be resolved through dialogue among concerned nations.
