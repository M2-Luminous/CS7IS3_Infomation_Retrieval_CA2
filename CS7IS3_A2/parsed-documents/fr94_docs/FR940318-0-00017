FR940318-0-00017 FR940318-0-00004 This final rule appropriately affords a reduced risk weight to loans whose future repayment prospects are such that they expose institutions to relatively low levels of credit risk. Multifamily mortgage loans not meeting the standards set forth in this rule may pose higher risk of loss and should be placed in the 100 percent risk-weight category. This final rule also satisfies the requirement of section 305 of FDICIA to ensure that multifamily mortgage loans are placed in an appropriate risk-weight category based on actual performance and potential risk of loss. B. Criteria for Eligibility in the 50 Percent Risk-Weight Category 1. Number-Of-Units Restriction The OTS's current risk-based capital regulation limits qualifying multifamily mortgage loans to properties with five to 36 units. The OTS requested comments on whether to retain this restriction. The majority of commenters urged the OTS not to impose a number-of-units restriction on the size of properties securing qualifying multifamily mortgage loans. Two commenters advocated retaining the number-of-units restriction, claiming that loans on smaller multifamily properties pose a lower risk of loss than larger projects. The OTS has considered these comments in light of the OTS's general experience with its current rule providing reduced risk weighting for multifamily mortgage loans on relatively small properties and believes they have some merit. Nevertheless, based on its data on the overall loss experience for multifamily mortgage loans regardless of size, and to conform with the uniform position adopted by the federal banking agencies, the OTS is not including a number-of-units restriction. A few commenters advocated removing a number-of-units restriction in order to allow mortgage loans secured by manufactured housing properties to qualify for the 50 percent risk-weight category. The OTS wishes to clarify that its capital rules generally, and this provision in particular, apply the same standards and principles to manufactured housing as to other residential properties in determining the appropriate risk weight. 2. LTV Ratio While a few commenters advocated calculating the LTV ratio at origination only, most commenters favored the agency's suggestions that the LTV ratio could be computed when there has been a loan paydown or a more recent appraisal. Several commenters cautioned the agency to control the frequency of new appraisals. Upon review, the OTS has determined to calculate LTV ratios as a continuing criterion based on current loan balance to the value of the property. Prudent underwriting standards dictate that at origination of a loan to purchase a multifamily property, the value of the property is the lower of acquisition cost of the property or the initial appraised value, or, if appropriate, the value of the property as determined by the initial evaluation. 4 The OTS recognizes that the value of property can change over time based on factors such as changes in market conditions or material development of the property. Nothing in this rule prohibits the recomputation of the LTV ratio based on such changes and developments. 4 For an explanation of the distinction between an appraisal and an evaluation of real estate and for a description of the circumstances under which each is required under the OTS's current rules, see 12 CFR Part 564. As part of an interagency initiative, however, the OTS is in the process of amending these appraisal regulations. See 58 FR 31878 (June 4, 1993) (proposed rule). In cases not involving purchase of a multifamily property, the value of the property generally would be determined by the most current appraisal, or, if appropriate, the most current evaluation. All appraisals and evaluations must be made in a manner consistent with the OTS's real estate appraisal regulations, guidelines, and policies and with the institution's own appraisal policies. Loans that exceed the LTV ratios set forth in the regulation at origination will be permitted to qualify for the 50 percent risk weight when the loans are paid down below an 80 percent LTV ratio for fixed rate loans and a 75 percent LTV ratio for variable rate loans, if the other criteria set forth in this regulation are satisfied. 3. 80 Percent Occupancy Rate The majority of commenters advocated removing the 80 percent occupancy-rate requirement. These commenters suggested that the requirement was unnecessary in light of the debt service, LTV ratio, and timely payments requirements. A few commenters also noted that occupancy rate may not accurately measure the income generated by a property. The OTS concludes that the debt service requirement is a more accurate measure of the income-producing capacity of the property than the occupancy-rate requirement and is eliminating the occupancy-rate requirement from the final rule. 4. Timely Payments Requirement The proposal includes the requirement that loans receive timely payment of principal and interest for the year preceding its placement in the 50 percent risk-weight category. The OTS received many comments on the effect of the timely payments requirement on the willingness of institutions to make multifamily mortgage loans. Several commenters urged that, for other than new construction loans, lenders be permitted to look at the property's prior operating history to determine compliance with the timely payments requirement. This would allow loans on properties with a history of timely payments to qualify for the 50 percent risk-weight category at origination.
