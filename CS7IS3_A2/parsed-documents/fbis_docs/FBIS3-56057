"Ukraine will carry out its obligations and will not stand in the way of nuclear disarmament", Kravchuk told a press conference on Wednesday after talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton. The U.S. President stressed that the Ukrainian decision to become nuclear free opens wide prospects for it in getting economic aid from various international financial institutions. The "Partnership for Peace" plan provides Ukraine with a possibility to cooperate with the armed forces of the United States and NATO which will also promote Ukrainian security, according to Clinton. The agreement will enhance the security of the three parties and the entire world, Clinton said. Kravchuk thanked the U.S. President for his active promotion of cooperation between the two countries.
