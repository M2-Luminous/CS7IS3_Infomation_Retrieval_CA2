Gen. Yi Yang-ho, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff [JCS] and CIOC commander, presided over the meeting held at the first conference room of the Defense Ministry. The CIOC designated establishment of the nation's total security preparedness as its key target in 1994. The participants discussed a broad range of measures to build up the readiness to instantly counter an irregular warfare, complete a joint civilian-government-military defense capability and conduct training exercises for guerrilla warfare, reviewing North Korea's capability of provoking unconventional warfare and its possibility. In a report, a senior CIOC officer said that North Korea completed a "three-stage" preparedness for waging a war from Oct. 8, 1992 through July 27, 1993 and that it regimented its people and the military forces more tightly in its uphill efforts to strengthen and maintain Kim Il-song's ideological system, chuche or self-reliance. North Korea has secured a 100,000-strong commando force, the largest in the world, and about 2,000 special operatives, the officer reported, revealing that it has recently concentrated on construction of midget submarines and air-cushioned hovercrafts for "high-intensity" infiltrations. The North Korean military machine, according to the officer, is also capable of sending roughly 20,000 combat troops simultaneously into action by mobilizing AN-2 planes, cargo aircraft and surface vessels. He predicted that the types of provocations by North Korean infiltrators would range from attempts to set up a underground party in the South by using core agents and infiltration to the rear areas through the demilitarized zone (DMZ) to conduct political, ideological and psychological warfare and camouflaged peace offensive. In an address, Gen. Yi warned strongly against relaxation in a sense of security and absent-minded posture, emphasizing the sense of security in which part of the people regard a possibility of military provocation by North Korea only as groundless fear is a real threat and danger from within to the national defense posture. North Korea, the only Stalinist communist country in the post-Cold War world, continues propagations and instigations to both its people and military forces, for complete preparations for a war with the South, Yi added. At a ceremony in the wake of the hour-long meeting, the JCS chairman conferred the presidential citations upon the Army's Chungyong Unit, the Kyongsangpuk-to Civil Defense Consultation Committee, the Kangwon-to regional police administration and the Hyundai Precision & Industry Co.s factory in the Changwon Industrial complex for their contributions toward consolidation of the counter-espionage system.
