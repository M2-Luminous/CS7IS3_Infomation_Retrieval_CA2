In his interview Sunjic explained the technical aspects of the monetary conversion and sought to clear up misconceptions and reassure the population of the soundness of the new legal tender. Taking into consideration "negative experiences" people had had in the past, he expressed understanding for their apprehension that the conversion would not proceed smoothly. He emphasized, however, that it is important to "forget the past" and "start building trust." Trying to dispel "persistent rumors" of devaluation, he emphasized that the conversion of 1,000 Croatian dinars into one kuna represents a redenomination and not a devaluation. Like the old Croatian dinar, the kuna will be convertible within Croatia, Sunjic explained, but he declined to discuss "at this moment... if and when it will become convertible" on international financial markets, because a currency cannot be declared convertible "by issuing regulations." In the 10 May edition of VJESNIK, commentator Jakovljevic examined the financial backing of the kuna -- foreign exchange reserves totalling $1.5 billion held by the Croatian National Bank and commercial banks -- and contrasted the current situation to that of December 1991, when Croatia established its "monetary independence" and had to use a temporary currency, the Croatian dinar, because the National Bank of Croatia had no foreign exchange reserves and those of commercial banks amounted to only $200 million. Although he considered present foreign exchange reserves sufficient to guarantee a "successful" introduction of the kuna as the national currency, Jakovljevic nevertheless expressed concern that these reserves will not be sufficient to guarantee its long-term security and stability. In his view the "real" foreign exchange reserves -- those held by the National Bank and currently amounting to only $720 million -- must be increased to an "optimum" of $1.4 billion; otherwise, the kuna could become "vulnerable" in the second half of 1994. These National Bank reserves, he added, must be financed from "regular sources," such as the return of capital that fled the country, foreign trade surpluses, and foreign investments. In conclusion, Jakovljevic recommended that the National Bank continue its present monetary policy of building its reserves to ensure the value of the kuna over the long term.
