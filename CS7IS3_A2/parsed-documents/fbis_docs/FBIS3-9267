[Martic] Well, we left for these negotiations with a clear aim. First of all, to establish a halt of [changes thought] to stop all hostilities, therefore, to establish peace, then to decide about the territory that has been temporarily occupied by Croatia in the January aggression in 1993 and in September. We also wanted to talk about the dumping of nuclear waste on the territory of western Slavonia, which is also occupied at the moment. As things stand so far, I think that we cannot be satisfied as talks have taken another direction. Croatia obviously wants to impose itself on our delegation there with a degree of threat. It says that (?these are the stands) of both the United States and Russia, something that we do not believe. As our delegation in Zagreb reported to us, the Croatian delegation is now demanding that all our formations disarm themselves and the like. We certainly cannot accept that, but we will still remain at the negotiations to take advantage of all opportunities to reach peace. [Stankic] What do you think about these demonstrations that are now held in front of the Russian Embassy in Zagreb? We heard new reports: There are a lot of people there who are demonstrating. [Martic] I consider that to be a method of pressure on our delegation so that, under this horrible pressure, they would give in and sign that paper. However, the people from our delegation are firm, stable, and know exactly to what limits they can go and why they have left. Nobody, including them, can sign something like that. [Stankic] [words indistinct] all kinds of pressures on the Serb delegation and obviously this pressure on Serbs. It seems that this is how they would treat the Serbs in Croatia if they remained in a sort of autonomy. [Martic] Well, you have both asked the question and provided the answer yourself. [Stankic] Finally, let us say what your expectations are? How will these negotiations end? [Martic] Well, I nevertheless expect Russian diplomacy to take more initiative here and to really comply to what it said when it invited us to go to the Zagreb negotiations and that is to establish all hostilities [as heard]. [Stankic] Let us return once again to the negotiations in Zagreb and the Serb side's platform. This is the problem of the occupied regions in Krajina and the problem of western Slavonia. [Martic] As for the occupied territories, the answer is known. We have had agreements before, when Croatia signed that it would withdraw from the occupied territories, but they soon refuted all the agreements they signed and have not respected them. [Stankic] How do you, Mr. President, see the final solution in these regions? [Martic] I expect that, in future, we shall hold negotiations at the International Conference on the former Yugoslavia. I expect us to find solutions there. However, whatever direction the situation may develop, we cannot go lower than our [word indistinct] and that is the people's right to self-determination. We have a parliament, a government, and a president and these are legally elected institutions [words indistinct]. We also have the people, who certainly will not and cannot allow our territory to be returned to Croatia. However, we shall allow this last referendum to be held before the international public -- the people should express its own will about with whom it wants to live. We cannot withdraw from this principle of self-determination.
