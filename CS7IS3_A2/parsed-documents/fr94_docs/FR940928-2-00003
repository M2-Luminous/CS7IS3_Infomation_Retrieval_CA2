Section 6501 et seq.), requires establishment of a NOSB. The purpose of the NOSB is to assist in the development of standards for substances to be used in organic production and to advise the Secretary of Agriculture on any other aspects of the implementation of Title XXI of the FACT Act. The NOSB met for the first time in Washington, DC., in March 1992 and currently has five committees to work on various aspects of the program. The committees are: Crops Standards; Processing, Labelling and Packaging; Livestock Standards; Accreditation; and International Issues. At its last meeting, the NOSB approved a number of recommendations for submission to the Secretary regarding the implementation of the national organic program. PURPOSE AND AGENDA: The main focus of this meeting is to discuss certain substances that should be considered for recommendation for inclusion on the National List as allowed synthetic substances and certain substances that should be considered for recommendation on the National List as prohibited natural substances in regard to the organic production and processing of organic foods. The main emphasis will be on the review of botanical materials that the Act indicates should be reviewed. Additional topics to be covered in the full NOSB meeting include mushroom and greenhouse standards, good manufacturing practices for organic processors and handlers, and livestock healthcare issues. A final agenda will be available on September 12, 1994. Persons requesting copies should contact Ms. Faith Ashton at the above address or phone number. TYPE OF MEETING: All meetings will be open to the public. Individuals and organizations wishing to provide written comments on these issues or to comment orally on any organic issues should send the request to Dr. Harold S. Ricker at the above address or FAX it to (202) 690&hyph;0338 by September 30, 1994, in order to be scheduled. The NOSB has scheduled time for public input on Tuesday, October 11, 1994, beginning at 1 p.m. and continuing until 5:30 p.m. While people may sign up to speak at the door, advance scheduling assures an opportunity in the time allowed and helps the NOSB plan its activities. Each individual or organization will be allocated 10 minutes for presenting orally the key issues of concern, and should provide copies of written material elaborating on those issues for the committees.
