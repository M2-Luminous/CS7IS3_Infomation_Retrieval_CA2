[Spaventa] Of course, and what I found most offensive was the way this lie was presented... [Cirillo] The prime minister answered for you... [Spaventa] Ciampi did a very commendable thing. His solidarity made me very happy. I am very grateful to him for what he did. [Spaventa ends] Thus Budget Minister Luigi Spaventa broke the interview "truce" earlier than expected. He made himself available to answer questions. He even lost some of that self-control which occasionally made him unsympathetic to many people. He spoke, explained, joked. [Cirillo] What would you have replied to Berlusconi had you been in Occhetto's place? [Spaventa] I would have simply answered the substance of the question -- namely, that the gap between the forecasts and the real situation must be blamed on the recession. [Cirillo] In any case, the general state accountant's calculations were wrong. [Spaventa] (The minister, who, when speaking on television and in the latest episodes of this electoral campaign, has resurrected a slightly more marked Roman accent than usual, stated:) I already explained the situation. The calculations were only partly mistaken. As regards two-thirds of the gap -- some 10 trillion lire -- this was due to recession, which caused a reduction in public income. As regards the remaining 5 trillion, clearly miscalculation was involved. This miscalculation, however, was smaller than last year's, when the gap was estimated at 15 trillion. Also this year's figures for the first quarter, which were somewhat puzzling to tell you the truth, did not help us at all to outline a precise picture for the lira. [Cirillo] In order to counter your line of defense, Berlusconi referred to a CORRIERE DELLA SERA article by Mario Monti, the rector of the Bocconi school, who spoke of the need for a 20 trillion package to balance public accounts in 1994. [Spaventa] I have gone through all my calculations again, and I have written a letter to CORRIERE, challenging my friend Monti's figures. A 20 trillion package is not needed to balance the state's accounts; I am more than ever convinced of this. Monti's calculations are wrong, and his figures bear no relationship to reality. I believe Monti's figures are very questionable. [passage omitted]
