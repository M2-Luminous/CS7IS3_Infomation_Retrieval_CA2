"I am happy that we can continue with the project with full security for the environment," Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen said, adding that from the environmental viewpoint the Oresund bridge is best-investigated bridge project ever. "The work on the coast-to-coast link can now get under way at the same time that the work on land on the Danish side can resume," the prime minister said. "I am extremely happy," said Transportation Minister Jan Trojborg, who believes that the timetable for the construction of the bridge and the financial framework for the project will hold, despite the "tardy" Swedish decision. "Compared with the link across the Great Belt, the Oresund bridge is a much simpler technical construction," Trojborg said. Kaj Ikast, his predecessor, was the man who signed the agreement with Sweden in 1991, and he called the Swedish decision "strong, important, and courageous." In 1991 the Christian People's Party did not back the bridge decision, and Ole M. Nielsen, the party's environment spokesman, is calling for new negotiations within the government on the Oresund bridge after this fall's elections.
