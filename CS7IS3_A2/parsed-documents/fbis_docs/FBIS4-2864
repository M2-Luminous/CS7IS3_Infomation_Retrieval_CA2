In 1990, the central government approved the opening of China's first stock exchange center in Pudong. Now the center has 501 member companies, with 152 kinds of stocks listed. It became the country's largest stock market in 1993 when its business volume reached 500 billion yuan. To date, 27 companies in Pudong have had their stocks listed. They raised 15 billion yuan through issuing stocks, relieving the fund shortage to some extent. The Lujiazui financial and trade district is accelerating the construction of some one hundred commercial buildings and business centers. The Jinqiao manufacturing district is also speeding up the official operation of close to a hundred projects and the construction of 200 other projects. The district is expected to become a new center of export-oriented industries. Other listed companies at the Shanghai stock exchange center also value Pudong as a "golden area". More than half of these corporations have invested there, with the total sum exceeding 10 billion yuan. Some large companies listed at the Shenzhen stock exchange have also made inroads in Pudong.
