FBIS4-33979 "drlat114_c_94010" FBIS-LAT-94-114 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 MEXICO Annual Human Rights Report Presented Annual Human Rights Report Presented PA1006224094 Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 7 Jun 94 pp 1, 8 PA1006224094 Mexico City UNOMASUNO Spanish BFN [Report by Angel Porras Robles] [Text] Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, president of the National Human Rights Commission [CNDH], acknowledged to the head of the executive branch, President Salinas de Gortari, that the organization's main problem is the partial fulfillment of 51 percent of its 796 recommendations, 103 of which are due to a "negligent" attitude. He emphasized that "we do not count on the decided support of all the governors or the judges," in the struggle against torture, adding that in 34 penal institutions there is a lack of "courage and willingness" to put an end to corruption, drug trafficking, and self-governing groups inside penitentiaries. During the presentation of his annual report, the ombudsman indicated that when the time comes, he will speak out about the 46 complaints he has filed on the Chiapas conflict, "without attempting to harm the institutions." On Luis Donaldo Colosio's murder, he emphasized that the CHDH mission is not to cover up criminals nor to hide arbitrary actions, it is simply to foster respect for the Constitution. Madrazo Cuellar reiterated that Mexico has the largest human rights organization in the world, however, what it seeks is to become the most efficient. To achieve this, he emphasized, it is indispensable, among other things, for the governors to reinforce their support to the local commissions so that these can efficiently fulfill their duty. Several of these commissions, he warned, face "severe financial problems," as well as a lack of technical and human resources, such as the case of Oaxaca. During the reporting period, the Nonjurisdictional National System of Human Rights' Protection received 24,096 complaints; of these, the CNDH attended to 8,804. This represents an average of 24.1 per day. He added that in four years, 27,841 charges have been presented, of which 26,393 have been investigated. He reported that the CNDH's current capacity to act is 94.8 percent. In this regard, he emphasized that based on a socioeconomic study of victims, it was established that 70 percent are people of very low income. He said: "It is very satisfactory that the institution is giving support to those who have less and with whom we have the greatest justice." He later indicated that the most frequent complaints concern violations of inmates' rights, abuse of authority, arbitrary detention, delays in legal action, denied access to medical services, false accusations, denials of the right to petition, public service responsibilities, and torture. With regard to this last complaint, he emphasized that the accusations are decreasing; last year only 141 complaints were filed. Nevertheless, he explained that he had not received support from some governors and judges. With regard to the governors, "suffice it to say that one fourth of the federal institutions in the country still use torture as a form of punishment and much less have laws to prevent or to punish it." With regard to judges, based on the CNDH's recommendations made during the reporting period, there are 53 cases of torture or homicide awaiting trial. He mentioned that only six of these cases have resulted in prison sentences; however, 26 denials or cancellations of arrest warrants have been issued. In seven cases, sentences have not yet been handed down; in 13 cases, arrest warrants have been issued; and one release resolution was issued. Meanwhile, the CNDH president indicated that the authorities most willing to resolve the complaints through mutual, friendly agreement are the Attorney General's Office and the justice prosecutor of Mexico City, the Secretariat General of Protection and Viability, the Security and Social Services Institute for Government Workers, and the Department of the Federal District. Madrazo Cuellar indicated that the current status of the 267 recommendations issued this year are as follows: 49 have been totally complied with, 196 have been only partially complied with, 12 have been accepted and are waiting for evidence to be presented, three have been accepted without evidence, 22 are pending a response, and seven have not been accepted by the officials involved. In discussing this matter further, he reported that these cases involve the head of Santiago Ixcuintla Municipality in Nayarit, the governors of Aguascalientes and Baja California, the head of Sinaloa State's Higher Court of Justice, the agrarian reform secretary, and the trust fund manager of the National Low-Income Housing Fund. The previous Oaxaca legislature also is included in this list, the CNDH official indicated, because it knowingly let time elapse despite having accepted the recommendations. "This is scandalous behavior devoid of any ethical basis," Madrazo Cuellar noted. Of the 796 recommendations issued in four years, Madrazo Cuellar noted that 376 were fully complied with and 404 partially complied with; three were accepted, but there is no evidence of compliance; and two were unsatisfactorily complied with. Also, 12 are at the stage of submitting evidence; there is still time to reply to 22; and 16 were not accepted. In addition, he noted that 101 of the 404 recommendations that were partially fulfilled fall under this category because the arrest warrants have not been enforced, or, in some cases, even issued by the judges. The CNDH, he added, knows that 426 arrest warrants issued on the basis of its suggestions and which correspond to federal or local jurisdictions have not been complied with or issued. Also, 145 recommendations that have been partially complied with deal with prison matters. In order for these to be fully enforced, many need the allocation of financial resources to build, expand, or repair prisons -- "something that takes time, of course." The CNDH chairman explained that a lack of courage or commitment to stamp out corruption, drug trafficking, and the persistence of self-governing groups is noticeable in 34 cases. Later, when referring to 103 recommendations that were partially heeded, he noted that, based on the dates on which they were issued and the records contained in the respective files, they must be regarded as cases in which there has been "negligent noncompliance." He enumerated the recommendations falling under this category that were sent to different governors: 15 to the Oaxaca governor, 13 to the Michoacan governor, nine to the Guerrero governor, eight to the Mexico State governor, six to the Chihuahua governor, five to the Morelos governor, five to the Puebla governor, four to the San Luis Potosi governor, three to the Baja California governor, three to the Chiapas governor, three to the Guanajuato governor, three to the Sonora governor, three to the Tamaulipas governor, two to the Colima governor, two to the Durango governor, two to the Tabasco governor, two to the Yucatan governor, one to the Aguascalientes governor, one to the Jalisco governor, one to the Nayarit governor, one to the Nuevo Leon governor, and one to the Tlaxcala governor. One was also sent to the agrarian reform secretary. He warned that the recipients "must be aware that each case is a complaint for an act of injustice, arbitrariness, impunity, and it is in their hands to resolve these cases and make amends.... Whoever has the authority to resolve an act of injustice and fails to do so becomes an accomplice of the perpetrator." During the period mentioned in the report -- from May 1993 to May 1994 -- more than 539 public officials -- 330 federal and 209 state employees -- were punished, but since the CNDH has been functioning, a total of 1,848 officials were subject to disciplinary actions. He affirmed that in the struggle against impunity there can be no exceptions. After recounting the CNDH activities -- contained in a total of 5,083 pages, which he summarized in 14 pages -- Madrazo Cuellar noted that the armed conflict in Chiapas represents the most important challenge for his organization. He added: "We are working in an objective and impartial manner in conducting the investigations and collecting evidence, because without these efforts we could not make pronouncements. We are working to rectify errors and to make amends for violations perpetrated by those who disobey orders, and we are doing this without seeking to harm any institutions." Regarding the complaint filed by the Mayorals, who were coimplicated in Colosio's murder, he said the CNDH will maintain the opinion that the perpetrators of the most serious offenses are entitled to their individual rights, but society "must not become confused." He added, "Just as all Mexicans, the CNDH wants the whole truth to be known and those responsible to bear the full weight of the law" for the "deplorable homicide." The CNDH's mission, he added, is to enforce respect for the law at all times, even during the most difficult and painful moments, under the terms of the Constitution.
