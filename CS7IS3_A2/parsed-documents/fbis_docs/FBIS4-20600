FBIS4-20600 "jpjst012__l94033" JPRS-JST-94-012-L JPRS Science & Technology Japan 14 April 1994 Aerospace Flight Test for Multi-Truncated Pyramid Type Pitot Tube Flight Test for Multi-Truncated Pyramid Type Pitot Tube 94FE0357C Tokyo KOGIKEN NYUSU in Japanese Oct 93 pp 7-8 94FE0357C Tokyo KOGIKEN NYUSU Japanese CSO [Article by Aerodynamic section, HOPE Team, National Aerospace Laboratory] [Text] To confirm the practicality of a multi-truncated pyramid base pitot tube that was being developed through co-research with the Tokyo Aircraft Instruments Company, the pitot tube was attached to the tip of the nose boom of the Queen Air B-65, an aircraft used to conduct experiments, for a flight test. The pitot tube is to be mounted on the space plane (HOPE) and the HOPE small-scale experimental landing aircraft. As of 9 September, there have been three modification inspection flights and five data collection flights, and good data was collected without any special breakdowns. Through the use of heads up display, flight tests were carried out with precision and efficiency and equipment for the STOL (short takeoff and landing) experimental aircraft was used for on-board and ground data collection. The multi-truncated pyramid base pitot tube can measure air speed amount and direction simultaneously while fixed to the aircraft. Moreover, it is a type of 5-hole tube that was developed as an air current sensor that does not have the problems of movable sections or complex correction procedures, and based on the 5 pressures, it can find angle of incidence, angle of side-slip speed, altitude, etc. With flight tests, it is difficult to test precision, but data concerning the precision of the pitot tube already had been collected in wind tunnel tests. In these tests, therefore, emphasis was placed on functions, dynamic characteristics, the effects of vibration, temperature and air pressure changes, practicality and reliability. Pressure signals from the multi-truncated pyramid base pitot tube are converted by the speed vector processing unit attached to the instrument rack in the aircraft cabin into angle of incidence, angle of side-slip, speed, altitude, etc., and is output at the rate of 16 times per second by the ARINC429 bus. This output is displayed and recorded by an on-board PC monitor and also is combined with other measurement signals by the ARINC-PCM multiplexer. Data was collected on speed and altitude for the purpose of data comparison by diverging the pressure from a conventional pitot tube for cockpit instrument use and from the static pressure hole and using a speed and altitude transducer. A vane was attached to the boom tip on the right wing end, and angle of incidence and angle of side-slip were used as reference data. Aircraft attitude angle, acceleration, path angle, etc., were measured with inertial navigation equipment (IRU). Data recorders were not mounted on the aircraft because all data was transmitted to the ground by telemetry. The following were the results of the flight tests: (1) While on the ground, equipment ceased to function due to momentary power loss on the aircraft, but there was no abnormal shutdown of equipment during flight. (2) During horizontal, regular flight, speed and altitude data from conventional instruments and from the multi-truncated pyramid base pitot tube were compared, and it was confirmed that the output was adequate. Figure 1 is a sample from an altitude of about 2,400 meters (8,000 feet). The error slope for speed is the effect of position error. Figure 1: Altitude, Speed Signal Comparison (3) Data on angle of incidence and angle of side-slip collected during horizontal regular flight by three methods -- vane, IRU and multi-truncated pyramid base pitot tube system -- were compared. Absolute values differed because the wing tip section and nose section were under separate local flow conditions, but they all displayed essentially the same behavior. Figure 2 is a sample from an altitude of about 3,000 m (10,000 ft). Figure 2: Angle of Incidence Signal Comparison (4) There was no difference between cases when a pitot heater was used and when it was not. (5) Angle of incidence and angle of side-slip response characteristics resulting from vertical short-term movement caused by sudden elevator manipulation and from Dutch roll resulting from sudden rudder manipulation were studied. Figure 3 shows response time samples at about 2,400 m (8,00 ft) altitude and about 50 m/s (100 kt) speed. Figure 3: Angle of Incidence Response Times (6) Angle of incidence sweep tests were conducted and angle of incidence data was collected from 0� to 21�. (7) Angle of side-slip sweep tests were conducted and angle of side-slip data was collected from -13� to +14�. (8) Visual inspection after landing did not turn up any clogging of holes due to insects, dust, etc. These flight tests confirmed that this pitot tube can stand up to use as air flow sensors for use in flight tests, but since some software problems were revealed, modifications are scheduled to be made before the next experiment. Additionally, since the minimum external air temperature was 8�C at 3,000 m (10,000 ft) altitude, there was no problem with moisture adhesion, but that effect is scheduled to be investigated through experiments during the winter.
