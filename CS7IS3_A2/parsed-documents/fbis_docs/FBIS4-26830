The three convicts were subsequently taken to the execution grounds where they were shot to death. The Qiandao Lake incident was brought to an end. This major criminal case stirred the emotions of countless compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan strait, from the time of its occurrence on 1 April until the end of the legal proceedings. I. At 0805 [2405 GMT] on 1 April 1994, the Chunan County Public Security Bureau in Zhejiang Province received a report that a tour boat had caught fire on Qiandao Lake. The county party committee, government, and public security bureau immediately sent fire brigade and medical personnel to the scene to extinguish the fire and carry out rescue operations. An investigation carried out at the time showed that the boat, the "Hairui," with a Taiwan tour group on board, had left Shendu, Anhui Province, for Qiandao Lake on 31 March and was scheduled to reach Maozhuyuan pier in Chayuan Town, Chunan County on the evening of the same day. There were 24 Taiwan tourists, two tour guides, and six crew members on board. Harbor inspection personnel from the Chunan County Shipping Administration were the first to arrive on the scene at 0830 [2430 GMT]. Thick smoke was billowing from the boat's lower cabin. The harbor inspection personnel, disregarding their own safety, boarded the burning boat and used the fire extinguishers on board to put out the fire. Shortly thereafter, two fire trucks arrived on a ferryboat. The firefighters contained the fire 10 minutes later. Accumulated water, however, caused the boat to list. The rescue personnel had to bail "Hairui" out while towing her to a nearby ferry dock where they continued to extinguish the fire. Because no people were found dead on deck or in the passenger cabin during rescue operations, the provincial party committee and government ordered a quick search for missing persons from the boat. To conduct the search, Chunan County sent more than 20 boats carrying over 1,000 people to comb the waters in bays and around islets within 40 km of the scene of the incident. Using wire broadcasts, they also asked residents in the lake area to provide clues. Air Force troops stationed in Zhejiang mobilized airplanes, and the East China Sea Fleet also sent people to assist in the search-and-rescue mission. After the fire on the "Hairui" had been extinguished, Liu Yongjian, head of the criminal investigation detachment under the county public security bureau, was the first to enter the lower cabin to survey the area in the hopes of finding out what had happened there. Covering his mouth and nose with a towel, he braved the thick pungent smoke billowing out from the cabin. There he found some dead bodies. After bailing out the cabin and counting the bodies, he found the bodies of all 32 people board the boat were in the lower cabin. CPC Central Committee and State Council leaders were very concerned about the incident and issued an important directive on dealing with it. They instructed that matters arising in the aftermath of the incident be handled earnestly, and that the cause of the incident be determined swiftly. The Taiwan Affairs Office under the State Council, Public Security Ministry, and Communications Ministry also immediately sent personnel to the scene. Based on reports filed from Zhejiang, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits [ARATS] promptly took the initiative in briefing the Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] on the relevant facts. [passage omitted on how local leaders organized efforts to deal with matters arising in the wake of the incident] On 4 April, more than 50 family members of the deceased Taiwan compatriots arrived in Chunan County to discuss matters arising in the aftermath of the incident with civil affairs, tourism, and other departments in Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou city. Vice Governor Liu Xirong and ARATS Deputy Secretary General Liu Gangqi visited the Taiwan compatriots at their hotels to offer condolences for the deceased and to express sympathy to the bereaved families. The bodies of the Taiwan compatriots killed in the incident were identified after careful examination and identification by their families. The Zhejiang authorities invited Master Jiyun, the abbot of the Hangzhou Lingyin Temple, to perform Buddhist rites and memorial services for the deceased. Following patient and careful communication between the two sides, the remains of the Taiwan compatriots killed in the incident were escorted by their families to the Tonglu County Funeral Parlor for cremation on the afternoon of 6 April and their ashes were taken back to Taiwan by their families. Mr. Lin Weiyang, general manager of Taiwan's Soaring Travel Service who was involved in dealing with the remains of the deceased throughout the period, said: "Mainland departments in charge of the incident have made all possible arrangements. After having done what is humanly possible, we have to defer to God's will. May the deceased rest in peace soon." Some high-ranking officials and politicians on Taiwan Island began issuing strong statements of condemnation on 2 April following the incident. Using such phrases as "utter disregard for human life" and "bandits," they launched vicious attacks and turned the incident into a political affair. On 12 April, Taiwan's "Mainland Affairs Council" made the following announcement: "As of today, cross-strait cultural and educational exchanges will be suspended temporarily" and "As of 1 May, mainland-bound tours by local people will be discontinued." Forces for Taiwan independence also seized on the opportunity to raise a hue and cry, and to provoke the call for "Taiwan independence." The Taiwan authorities' actions cast a shadow over cross-strait relations and exchanges, and attracted attention at home and abroad. On 12 April, ARATS Executive Vice President Tang Shubei met with SEF Deputy Secretary General Shi Qiping [Shih Chi-ping] in Beijing, during which the former briefed the latter on how mainland central and local authorities took the incident seriously and how they managed it as best they could. He reiterated: The mainland guarantees Taiwan compatriots' safety, both in terms of their lives and property. State laws offer equal protection to both Taiwan and mainland compatriots. The Qiandao Lake incident cannot and should not affect the development of cross-strait relations. More important, we should not "politicize" the incident and allow it to worsen cross-strait relations which have been built up with great difficulty. II. The investigation was greatly hampered by the fact that all passengers and crew members aboard the "Hairui" tour boat had been killed and that there were no eyewitnesses at the time of the incident. Faced with this complicated and major case, public security officers and experts showed a strong sense of responsibility toward the people, and commenced a methodical and intensive investigation. Yu Zhangchun, a 30-year-old deputy director of the Chunan County Public Security Bureau, was the first public security officer to arrive on the scene. Prevented from approaching the tour boat by the firefighting operation, he led four public security motorboats to search the surrounding waters and obtained several leads with which they could judge the approximate time and place of the incident. The sketch showing the "Hairui's" route before and after the incident, compiled by the county public security bureau on 2 April, was confirmed by the testimony provided by the criminals after the incident. Ding Hong, head of the Hangzhou City Public Security Bureau forensic office, rushed to the scene at 2300 [1500 GMT] on 1 April. The lower cabin was submerged in 50 centimeters of water; bodies were floating or submerged in the water. To find out whether all 32 people on the boat were dead, Ding Hong and three other officers entered the lower cabin, which covered an area of just 17.1 square meters and was 1.5 meters high, to survey the area with flashlights. They worked until 0400 [2000 GMT] the next morning. When the bodies were removed the next day, they squatted down in the cabin and assigned numbers to, photographed, and videotaped the bodies. The smell in the cabin was suffocating. The four men, who sweated profusely, removed the bodies with their bare hands after their rubber gloves were damaged. From 1200 [0400 GMT] to 1700 [0900 GMT], they removed all 32 bodies from the lower cabin. On the evening of 2 April, 14 forensic experts sent by the Hangzhou City Public Security Bureau carefully examined the bodies. Trace analysts collected 36 bags of "charred ashes" from the cabin, washed them, and conducted a careful technical appraisal of the screened substances. Before long, the forensic experts prepared a report on the general status of the bodies. The autopsy report concluded that the victims were still alive before they entered the lower cabin, and that their deaths were caused by suffocation and burning. Firefighting experts confirmed that the fire was started at the entrance to the lower cabin, and that gasoline was added to the flames. Shipping experts excluded the possibility of the fire being caused by latent defects on the boat and its equipment. During the survey, trace analysts found that the iron ladder at the entrance to the lower cabin was defective. They also found a gasoline canister in the center of the spot where the fire was started. Round dents caused by shots from hunting rifles were also found on the steel plate above the entrance to the lower cabin. There were traces of an explosion on the oil tank in the cabin. Criminologists analyzed that people on the boat were most likely forced into the cabin under the threat of violence and were burned to death afterward. Public security organs confirmed that the incident was a premeditated, well-prepared robbery and murder case of exceptional proportions, and they formally put the case on file for investigation. [passage omitted on how police officers devoted themselves to solving the case] The leads in the investigation gradually pointed to Wu Lihong, who operated a motorboat service without a license. On the day of the incident, Wu Lihong bought three gasoline canisters, one of which was never returned. The specifications of the missing canister were the same as those of the one found on the "Hairui." Prior to the incident, Wu Lihong had bought civilian-use explosives and hunting rifle bullets and had lent hunting rifles to other people. An eyewitness saw Wu Lihong driving two other men to the lake on a motorboat on the afternoon of 31 March. Last year, Wu Lihong borrowed 60,000 yuan to buy a high-horsepower motorboat, and the debt will become due this month. According to an informant, Wu Lihong had his hair cut on the morning of 1 April, and burn mark traces were found on his eyebrows and on the hair covering his forehead. After the incident, he said he would mortgage his motorboat for just 30,000 yuan....[ellipses as received] Public security officers immediately launched an investigation into Wu Lihong's family life, lifestyle, his friends and activities, learning quickly about some suspicious activities of two of Wu's close friends, Hu Zhihan and Yu Aijun. Afterward, public security organs resolutely decided to summon the suspects immediately. Yu Aijun and Wu Lihong were summoned on the afternoon and evening of 15 April. Hu Zhihan was called in the next day. The three criminals bowed their heads in the face of conclusive evidence. During the small hours of 17 April, the three gave an account of the entire incident and explained their motives. The details of their story completely matched the information collected during the on-site survey. According to information provided by the three criminals, the police went to the place where they had stashed their stolen goods to recover the booty, which included camcorders, cameras, U.S. dollars, new Taiwan dollars, renminbi, Hong Kong dollars, wristwatches, rings, jade bracelets, and necklaces. They also seized the motorboat, hunting rifles, bullets, and leftover explosives which the criminals had used to commit the crime. On 20 April, Wu Lihong, Hu Zhihan, and Yu Aijun were apprehended in accordance with the law. On 3 June, the Hangzhou City People's Procuratorate filed a public indictment in the Hangzhou City Intermediate People's Court regarding the robbery and murder case on Qiandao Lake. After public security organs proclaimed the case solved, ARATS promptly notified the SEF and briefed the latter on the case on several occasions. Speaking on 18 April, Li Peng, premier of the State Council, said: The exceptional robbery and murder case on Qiandao Lake has been solved, and the criminals have been arrested. They will be dealt with strictly according to legal procedures. Most Taiwan compatriots were relieved to hear his words. Some people in the Taiwan government, however, continued to spread rumors and falsely accused the mainland of "covering up the truth," as they attempted to mislead public opinion at home and abroad. To safeguard cross-strait relations, and to inform more people concerned about the case, especially Taiwan compatriots, ARATS sent three letters to the SEF in which it invited SEF officials and experts to come to Hangzhou for briefings by experts in charge of the case on condition that the judicial proceedings not be affected. On 8 May, SEF Deputy Secretary General Xu Huiyou [Hsu Hui-yu] led six analysts, criminologists, and forensic experts, some lawyers, and seven bereaved family members on a visit to Hangzhou. [passage omitted on briefings by ARATS officials to the delegation] III. On 10 June, the Hangzhou City Intermediate People's Court held an open trial of the robbery and murder case on Qiandao Lake. [passage omitted on details of the crime provided by the defendants in court] Justice has a long arm. The three criminals were sentenced to death and executed in accordance with the law. The compatriots from both sides of the Taiwan strait who were killed in the incident can now close their eyes in death. The relevant insurance company has made preparations for compensation for the Taiwan compatriots killed in the incident, and it is handling the case in accordance with relevant provisions. The handling of matters arising in the aftermath of the incident, the swift solution of this largest criminal case involving Taiwan compatriots since the two sides of the Taiwan Strait initiated exchanges, and the punishment of the criminals in accordance with the law, demonstrate that the state sets great store by people's legitimate rights and interests, and has made every effort to improve its legal system and safeguard people's lives and property. Judging by the rumors flying around the Qiandao Lake incident, however, people on the two sides of the Taiwan strait perceive and deal with certain issues differently because of their long-term separation and different social systems. Different perceptions and methods of dealing with matters have inevitably given rise to misunderstandings. Farsighted people on both sides of the Taiwan strait maintain that the two sides should expand exchanges and improve communication to achieve a better understanding of each other in an even shorter period of time. In dealing with concrete matters involving both sides of the Taiwan strait, we must consider the general interest of cross-strait relations, and confront and solve problems by adopting the attitude of safeguarding the fundamental interests of people on both sides of the Taiwan strait, being realistic and objective, and seeking truth from facts. We should prevent people from making a fuss over something in an attempt to undermine cross-strait relations. After learning of the truth, some Taiwan newspapers noted: "The Qiandao Lake incident, however complicated, is after all a criminal case. It would be a serious mistake to dismiss Mainland China's current social values or even the blood ties binding all of China together." It should be noted that some people in the Taiwan government and a handful of Taiwan independence elements are still nonsensically characterizing the incident as an "unsolved case," although the truth of the Qiandao Lake incident has been brought to light and the criminals have been executed. It seems a few people are still trying to exploit this unfortunate incident to obstruct and undermine cross-strait relations. Such an attempt will eventually prove fruitless. The Qiandao Lake incident was an accident and its adverse effects will be temporary. Closer cross-strait relations are an inevitable and general trend. History will corroborate this point.
