IEC chairman Judge Johann Kriegler and vice-chairman Dikgang Moseneke said yesterday the ANC's lawyers had asked that the application be "put on ice" after earlier serving papers on the IEC's Special Electoral Court. The ANC has until the dismantling of the IEC at the end of next month to reopen the matter, if it so chooses. Kriegler declared the elections substantially free and fair in the face of an ANC request that the results in Natal/KwaZulu be declared null and void after widespread claims of voting irregularities in the area. IEC sources indicated that the ANC's application would have little chance of success.
