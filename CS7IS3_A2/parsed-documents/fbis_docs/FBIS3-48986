[Melescanu] Indeed, the meeting in Washington was scheduled to take place in the month of October and in his letter of invitation Mr. Warren Christopher said that we were going to see each other to celebrate, together, the granting of the most-favored-nation status and to discuss tangible ways and means for cooperation whereby Romania could benefit; this, actually, meant returning to normal relations of partnership with the United States of America. Due to Mr. Christopher's schedule, this visit was postponed all the time, and thus the events happened to which you referred; to this we may also add certain reactions by the American public to domestic actions. Unfortunately, there were things that modified the framework initially established for this official visit. I do not want to conceal the fact that great attention was paid there to the unveiling of the statue of Marshal Antonescu in Slobozia, which was viewed as a certain escalation of ultranationalist political positions... It was obvious to me that there is concern for developments in Romania; this is proven by the particular impact this unveiling had on groups of Jewish people in the United States. I tried to explain that the government was not involved in this event. I have said and I want to repeat that Marshal Antonescu is a very controversial figure; there are still numerous facets that have not been clarified. He is perceived by Jewish organizations as Hitler's man, who caused the death of Jews in Romania. By other segments of society, however, he is perceived as the man who reclaimed Romanian territories and who recovered our national integrity. And he is also perceived as a victim of the communist regime. In the United States, however, this is viewed as an extremist nationalist event that proves that the image we enjoy here, at home, is different from our image across the ocean. [Terenche] But you still returned very optimistic... [Melescanu] We discussed two big problems. One is linked to the question of bilateral relations within the framework of which we noted signs of entering a new and different stage of Romanian-U.S. relations. Second, we conducted lengthy discussions on the consequences of the developments to which you referred and on the possible orientations of our government. [Terenche] What does this mean in concrete terms? [Melescanu] Concretely speaking, it means a firmer involvement of ours in efforts that are being made, on the one hand, to stabilize this area and support democratic developments in all countries, including the countries of the former USSR. On the other hand, it means achieving, at the domestic level, a broad political base of a center leaning that will permit the continuation and speeding up of the economic reform program. The Americans insist very much on broad support for the population in the reform process. Consequently, in their view this process has to take place under such conditions as will ensure support for the political forces at all levels. It is clear-cut that the United States of America has opened a door for Romania and that on its threshold stands a friend. And it depends solely on us to capitalize on the possibilities we are offered. Thus, a fund of $50 million was set up in support of the development of private enterprises in Romania. It is not a big fund, but rather a symbolic one; its merit, however, is to encourage investors. For, the moment the American state participates with 10 percent in an investment, this will surely attract private investors. Thus, the multiplying effect is greater. The second part of the visit refers to the support the United States guarantees for us to preserve Romania's stability and security, and even territorial integrity. I am not talking of formal, judicial guarantees. We are now in a different stage, one in which no treaties of mutual assistance are concluded as we used to do formerly. I am talking of a very clear-cut involvement of the U.S. Administration in what we would term Romania's security and stability, because this is a question that interests the United States. [Terenche] Is this where the "Partnership for Peace" relationship comes in? [Melescanu] Mr. Warren Christopher told us that their political concept that is now being applied in the "new democracies" is incorporated from the point of view of security into the concept "Partnership for Peace," which they view as a transition stage in relations with NATO. This means that the immediate admission to the Alliance, as those working at the Pentagon said more directly, is not possible from a technical point of view. Similarly, NATO's expansion should not take place in a fashion that would give the Russians the impression that it is directed against them. We were told very clearly both at the State Department, the Pentagon, and the National Security Council that we will be included in the program, that we will even conduct some consultations on concrete ways and means of applying the concept of "Partnership for Peace," which also implies tangible obligations. Military obligations of cooperation, and so forth. [Terenche] Nevertheless, what is the explanation of the fact that Romania is constantly eschewed by U.S. officials? [Melescanu] A position toward Romania is valid. Therefore, I believe it is necessary to conduct a dialogue at the summit level and I mentioned the possibility of a meeting in Prague. Or an official visit, for which purpose I extended an invitation to President Clinton to visit Romania. The excuse was a full program and I am convinced that it was not a circumstantial problem. We have overcome the stage in which political dialogue at the summit level was a question of reservations by the other side... [Terenche] How did the Americans react to the election results in the Russian Federation? [Melescanu] I arrived there when things had begun to calm down. I said that not the result, but the percentage surprised us. Obviously, in Russia there is very broad support for tackling the reform other than in a democratic way. The conclusion I drew was that an alarm signal has been sounded and this should make the Americans pay greater attention to the support granted to Russia and the East European countries. [Terenche] What was the reaction to the death sentence pronounced in the Ilie Ilascu case? [Melescanu] The entire Romanian community in the United States rallied and energetically supported the Ilascu case. They took steps and put pressure on the U.S. Administration. [Terenche] And what was the result? [Melescanu] The result is a very serious involvement of the Administration. We have already received serious signals in this respect from Moscow. In the United States it is very important when an ethnic community rallies and demands something from the Administration. For ourselves, however, that is for relations with Russia this has, unfortunately, had a negative effect. The postponement of the visit by Defense Minister Grachev is a signal in this respect. And such signals have become increasingly numerous: For example, the postponement of the meeting on the treasury or the consultations on the treaty... I personally do not think that we are guilty of anything, because what happened in Tiraspol was shocking for the public, irrespective of political leaning. People were shocked and said so. But this created a negative moment in Romanian-Russian relations as far as economic integration is concerned. It is important for us to relaunch bilateral relations with our neighbors: With Bulgaria, Ukraine, and, of course, with the Russian Federation. Such moments affect us. They have a much more centralized system than we, where every economic element has a political effect. [Terenche] You also hold the position of minister state secretary, that is a sort of deputy prime minister. What are you doing in this capacity? [Melescanu] A sort of... is well put. We have the feeling, somehow, that we could do more to brief and ensure the access of parliamentarians and politicians to the foreign policy elements such as the European conventions. [Terenche] But here we can also mention the way in which one can violate the freedom of citizens to travel, a right enshrined in the European conventions, which are so little known by our authorities... I am referring to the refusal of granting a visa to His Majesty King Mihai to visit the country on 1 December. [Melescanu] There are two aspects: First, there is the formal one, meaning the need to clearly settle procedures. Irrespective of what will happen, of how we will develop politically, we have to try to solve the problem of the monarchy in its entirety. I want you to understand me: It is not the visa that presents a problem, but the political decision on the king's participation in some of the events in the country. I understand that there was an opening at Christmas, but there was no answer. I am not talking about the fact that we are a republic; that is clear and stipulated in the constitution. [Terenche] But nothing is nailed... [Melescanu] Of course. But I do not understand why we do not see the good side of things in this respect. A major part of the Romanians, who left the country after the war, did not do so because they had it too good. If we start from the idea that now we need the support of Romanians everywhere, I do not see why we should not consider the possibility of using the royal institution. Especially since reference was made to abiding by the constitution. This is why we are the advocates of solving this problem in its entirety. We need the support of numerous capitals through contacts. [Terenche] Including through royal houses... [Melescanu] Why not? If they can help us! Our situation is such that we need any help available. At the domestic political level, I do not think that we have an overproduction of capable people, so that we do not know what to do with them. Therefore, we cannot ask anyone to change his opinions and friendships. Thus, both at the domestic level and the foreign one, we have to rally our efforts in order to implement our basic objectives. For, misery is no political capital. [Terenche] Were these arguments insufficient when needed? [Melescanu] You have to know that each one tried to present his point of view as best as he could. Finally, however, a conclusion is formed on the basis of all opinions, and thus we cannot always win. I, however, have the impression that there are developments on both sides, although there are irreconcilable positions. There is the basic problem of the abdication act and that of elections on the basis of which the constitution was adopted. But even if each one continues to have the same position, one can seek ways and means to cooperate, which is the most important thing. [Terenche] Mr. Minister, how did you react, first as a private person and then as an official person, to the idea promoted by Mr. Adrian Nastase that the minister of foreign affairs should be involved in the political, party activity? [Melescanu] I think that it is a correct and principled position, which is being supported by numerous politicians in Romania. It is a correct solution in the sense of the political responsibility of ministers when governing. I think that this is a normal thing in a democratic society. The only question in our country at this point is to what extent our society is sufficiently structured for the application of these principles. In actual fact, I and the other ministers, who are "non-party members" are involved in the government program in which we participate. I cannot say that I am a minister who enjoys full freedom of movement, but I am a minister within a PDSR [Socialist Democracy Party of Romania] government. Since, however, I am not fully involved, this situation offers me certain advantages in the sense of getting broader support. If I had a certain political color, a dialogue could be refused at a certain point, although this refusal would not have anything to do with my activity...
