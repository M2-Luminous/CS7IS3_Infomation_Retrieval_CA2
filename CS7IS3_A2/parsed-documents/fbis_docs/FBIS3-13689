The agreement came after hours of closed-door talks here between Sudanese President 'Umar al-Bashir and the presidents of Kenya, Ethiopia and Uganda, who also met leaders of two rival factions of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA). "The government of Sudan and the SPLA factions have stated their readiness to immediately embark on peace negotiations," Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi said. The six-nation regional organisation, the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development (IGADD), has named Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda and Eritrea to spearhead a new initiative to bring peace to famine-hit Sudan. The agreement stopped short of declaring a ceasefire in southern Sudan, where the government has taken advantage of tribal divisions in the SPLA to launch a new offensive aimed at crushing the southern rebellion. But the IGADD presidents said in a press statement that the warring parties had agreed to "desist from esclating hostilities ... in order to create a conducive atmosphere for the negotiations." "The root causes of the conflict are so complex that previous peace conference have failed to arrive at a peaceful solution," Moi told his fellow heads of state and rebel leaders in a brief open session after the meetings. "We must be prepared to give peace a chance," Moi said, stressing that Africans had to play a more active role in solving their problems instead of waiting for outside initiatives. He said the forthcoming negotiations would try to reach "a comprehensive negotiated settlement and urged all sides to allow relief supplies into southern Sudan, where millions depend on food aid.
