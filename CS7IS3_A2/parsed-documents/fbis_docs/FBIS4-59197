The diplomats said the imminent lifting of the siege on al-'Aqabah would open the door for Jordan's resumption of its "important" role in the peace process and would allow for its participation in the next round of bilateral peace talks expected to begin in Washington next month. The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Jordan has agreed to pay the estimated $2 to 3 million annual fees for the non-profit Lloyds Register but the United States is insisting that the payments be made through the United Nations so that Jordan "will not be able to influence the organisation." They said Washington was also insisting that Lloyds Register establish a direct link with the U.N. Sanctions Committee in order to supervise exports to Iraq that are permitted by the trade embargo on Baghdad. Among other "minor technicalities" still under negotiations between Jordan and the U.S. and other members of the multilateral interdiction forces enforcing the naval blockade on al-'Aqabah is a mechanism through which member countries of the force will be able to inspect Lloyds Register's operations, the sources told the JORDAN TIMES. Though no Security Council resolution is needed to change the mechanism through which al-'Aqabah-bound shipping is being checked under Security Council Resolution 665, the diplomats said consultations among member states of the council are required, adding that these consultations are underway already in New York. The U.S. on Sunday reportedly communicated to Jordan its formal acceptance of the Kingdom's proposal to replace the sea-inspection with land-based verifications through a letter sent by Secretary of State Warren Christopher. The U.S. decision came few days after France decided to pull out from the force enforcing the blockade on al-'Aqabah and Canada reportedly rejected an American request that Canadians replace the French in this task. The Western diplomats said France saw no reason for the continuation of the sea-inspection operations since the Jordanian proposal provided a fitting alternative and found no justification for Washington's procrastination in implementing the proposal which was made by the Kingdom in January. Jordan had earlier linked its participation in the peace talks with the lifting of the siege on al-'Aqabah which many officials described as pressure on Jordan to force it into entering a separate peace accord with Israel. Informed sources say the U.S. Congress, which "has not yet forgiven" the Kingdom for its opposition to the Gulf war coalition that drove Iraq out of Kuwait in 1991 and some U.S. security agencies which "do not trust Jordan" have been behind the delay in lifting the siege on al-'Aqabah. Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani confirmed Tuesday that the Jordanian government has received confirmation from the concerned American authorities that Washington had approved the Jordanian proposal. He said the next steps were to reach a final agreement with Lloyds Register to determined the methods of observing cargo entering al-'Aqabah. This might be achieved within the coming three weeks, he said. Dr al-'Anani said that the representative of Lloyds Register would not be inspecting ships, but will be monitoring incoming cargo when they are opened at the port to make sure that they conform to the cargo manifests.
