"The world community, which has for decades been persistently striving for a restoration of racial and social justice in the RSA, today notes that this goal has been achieved. For its part, Russia, which has invariably supported all the constructive efforts of the South African Government, parties, and public organizations along the path of democratic transformations, shares with everyone a feeling of deep satisfaction at the results of these efforts. "We believe that favorable prospects are opening up for the harmonious economic and social development of the peoples of South Africa. Much will depend on the readiness of all the country's political forces for constructive interaction similar to what they have shown during the period of preparations for the elections. "Russia expresses its readiness to cooperate with the new democratic South Africa and hopes that the good relations that have been formed between our countries and peoples will in the coming period be further developed in the interests of universal peace and prosperity."
