The NP wants its own men in the new Cabinet in the places of Alfred Nzo and former Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC military wing] commander Joe Modise, who were appointed to those Ministries by the ANC on Friday [6 May]. THE STAR's sources said De Klerk wanted to retain both Pik Botha and Kobie Coetsee in two of the most powerful positions in the Cabinet. A confrontation between the outgoing and future governments is expected over the posts. However, ANC spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said as far as his organisation was concerned, the Cabinet issue had not reached finality and Cabinet positions would, in the spirit of the government of national unity and reconstruction, be negotiated with the NP, the Inkatha Freedom Party and other political players. NP sources told THE STAR that Roelf Meyer, the Government's chief negotiator in the multiparty negotiations would retain his Constitutional Development Ministry. The other four NP men tipped to fill Cabinet seats are Public Enterprise Minister Dawie de Villiers and Leon Wessels, the current Minister of Manpower. Derek Keys would retain his finance portfolio, so would Abe Williams retain sports. In the three NP Deputy Ministers' posts, De Klerk is said to be willing to reward some up and coming black, coloured and white politicians. The posts could either go to David Chuenyane, who was the highest black on the party election list; Sheila Camerer, outgoing Deputy Minister of Justice; Chris Fismer, a Deputy Minister in the State President's office, Jac Rabie, former Minister of Population Development and Bhadra Ranchod, the current Minister of Tourism. The Inkatha Freedom party's three seats would be filled by Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Joe Matthews and Dr. Ben Ngubane, THE STAR learnt last night. [passage omitted]
