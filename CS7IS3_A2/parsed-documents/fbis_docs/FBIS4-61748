ITAR-TASS learned today at the press service of the military collegium of the Russian Federation Supreme Court that Judge Viktor Yaskin has closed this criminal case. It has not been closed only in the case of Valentin Varennikov, who has refused the amnesty announced by the State Duma. The SCSE case has initially been dropped in connection with the amnesty, however this decision was later contested by the office of the Procurator General on the basis that any criminal case must proceed to the end. The appeal was accepted by the collegium of the Supreme court and the SCSE case was sent back for a new trial. However, in this instance it did not come under the same article of the criminal code, on the basis of which the procuracy had launched its protest. Therefore, having studied the SCSE case, Judge Yaskin has stopped the proceedings. Although this decision does not involve Varennikov, it is not yet clear whether he will have to stand trial. At any rate, the military collegium of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation has not taken any decision yet with regard to this matter.
