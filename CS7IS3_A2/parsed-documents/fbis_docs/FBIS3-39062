They were the first to reach for their weapons. Their artillery pounds the city virtually every day. Scarcely a day goes by without more victims falling because of the civil war. But every time a shot hits home, and the international community is forced to make a move, these same Serb leaders scream their innocence like the murdered victims and point to the Muslims as the guilty ones. Then mention is once again made of the "fundamentalism" that from time to time scores a direct hit against its own side in order to keep international sympathy for its cause warm. Nobody can rule out with 100 percent certainty that there is not some Muslim commander who is tempted to work out such a devilishly Machiavellian plan, but if Radovan Karadzic and the other Serb leaders want to be absolved once and for all of all blame and "unjust accusations," then there is a simple solution open to them: They can withdraw their heavy artillery from around the city. Then the international community can translate its cries of indignation into deeds: It can reinforce the UN troops on the ground so that they can supervise a demilitarized zone around the city in order to prevent the "balance" between these Serbs and the Bosnian Government Army from being broken up too suddenly. If that were to happen there, or on other fronts, it would lead to fresh outbreaks of violence. The rescue of Sarajevo -- even if it is a temporary and local solution -- could give new impetus to peace talks for all of Bosnia-Herzegovina, but anyone who believes that the Bosnian Serbs will give up their siege without a struggle must still believe in Santa Claus. All the parties in the Yugoslav conflict still place their exclusive trust in the power derived from weapons. For this reason, there was a great deal to be said for the French proposal to put an ultimatum to the guilty parties in this and other concrete cases. That is a step toward escalation, and the people who take such action should be well aware of the dangers it entails. However there is an awfully great chance that the Bosnian parties will themselves initiate this escalation, and will do so directly at a higher and just as dangerous a level -- at least internationally. So far the international community has been piling one blunder on top of another. Or better put: Time after time it has missed the boat when opportunities to have a positive influence on the conflict presented themselves. That was already the case before the weapons started doing the talking in Slovenia and Croatia, and before the situation in Bosnia turned into war. Since the outside world does not seem capable of following a sufficiently preventative policy, it will be forced -- sooner or later -- to reach for military threats. That is the price of the present comfort and detachment. The stronger Russian nationalism grows, the weaker becomes the West's grip on the Serbs. And this is happening at a time when in other places in the Balkans new conflicts could break out at any time which would immediately plunge the entire region into flames.
