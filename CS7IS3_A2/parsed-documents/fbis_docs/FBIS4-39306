Assessing its results, Doctor of Historical Sciences General Dmitriy Volkogonov, the commission chairman, noted at the traditional news conference that their more than two years of work had been in the nature of a multilateral international humanitarian act. The two-year investigation may not have brought any sensations, but it has nonetheless revealed many secrets. After World War II there were more than 20,000 U.S. citizens on Soviet territory who had been released from German imprisonment by Soviet troops. The overwhelming majority of them were repatriated. Several people died in transit camps and, admittedly, not all the graves have been located. The Americans are doggedly searching for them with our help. Checks on one eyewitness led the commission members in a new direction. At issue is a camp for U.S. POW's built by the Japanese in the South Kuril Chain. According to locals, during World War II it held between 500 and 12,000 Americans. Neither the Russian nor the U.S. researchers as yet have any documentation to confirm this. But their joint expedition to Iturup Island revealed traces of a POW camp. Who was held there is a mystery. Another "black spot" from World War II was the Tashkent camp for interned U.S. pilots. The researchers have no doubts about its existence. But not a single document about the camp has yet been found in a single Russian archive -- including Defense Ministry, state security, MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], and CPSU archives. The search for documents about the Tashkent camp unexpectedly led researchers to the previously unknown episode of the transportation in the winter of 1941 of, according to archive materials, several dozen "British and French internees." Just who they were -- whether it was just British and French and what happened to them -- is as yet unknown. The commission members are concerned about the fact that the unknown convoy repeated the route taken by the Polish officer POW's (ending at the Kozelsk camp) who were shot in 1940. Once all the formalities in declassifying the list of the "Kozelsk convoy" have been carried out, it will be passed to the Americans. The Russo-U.S. commission is interested in any information on an incident that took place over the Barents Sea 1 July 1960. Soviet fighters shot down a U.S. aircraft that had violated the state border. Two U.S. pilots survived and two died. The survivors and one dead body were handed over to the U.S. authorities. It is not known where the other American is buried -- his grave is being sought. The Americans have been given documentary information on the areas where around 500 U.S. aircraft shot down by Soviet pilots or air defense troops came down. Records of the interrogations of more than 50 U.S. pilots involving the Soviet special services have also been passed on.... The "Vietnam document" on 1,205 U.S. POW's originally obtained through Soviet foreign intelligence channels and handed over to the U.S. researchers last year continues to exercise public opinion. The commission members are disinclined to discuss whether the figures cited in it are realistic, but they are confident of the document's authenticity. The plenary session of the commission naturally discussed Russian citizens missing abroad. According to Gen. Volkogonov's figures, there have been 106 local wars and armed conflicts since World War II. And at the will of the state Soviet citizens participated in almost every clash. The list of MIA's in these wars includes thousands of Russian names. Clearly, the Americans had prepared carefully in advance of this discussion. Because the gift they presented to the Russian side was truly a gift from the gods -- the so-called "Klaus dossier," a document that had until recently been a complete secret not only to our researchers but to the Americans as well. It is claimed that U.S. State Department staffer Klaus was the only man privy to all the U.S. intelligence reports on conflicts involving Soviet citizens. Moreover, the "Klaus dossier" contained information from other confidential sources as well. Familiarization with this material may be the key to revealing what happened to thousands of our fellow countrymen lost without trace during various conflicts.
