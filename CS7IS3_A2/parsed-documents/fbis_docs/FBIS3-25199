Mr. Marais said the leaders of the Volksfront had no mandate from the Afrikaner people to negotiate with the National Party and the ANC [African National Congress]-SACP [South African Communist Party] alliance. He said that as soon as the AVF withdrew from the negotiations, right-wing leaders could embark on a national campaign to inform the volk [Afrikaner nation] of why they were refusing to participate in the election.
