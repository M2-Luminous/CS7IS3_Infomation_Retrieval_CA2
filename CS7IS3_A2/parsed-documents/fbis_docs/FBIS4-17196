Vyacheslav Kostikov told a news briefing in Moscow on Thursday that President Boris Yeltsin insisted that highest-level consultations on the Yugoslav issue between Russia, the United States, the European Union and the United Nations take no more than one month, developments in the embattled Balkan country being too fast. Kostikov denied media reports that the latest events in Bosnia's Gorazde area had made Russia change its position. Moscow still wants a nonviolent settlement, he said. Russia is taking no sides in the conflict, the spokesman said. Yeltsin thinks not all nonviolent means have as yet been tried, Kostikov said. He said he had had a meeting with Yeltsin before the briefing, at which the president repeated his objection to air strikes against Bosnian Serb forces. Kostikov denied that a rift had appeared between Russia and America. "There are undoubtedly natural contradictions between states in their national interests, in economics and politics, but Boris Yeltsin believes the main principle underlying the policies of the two countries, namely their intention to develop cooperation and strengthen the path of democratic development has not been changed," he said. He quoted Yeltsin as saying that attempts to "drive a wedge between Russia and the United States and between him and President Bill Clinton are doomed to failure."
