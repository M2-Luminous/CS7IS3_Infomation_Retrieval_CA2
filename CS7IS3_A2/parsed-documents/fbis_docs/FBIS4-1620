R. Wilkie] [Text] Imagine a world where all outsiders are enemies; where not even your closest colleagues are above suspicion, where all telephone calls are assumed to be bugged; where even trivial internal documents must be burnt in the presence of witnesses. Living with suspicion is the fate of many who work for intelligence organisations all over the world. China too has specialist organisations which carry out intelligence and counter-intelligence operations, the most important of which is the Ministry of State Security. But the police, even down to the lowly beat officer, also live in a John Le Carre world of spy-counter-spy. Skim the pages of the POLICE OFFICE WORK HANDBOOK, published for internal circulation only by the Police Officers Education Publishing House. The handbook opens with some general words of warning for police officers meeting foreign visitors. "Be friendly, warm and polite, at the same time raise vigilance and act according to the principle of `treating insiders and outsiders differently' in order to protect against any attempt to gather intelligence." Much of the handbook deals with practical hints, such as how to deal with superior officers on the telephone (never hang up first) and how to handle the messy paperwork required to send a detainee to a labour camp. But at least 20 pages are devoted to secrecy. Police officers are instructed "never to sell secret documents to scrap paper merchants, never use them as wrapping paper, and never use them as wallpaper". Secret documents must never be sent through the mail or carried when shopping or visiting restaurants. Even after secret documents have passed their expiry date, the information in them remains secret. If the documents are clogging up the shelves, permission must be sought to burn them, but only in the presence of two police officers. What are these secrets that must be so fiercely protected? Some have to do with arrangements for the protection of top leaders or visiting dignitaries. But political dissent and the fight against it is at the top of the list. "Anything that creates difficulties for quelling or handling riots, chaos, disturbances, protests and sudden incidents" is a state secret. Top secret -- to be kept under wraps for at least 30 years -- includes "information held by the police on spying, rebellions, hijackings, plots, treachery, intelligence about serious cases of smuggling, investigations or charges against the police, details of surveillance operations, investigations and plans to solve crimes, plans for cracking down, and any knowledge that if it became known might cause serious losses to the unity of the country, political stability, the unity of nationalities, foreign relations and economic interests". Statistics concerning "counter-revolutionary incidents" are considered "highly confidential". Officially, they should be kept secret for at least 20 years, as should "plans for quelling or dealing with local protests, disturbances and other sudden incidents which have a big impact on social order". "Captured reactionary leaflets" are state secrets, and so are information about police who break the law and "political accidents". Inexplicably, the number of overseas Chinese permanently resident in China is also a state secret. There are other categories of secret that are so secret they cannot be named in a handbook that is only semi-secret, such as any sensitive information about leaders and their families. Documents which contain secrets must be printed only by approved specialist printers who have been vetted. If this is not possible, the printing must take place in a workshop which stands on its own and where privacy is guaranteed. The number of copies cannot exceed the number ordered, and any spoiled copies or scraps of waste must be carefully destroyed. When there is to be a meeting at which secrets may be discussed, all arrangements "from decorating the room to purchasing necessary items to the preparation of the teapot and cups" must be made by police officers. Such meetings must never be held in hotels which receive foreign guests. After the meeting, a search of the room must be carried out to make sure no state secrets have been slipped between the cushions or been idly doodled on the table top. The reason for this obsession with secets, the handbook explains, is that just about everybody is out to get them. "With increased reform and opening to the world, there are more routes for exchanges with the world on wider subjects. Foreign intelligence organisations and other personnel from abroad are trying every other way to gather intelligence. In the past few years, the central government's secret documents have been copied by people at foreign organisations stationed in China... People come to China in all sorts of guises, including businessmen, journalists, academics, to do spying... There are also some people in China who have ulterior motives and sell the top secrets of the party and government." Spies, the handbook explains, try to intercept police information as it is communicated internally, in particular by listening in on telephone calls. Deleted material can be salvaged from computer disks. Fax machines and computer modems can be easily bugged with simple equipment. Imported fax machines and computers, the handbook warns, should be treated with particular care, since bugs may have been planted in them at the time of manufacture. Any imported electronic equipment must therefore be inspected for security before it can be installed. There is no doubt that China, like all countries, is spied on by foreign governments. But Beijing's concern about espionage seems unusually intense and wide-ranging. The only hard evidence for foreign intelligence gathering cited in the handbook is the publication abroad of excerpts from Chinese newspapers and magazines and transcripts of radio broadcasts, all or most of which are already openly available. Perhaps the greatest worry for the police are the highly organised and well-funded dissident groups now active in China. Rightly or wrongly, the authorities believe these dissident groups are supported and encouraged by prodemocracy groups abroad. Increasingly, modern dissidents carry beepers and use fax machines, spreading the word electronically. Nor can the police force be fully confident of everyone in its own ranks. Dissidents say that while the police have infiltrated their organisations, they, in return, have also infiltrated the police. Dissent is a crime, so the police -- like almost everything else -- has become politicised. And the price to be paid for engaging in politics in China is paranoia.
