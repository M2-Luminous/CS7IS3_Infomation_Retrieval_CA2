Among the participants were Lei Jieqiong, vice-chairwoman of the Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress, Huang Hua, president of the China Society for People's Friendship Studies, Canadian Ambassador to China Fred Bild and members of the Endicott family. Dr. Endicott was born into a missionary family in Leshan city, in China's Sichuan Province, in December 1898, and died in Toronto, Canada, in November 1993. The Chinese People's Association for Friendship With Foreign Countries (CPAFFC) in August last year conferred on him the honorific title of "friendship ambassador," together with a certificate. In accordance with his last wishes, Mrs. Endicott and his children brought his ashes to spread on the river that flows by Leshan, his "second homeland". In his speech, Huang Hua described Dr. Endicott as a foreign friend who sympathized with and supported the Chinese people in their just struggle. "Dr. Endicott devoted his entire life, energy and wisdom to the Chinese people's revolution and national development, to friendship between the Chinese and Canadian peoples and to world peace," Huang said, adding that Endicott made significant contributions in all these endeavors. Recalling the century-old friendly ties the Endicotts have with China, CPAFFC Vice-President Xu Qun expressed the hope that there will be more and more friends who will, just as Dr. Endicott did, concern themselves with the cause of Sino-Canadian friendship and make it more bright. A speech written by Bishop K. H. Ting, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and chairman of the China Christian Council, was delivered for him because he could not be present for health reasons. Dr. James Endicott's son Stephen Endicott and son-in-law William Small also spoke at the seminar. Mrs. Endicott presented to the China National Library via CPAFFC the one-volume edition of "The Canadian Far East Newsletter", edited and published by Dr. Endicott from 1948 to 1992, which reported objectively China's socialist construction and rebutted anti-China allegations in the West.
