Tsai] [Text] Taipei, June 27 (CNA) -- Taiwan's bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, is expected to push up imports of consumer goods to an all-time high, trade sources said Monday [27 Jun]. The sources forecast that imports of consumer products will reach U.S.$11 billion this year, mostly attributable to relaxed tariff restrictions. They said further import-duty reductions are a must if Taiwan expects to gain membership in the Geneva-based world trade regulating body by the end of the year. Taiwan now has observer status with GATT. With lower tariffs, they pointed out, a substantial increase in imports, epecially of consumer products, is almost a certainty. When the government slashed import duties in 1988 and 1992, imports of consumer goods jumped 64.2 percent and 35.7 percent to U.S.$5.68 billion and U.S.$9.27 billion, respectively, they said. Government statistics show that consumer imports totaled U.S.$4.65 billion in the first five months of the year, accounting for 13.6 percent of Taiwan's aggregate imports and an increase of 1.8 percent from the year-earlier level. The officials attributed the growth to the tariff reductions that occurred earlier this year, when import duties on 70 items were cut.
