It has been noted that the less the Main Directorate for Supervision of the Fulfillment of Laws in the Armed Forces (this is what the GVP [Main Military Procuracy] is now called) depends on these Armed Forces in a personnel and financial sense, the more efficient its activity becomes. We asked Lieutenant General of Justice Grigoriy Nosov, first deputy chief of the main directorate, to talk about corruption and the nonfulfillment of laws and regulations in the Armed Forces: [Kholodov] The GVP has been turned into a directorate of the General Procuracy with a long name that includes the phrase "supervision of the fulfillment of laws." It would be interesting to know how you do this, given the existing chaos in the legislative system of the country? [Nosov] Our practical experience has shown that the problem of the fulfillment of laws, to put it mildly, has not been resolved. Military procurators have exposed more than 12,000 violations of legislation. On our protests, about 1,800 illegal orders and other acts of the command authorities were canceled. More than 13,000 officials were made financially liable. But the adoption of a package of military laws was a big step. Previously many aspects of military activity generally were regulated only by orders and directives of the Ministry of Defense. Unfortunately, under existing laws, the procedure for their implementation has not been worked out in many ways. Up to the present time, the subordinate legal acts necessary for this have not been adopted. The situation is unprecedented for us as well: The Military Procuracy is not mentioned at all in the Law on the Procuracy of the Russian Federation. [Kholodov] You are outside the law? [Nosov] We were previously locked into the Union Procuracy. Then the Russian Procuracy took us under its jurisdiction. There is only an outdated 1981 decree on military procurators, and we are compelled each year to confirm our existence with special normative acts of the president and parliament. [Kholodov] Does the Military Procuracy frequently protest the orders of higher military officials? [Nosov] We conduct supervision over the fulfillment of laws, including also by senior officials up to and including the minister of defense and his deputies. In 1993 we protested 27 orders of the minister and his deputies. In 1992 there were 19 such protests. [Kholodov] What kind of laws are most frequently violated by this contingent of servicemen? [Nosov] For example, the order on the promotion of Dmitriy Yakubovskiy to the rank of major of justice. The directive of the commanding general of the Internal Troops of the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] of the Russian Federation that prohibited the allocation of housing to unmarried officers and warrant officers. The instruction of a deputy of the Ministry of Defense that authorized the discharge of officers without granting housing was protested. If we are talking in general about violations of laws in the higher echelons, there are enough of them. There are especially many in the assignment of housing. In the North Caucasus Military District, on the verbal instructions of General Netkachev, the commander of a large unit, apartments were given to his deputies out of turn--to Generals Kulakov and Artemov. [Kholodov] Apartments, of course, are a very important issue for officers. But in the army cases of corruption are treated with extreme sensitivity, especially those among the senior command personnel. Are the military procurators conducting any kind of work in this direction? [Nosov] Many violations in the upper echelons are associated with illegal commercial activity that is forbidden in the army. Just as a result of inspections in the central apparatus of the Ministry of Defense by forces of the main directorate, reimbursement was made for damages in the sum of about 16 billion rubles [R]. Ten criminal cases were instituted. In particular, under Article 260, clause a, of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, with respect to Colonel General of Aviation Pavlov, commander of Aviation of the Ground Troops, and Generals Lukashev and Vorobyev, who are subordinate to him, who committed abuses in the sale of military aviation equipment that resulted in a large financial loss to the state. In the interests of the investigation, I cannot say more. There are many cases of servicemen working in commercial structures, holding staff positions, receiving money. This does not lead to anything good. The military are not businessmen but officials. [Kholodov] We literally receive streams of complaints from officers here at MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS. Do servicemen turn to you? [Nosov] There are many complaints. Last year about 12,000 of them came to the organs of the Procuracy. We check them out, and institute criminal cases in some of them. For example, a criminal case was instituted in January under Article 260, clause a, regarding Major General Baskayev (commander of the Internal Troops of the Moscow District). On Baskayev's instructions, Colonel Trofimov, commander of an Internal Troops subunit, concluded a contract with a certain commercial organization to guard with Internal Troops forces a building that was under construction. This company assumed the obligation of allocating dwelling space in this building to servicemen as payment for the guard duty. It turned out that this company was not the owner of the housing. As a result, housing was not allocated to them. Then servicemen of the Internal Troops blockaded the building. The apartments had already been distributed among civilians. With the employment of special means of the forces of the Internal Troops, the legal owners were evicted from the apartments and servicemen of the Internal Troops and other persons who were absolute outsiders were settled in them. In addition, damage was done to the property of citizens in a sum of more than R272 million, and to an enterprise associated with this building in a sum of R64 million. Proceedings were instituted on the charge of arbitrariness by the commanding general. [Kholodov] Commercialization in the army is terrible in that arsenals are becoming empty. Are a lot of arms stolen in the Russian Armed Forces? [Nosov] In recent years the number of thefts has increased by a factor of 25. While in 1987-1988 a little more than 100 units were stolen, now this is thousands of gunbarrels. All told last year military procurators investigated 317 cases concerning theft of arms and ammunition. [Kholodov] Where is the most stealing? [Nosov] In military units deployed in "hot spots." Most of all in the Group of Russian Troops in the Transcaucasus. On 25 April 1993 there, for example, 44 armored assault vehicles were stolen: About 60 armed militants [Mkhedrioni] broke into the territory of a military unit in Kutaisi. It is interesting that while previously the objects of theft were pistols and rifles, frequently for hunting, now it is grenades and machine guns. Last year two sailors of the Baltic Fleet stole a PZRK [portable SAM] Strela-2. [Kholodov] Indispensable for hunting... [Nosov] They were arrested while attempting to sell it for $40,000. Since September of 1993 a private and a junior sergeant had removed six Igla SAM's from a depot and were selling them to Lithuanian citizens--this also occurred in the Baltic Fleet. In October 1993 in the Leningrad Military District, Warrant Officer Ismailov stole seven 23-millimeter rapid-fire antiaircraft guns! [Kholodov] And the last question. We have hardly talked about hazing of new conscripts for some time. There seems to be a reserve of trust in the current Ministry of Defense. Now, it seems, telephone calls and letters have literally burst forth... I would like to hear the statistics on such crimes that are available to the Military Procuracy. [Nosov] You can see a reduction in crimes of this nature by 14.6 percent in comparison with 1992. During all 1993 for all troops, 1,287 hazing crimes were recorded. But this is "clean hazing," and its importance in the total number of military crimes is less than 5 percent. [Kholodov] Is there "dirty hazing"? [Nosov] That is to say, "clean hazing" implies nonregulation mutual relations among servicemen that are not in relations of subordination or seniority with respect to one another. The number of these crimes does not include, for example, assault and battery by commanders. In the last year we concluded the investigation of 1,942 criminal cases of nonregulation mutual relations. About 80 percent of these were sent to court. [end Nosov] It is difficult to oversee laws in a state where there are none, or where they contradict one another. Nevertheless, the Procuracy is obligated to be impartial. But whether the Procuracy is earning its keep is for you, taxpayers, to judge.
