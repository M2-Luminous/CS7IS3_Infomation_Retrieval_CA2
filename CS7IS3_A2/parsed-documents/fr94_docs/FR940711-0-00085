FR940711-0-00085 FR940711-0-00028 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 681 [Docket No. 940690&hyph;4190; I.D.061794B] RIN 0648&hyph;AG73 Crustacean Fisheries of the Western Pacific Region AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Interpretive rule; regulatory amendment. SUMMARY: NMFS publishes this interpretive rule to clarify the definition of the landing requirement in Federal regulations implementing the Fishery Management Plan for the Crustacean Fisheries of the Western Pacific Region (FMP). The purpose of this action is to remove an unintended barrier to fishermen who might have difficulty renewing their limited entry permits because there was no quota in 1993. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 6, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. James J. Morgan at (310) 980&hyph;4036 or Mr. Alvin Z. Katekaru at (808) 541&hyph;2927. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The final rule implementing Amendment 7 (57 FR 10437, March 26, 1992) to the FMP established a limited entry program for the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. Among the provisions implemented was the establishment of a landing requirement for renewing permits each year. The Code of Federal Regulations at 50 CFR 681.30(c)(2) states that a permit will be renewed for a subsequent year only if the permitted vessel was used to: (i) land the equivalent of at least four lobsters for each trap normally used, calculated over 1 calendar year [the landing requirement] and (ii) make the landings during at least one of the 2 years prior to the year for which the new permit would be valid. If a permit were not renewed or were revoked, others could apply for the unused permit. The purpose of the rule was to ensure that only active fishermen held permits, thereby achieving the maximum benefit from the fishery. Permit holders were notified by letter in December 1992 that the 1992 fishing year would be the first year to be considered as a qualifying year. However, in 1993, the quota was set at zero lobsters because the resource was not of a sufficient size to support a fishery. As a result, those fishermen who had not fished in 1992 would have been required by Federal regulations to land a minimum number of lobsters in 1993 to obtain a permit for the 1994 fishing season, but also were forbidden by Federal regulations to fish. Therefore, the rule is being amended to make the regulations clear that the landing requirement: (1) will not apply until at least 2 years of lobster fishing has occurred beginning in 1992; and (2) must be met in one of the 2 most recent years in which lobster fishing under the limited entry program was authorized. Since lobster fishing under the limited entry program was authorized in 1992, and will be authorized in 1994, the landing requirement will first be applied to permit renewals for the 1995 lobster season. Classification This final rule is issued under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . In that this rule merely interprets an existing regulation without creating any new rights or duties, it is not subject to the requirement of notice and an opportunity for public comment under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A). Similarly, as an interpretive rule, this rule is not subject to a 30 day delay in effective date pursuant to authority set forth at 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(2). This rule has been determined to be not significant for the purposes of E.O. 12866. List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 681 Fisheries, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Dated: July 6, 1994.
