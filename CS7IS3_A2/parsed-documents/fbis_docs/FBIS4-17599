Bezborodov, head of Russian State Duma delegation; from the "Novosti" newscast] [Text] [Solovyev] For over three days the first official delegation of the Russian State Duma to former Yugoslav republics has been continuing its familiarization with the details of the Balkan tragedy. After a number of meetings in the Yugoslav capital at the weekend, the deputies visited Pale and Sarajevo where they held consultations with leaders of the Bosnian Serbs and Sarajevo Muslims. They visited the Russian paratroop battalion in Grbavica, Sarajevo's Serb section. Today the parliamentarians saw Vukovar -- a Yugoslav Stalingrad -- and Klisa, the main base of the Russian contingent of blue helmets. [Bezborodov] We believe that the initiative put forward now by Russian President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin must be urgently discussed. It is a question of holding a conference attended by Russia, the United States, the United Nations, the European Union, and the parties to the conflict, in order to sit at the negotiating table as soon as possible and to solve all the disputes peacefully. [Solovyev] Some members of the Russian delegation took a special UN flight to Zagreb, the Croatian capital, today. The Russian deputies are to meet Serbia President Slobodan Milosevic tomorrow.
