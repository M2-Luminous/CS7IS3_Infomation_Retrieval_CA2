But the question also of the international climate in this difficult period is far from secondary. The dramatic content of the external problems which Russia is encountering is obvious. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, it has for the first time in several centuries been deprived both of the western and Central Asia-Transcaucasus cordon. Beyond its new borders is an encircling focal point of conflicts, and 25 million of its colinguals today rank as foreigners. To avoid being caught unawares by the further development of events, a sober, impartial analysis of trends in the surrounding world is required. It is time that Russians tired of the incantations about the fact that to each proclaimed course there is no alternative recalled the truth that the way to the future is always variant. As far as the possible forecasts for the future are concerned, four scenarios of the impact of the surrounding world on the national interests of the Russian Federation may be imagined. First scenario (optimistic or positive). The reintegration of the economies of a sizable number of countries of the CIS and their political and military interface occur. Conflicts on Russia's borders subside. Relations with countries of East Europe improve. The West, primarily in the shape of the Seven, renders the restoration and modernization of our industry appreciable assistance by way of large investments and the lifting of trade restrictions. Second scenario (pessimistic or negative). Economic and political disintegration of the space around Russia occurs. It suffocates without friends or markets. Problems of its security as a consequence of the proliferation of nuclear weapons close by and/or the growth of conflicts along the perimeter intensify sharply. The West, denying Russia stabilization on its borders, engages in a tug-of-war in respect to the former allies and republics of the USSR, and its economic interaction with us amounts to shoring up Russia's raw material sectors. Third scenario (interim or stagnant). The formation of a common market of the CIS comes to a standstill. With the East European countries--cool relations. Conflicts along Russia's perimeter smolder, although they do not develop into a conflagration. The danger of the proliferation of nuclear weapons nearby hangs in the air. The West dribbles out economic assistance and politically and strategically contemplates the development of events. Fourth scenario (sudden or spontaneous). An abrupt deterioration in Russian-Ukrainian relations arises. In the wake of the Transcaucasus, borders are revised in Central Asia between former Union republics. Tension is created throughout the system of relations with an increasingly assertive West. The distant surroundings could bring rolling to Russia seismic waves of their own tectonic shifts--the bankruptcies of a number of important developing countries, trade wars, and the unleashing of "hot wars" in the Third World or against it. It is not known which of these scenarios is possible today. There are even more uncertainties with regard to their probable combinations. The sole solution for Russia in this situation is to be ready to defend its national interests all along the line and to assert its statehood. Precise reference points are required for this first and foremost. It would seem that the cornerstone of the policy course of the Russian Federation should, as in critical times in the past also, be its clear understanding of its own significance in world geopolitics. A big ship has no need to be constantly flashing its lights. It cannot be forgotten that we are a major global factor, and in emergency situations, an irreplaceable factor. The truth is that the entire history of mankind in the second millennium would have developed tragically had there not been at the intersection of Europe and Asia the Russian state. Three times it has saved the European continent, and on the last occasion, the world also, from unprecedented aggression. The first time, when, in the 13th-15th centuries, Russians shielded Europe from the invasion of the hordes of the descendants of Genghis Khan. The second, at the start of the 19th century, when Russia crushed the armies of Napoleon, invincible to subjugated Europe. The third time, in the 1940's, when two-thirds of the might of Hitler's fascism was pulverized and its backbone broken on the Soviet-German front. Who else could have done all this? Russia has thus traditionally, throughout the millennium, acted the part of proven stabilizer of European civilization, guarantor of its peace, and dependable shield against history's biggest acts of aggression. To maintain anything different is to falsify. It is odd under these conditions, if not insulting to Russians' national pride, to hear today talk to the effect that, for example, Russia generally (both tsarist and Soviet) has always been a "constant threat" to Europe. But this imaginary threat has simply never materialized. Or that Russia, the times of the USSR included, has been an invariable "potential aggressor." Finally, that Russia, ideology notwithstanding, is organically typified by sinister "imperial ambitions." And once again this is merely something ascribed to us, but unconfirmed. Well, lack of scruples, let it pass. Gratitude is a stranger to politics. But today's rehashes of unfriendly tunes must not, in any event, provoke us into needless and humiliating excuses or evoke an inferiority complex. Russians have nothing to make excuses for. We should be proud of our noble historical mission and continue it. Russia was, is now, and will remain a great power vitally necessary to the world. Only such a confident, majestic position is the way to its revival. A most important specific task of the Russian Federation, as of any other state also, is the assurance of tranquillity for internal transformations, primarily by way of the formation of friendly surroundings. Today these are primarily the CIS countries. Agreeing to their unnatural alienation would mean tearing up our own age-old roots, the earth for which cannot be imported from overseas. Russians do not, understandably, want such a development. At the recent elections, relations within the CIS figured as a priority in the programs of the majority of election associations. Of course, it can only be a question of a process of voluntary unity by political methods. Another large-scale practical goal of the Russian Federation on the outside is assurance of a general healthy international climate. This signifies a renunciation in principle of confrontation with the West and a readiness for mutually profitable and long-term cooperation. But this presupposes also Russia's firm defense of its inalienable national interests and legitimate and equal rights in world politics and economics. In any event, attempts to erect either a cordon sanitaire or a wire mesh very close to Russia's borders are unnatural, discriminatory, and unacceptable. Are any of these reference points a threat to anyone's interests? Great, sovereign Russia, with its "exceptional mien," is approaching the world of the future in the best possible way.
