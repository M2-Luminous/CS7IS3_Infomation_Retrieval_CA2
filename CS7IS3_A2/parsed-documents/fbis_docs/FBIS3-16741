Hlushkevych, H. Vasilevych, M. Chudakov, and V. Fadeyev held a news conference on 17 March and commented on the principal articles of the Constitution. In the beginning they spoke about the "distinctions" and advantages of the Belarusian Constitution. However then, driven into a corner by reporters, the lawmakers had to admit that the Constitution contains a number of inconsistent and ambivalent provisions. For example, the vertical structure of presidential power has been outlined very vaguely. With regard to this, the authors of the constitution said that the article on presidential power will be accompanied by a law that is "much easier to adopt." The issue of merging Belarusian and Russian monetary systems was also raised. According to the new Constitution, the Republic of Belarus shall pursue a single financial-credit policy, which in a way contradicts the unification. However, Yuriy Fadeyev clarified this issue by saying that a single monetary system does not necessarily denote an independent monetary system, adding that "there will be a single system in Grodno, Minsk, Vitebsk, and Brest." Thus, everything seems to be working just fine. However, confused by the questions that followed, the working group member added: "One can predict that the ruble zone will not be formed at all." In the course of the news conference, it turned out that a number of relevant provisions were excluded from the Constitution. The legislative committee and working group members explained this by saying that those issues could hamper the adoption of the entire Constitution. Thus, one gets the impression that the Supreme Soviet aimed for a hasty adoption of the Constitution rather than its quality.
