Anxious in wake of the Rousselet "affair" not to stir up more controversy on the high-visibility media scene, the government had almost decided against introducing a new legislative package to complement the one promulgated 2 months ago after much debate. One of CSA's recommendations is to reestablish for M6--and only for M6--the right to two commercial interruptions during the screening of fictional presentations. And it is likely to set off another uproar in the public and private television sector. "The little station on the move" reacted quickly: Nicolas de Tavernost, general manager of M6, said he was happy with this "unequivocal position," adding that he planned to "collar the communications minister on Friday 8 April to ask him to prepare implementing legislation as quickly as possible." Although CSA believes that the financial impact of such a measure--130 million French francs [Fr]--will not "greatly distort the structure" of the advertising market, TF1 surely will not accept the risk of losing market share without trying to do something about it. With regard to public television service, CSA thinks a decree should be issued to clarify once and for all the "structures" of France-Television's common presidency. CSA also deems it "indispensable for the state to assign specific missions" to each station and clearly specify authorized areas of cooperation. Which is one way of saying it is high time for the government to make public the terms and conditions of the France 2 and France 3 charters. Juridical Vacuums Concerning advertising, the council reiterated its desire to see advertising authorized on local television stations for the distribution sector. This is a step it will be difficult for the government to take, so long as newspaper publishers (and especially the daily regional press) are so intensely fearful of it. Regarding broadcasting quotas, the CSA says they have "proved themselves" even though further improvements could be made on production obligations, to support European coproductions. CSA even goes so far as to opine that the French regulatory code could "constitute a model for the European law." On the subject of cable television, CSA notes the code does not specify procedures for withdrawing an operator's authorization once issued, even though the council has received "several" requests from communes that want to change operators. Also, it points out that the absence of decrees on the subject means there is no certification procedure for stations that broadcast via telecommunications satellites. Lacking too is any "administrative sanctions regime" for cable stations or cable operators parallel to the "contractual penalties" currently in force. CSA would not be unhappy to see "criminal sanctions" instituted either. Finally, the council submitted a long list of draft decrees "not yet issued" by the government whose "rapid promulgation would put an end to the current juridical vacuums"; included are decrees covering advertising on local radio stations, minimum service in event of a public-sector strike, sports event exclusives, and obligations of stations that broadcase via telecommunications satellites. CSA notes that other measures still on hold include the new charter for Radio-France-Outremer (RFO), the decree on the 52 additional motion pictures authorized for television, and even the new decrees establishing the obligations of cable stations, which are needed "urgently" though "the government has not even submitted drafts."
