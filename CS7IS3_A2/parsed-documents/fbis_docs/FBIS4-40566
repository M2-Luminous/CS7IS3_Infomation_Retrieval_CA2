The CEAR was represented by the German, Korean, Moldovan, Ukrainian, Polish, Karaim, Tatar, and Jewish communities, as well as the Ingush and Ossetian organizations representing the territorial "autonomous entities." The Council of Europe was represented by members of the commissions for human rights and political issues and of the judicial chamber. The experts were led by the head of the court department of the Council of Europe's human rights commission, Prof. Bernard, who said that "the group is here to listen rather than speak because Russia has started the process of joining the Council of Europe, and one of our tasks is to find out about the position of national minorities." However, a number of participants in the meeting believed, the experts "were unprepared for it" because "national minorities are nonexistent as far as Russia and all its parties and the Council of Europe are concerned." According to statistics, non-Russians account for 30 percent of Russia's population. The notion of a "national minority" has not been defined in legal terms. The main demands of the CEAR were expounded by, Roman Spektor, member of the Executive Committee of the World Jewish Congress. The CEAR is pressing for the right of national minorities to be "represented in the organs of power or under their auspices," for which it offers to create a "consultative structure in the shape of an Assembly of Peoples." The second demand is the implementation of the right to national-cultural autonomy, which can be "territorial and ex-territorial." The CEAR is trying to "hold consultations with parties and democratic political movements, and it is ready to cooperate with them not in order to compete for seats in the Duma but rather in order that the parties whose electorate we are ready to join should take account of our interests and match them at the legislative level." Two days after the meeting with the Council of Europe experts there was a meeting with Yegor Gaydar which discussed the 1996 elections and the CEAR stance in them. As Mr. Spektor stated, "we can become partners as we cooperate on certain questions if some of the parties become our lobbyist."
