FR940127-2-00203 FR940127-2-00112 (2) CSRS and ARS Categorical Exclusions (7 CFR 3407.6 and 7 CFR 520.5) Based on previous experience, the following categories of CSRS and ARS actions are excluded because they have been found to have limited scope and intensity and to have no significant individual or cumulative impacts on the quality of the human environment: (i) The following categories of research programs or projects of limited size and magnitude or with only short-term effects on the environment: (A) Research conducted within any laboratory, greenhouse, or other contained facility where research practices and safeguards prevent environmental impacts; (B) Surveys, inventories, and similar studies that have limited context and minimal intensity in terms of changes in the environment; and (C) Testing outside of the laboratory, such as in small isolated field plots, which involves the routine use of familiar chemicals or biological materials. (ii) Routine renovation, rehabilitation, or revitalization of physical facilities, including the acquisition and installation of equipment, where such activity is limited in scope and intensity. In order for CSRS and ARS to determine whether any further action is needed with respect to NEPA, pertinent information regarding the possible environmental impacts of a particular project is necessary; therefore, a separate statement must be included in the proposal indicating whether the applicant is of the opinion that the project falls within a categorical exclusion and the reasons therefor. If it is the applicant's opinion that the project proposed falls within the categorical exclusions, the specific exclusions must be identified. The information submitted shall be identified as ``NEPA Considerations'' and the narrative statement shall be placed after the coversheet of the proposal. Even though a project may fall within the categorical exclusions, CSRS and ARS may determine that an Environmental Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement is necessary for an activity, if substantial controversy on environmental grounds exist or if other extraordinary conditions or circumstances are present which may cause such activity to have a significant environmental effect. Proposal Submission What to Submit An original and 14 copies of a proposal must be submitted. Each copy of each proposal must be stapled securely in the upper lefthand corner (Do not bind).
