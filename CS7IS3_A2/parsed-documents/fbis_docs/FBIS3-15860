Regardless of the holiday, city residents filled the Miners' Palace of Culture to almost full capacity. The ex-speaker declined to straightforwardly answer questions from the audience of whether his recent trips to Belarusian cities mark the beginning of his presidential campaign. However, he did say that democratic forces in the Republic should nominate a single candidate for the upcoming elections to secure a greater probability of victory. Stanislav Shushkevich also spoke positively of the unification of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems, as well as of the economic achievements of the Baltic countries. Despite discontent with the policy of the government and Supreme Soviet, the former Supreme Soviet chairman spoke against a political strike with plant and factory stoppages.
