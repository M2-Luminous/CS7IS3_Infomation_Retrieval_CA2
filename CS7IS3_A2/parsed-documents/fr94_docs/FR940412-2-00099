SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Energy announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(A) it plans to negotiate a renewal award to Cooperative Agreement DE&hyph;FC07&hyph;92ID13162 with Weirton Steel Corporation, Weirton, West Virginia. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Linda A. Hallum, Contract Specialist, (208) 526&hyph;5545; U.S. Department of Energy, 850 Energy Drive, MS 1221, Idaho Falls, ID 83401&hyph;1563. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The objective of the project is to develop a material marking and tracking system and a process planning and scheduling system suitable for use in a steel plant. These systems are part of a larger effort to provide a comprehensive Integrated Manufacturing Information System (IMIS). The renewal award will continue with Phase II tasks. DOE has no recent, current, or planned solicitations under which this proposal would be eligible. The activity to be funded is necessary to the satisfactory continuation of an activity currently funded by DOE and for which competition for support would have a significant adverse effect on continuity or completion of the project. Anticipated project benefits include energy savings, economic benefits, and environmental enhancement. The renewal award will be for two years at a total estimated cost of $9,137,433 per year. Weirton must cost share at least 50% of the project costs and DOE obligations will not exceed amounts authorized for this project. DOE has $2,912,000 available for FY 94 and expects a similar amount for FY 95. Statutory authority for this award is Public Law 93&hyph;577, Federal Non-Nuclear Energy Research and Development Act of 1974. The Federal Domestic Catalog Number is 81.078. Dated: March 28, 1994.
