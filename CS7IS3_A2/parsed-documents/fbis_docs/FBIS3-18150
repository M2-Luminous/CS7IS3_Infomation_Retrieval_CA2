It says sending peacekeepers would be in line with the national tradition of supporting peaceful solutions to political conflicts. A nationwide vote on the issue has been called by rightwing opponents of the scheme. This report from our parliamentary corrrespondent, Pierre Andre Tschanz: [Tschanz] Opponents of Swiss participation, who have now collected the 50,000 signatures needed to force a nationwide vote, share a very limited view of what neutrality means. As they see it, it not only precludes Swiss membership of the United Nations, it also prevents Bern sending troops to take part in peacekeeping operations. Eight years ago this viewpoint was still prevalent in Switzerland. Three out of four voters said "No" to joining the UN in a nationwide vote. This time, though, the government is not letting the grass grow under its feet, hence the launch of a publicity offensive two and half months before the vote. Its argument is simple: Switzerland has always done its best to contribute to peace and security worldwide. It has done so by sending mediators and observers to conflict zones and by offering financial support and personnel. For Mr. Cotti [president], sending peacekeeping troops to such areas is a logical continuation of traditional policy. Mr. Villiger [defense minister] puts it even more bluntly -- for him, not to do so would risk endangering the credibility of the government's foreign and security policy. What is more, says the government, there's no real conflict between participating in such missions and maintaining Swiss neutrality. Swiss troops would not be taking part in what is termed peace enforcement. Participation would be limited to peacekeeping missions which have been approved by all parties to the conflict. And the government would always be free to choose on a case by case basis which operations it takes part in. If the nature of the mission changed during its course, troops could be withdrawn at any stage. To take a practical example, Switzerland would not send troops to areas such as Somalia or Sarajevo. The government, it's plain to see, is doing its best to reassure nervous voters. It has two and half months to succeed.
