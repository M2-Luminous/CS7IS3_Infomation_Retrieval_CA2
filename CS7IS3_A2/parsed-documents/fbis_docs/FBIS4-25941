The traffic is light as the residents are enjoying their weekend in the city, which is well known for its bustle and hustle traffic movement during the weekdays. Armed police are seen manning strategic points in the metropolis. On the lawn patches near the national theater, Nigerian kids and youngsters are playing football, one of the most popular sports game in the West African nation. Nigerian head of State General Sani Abacha said in his broadcast to the whole nation this morning that his government is determined to seek the successful implementation of the agenda of the proposed national constitutional conference, slated for June 27. Meanwhile, he also warned against any act to endanger the peace and security in the nation, saying that saboteurs would be sternly punished. A young Nigerian woman, who identified herself as a high school student, said Abacha's broadcast "is not specific." "If only he (Abacha) can identify those bad elements in our society," she said. On Awolowo Road, a petit peddler told XINHUA, "I know nothing about Abacha's speech and I do not know (anything) about (the fact that Moshood) Abiola was wanted" by the Nigerian Police. "I don't care about politics, but I do care about my business because my family lives on" the petit business, he said. At a shopping center near the American Embassy in Nigeria, a Nigerian Army soldier named Alassan said Abiola "Is doing something at a wrong time." "You see, the election was annulled a year ago by the (General Ibrahim) Babangida administration, but one year later Abiola still insists (on) the restoration of the election," he said, adding that "I think he's joking." Asked about what he will do if Abiola is standing before him, he said calmly, "The fact is that Abiola is missing now. But if he is standing before me, I'll arrest him and I think he'll be tried." "You can't establish a government within the government headed by General Abacha," he said, "That's why Abiola's action is viewed as treason." Meanwhile, Alassan said if he arrested Abiola or had the information which leads to his arrest, "I will be 50,000 (naira) richer." However, no information so far is available to confirm whether the Nigerian police have promised to offer a reward of 50,000 naira (about 2,270 U.S. dollars at the official exchange rate). Abiola, widely believed to have won the annulled presidential election last year, repeatedly threatened to form a rival government with him as "the president of Nigeria." While declaring Abiola wanted, the Nigerian Police on Saturday [11 June] asked the general public with information of his whereabouts to come forward with such information.
