President Zafy warmly welcomed Qian Qichen. He said: The current visit will surely further enhance the development of friendly and cooperative ties between the two countries. Qian Qichen said: Sino-Malagasy relations have a sound foundation. The Chinese and Malagasy Governments will make joint efforts to continuously consolidate and develop the friendship between the peoples of the two countries and push forward the development of bilateral economic and technological cooperation. Qian Qichen conveyed President Jiang Zemin's cordial regards and good wishes to President Zafy. He said: President Jiang looks forward to President Zafy's visit to China this year. President Zafy pointed out: Madagascar and China have many points in common. The Malagasy Government highly treasures our friendly ties with China. Touching on the situation in Africa, Qian Qichen said: The process of decolonization in Africa has taken nearly half a century. Currently, the African nations are still in a stage of exploring how to develop their own economies. He stressed: The practice of China's construction has proven that one cannot gain success by indiscriminately copying and imitating the experiences of other countries. The important thing is to proceed from the realities of your own country, combine them with and draw from the experiences of other countries, while seeking your own path of development. President Zafy endorsed Qian Qichen's views. He said: The African people are increasingly aware of the importance of acting independently and having the initiative in their own hands, and of relying on themselves to develop their countries. Notwithstanding that presently Africa has encountered difficulties, it has its own superiorities. Earlier on, Malagasy speaker Andriamahazo met with Qian Qichen, and both sides exchanged views on how to further strengthen contacts between the national assemblies of the two countries. Qian Qichen and his party left Madagascar this afternoon for a visit to Mauritius.
