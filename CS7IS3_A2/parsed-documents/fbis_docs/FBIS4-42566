Referring to Turkish claims that Kurdish guerrillas are being trained in Greece, the spokesman explicitly reiterated that such claims are slanderous and unfounded. He added that the Greek position is well-known, and mentioned the case of the Kurd who was arrested in Turkey and, after being tortured, supposedly confessed about the training of Kurds in Greece.
