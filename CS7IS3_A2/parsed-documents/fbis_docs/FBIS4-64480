Bohl told SUEDWESTFUNK [Southwest Radio] yesterday that the income generated by this surcharge had already been taken into account in planned budget spending over the next five years, but it looks as if the surcharge might have to be kept longer. Bohl pointed out that between 135 and 140 billion marks have to be paid to the new laender every year. "No one can say how much longer we are going to live with the heritage of socialism," said Bohl. "Anyone who attempts to set a time limit to this is merely deceiving others." But the government would also like to abolish this surcharge as soon as possible, Bohl said. FDP [Free Democratic Party] chairman Klaus Kinkel welcomed the fact that the "CDU seems prepared to accept our demand that the solidarity surcharge be reexamined after three years," something which Bohl had categorically denied on behalf of the government. Kinkel added that this was not by any means a condition for continued FDP cooperation with the CDU. Acting SPD [Social Democratic Party] chairman Lafontaine accused the chancellor of having approved the solidarity surcharge without knowing how prices and incomes would develop in future.
