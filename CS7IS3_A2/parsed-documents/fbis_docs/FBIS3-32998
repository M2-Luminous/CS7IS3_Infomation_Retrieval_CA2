Approximately 22,000 tractors and light trucks, as well as other work equipment used in the fields, will be maintained by the soldiers as direct cooperation with the productive sector, Radio Rebelde has reported. Right now, the main objective is to remove corrosion and halt the deterioration of the equipment that is now available after converting a large number of former state-run farms to the cooperative system. Until this equipment is distributed and used in other agriculture units or assigned to cooperatives, the Armed Forces will be charged with maintaining the tractors and mentioned vehicles. Similar support operations for other sectors of the national economy have been implemented in the past, directly benefiting the Construction and Transportation Ministries, according to what could be learned.
