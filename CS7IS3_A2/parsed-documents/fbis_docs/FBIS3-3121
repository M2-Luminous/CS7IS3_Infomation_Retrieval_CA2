The meeting passed a draft resolution on the government work report made by Premier Li Peng to the legislature. The resolution will be sent to NPC deputies for examination before being submitted to the NPC general session for a vote. The Presidium meeting also heard and passed examination reports made by Liu Suinian, chairman of the NPC Financial and Economic Committee, on: implementation of the 1993 plan for national economic and social development, a draft 1994 plan for national economic and social development, implementation of the state budget for 1993 and a draft state budget for 1994. The NPC Financial and Economic Committee, Liu said, believed that the guiding idea, principle and key points of the 1994 national economic and social development plan are correct and that measures put forth therein are feasible. In the process of carrying out the national plan, he said, any partial adjustment of the plan has to be reported to the NPC Standing Committee for examination and approval. On this year's budget plan, the committee maintains that its guiding principles for budgetary arrangements are correct, Liu said. The principles, he said, provide for expenditures on key projects and undertakings that will promote national economic and social development. At the same time, the budget provides a necessary financial guarantee for the smooth progress of major reform measures and strengthened macroeconomic controls, he said. The meeting also passed a draft list of candidates for by- election of members to the NPC Standing Committee to be handed over to the deputies for examination.
