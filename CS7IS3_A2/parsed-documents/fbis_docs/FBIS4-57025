FBIS4-57025 "drlat092_f_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-092 Daily Report 10 May 1994 CENTRAL AMERICA El Salvador Eight Reject Separation Decision Eight Reject Separation Decision PA1205034294 Panama City ACAN in Spanish 2150 GMT 10 May 94 PA1205034294 Panama City ACAN Spanish BFN [Text] San Salvador, 10 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Eduardo Sancho, one of the eight leaders of the former Salvadoran guerrilla organization Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), today rejected the National Council's decision to separate them from their posts in the organization. Sancho -- former commander "Ferman Cienfuegos" -- said at a news conference that "we do not accept the decision of the National Council to suspend the members of the ERP [People's Revitalizing Expression] and RN [National Resistance] from the Political Commission because that is the first step toward a permanent expulsion." Shafik Handal, coordinator general of the FMLN, made the announcement following a prolonged meeting of the FMLN National Council. Representatives of the ERP and the RN did not attend the meeting which ended early this morning. Seven [as received] ERP and RN members voted for deputy Gloria Salguero -- of the ruling Nationalist Republican Alliance (Arena) -- for president of the new Legislative Assembly during the installation ceremony on 1 May. In return, the ERP's Ana Guadalupe Martinez and the RN's [Eduardo] Sancho were elected vice president and secretary, respectively, with the support of 39 deputies of the right wing Arena. Sancho declared that the other three factions of the FMLN -- the Farabundo Marti People's Liberation Forces (FPL), the Communist Party of El Salvador (PCES), and the Revolutionary Party of Central American Workers (PRTC) -- "are not yet democratic, and that is the honest truth." He added: "We reject and do not accept this measure, and we do not view it as a decision," and he stressed "we still belong to the FMLN." The document prepared this morning by the council points out that its members decided to "suspend all of these companeros from posts assigned to them by the National Council," and asks the RN and the ERP to "correct the behavior that has given rise to this situation and to propose replacements for approval by the National Council." From another quarter, Walter Araujo, deputy of the ruling ARENA, said that independent of the internal problems of the FMLN, his party will seek "reconciliation in order to gain the support of 84 deputies for the bills, initiatives, and agreements to seek greater unity. The FMLN's problem does not involve the other political parties: it is very much their own problem," Araujo declared.
