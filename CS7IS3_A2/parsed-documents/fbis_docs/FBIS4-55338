The following are the conclusions of the RS assembly: 1. The platform on further moves of the RS delegation at peace talks, which the RS people's assembly adopted at a session held on 20 April 1991, remains the basic working document of the RS delegation. 2. There are no preconditions for the general cessation of hostilities and for the resumption of the peace process, but the RS delegation has been charged with a task of ensuring that the RS is given equal treatment at the talks; that is, that all forms of pressure on the Serb people, including the sanctions, are eliminated. 3. Future talks on former Bosnia-Herzegovina are to be conducted within the framework of a new peace conference. The results so far of the peace conference on former Yugoslavia -- agreed to by the three sides in the conflict and by all the relevant international factors -- must be taken into account. The basis for a territorial separation remain the actual situation on the ground and other relevant factors, such as the existence of two independent state entities in the territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina: the RS and the Muslim-Croat federation. 4. Brcko and Posavina are the component parts of the RS and are of vital national importance. The assembly therefore rejects any attempt on the part of the international community to alter these territories as something other than vital territories for the entire Serb nation. 5. The bombing of Serb positions by NATO and missile attacks on Serb civilians in the vicinity of Tuzla by an UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] unit are hostile actions against the Serb nation, and all such actions must cease. 6. The assembly most strongly condemns the atrocious attack on Brcko by the Muslim army at the time the RS assembly was in session, which took the lives of four innocent civilians while several civilians were seriously or lightly injured.
