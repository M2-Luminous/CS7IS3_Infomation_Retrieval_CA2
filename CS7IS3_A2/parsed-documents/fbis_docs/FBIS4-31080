Bisenic: "Let Milosevic Assume Responsibility for Yugoslavia"] [Text] A discussion on how the federal state is functioning should be held immediately, at an extraordinary session of the Federal Assembly. This has been suggested by Zoran Djindjic, president of the Democratic Party, explaining for BORBA the initiative according to which the top posts in that state ought to be held by the "most important people," while the state ought to become a federation in the real sense of the word. "At this session, the government, which is only a `feather among whirlwinds,' should be voted out. It is necessary, without shrinking from it, to raise the question of the post of FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] President [Zoran] Lilic and establish what his role is, since he is only a political mask," Djindjic said. According to Djindjic, this discussion should be held in the Federal Assembly among the parliamentary parties. They should establish whether there is a consensus on this and what the contentions issue are. "We already have two years of experience. This debate should be followed by federal elections at which the citizens would vote for a concept that the parties that win the majority of votes must put into practice. The citizens are now being deceived because they voted for a federal state, but, in essence, only got an illusory federal state," the leader of the Democratic Party said. It is high time, Djindjic said, that the Socialist Party of Serbia explain its views on Yugoslavia, because the comedy of the federal state may be funny, but the consequences are tragic. Judged according to their importance, [President] Lilic, [Prime Minister Radoje] Kontic, Bozovic [chairman of the Chamber of Citizens], and Radulovic [chairman of the Chamber of Republics], as the four top officials of the state, cannot even be considered second-rate politicians. We demand that the ruling parties and these people say whether they really want a federal state, or whether they need it only as a front for the republican states. If they want the former, then they should find different persons for these posts. If they want the latter, then this is too expensive for the people. The crisis in the federal parliament is the right opportunity to find an answer to these issues. We as a party hold the view that the top posts in the top organs in a modern federal state should be held by the most influential politicians of Serbia and Montenegro. I do not see any reason why [Serbian President Slobodan] Milosevic should not assume responsibility for Yugoslavia, why [Montenegrin President Momir] Bulatovic should not be prime minister, why Djukanovic [Montenegrin prime minister and defense minister] should not be finance minister, why Marovic should not be chairman of the Chamber of Republics, and so forth. Neither Bozovic, nor Sainovic, nor the other spent officials that were put on this sidetrack called the federal state have any influence on internal or foreign policy. Those who are indeed in charge of the policies should be in the posts from which they can do it legally, Djindjic said. Djindjic also said that one should discard the confederal elements and create a clear decisionmaking pyramid. These top posts should be filled with respectable politicians. The Democratic Party proposed this initiative to other parties at the recent interparties meetings. If the ruling parties reply negatively to this initiative, Djindjic said that this would be a kind of answer that is only prolonging this deception, torturing people, and discrediting the very idea of the state.
