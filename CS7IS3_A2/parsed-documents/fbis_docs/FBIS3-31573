Both delegations, it has been learned, have accepted the model of the cantonal organization of the future Bosnia-Herzegovina, but some of their standpoints are, nevertheless, different. The Muslim side sees the cantons as the basis for the development of a future state while the Croatian side sees them as only a framework guaranteeing the appropriate participation of both nations in the government. In this connection, stress is laid on the U.S. initiative on the territorial division of Bosnia-Herzegovina into seven cantons. Of the concrete agreements, stress is placed on the forthcoming meeting between military commanders General Ante Roso and Rasim Delic, which should provide a definite cessation of hostilities between the Croatian Defense Council and the Muslim army, something that will make further negotiations easier. Both delegations agreed with the U.S. approach to the talks -- that first there should be an agreement between Croats and Muslims on Bosnia-Herzegovina before an agreed proposal is put to the third side, the Bosnian Serbs.
