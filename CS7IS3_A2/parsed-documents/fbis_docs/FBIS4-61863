"The six detachments of cosmonauts previously included almost 100 men, which is much more than needed by expeditions to the orbital piloted "Mir" station, planned until 1997," ITAR-TASS was told today by officials of the inter-departmental commission for ensuring the flight and exploitation of the "Mir" space laboratory. Cosmonauts aged above 50, were the first to be laid off. Nevertheless, 54-year-old Gennadiy Strekalov, one of the most experienced cosmonauts, was left on the staff. One will hardly have to wait long for a regular space flight after this reduction of the personnel, as it happened, for instance, with German Arzamazov, who remained a stand-by on the ground for 17 years running, or with Tamara Zakharova, who is now on maternity leave, waiting for her turn to fly. The largest detachment today belongs to the Russian air force -- 17 men. The detachment of the "Energiya" scientific production society will number 12 men. The medico-biological institute also has its own 5-man detachment. The fate of 12 cosmonauts, trained according to the "Buran" programme, is yet to be decided. They may be switched over to training for flights to the "Mir" station.
