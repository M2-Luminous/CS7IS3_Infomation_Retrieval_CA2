In a news conference held just before his departure from the ROK on the afternoon of 13 March, Robert Gallucci, U.S. assistant secretary of state for political and military affairs, said that the situation is "hopeful," unlike the general observation that the issue "has gone up the river," although he did not elaborate on this. Such remarks by Assistant Secretary Gallucci may be construed as an expression of mere formality intended to not influence negatively the ongoing North-South working-level contacts for the exchange of special envoys. However, people believe that since he has experience in sitting face to face with the North Korean side during the first and second rounds of talks as senior delegate of the U.S. side, his remarks should not be taken lightly. After holding the working contact on 12 March, Song Yong-tae, vice minister of the National Unification Board and our side's delegate to the North-South working-level contact, also revealed that although he is not definitely sure, the exchange of special envoys before 21 March is not technically impossible, thus making a similar suggestion to the one made by Assistant Secretary Gallucci. Then, what is the reason they have not abandoned hope despite the prevailing general pessimism? The day in which the exchange of special envoys could be possibly held, without breaking the "25 February North Korea-U.S. agreement," would be the first day of the week immediately following the 16 March North-South contact, or 21 March, which is designated as the date for the North Korea-U.S. high-level talks. It is the unanimous view of government authorities that the exchange of special envoys during the weekend is practically impossible in view of past instances. Therefore, the date to which both the ROK and the United States pay attention is 21 March. The two countries believe it is very likely that North Korea will propose this date. It has been learned that the two sides discussed this issue in depth during Assistant Secretary Gallucci's visit to the ROK. North Korea will possibly propose 21 March as the date for exchanging special envoys because, by doing so, it can avoid international criticism for breaking the "25 February North Korea-U.S. agreement," which requires the exchange of special envoys before the North Korea-U.S. high-level talks, and because it can propagandize that it is simultaneously pushing for North Korea-U.S. high-level talks and North-South dialogue according to its own intention. Besides, the "21 March special envoy exchange" corresponds to North Korean foreign negotiation tactics in the "settlement of all problems at the same time at the last moment." There is an eight-hour time difference between Seoul and Geneva, where the North Korea-U.S. high-level talks are to be held. Therefore, the exchange of special envoys on 21 March would not necessarily mean that "the 25 February North Korea-U.S. agreement" was broken. The ROK and the United States have not finished finalizing their positions toward this speculation but are intensively discussing whether or not they would accept such a North Korean proposal. Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu temporarily showed a negative position toward "the possibility of the special envoy exchange on 21 March." However, an official close to him revealed that Minister Han is keenly attentive to this possibility. Because of President Kim Yong-sam's upcoming visit to Japan and China slated for 24 to 30 March, the government has not finalized its strategy to cope with a possible North Korean proposal for an envoy exchange on 21 March. A relevant government official said: The 21 March special envoy exchange would be the best card for North Korea. Although there were many negative views on the proposal on our side at first, positive opinion is now growing gradually from the standpoint that it is not necessary for us to drive North Korea into a corner by any means.
