He said: "The key factors cementing them are a common economy, historical and cultural traditions, and a common mentality." Therefore, Nursultan Nazarbayev emphasized, "nobody will ever manage to sow discord between our peoples. Although such attempts have already been made and are still being made by some irresponsible politicians." "Take, for instance, the problem of dual citizenship," the Kazakhstan president said. "Many countries, including Russia, do not provide for this. So the question arises: Can this be introduced in Kazakhstan when it is just beginning to construct its statehood and when more than half of its citizens are not native inhabitants? This would put the republic's citizens at a disadvantage at the outset, dividing them into people of first and second class. Would it not be better for everyone to create equal conditions and have everything correspond to the demands of peaceful, world standards, and to make borders transparent by concluding the appropriate intergovernmental agreements? Then, for instance, persons wishing to move to a permanent place of residence in Russia would be automatically given Russian citizenship, and if they return to Kazakhstan, Kazakh citizenship would be given just as freely. If that were to happen, no one would ever again raise the question of the need for dual citizenship." As to the essence of the forthcoming talks with the Russian Federation president, is concerned, the Kazakh chief of state said the main purpose of the meeting with Boris Yeltsin is to remove the problems which have accumulated in relations between the two countries. Experts have worked throughout the year on ways of resolving many of them and there is no doubt that mutual understanding will be found. Nursultan Nazarbayev went on to say that the first thing at issue will be military cooperation. He said: "We had a single army, a single weaponry, a single military school, and these ties should not be broken, especially since we are friendly states. In our time we have already reached a relevant agreement on friendship, cooperation, and military aid, and I think normal conditions should be created for the Russian Army to use the military test ranges on Kazakhstan's soil." "A second problem -- Baykonur -- should also be resolved, Nursultan Nazarbayev continued. "This is a unique facility, the only one of its kind. I think that tomorrow the Russian side and ourselves will find mutually acceptable conditions for its use in the interests both of Kazakhstan and of the Russian Federation. All unresolved problems concerning humanitarian links, including civilian ones, must be resolved. People's freedom of movement across the border must be guaranteed. Economic problems must also be resolved; they concern many aspects of our cooperation. We expect over 20 specific documents to be signed here. Nursultan Nazarbayev stressed, in particular, that he personally would like matters to be conducted in such a way as to ensure that there are never any problems at all in the dialogue between Russia and Kazakhstan. The Kazakhstan president said the two countries are fated, "in the best sense of that word, to be always together. After all, the economies of our republics represent in many ways a single production mechanism. In particular, the world's biggest coalfields in Pavlodar Oblast send most of the fuel they mine to the Russian Federation. Siberia and the Far East provide Kazakhstan with the lion's share of its industrial timber requirements. It is not difficult to imagine what our countries would be deprived of if such reciprocal deliveries were halted. For it would take Russia not just tens of years, but also vast and presently nonexistent resources, to develop its coalfields, just as it would Kazakhstan to grow its forests." Nursultan Nazarbayev said the exchange of opinions on the "situation in the Commonwealth and on ways to give it a more concrete and effective content will occupy an important place in his conversation with Boris Yeltsin. The fact of the matter is that all the heads of states are already saying that the Commonwealth is necessary, that it is a great future. At the same time, little is being done in practice to strengthen the processes of integration. One wonders how long some political leaders, and not just them, will continue to harbor a panicky fear that the empire will be revived? It has already been consigned to history. It's time for all to realize that fact once and for all and to begin restoring the economic ties which have been ruptured. Otherwise the economy of our countries will never get out of the crisis."
