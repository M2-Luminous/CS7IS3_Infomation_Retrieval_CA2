ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ), this notice announces that the Information Collection Request (ICR) abstracted below has been forwarded to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and comment. The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected cost and burden. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before April 1, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For further information or to obtain a copy of this ICR, contact Sandy Farmer at EPA, (202) 260&hyph;2740. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Office of Water Title: Information Collection Request for Combined Sewer Overflow Policy (EPA No. 1680.01). Abstract: This is a new collection of information in support of the 1993 Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) Policy, a national guidance that was issued earlier as a draft Policy in 1992, and is partially based on the 1989 Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) Strategy, as published at 54 FR 37370. The Clean Water Act (CWA), as promulgated at 40 CFR Parts 121 through 125, provides the authority to regulate Combined Sewer Systems (CSSs) as point sources subject to National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit requirements. CSSs are wastewater collection systems designed to transport both wastewater and stormwater to publicly-owned treatment works (POTWs). CSSs may periodically experience flows that exceed capacity, resulting in discharges of untreated wastes into surface waters. The CSO policy requires POTWs to provide information to EPA, or the delegated State authority, that will be used to ensure the adequacy of existing CSO controls, to establish permit terms and conditions, to track performance, and to conduct compliance assessment and enforcement of CWA requirements. Under the CSO Policy, municipal POTWs are expected to document the implementation of nine control measures develop a Long Term CSO Control Plan (LTCCP), and perform ongoing compliance monitoring. The information provided by CSOs may include: 1) operation and maintenance plans; 2) revised sewer-use ordinances for industrial users; 3) infiltration/inflow studies; 4) descriptions of pollution prevention programs; 5) public notification plans; 6) facility plans for maximizing the capabilities of existing collection, storage and treatment systems; 6) contracts and schedules for minor construction programs; and 7) information or data relevant to assessing the extent to which the nine minimum controls satisfy water quality standards. Documentation, monitoring and reporting by POTWs will occur over the normal five year duration of their NPDES permit. POTWs will be required to retain records for a period of three years. Burden Statement: Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 565 hours per response for POTWs and 1,052 hours for States operating NPDES programs including time for reviewing the policy, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the information. Annual public recordkeeping is estimated to average 25 hours per POTW and 6 hours for each State operating an NPDES program. Respondents: Municipal POTWs and States operating NPDES programs. Estimated number of respondents; 1100 POTWs, 30 States. Estimated number of responses per respondent: 1. Frequency of Collection: Twice every five years. Estimated Total Annual Burden on Respondents: 591 hours for POTWs, 1,058 hours for States. Send comments regarding the burden estimate, or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to: Sandy Farmer, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Information Policy Branch (2136), 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. and Matt Mitchell, Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, 725 17th St., NW., Washington, DC 20503. Dated: February 23, 1994. Paul Lapsley, Director, Regulatory Management Division. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;4754 Filed 3&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;M
