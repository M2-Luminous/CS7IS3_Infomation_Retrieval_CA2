FBIS4-38888 "drsov107_h_94003" FBIS-SOV-94-107 Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 Moldova Cetin Calls UN Report Unfair Cetin Calls UN Report Unfair TA0206090894 Ankara TRT Television Network in Turkish 2100 GMT 1 Jun 94 TA0206090894 Ankara TRT Television Network Turkish BFN [Announcer-read report over video] [Text] Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has stated that the UN secretary general's recent Cyprus report shows that the organization lacks the patience necessary at this time, when the Turkish Cypriots are making sacrifices toward an agreement. Cetin said that the report will not help secure an agreement on the confidence-building measures [CBM] package. Cetin held a news conference in Moldova, where President Suleyman Demirel is conducting an official visit, and assessed the report. TRT correspondent Kemal Gungordu reports from Kishinev: [Begin recording] [Gungordu] Cetin stated that it is unfair and unjust for the United Nations to blame the Turkish Cypriot side for not having political will. Cetin stressed that in this way, the United Nations is striving to avoid and rid itself of the issue. Cetin continued: [Cetin] It is obvious that such an approach will not contribute to a positive development regarding the Cyprus issue. The United Nations, which is in no hurry to reach decisions on Bosnia-Herzegovina and other places in the world where bloody incidents are taking place, took a harmful course when it issued this report without awaiting the conclusion of the CBM talks in Cyprus, which had embarked on a favorable course, and thereby failed to exhibit even the patience necessary for a solution. [Gungordu] Noting that this is his initial assessment of the report, Cetin added that he will have a more detailed announcement to make once he reviews the particulars of the report. In answer to a reporter's question, Cetin noted: I must admit that the UN secretary general has failed to fulfill his goodwill mission with this report. In the report, Cetin noted, the UN secretary general creates the impression, without actually naming names, that he blames the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC] for being the party that is not interested in conciliation. Pointing out that in his report, the secretary general mentions the impossibility of making changes in the CBM's, Cetin added: They, however, are the ones who made the changes. Explaining that the CBM's were put forward on 1 July 1993, Cetin recalled that President Rauf Denktas had announced his acceptance of the package. Indicating that the package that emerged on 21 March, when the talks started, differed on five basic points from the secretary general's initial package. Cetin continued: [Cetin] One of these points was related to the map of Maras [Varosha], the second to arrangements regarding access to Maras, the third to establishing two separate customs at Lefkosa [Nicosia] Airport and to the landing of Turkish planes, that is to say, TRNC planes. All of these points, which were under consideration were changed in the document they put forward on 21 March, and all of these changes are in the Greek Cypriot Administration's favor. Actually, they are the ones who made the changes. [Gungordu] Cetin reiterated that the TRNC submitted legitimate requests when confronted with changes that favored the other party. Pointing out that the TRNC requests were discussed in the Vienna talks, where certain arrangements were formulated, Cetin added: [Cetin] This report was released when the discussions were continuing. It is clear -- and this is pure speculation and is not based on anything concrete -- that when it became obvious that the items agreed on in Vienna would probably be unacceptable to the Greek Cypriot side and before that point was reached, it was decided to issue this report, which portrays the TRNC as the side not interested in conciliation. This is totally unjust and unacceptable. [end recording]
