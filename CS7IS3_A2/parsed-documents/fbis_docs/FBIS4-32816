The Central American presidents were disappointed with the so-called Tegucigalpa minisummit because Gore rejected any links between their countries and NAFTA in the short-, mid-, or long-term. It is true that the presidents had extremely high expectations for this meeting, and with good reason. To join in an agreement of this nature has enormous significance for a region still suffering the effects of a 10-year war and ever-increasing poverty levels. Although the United States promised to open its markets to textile imports from Central America, this will only happen after each Central American country complies with a number of requirements and conditions imposed by the United States. These conditions include approving a series of labor laws, creating laws to protect intellectual property rights and copyrights, establishing regulations to protect the environment, and complying with NAFTA's rules of origin governing the textile sector. The foreign debt, a paramount issue that determines whether Central American countries are able to advance economically and which precludes the region from undertaking sustainable development because of all of the resources it consumes, was not discussed at the Tegucigalpa minisummit. We must recall that Central America and the Caribbean had accumulated a $37-billion foreign debt by the end of 1993. For countries like Nicaragua and El Salvador, the foreign debt is an extremely onerous burden because these nations have so many economic, political, and social problems resulting from their prolonged wars. Leading Central American newspapers have criticized the presidential meeting and stress that Vice President Gore did not make any clear references to topics of enormous regional interest, such as the fight against poverty and the often-mentioned regional incorporation into NAFTA. Although Hondurans did take advantage of Vice President Gore's visit to display posters across the conference hall eloquently asking for the withdrawal of U.S. soldiers from their territory, Gore did not seem to care at all. Many analysts have agreed that this meeting tried to exalt the virtues of the so- called hemispheric summit that will be hosted by President Clinton and which seeks to become a panacea for this part of the world. The presidential summit that will be held in Miami in December has been revived by President Clinton precisely at a time when the defense and recovery strategies proposed at the various Ibero-American summits are now in the process of being consolidated. It appears that the Miami meeting is aimed at chastising countries looking for a social model different from that of the United States, and it seems the session is also designed to remind the region that the only country that can convene meetings of this nature is the powerful North American nation. The hemispheric summit may end up being as disappointing as the Tegucigalpa minisummit, where the U.S. Vice President simply voiced some promises, all of which were tied to demands that are nearly impossible to meet. Central America, a region with a population of 30 million and still burdened by social injustice and military predominance, urgently needs specific development projects, rather than promises. In this sense, the visit by the U.S. Vice President was fruitless.
