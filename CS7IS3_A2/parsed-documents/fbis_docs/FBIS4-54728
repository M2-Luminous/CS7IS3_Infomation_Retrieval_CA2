"The integration is favoured by such initiatives as the Partnership for Peace. Poland expresses the hope that it will become a road towards the creation of an efficient European security system," Walesa said at a meeting held at the royal castle on the occasion of the national day of Poland, the 3rd of May constitution anniversary. "Regional cooperation also brings us closer to the united and safe Europe," Walesa stressed and added that Poland attaches importance to the Visegrad group and the Council of the Baltic Countries and the regional meeting at Litomysl. The Polish president spoke of Poland's "frequent and significant contacts with Washington, and also Bonn, London and Paris" and said: "We are of the opinion that the role of the United States in maintaining European stability should not be weakened. At the same time we attach great weight to cooperation with democratic Russia. Our proposal to codify the principles of the Eastern policy serves this end. Through discussions with our partner we are trying to open the road towards concrete solutions." Apart from President Walesa and his wife Danuta, the meeting was hosted by Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak, Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy, Senate Speaker Adam Struzik and Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski. On behalf of the diplomats the dean of the Diplomatic Corps, Papal Nuncio Archbishop Jozef Kowalczyk expressed recognition to the Polish president and the Polish people for their "everyday toil and struggle for a new shape of the democratic country."
