City Treasury's Expenditures To Exceed Revenues for the First Time"] [Text] The St. Petersburg government has hastily approved the city's budget for 1994. It is planned that the city budget's annual revenues will be 2,116,772,000,000 rubles [R] and expenditures will amount to R3,607,993,000,000 in 1 February 1994 prices. Hence, city hall has envisioned for 1994 a budget deficit of nearly R1.5 trillion. It is expected that social spending will account for 40 percent of budget expenditures, nearly the same share as the maintenance of the municipal infrastructure. The maintenance of government authorities will require 1.5 percent of the entire budget expenditures. Another 14 percent of St. Petersburg's budget appropriations will be channeled to finance investment projects. The share of expenditures on the municipal infrastructure will rise 1.5 percent, that of social and cultural spending will be up 0.5 percent. According to city hall, the maintenance of government authorities will be less costly for the city's taxpayers -- specialists from the financial committee managed to reduce the share of expenditures on the maintenance of bureaucrats by 0.1 percent. According to assessments by city hall's financial committee specialists, implementing the budget approved by the city government will be a hard task. By comparison with other Russian Federation components, St. Petersburg's overly cumbersome economy, prone to inertia, is impeding the city's transfer to new principles of budget formation, but city hall expects to cope with the problem.
