SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Statement The Office of Management and Budget has approved the use of the Flexible Subsidy forms under OMB control number 2502&hyph;0395. I. Purpose and Substantive Description A. Statutory Background and Authority Section 201 of the Housing and Community Development Amendments (HCDA) of 1978 created the Flexible Subsidy Program to provide Operating Assistance to eligible projects experiencing financial difficulty. Operating Assistance is provided in the form of a deferred loan and, in conjunction with other resources, is designed to restore or maintain the physical and financial soundness of eligible projects. The 1983 amendments to section 201 of the HCDA expanded the universe of eligible projects and clarified that a project need not have an FHA-insured mortgage to be eligible for Flexible Subsidy assistance (e.g., a non-insured section 236 project is eligible). The Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 amended section 201 of HCDA to create a new category of assistance to be provided under the Flexible Subsidy Program for projects that needed capital improvements to achieve physical soundness that cannot be funded from project reserve funds without jeopardizing other major repairs or replacements that are reasonably expected to be required in the near future. The 1987 amendments to the Flexible Subsidy statute (Sections 185 and 186 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987) also recognized the need to coordinate assistance under the Flexible Subsidy Program with the initiative to preserve low- and moderate-income housing, enacted in Title II of that Act. (In its comprehensive revision of the 1987 Act, Title VI of the 1990 Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act, at the new section 219, repeated the listing of incentives the Secretary could agree to provide an owner as part of a plan of action to prevent prepayment of a mortgage on a project serving low- and moderate-income tenants. A capital improvement loan was included as an incentive to owners.)
