He said: "I believe neither the United States nor the ROK fully supports the idea right now." However, the official noted the idea may become worthy of consideration when the UN Security Council [UNSC] adopts a resolution on the issue, saying: "It appears some nations would support an international conference following the UNSC resolution."
