Some 130 of the 300-odd projects under the Yulgok plan ought to be reexamined to decide whether they should be continued, he said. He told the 18-member committee, chaired by Lt. Gen. Chang Song, commandant of the Korea Military Academy, that it must find ways to improve Yulgok projects and the defense procurement system as well as to restore the people's trust in the military. Also Monday, Lt. Gen. Chang Pyong-yong, head of the Armed Forces Special Inspection Group, said that a special team would start a full-scope probe of two of the five Yulgok projects it is to investigate toward the end of the week. The two are relocation of the Army's combat arms school and the Navy's procurement of tactical data systems. Cho Ki-hyon, 53, president of Chongwoo Construction Co., will be questioned about his company's role in the relocation project, Chang told reporters. He said an exit ban on So Chon-sok, 52, president of Litton Korea, has been lifted as he was found to have had nothing to do with the Navy's tactical data system project. The team will focus on what was overlooked or missed in the Board of Audit and Inspection's probe last year, he said.
