This prediction was made by Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko. Speaking to correspondents today, he explained that this "will not be to spite the government or its prime minister, whom I hold in high esteem," but merely in the interests of Russia's regions. Vladimir Shumeyko disclosed that the chamber was actively discussing the reform program, and deputies do not agree with all its provisions. The budget will be discussed with interregional economic associations. Vladimir Shumeyko said this was why the next session of the Federation Council was being postponed from 23 May, the date originally scheduled, to 30 May. A number of questions connected with the economy have been proposed for the draft agenda.
