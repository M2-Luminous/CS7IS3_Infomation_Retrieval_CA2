The situation in the territory will be included in the final communique of the Colombian summit. In Cartagena de Indias the Portuguese representatives expressed an interest in greater cooperation with Latin America. Among all the speeches there was harsh criticism of Cuba and Fidel Castro from Argentina and Venezuela. Our correspondent Antonio Prata reports. [Begin recording] [Prata] [passage omitted] Despite the friendly hug between Fidel Castro and Portuguese Foreign Minister Durao Barroso, President Mario Soares and Prime Minister Cavaco Silva did not forget the situation on the island. For Soares, without a strong democracy there will be no development in Latin America. [Soares] In order for the legitimate aspirations and expectations of the people to materialize, it is necessary for democracy to rest on solid foundations, giving rise to a balanced and equatable economic, social, and cultural development. [Prata] A future which already includes trade development and an open process of regional integration--a phenomenon praised by Cavaco Silva: [Silva] Therefore, I welcome the fact that the documents of this conference advocate the principle of open regionalism which adequately represents the different processes under way in Europe and in Latin America in the area of economic integration. [Prata] Durao Barroso also advocated this cooperation between blocs. [Barroso] In this modern world, which some believe is moving toward a concept of blocs, it is important to maintain these links between different blocs or different groups, and to this effect Portugal, as well as Spain, has been a link between Europe and, in this case, Latin America. [Prata] [passage omitted] It seems certain that Portugal will host the 1998 summit, probably in Oporto. [end recording]
