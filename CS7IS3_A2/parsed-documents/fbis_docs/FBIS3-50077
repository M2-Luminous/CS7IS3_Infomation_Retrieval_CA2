Before he left, Minister Granic held a brief news conference, that was also attended by our reporter Branko [word indistinct]. Setting out the aim of his visit to Strasbourg, Dr. Mate Granic said: [Granic] "Croatia has special guest status in the Council of Europe, while at this moment the process of it becoming a full member has been frozen. The basic aims of my stay in Strasbourg will be to explain Croatian positions in the talks in Geneva, especially the joint declaration between the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and the talks with the Bosnian Muslim side, and there will also be a discussion of all open questions during a meeting with the most senior officials in the Council of Europe. A news conference will also be organized." [Announcer] After he was asked to do so by journalist, Minister Granic also set out the standpoints and plans of the Republic of Croatia regarding the Partnership for Peace [PFP] initiative. [Granic] "Croatia welcomes this initiative. President Tudjman, even during the peace talks in Bonn welcomed the NATO decisions, and also welcomed the initiative during his talks with Mrs. Madeleine Albright. Our ambassador in the Council of Europe did the same during a meeting of CSCE senior officials. Croatia will carefully study all the documents and in a very short time send its offer to NATO. It should be stressed that Croatia is conscious of specific realities -- namely that 25 percent of our territory is under UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] supervision. At the same time, Croatia will do everything to develop and strengthen democratic institutions, especially the Croatian Army, which has no roots in the Warsaw Treaty [Organization], but developed out of a defensive war the system of which has the same basis as in all democratic countries of Europe; it makes use of all the best expert and scientific knowledge and also democratic (?rules). We will very rapidly get in touch with the North Atlantic Alliance and after this we will send it our offer. This will be Croatia's offer to the PFP initiative." [Announcer] On his return from Strasbourg on Tuesday [25 January] Dr. Mate Granic will be present at talks in Ljubljana between the Croatian and Slovenian prime ministers. Asked what he expects from this meeting, Dr. Granic said: [Granic] "I believe that over these last 10 days or so an important step has been taken in the preparation of this meeting. I will be joined by Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic because this will be a meeting between prime ministers and foreign ministers, and I think that an important step will be taken to resolve our problems, and of course prepare for the signing of very important agreements. We believe that all the conditions exist for an agreement to be reached on all economic questions -- the questions of Krsko [nuclear plant] and Ljubljanska Banka [Ljubljana Bank] and also agreements on property and legal issues, as well as an economic agreement and numerous other important agreements." [Announcer] According to Minister Granic there will also be talks on the Bay of Piran, the question of borders, highways, and other questions important to Croatia and Slovenia.
