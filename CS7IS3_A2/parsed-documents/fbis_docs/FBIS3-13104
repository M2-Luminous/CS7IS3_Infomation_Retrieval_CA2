[Rabin] We have no intention of letting these incidents go unnoticed. We will take steps when we see fit in order to prevent the recurrence of such incidents. Those who perpetrated the attacks will be punished. [Nisan] Are you now sending signals to those who perpetrated the attacks? [Rabin] I am not sending any signals. We are in a state of war and not a dialogue with Hizballah and the Palestinian rejectionist terror organizations. On the other hand, there is no doubt that the Lebanese and Syrian Governments must do their share in calming the situation if they ever wish to promote the peace process.
