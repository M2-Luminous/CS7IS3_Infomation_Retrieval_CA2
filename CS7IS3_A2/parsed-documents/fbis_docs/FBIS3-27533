Kozyrev spoke during an interview with the ITAR-TASS news agency, commenting on the arrest of Aldrich Ames and his wife who are accused of spying for Russia and the former Soviet Union for nine years. The case should be left to the decision of relevant special agencies, the foreign minister said. He expressed regret over the incident, but added that such cases occur all the times between countries, even between member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and between the United States and Israel. He stressed that the partnership between Russia and the United States has reached a high level and will not be affected by such a spy case. He hoped that the American couple's case would not be related to President Boris Yeltsin's latest initiative for settling the Bosnian crisis. It is inadvisable to turn the case into a political and ideological scandal, he said. It has also been reported that the CIA will soon send a delegation to Moscow to work out a solution to the issue with the Russian Intelligence Agency. Ames, chief of the Soviet branch of the CIA's Counterintelligence Group during 1983-1985, allegedly sold information about CIA operations and personnel for more than 1.5 million U.S. dollars. The Clinton administration lodged a strong protest over the case and warned that Russian diplomats involved in the case would be punished.
