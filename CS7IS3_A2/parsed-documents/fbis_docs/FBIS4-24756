"At this point, there has not been any U.S. decision taken about those next steps because we want to work in tandem with the international community on this and hear back from the IAEA (the International Atomic Energy Agency)," Department Spokeswoman Christine Shelly said at a regular news briefing here. The WASHINGTON POST today reported that a group of senior U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Defense Secretary William Perry, met yesterday at the White House to prepare for formal diplomatic consultations about sanctions. This report was published as the DPRK and IAEA remain deadlocked over the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsular. The IAEA wants to conduct further inspections of DPRK's principal nuclear reactor, but differs with the DPRK over how such inspections should be conducted. "Certainly we have looked into the issue and about what kind of form that might take," Shelly said, but "We are not ready to actually move to the issue of sanctions yet." "So far, the IAEA has not informed us that it would be impossible to carry out analysis of the fuel to determine the reactor's operation history," she added. "We're really waiting to hear from the IAEA," Shelly noted, "We will then be able to make a decision about what is the appropriate U.S. response." On Monday [30 May], the U.N. Security Council urged the IAEA and the DPRK to start immediate consultations over measures necessary to resolve the issue.
