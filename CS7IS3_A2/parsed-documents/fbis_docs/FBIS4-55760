FBIS4-55760 "dreeu098__a94007" FBIS-EEU-94-098-A Daily Report 19 May 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic NATO's `Special Relations' With Russia Noted NATO's `Special Relations' With Russia Noted AU1905162294 Prague CTK in English 1437 GMT 19 May 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1905162294 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Prague May 19 (CTK) -- The Czech Foreign Ministry will not react to unofficial reports that NATO has conceded to pressure from Russia and offered it "special relations" with NATO alongside participation in the Partnership for Peace programme. Ministry spokesman Vit Kurfurst told CTK no official information on the offer had been received from Brussels. Kurfurst reminded reporters of Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec's speech at the Charles University Law Faculty in Prague a month ago when he "said clearly that we signed the Partnership for Peace in the form of 16+1 (i.e. the 16 NATO states plus the Czech Republic), and not 16+1+Russia". At his meeting with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko on March 17, Zieleniec said that if Russia insisted on a special status in the Partnership for Peace programme, as Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev had done several times, new negotiations on the programme would have to be launched. He said the Czech Republic was satisfied with the form of the programme and did not regard alteration as realistic. According to unofficial information from Brussels, NATO's special relations with Russia are separate from the Partnership for Peace, offered by NATO in January to former communist bloc countries with an unspecified possibility of future alliance membership. Besides the Czech Republic, 17 countries have so far joined the Partnership programme. At the beginning of the year, Russian representatives expressed willingness to join the scheme but later revised their view and accused NATO of not taking sufficient account of Russia's status as a great power.
