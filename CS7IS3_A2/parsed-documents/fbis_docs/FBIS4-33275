A resolution approved by representatives from 27 of the regional organization's member countries urged the U.S. Government to lift its restrictions against the Caribbean island, characterizing their effects as harmful to the Cuban people. The SELA text contemplates the need to reaffirm, among other principles, the sovereign equality of states, noninterference in the internal affairs of states, and freedom of trade and navigation, which are established in various international agreements. It is estimated that Cuba has lost approximately $40 billion as a result of the U.S. restrictions and efforts to hinder trade negotiations between the Cuban Government and foreign businessmen and institutions.
