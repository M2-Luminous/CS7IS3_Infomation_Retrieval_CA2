FR940831-2-00190 FR940831-2-00107 (iii) State-of-the-art conference techniques and program elements. (10 points). (i) Review Process Applications submitted in response to this competitive announcement will be reviewed and scored by a panel of Federal employees. The panel will make recommendations to the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, Department of Housing and Urban Development. The panel will assign numerical values based on the weighted selection criteria. Awards will generally be made in rank order, although a lower ranking application may be selected on the basis of cost-effectiveness over a higher ranking application. In the case of a numerical tie, preference will be given to the applicant with the highest numerical score for the Quality of the Plan. The final award decision will be made by the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, Department of Housing and Urban Development. Letters will be sent to all applicants notifying them that their proposal has been selected or the reason(s) it was not selected. HUD will then negotiate specific terms of the award with the selected applicant(s). (j) Administrative Requirements (1) Award Period The grant will be cost reimbursable, and awarded for a 1-year base period, with the option to extend the Agreement for an additional year(s). (2) Cooperative Agreement After the application has been approved, HUD and the applicant shall enter into a Cooperative Agreement (Form HUD&hyph;1044) setting forth the amount of the Cooperative Agreement and its applicable terms, conditions, financial controls, payment mechanism/schedule, and special conditions. (k) Other Matters Environmental Review Grants under this program are categorically excluded from review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) in accordance with 24 CFR 50.20(p). However, prior to an award of grant funds, HUD will perform an environmental review to the extent required by HUD's environmental regulations at 24 CFR part 50, including the applicable related authorities at 24 CFR 50.4. Federalism Impact The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined that the policies contained in this notice will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions, or the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government and, therefore, the provisions of this notice do not have ``federalism implications'' within the meaning of the Order. The notice only makes available technical assistance for housing authorities to address the problem of drug-related crime. Family Impact The General Counsel, as the Designated Official for Executive Order 12606, the Family, has determined that the provisions of this notice have the potential for a positive, although indirect, impact on family formation, maintenance and general well-being within the meaning of the Order. This notice is intended to provide funding for technical assistance that will improve the quality of life of public and Indian housing development residents, including families, by reducing the incidence of drug-related crime. Section 102 HUD reform act_documentation and public access requirements; applicant/receipt disclosures. Documentation and Public Access HUD will ensure that documentation and other information regarding each application submitted pursuant to this NOFA are sufficient to indicate the basis upon which assistance was provided or denied. This material, including any letters of support, will be made available for public inspection for a five-year period beginning not less than 30 days after the award of the assistance. Material will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. In addition, HUD will include the recipients of assistance pursuant to this NOFA in its quarterly Federal Register notice of all recipients of HUD assistance awarded on a competitive basis. (See 24 CFR 12.14(a) and 12.16(b), and the notice published in the Federal Register on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these requirements.) Disclosures HUD will make available to the public for five years all applicant disclosure reports (HUD Form 2880) submitted in connection with this NOFA. Update reports (also Form 2880) will be made available along with the applicant disclosure reports, but in no case for a period less than three years. All reports_both applicant disclosures and updates_will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. (See 24 CFR subpart C, and the notice published in the Federal Register on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these disclosure requirements.) Section 103 HUD Reform Act HUD's regulation implementing section 103 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 was published May 13, 1991 (56 FR 22088) and became effective on June 12, 1991. That regulation, codified as 24 CFR Part 4, applies to the funding competition announced today. The requirements of the rule continue to apply until the announcement of the selection of successful applicants. HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the making of funding decisions are limited by Part 4 from providing advance information to any person (other than an authorized employee of HUD) concerning funding decisions, or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair competitive advantage. Persons who apply for assistance in this competition should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted under 24 CFR Part 4. Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics (202) 708&hyph;3815. (This is not a toll-free number.) The Office of Ethics can provide information of a general nature to HUD employees, as well. Section 112 HUD Reform Act Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act contains two provisions dealing with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the taking of a management action by the Department and those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of housing units received or are based on the amount of assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt of assistance. Section 13 was implemented by final rule published in the Federal Register on May 17, 1991 (56 FR 22912). If readers are involved in any efforts to influence the Department in these ways, they are urged to read the final rule, particularly the examples contained in Appendix A of the rule. Prohibitions Against Lobbying Activities The use of funds awarded under this cooperative agreement is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of section 319 of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) (The ``Byrd Amendment'') and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of federal contracts, grants, or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative branches of the federal government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification regarding lobbying. Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients, and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000 must certify that no federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance.
