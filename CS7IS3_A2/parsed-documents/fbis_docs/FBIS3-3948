Agriculture and animal husbandry make up 80 percent of the region's local output, and this year the regional government will carry out a more preferential policy with regard to loans to the two sectors. The additional funds will be used mainly to promote the development of farmland, grassland, hydropower stations and other water conservancy facilities. The government will increase funding by seven million yuan (804,600 U.S. dollars) each year in an attempt to spread fine strains of crops. Chemical fertilizers will continue to be sold with government price support. The region will also appropriate 20 million yuan each year to ensure the construction of some key or small hydropower stations. The funding in animal husbandry will remain at ten million yuan a year as before. In addition to the central government's aid to impoverished areas, the regional government will expand the scale of loans to township and town enterprises to boost their growth.
