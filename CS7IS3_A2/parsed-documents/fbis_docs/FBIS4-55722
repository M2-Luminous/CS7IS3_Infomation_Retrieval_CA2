After the meeting, Jan Borkowski, chairman of the Commission for European Treaty Matters, said that the most important issue discussed today was a proposal by Polish parliament members for Poland to participate in the work of setting up the new European Union [EU] institutions that are to emerge after the states of Central and East Europe are accepted as members of the organization. According to Borkowski, Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy suggested during the talks that Poland should gain permanent observer status in the European Parliament. Borkowski said Delors agreed that an initiative should be taken to enable Poland to cooperate in reforming the EU. He added that Poland does not want only to be a recipient of EU decisions and to stand outside, but that it also wants to contribute to the creation of new structures in which it is going to participate in the future.
