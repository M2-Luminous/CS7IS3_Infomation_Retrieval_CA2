FR941019-2-00019 FR941019-2-00018 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Financial Assistance Award (GRANT) AGENCY: U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). ACTION: Grant Solicitation Awards for Laser Fusion Research Applications. SUMMARY: Pursuant to 10 CFR 600.15, The U.S. DOE announces that it plans to conduct a technically competitive solicitation for basic research experiments in high energy density studies at the National Laser's User's Facility (NLUF) located at the University of Rochester Laboratory for Laser Energetics (UR/LLE). Grant Solicitation No. DE&hyph;PS03&hyph;95SF20539. Universities or other higher education institutions, private sector not-for-profit organizations, or other entities are invited to submit grant applications. The total amount of funding expected to be available for the Fiscal Year 1995 (FY95) program cycle is $450,000. Multiple awards are anticipated. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Hank Jones, DOE Oakland Operations Office, 1301 Clay Street, Room 700N, Oakland, CA 94612&hyph;5208, (510) 637&hyph;1868. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Interested parties can obtain a 31/2 ’ ’ computer floppy disk of the solicitation document by submitting a written request; specify WordPerfect 5.0 for DOS or Microsoft Word 5.0 for Macintosh. The solicitation document contains all the information relative to this action for prospective applicants. The solicitation is targeted for release in October 1994. The actual work to be accomplished will be determined by the experiments and diagnostic techniques that are selected for award. Proposed experiments and diagnostic techniques will be evaluated through scientific peer review against predetermined, published and available criteria. Final selection will be made by the DOE. It is anticipated that multiple grants will be awarded within available funding. The unique resources of the NLUF are available to scientists for state-of-the-art experiments primarily in the area of inertial fusion and related plasma physics. Other areas such as spectroscopy of high ionized atoms, laboratory astrophysics, fundamental physics, materials science, and biology and chemistry will be considered on a secondary basis. The LLE was established in 1970 to investigate the interaction of high power lasers with matter. Available at the LLE for NLUF researchers is the upgraded OMEGA LASER, A 30 Kj uv, 24-beam laser system (at 0.35um) suitable for direct-drive ICC implosions, and the Glass Development Laser (GDL), a 250 billion watt, single beam prototype for the variety of experiments including laser-plasma interactions and atomic spectroscopy. The NLUF program for FY95 is to concentrate on experiments than can be done with the OMEGA laser at the University of Rochester and development of diagnostic techniques suitable for the upgraded OMEGA system. Measurements of the laser coupling, laser-plasma interactions, core temperature, and core density are needed to determine the characteristics of the target implosions. Diagnostic techniques could include either new instrumentation, development of analysis tools, or development of targets that are applicable for 30 kJ direct-drive implosions. Additional technical information about the facilities and potential collaboration at NLUF can be obtained from: Dr. James Knauer, Manager, National Laser User's Facility, University of Rochester/LLE, 250 East River Road, Rochester, NY 14623.
