President Mwinyi reiterated this advice during separate talks at State House in Dar es Salaam today, when he met with delegations from the Rwandan Government and the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF]. He said the meeting, which Tanzania will be convening in Arusha on 23 April, seeks to give the warring sides in Rwanda a chance to end the civil war and to consider ways for immediately implementing the Arusha Accord. Speaking to Rwandan Home Affairs Minister Faustin Munyazesa, who was heading his government's delegation, President Mwinyi stressed that the delay in the implementation of the Arusha Peace Accord had led to the eruption of war and slaughter in Rwanda. He said the only solution was for all the parties to implement a cease-fire, end the killings, and discuss the implementation of the Arusha Accord. President Mwinyi assured the first vice chairman of the RPF, Mr. Patrick Mazimpaka, that next Saturday's meeting in Arusha did not aim to begin new talks on a peace agreement, but to discuss feasible ways of implementing the accord in the context of the new political situation in Rwanda. He emphasized that the Rwandan crisis was political, and hence called for a political, not a military, solution. Mr. Mazimpaka assured President Mwinyi that the RPF's objective was to halt the killings so that the Arusha Accord could be implemented, not to take over power through the barrel of the gun.
