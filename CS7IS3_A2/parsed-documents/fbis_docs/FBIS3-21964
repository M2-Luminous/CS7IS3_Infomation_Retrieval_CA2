This is the largest hashish seizure that police and customs officials have made in recent years. The 36-year-old, who is an Icelandic citizen, is being held for preliminary investigation in Grasten. The criminal police in Aabenraa have charge of the investigation. [passage omitted] Icelandic police revealed that the man has lived in Spain for a number of years, and that earlier he had been convicted for drug smuggling in both Iceland and Great Britain. The finding of the 100 kg of hashish in the man's baggage is the biggest single seizure at the Danish-German border in recent years. For all of 1993 only around 30 kg were seized at the border. The two preceding years, customs and police officials found about 400 kg of hashish. Reduced customs inspection at the border following Denmark's joining the Internal Market in 1993 was named by the chief of the Sonderborg Customs and Taxation Region as the reason for authorities more rarely uncovering attempts at narcotics smuggling.
