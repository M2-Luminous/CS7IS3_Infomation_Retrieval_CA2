They have been slugging each other off and fighting each other for weeks. Now, General Kamina of Alhaji Koromah's military command has called us up to launch a scathing attack on the ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] peacekeeping force, and especially the Nigerians. Robin White asked him what his complaint was: [Begin recording] [Kamina] They have been aiding the dissident group to bring total split into ULIMO forces and to derail the entire peace process. [White] Why on earth should the Nigerians want to do that? [Kamina] Sure, they have been promised a lot of things. These guys have told them that they are going toward the diamond mining areas and other areas. This is the Nigerian ECOMOG particularly I'm talking about. Most of them on the ground with the command of General Togun, they have been promised everything on the ground there; that they are going to get everything, all the wealth and resources. [White] It does seem most unlikely. I mean ECOMOG and Nigerian troops are there to try and keep the warring factions apart. [Kamina] I am telling you that they have been aiding and transporting arms and ammunition through everywhere. Through Tubmanburg and along the route side, they are carrying on these dissident forces there, transporting them and derailing the whole peace process. These guys are plenty men. They are having men disguised into ECOMOG uniform, fighting all along [words indistinct] to Tubmanburg. [White] So is your faction currently losing? [Kamina] We are not losing. We are determined to fight but we want to register this to the world that the ECOMOG forces, the Nigerian contingent, are on the ground and continue to aid the dissident forces that we are still fighting and we want to tell the world that we will never relent. We will keep fighting this thing here until ECOMOG, the Nigerian contingent is [word indistinct] from that ground totally. [White] Aren't you just blaming the Nigerians for what after all are your own problems? [Kamina] I am saying that the Nigerians, particularly wherever they are there is a problem there. Even the LPC [Liberian Peace Council] to see for itself. They have created another group in Charles Taylor area to support the LPC thing. [end recording]
