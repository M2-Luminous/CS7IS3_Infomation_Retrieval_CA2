The official predicted that overseas study in China will be activated and liberalized when China is excluded from "specific" countries in the government's "guideline on exchanges with northern (former and present communist) countries" in late March. "China is now among the specific countries targeted by the guideline, so students who want to study in China are not able to gain favors like suspended military service," the official noted.
