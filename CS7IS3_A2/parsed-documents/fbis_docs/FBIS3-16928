Which One Will Supreme Court Choose?"] [Text] The investigation into the State Committee for the State of Emergency [SCSE] case is the way to establish the historical truth, Yuriy Baturin, an aide to the Russian president, believes. "If the renewed judicial investigation into the SCSE case is brought to an end once again, it will have major moral repercussions for society. Society will be led away from the quest for the historical truth." This position was voiced in an interview with this ITAR-TASS correspondent by Yuriy Baturin, the Russian president's national security aide. And he particularly emphasized in the conversation that his opinion should in no way be interpreted as pressuring the Supreme Court. Baturin's fears in connection with the emergence of new "blank spots" in the country's history are based on the fact that in the prevailing situation -- whereby the SCSE members have been granted an amnesty in violation of Article 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, following which this decision was repealed by the Military Collegium -- at the stage of the scheduled new judicial investigation, three options are possible: either the search for the truth is continued until a conviction or acquittal is gained, after which the amnesty would come into force; or the case is sent for additional investigation; or the case is closed. "If the Supreme Court takes the first option it will trigger a new judicial investigation. This would mean restoring legality and continuing the search for the truth. Then we could take our hat off to the Supreme Court," Yuriy Baturin said. The second option -- of sending the case back for additional investigation -- would mean that the prosecutor's office would again study 150 bulky volumes of evidence. The third option would be to close the case at the new stage in light of the legitimate ground of the act of amnesty. "This may be a well-conceived way of legitimately closing the case illegally," was how Baturin put it, since, although it was illegal to close the case in the course of the judicial investigation, the law does not prevent this now that a new investigation is in preparation.
