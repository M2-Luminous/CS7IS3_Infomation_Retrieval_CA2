FBIS3-46520 "dreas001__a94018" FBIS-EAS-94-001-A Document Type:Daily Report 3 January 1994 ANNEX Japan Poll: High Support for Partial Rice Opening OW2712141093 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN in Japanese 24 Dec 93 Morning Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2712141093 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] YOMIURI SHIMBUN conducted a nationwide survey on 18 and 19 December regarding the government's decision to partially open Japan's rice market. In the survey, 8 percent of those questioned termed the decision "reasonable" and 69 percent called it "unavoidable," making a total of 77 percent who found the decision acceptable. The results clarify that more than three-fourths of the people accept the government's decision. However, 19.4 percent "opposed" it. Asked if Japan should accept rice tariffication after a six-year grace period, during which time the market will be partially open, 43 percent of the respondents said "tariffication should not be accepted," while as many as 35 percent said "it should be accepted." The results show that public acceptance of liberalizing Japan's rice market is on the rise. In a similar poll in October, 62 percent supported opening the rice market and 30 percent opposed. The results cannot be compared directly with those of this month's survey because the December survey asked specifically about the partial opening of the market. Nonetheless, in this month's survey 22 percent of those who "opposed" the partial opening said "rice tariffication should be accepted" after the six-year grace period. This may mean those who oppose the partial opening do so because they want the market to be fully opened. Also, as many as 50 percent of those who are in the agricultural, forestry, and fisheries industries called the partial opening "unavoidable." When asked about how they think the partial opening will affect Japanese rice farming, the majority said "the structure of rice farming will be improved," while 44 percent said "rice farming will be on the decline." In response to other questions, more than 70 percent said "ensuring the safety of imported rice will be a major problem;" 62 percent said rice, the staple food in Japan, "will steadily be supplied;" and 70 percent said "there will be little change" in rice prices.
