The entire city is again targeted, but the area around the hospital and the hospital itself, half of which is almost completely demolished, are exposed to the heaviest attacks. It is impossible to provide aid to the wounded, what with the constant attacks with tanks and rockets and the lack of all kinds of medicine and sanitary material. The lives of the wounded and the medical staff are in constant danger. The tanks on the right side of the Drina River are only several hundred meters from the hospital. At 0845 they moved a bit closer to the center of the city, demolishing it house by house on their way. At 0910 the chetniks opened heavy small arms fire from all their positions on the right bank. However, the front lines have not moved and the entire city is still under the control of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. The chetniks are attacking fiercely on the left bank. The district of (Obarac) is under attack, while tanks have been demolishing the 1 May Street from the direction of the city stadium. The attacks are also intensifying at the defense line toward [word indistinct], where the aggressor has been bringing reinforcements. [Word indistinct] missiles have been fired from Ustipraca at the eastern sector, and from (?Stubiste) at the southern sector.
