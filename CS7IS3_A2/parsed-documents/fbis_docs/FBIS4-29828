Two conservative Liberal members of the New South Wales state parliament invited MPs to visit the Villawood Detention Centre in western Sydney, where they said Cambodian boatpeople had been held for up to four years. State Multicultural and Ethnic Affairs Minister Michael Photios organised the Monday tour with colleague Brad Hazzard for delegates from all parties to inspect conditions. The New South Wales state government is a conservative alliance of Liberal and National parties while the Australian Government of Prime Minister Paul Keating is Labor. Photios said he was outraged when Australian Immigration Minister Nick Bolkus formally denied access to the delegation of more than 20 state MPs, mostly state government parliamentarians. A spokeswoman for Bolkus said the minister had written to Photios and Hazzard saying the MPs were playing political games with the issue and under the circumstances he was not prepared to accommodate the request. She said Bolkus first heard of the proposed visit through the daily SYDNEY MORNING HERALD newspaper following an approach to the paper by Hazzard. There was "quite a big lag" between that report and Photios' letter to Bolkus' office asking for permission to visit the centre, indicating to the minister that it was a political exercise, the spokeswoman said. "He did point out to Photios ... that a whole range of people do have access to Villawood including all the relative support agencies and non-government agencies," she said. "People can also visit on the invitation of the detainees themselves." Photios said he understood seven long-term detainees, mostly women and children, were being held at Villawood, while 16 others remained in a similar centre at Port Hedland in Western Australia's north. "If it is good enough for Australian parliamentarians to monitor the process of democracy in South Africa, it is good enough for state parliamentarians to monitor what happens in their own backyards," Photios said. Bolkus' spokeswoman said only one Cambodian boatperson remained at Villawood and he was booked on a flight back to Cambodia within the next week or so. Photios said the Australian Government allowed thousands of illegal immigrants to move freely around Australia while they waited for decisions on their status. However, he said the boat people were detained because they had arrived illegally when, at the time, there was no legal way for them to get to Australia. "Jailing them, while people who overstay tourist and student visas are not detained, is the height of hypocrisy," Photios said.
