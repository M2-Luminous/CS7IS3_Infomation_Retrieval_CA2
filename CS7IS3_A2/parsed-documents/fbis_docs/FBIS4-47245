This has been connected to a decisive extent with the inefficient use of the financial and credit resources of public enterprises and organizations, the unjustified increase in their crossover into nonstate structures, and the absence of precise mechanisms of the pursuit of a price policy and the regulation of wages and the currency market. All this is creating difficulties for the implementation of the program of market transformations and bringing about a growth of socioeconomic tension. To increase social protection of the population and ensure financial stabilization of the economy I resolve: 1. To establish as of 1 June 1994 minimum remuneration at 2,000 manat a month. 2. To appoint as of 1 June 1994 for social and nonworking retirees, students of day courses at higher educational institutions, and trainees of technical schools and vocational-technical schools monetary compensation amounting to 1,500 manat, and for families with a per capita monthly income of less than the minimum wage times two, monetary compensation amounting to 750 manat a month per child 16 years of age and under. These sums of compensation shall be paid from the resources of the republic budget. To consider lapsed in this connection the Republic of Azerbaijan presidential edict of 22 November 1993 "Payment of Compensation to Nonworking Retirees" and clause two of Republic of Azerbaijan presidential edict of 22 November 1993 "Supplementary Measures in the Field of Regulation of the Price of Bread and Bakery Products and Increased Social Protection for the Needy Strata of the Populace." 3.
