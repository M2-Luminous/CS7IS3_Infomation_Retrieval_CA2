FR940912-0-00078 FR940912-0-00018 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Part 64 [CC Docket No. 93&hyph;22; FCC 94&hyph;200] Interstate Pay-Per-Call Services AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Commission adopted this Order on Reconsideration to rule on petitions for reconsideration of a Report and Order which amended the Commission's pay-per-call regulations to implement the Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act (TDDRA). The Commission affirmed these rules with minor modifications, consistent with the TDDRA. The rules are intended to maximize telephone subscribers' protection against fraudulent and abusive practices without unduly burdening common carriers and providers of legitimate pay-per-call services.

On August 2, 1994, the Commission adopted an Order on Reconsideration in CC Docket No 93&hyph;22 (released August 31, 1994; FCC 94&hyph;200) (Order) ruling on petitions for reconsideration of a Report and Order, 58 FR 44769 (Aug. 25, 1993), which amended the Commission's pay-per-call regulations to implement the Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act of 1992, 47 CFR 228 (TDDRA). As explained below, the Commission affirmed, with minor modifications, regulations governing interstate pay-per-call and similar information services. 2. The Commission modified §64.1506 to clarify that services specifically exempted from the TDDRA's definition of ``pay-per-call'' need not be offered exclusively through 900 numbers. The Commission stated that it had not intended to negate the express exclusions from pay-per-call status enacted by Congress in the TDDRA, and, accordingly, amended §64.1506 to require that any interstate services possessing the basic pay-per-call attributes set forth in the statute and §64.1501(a)(1)&hyph;(2), and not subject to the exclusions stated in that section, must be offered only through telephone numbers beginning with the 900 service access code. 3. The Commission affirmed §64.1508(c) which requires local exchange carriers (LECs) to file federal tariffs for services that offer subscribers the option of blocking access to 900 numbers and also declined to permit LECs to satisfy the federal tariffing requirement by cross-referencing applicable state tariffs. The Commission found that it could implement the TDDRA's mandate that blocking services be reasonably priced most effectively by requiring the filing of federal tariffs. Federal tariffs assure that the Commission need not review individual state tariffs or await subscriber complaints to ensure that 900 number blocking is offered to subscribers at a reasonable charge. 4. Finally, the Commission affirmed, with minor modifications, §64.1510(b) of its rules. This section requires common carriers billing subscribers for information services provided on either a collect basis or under a presubscription or comparable arrangement to separate the charges for those services from charges for ordinary telephones services, to the extent possible, and include in each bill assessing such charges a brief statement of subscriber rights and responsibilities. Although the Commission recognized that these provisions are not required by the TDDRA, it concluded that they are necessary to protect consumers from fraudulent and deceptive practices associated with the provision of interstate information services. 5. The Commission noted that subscriber complaints filed with the Common Carrier Bureau over the past several months confirm and highlight the need for separate billing and consumer notification requirements, particularly when 800 numbers are used to provide information services, purportedly under a presubscription or comparable arrangement. The Commission's rules require that a valid presubscription arrangement be established as a contractual agreement between a caller and an information provider (IP) after the caller is fully informed of the rates and conditions for using the information service and agrees to take the service on the terms offered. The IP must require use of a personal identification number (PIN) to guard against access by unauthorized persons. However, the complaints received by the Commission indicate that information providers apparently read the Automatic Number Identification (ANI) of the originating telephone line and issue a PIN to the caller without ascertaining that that individual is both the subscriber to the originating line and legally capable of entering into a contractual agreement. The subscriber to the originating line is then charged for a call to the IP on the basis of ANI and, unless the bill segregates such charges, the subscriber to the originating line may not be aware that charges for information services have been billed. The Commission emphasized that this practice does not establish a valid presubscription arrangement and that unless an IP has ascertained that the subscriber to the originating line is, in fact, the caller who agreed to purchase information services, the IP may not use ANI in order to bill charges to the originating line. The Commission also noted that LECs have often used confusing or misleading language in displaying charges for 800 number information services and, accordingly, directed carriers to render bills that accurately reflect the charges assessed. 6. The Commission also ruled that, while IPs generally appear to have abandoned collect calls as a means of providing information services, LECs should include in their billing contracts a requirement that entities on whose behalf collect calls are billed take reasonable steps to segregate any collect calls for information services.
