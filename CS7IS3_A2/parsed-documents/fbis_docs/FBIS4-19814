In the BERLINER ZEITUNG (Wednesday [20 April] edition), defense experts of CDU and Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] called for the abolition of compulsory military service. CDU politician Otto Hauser called for general compulsory service for men. In the future, there should be a free choice between military service or national alternative service, between police and fire brigade, disaster relief and environmental service. "Compulsory military service is outdated." Anyone who further reduces the Bundeswehr departs from the concept of compulsory military service, the defense expert said, referring to plans to reduce the Bundeswehr to 320,000 men. Referring to Ruehe, the CDU politicians said: "I have never seen such behavior by a defense minister." One cannot push such profound changes in the armed forces through parliament in a "mad dash." He thinks the course that has been set is substantively wrong. Anyone who serves in the military for 10 months is effectively available for only eight months. FDP Politician Juergen Koppelin said that he favors general compulsory service for men and women. There is no way to avoid an army of volunteers if compulsory military service is shortened further. One can hardly find words to describe the defense minister's confusion, criticized the FDP politician. "Mr. Ruehe finally must present a concept instead of constantly manipulating the figures." Compulsory military service of 10 months would throw the Bundeswehr into organizational chaos.
