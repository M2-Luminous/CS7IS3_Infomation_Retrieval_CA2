At a meeting in western Matanzas Province, Minister Jordan, who is a member of the Politburo of the ruling Communist Party of Cuba, said the state will impose a tax on "fallow lands" to force private rural landowners to produce. He said, "We must make demands on those who fail to comply and, if necessary, apply the penalties prescribed by the Agrarian Law without fail." In the first admission by a public official of the farmers' reluctance to sell crops to the state, Jordan said, "There are landowners who have not delivered even one quintal of agricultural products over the course of the year; this is totally unacceptable." The official demanded that private farmers who control 20 percent of the country's arable land comply with their obligation to sell crops to the so-called collection centers that are in charge of marketing for the state. "Feeding the people is a sacred task, and those who possess land and make production commitments through agreements with the state must fulfill their obligations," Jordan insisted. The minister's warning coincided with the publication in the official press of reports regarding a drop in the production of tubers and vegetables in 1993. Many private farmers prefer to sell their crops to middlemen or consumers who visit the rural areas on weekends to buy provisions at prices higher than the official price. "There are farmers who do not sell their crops to the state's collection centers and who seek to enrich themselves by other means," said the weekly newspaper TRABAJADORES, the mouthpiece of the unions. The weekly said that in 1993, the production of various crops, including vegetables and tubers, dropped 77 percent in comparison to the 1992 crop, and this was made evident by empty stores in Havana. According to the source, the volume of agricultural production by the cooperative-peasant and state sectors declined, and the ensuing deficit has led to a reduction in other related crops. Private farmers produce 35 percent of the country's total agricultural production, producing more than the state in crops such as coffee, tobacco, tomatoes, onions, garlic, green peppers, and carrots. In terms of land distribution, from September onward state agriculture has been reorganized into basic units of cooperative production which are managed by experienced farmworkers. These units control some 80 percent of the island's arable land. Following the two agrarian reform programs implemented in the sixties, there are some 200,000 registered private farmers affiliated with the National Association of Small Farmers. As a group, these private farmers own more than 865,000 hectares of land, which are distributed among 2,260 farming cooperatives. Some 125,000 farmers refused to pool their land together but maintain a certain level of cooperation through "credit and services cooperatives." Private rural farmers had sold their products at the so-called "farmer's free markets" which flourished up until 1986, when the government ordered them closed to avoid "excessive enrichment."
