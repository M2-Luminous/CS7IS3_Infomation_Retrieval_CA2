However, sound cost reduction measures also are being refined in a more modest sense by the industry. It is a reduction of distribution costs such as by enlargening tank trucks. Then, it also appears that something will come of substantial regulation relaxation. A superlarge tank truck with a 24-kiloliter load capacity was seen for the first time in Japan at the Sakai oil refinery of General Sekiyu on 2 June. It is no more than a test vehicle with no General logo or anything on the body, but the appearance of a 24-kiloliter truck was epochal for the industry. Previously, a 20-kiloliter capacity tank truck had been the biggest in Japan, but up to a 30-kiloliter capacity has become possible by the relaxation of Fire Services Act regulations which took effect on 1 April. If there is 1.5 times the load capacity, very simply speaking, the number of truck trips will be two-thirds that of the present and it should become a big weapon in lowering distribution costs. However, a different regulation wall is standing in the way even with this relaxation of regulations. That is the Road Law provision which prescribes that "The weight per vehicle axle must be less than 10 tons." A 20-kiloliter truck has a structure with a total of three axles, one axle directly under the driver's seat, and one axle each under the front part and the back part of the tank. The total weight of the 20 kiloliters of fuel and the vehicle body is less than 30 tons and it can clear the provision of 10 tons per axle. In transporting over 20 kiloliters of fuel, however, somehow it must add one axle. Normally, the axle in the back part of the tank is changed to two axles. If that is done, the length of the vehicle will be extended for the added axle portion and balance. Vehicle length must be extended to a certain extent because of the need to enlarge the tank, and the Road Law regulation restricts free design. The vehicle length of current 20-kiloliter trucks is 11.79 meters, but according to test design, a 24-kiloliter capacity would be 14.70 meters, and a 26 kiloliter capacity would be 15.50 meters. Considering turning radius and Japanese road conditions, it is said that 24 kiloliters is the maximum size that can be realized. The limit of 30 kiloliters obtained in the relaxation of regulations cannot be fully put to use. Of course, the Road Law was determined considering strength of bridges and elevated roads and wear on roads. However, traveling with over 10 tons per axle is possible on many roads in the Tokyo metropolitan area. The petroleum companies also will not use superlarge trucks to deliver to all stations, and they should be able to use them within the limits of being able to make deliveries on roads where the strength is confirmed. On the other hand, if a 30-kiloliter truck is achieve, not a few stations will raise a cry. According to the Fire Services Act, the largest storage tank that can be installed at a station is 50 kiloliters for gasoline, and 80 kiloliters is considered the limit for total light oil and kerosene. With the current mainstream 14-kiloliter trucks or 20-kiloliter trucks, the tank is finally filled with four or five delivery trips, but with the 30 kiloliter, the tank will be filled with less than three trips. In other words, a station cannot accept a truck unless the storage volume has decreased to about 60 percent and the inventory level becomes unstable at stations where a large amount is sold. That is because there is a fear that inventory will run out if there is some confusion in the truck service and deliveries are delayed. If the transport means is made large, the receiving tank also needs to be made large. Another big thing in truck delivery is the problem of observing unloading. Under the present situation, a qualified person at the station must personally observe it. Except for stations with 24-hour operation, it is necessary for large trucks to run around during the day. If a driver could unload by himself, he could deliver late at night or early in the morning, taking advantage of relief from traffic congestion and shortened delivery time. It is apt to be overlooked, but the greatest part in petroleum sales cost is distribution cost. In reducing costs on the procurement side such as import or transfer of business, uncertain factors such as market prices follow in the shadows. Thus, it is not strange that efforts to lower the price of gasoline begin from reduction of distribution costs by sound relaxation of regulations.
