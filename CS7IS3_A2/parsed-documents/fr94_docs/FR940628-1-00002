FR940628-1-00002 FR940628-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 9 CFR Parts 53, 71, 82, 92, 94, and 161 [Docket No. 87&hyph;090&hyph;1] RIN 0579&hyph;AA22 Exotic Newcastle Disease in Birds and Poultry; Chlamydiosis in Poultry AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: We are proposing to revise completely subpart A of part 82 of title 9, Code of Federal Regulations, concerning exotic Newcastle disease in birds and poultry, and psittacosis or ornithosis in poultry. We have reviewed part 82 as part of our ongoing review of existing regulations, and believe that a complete revision of subpart A is necessary. Revising the regulations would make them easier to understand, thereby increasing compliance with the regulations, and would make them more effective in preventing the interstate spread of these diseases. We are also proposing to amend parts 53, 71, 92, 94, and 161 of Title 9, Code of Federal Regulations, to reflect the amendments to part 82 we are proposing. DATES: Consideration will be given only to comments received on or before August 29, 1994. ADDRESSES: Please send an original and three copies of your comments to Chief, Regulatory Analysis and Development, PPD, APHIS, USDA, room 804, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782. Please state that your comments refer to Docket No. 87&hyph;090&hyph;1. Comments received may be inspected at USDA, room 1141, South Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays. Persons wishing to inspect comments are encouraged to call ahead (202&hyph;690&hyph;2817) to facilitate entry into the comment reading room. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. C.M. Groocock, Senior Staff Veterinarian, Emergency Programs Staff, VS, APHIS, USDA, room 746, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20872, (301) 436&hyph;8240. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Part 82 The regulations in 9 CFR part 82, subpart A, restrict the interstate movement of certain poultry, birds, and other items from premises and areas quarantined because of exotic Newcastle disease, and psittacosis or ornithosis. 1 These regulations are designed to prevent the interstate spread of these contagious, infectious, and communicable diseases of birds and poultry, which could devastate the United States poultry industry. 1 Psittacosis and ornithosis are two different names for the same disease. However, ``psittacosis'' commonly refers to the disease in humans and birds and ``ornithosis'' refers to the disease in poultry. We have reviewed the exotic Newcastle disease and psittacosis/ornithosis regulations in accordance with our regulatory review plan, which provides for ongoing review of existing regulations. Based on this review, we believe a complete revision of these regulations is necessary.
