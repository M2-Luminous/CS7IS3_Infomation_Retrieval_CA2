[Golhan] Fine, thank you. This is the first time in 15 years I have attended the opera. I have left the hall to watch your program. [Birand] We thank you. Hundreds of thousands of people are waiting to hear what you have to say. We are sorry to have interrupted your opera. What I would like to ask is the following: Military affairs are always planned in advance. We are well aware that both the National Defense Ministry and the Chief of the General Staff's Office are very meticulous on the issue. It was your government that shortened the military service. Were you not aware that you would be faced with the current situation? If you were aware, then why did you shorten it? This is what everyone wants to know. [Golhan] Mr. Birand, naturally the problems and the potential risk facing Turkey when we shortened military service and the situation about a month or two ago -- or even the current situation -- are very different. In other words, we did shorten the military service from 18 to 15 months last year. It was the right decision at the time. Since then, however, certain changes have taken place in our neighbors. I would not like to name them now. Everyone is well aware to whom I am referring and which countries I would like to include in this basket. Our viewers are very intelligent and they will understand. If, however, I name names now, then there will be talk about the defense minister creating adversity against that country. Certain conclusions will be drawn. The foreign threat Turkey was facing yesterday is different than the one it is facing today. The current potential foreign threat is very different than the one in the past. This is the first issue. Secondly, we have for the last five or six months been repeatedly saying that we should be taking every necessary measure to end the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] curse we are facing. These operations will be concluded this winter and spring. Turkey will be rid of this problem. We have, for the last six months, been saying loudly that every possible measure will be taken to render these bandits ineffective. No doubt, certain decisions have to be taken in connection with these measures. These are the reasons for deferring the discharges from the armed forces. [Birand] Mr. Minister, the PKK problem existed last year as well. In other words, this problem existed when your government shortened the military service. As far as I know, threats against our country, whether they are from Syria, Russia, the Caucasus, or any other country, have not increased in the last few months. There is something here that no one can understand... [Golhan] Mr. Birand, I am sure you read the papers. [Birand] I read much more than the papers. [Golhan] Our viewers also read the papers. Have you not heard the voices rising from one of our neighboring countries? It was in the papers yesterday and today. [Birand] Obviously, but Mr. Minister... [Golhan] Did they exist yesterday? Did they exist five months ago? They did not, categorically not. [Birand] I do not believe that you can counter a threat against Turkey from Russia, Syria, Iran, or Iraq with 110,000 soldiers. What I am saying is that there is a mathematical error here. [Golhan] There is no mathematical error. Turkey has not declared mobilization. We are not seeking a mobilization cadre. [Birand] This is the atmosphere that has been created. [Golhan] We are obliged to maintain our peace cadres. We are obliged to maintain this cadre. This is what we are doing. Furthermore, it is obvious that we cannot discharge the current soldiers and place the new young recruits, who are fresh out of training and inexperienced in guerrilla warfare, to fight the PKK. [Birand] Could you not have met this shortage by transferring troops from other regions? May God bless it, we do have a large army. [Golhan] You cannot do that. As I have said earlier, Turkey is facing certain risks. In many regions you cannot reduce the number of troops to zero. You cannot reduce the forces and units deployed in certain regions. You cannot do that. We are implementing certain transfer of forces anyway. You cannot reduce the number of troops below a certain level. There are certain rules in the military. There are possible risks, threats which have to be taken into consideration. [Birand] Did the reaction to the decision disturb you? You are a politician and it was your government -- although you were not the defense minister at the time -- that first reduced the military service and is now increasing it. [Golhan] This is not true. We have not yet increased it. This is only a measure. We have told you that we will be carrying out an operation during the winter and spring. The PKK will definitely be rendered ineffective. In order to fulfill that promise, we need experienced soldiers who are familiar with the region. [Birand] What you are trying to say is that military service will be reduced again when the PKK is defeated. Is that the message? [Golhan] Naturally; the extension is on a one-time basis. The discharge of soldiers who were to be released in February and May has been deferred, on a one-time basis, for four months. This was the decision made by the Council of Ministers. [Birand] Does this mean that the next batch will serve a shorter term? [Golhan] Naturally, if Turkey attains the goals we have set. The government is determined on the issue. No matter what the consequences. [Birand] Then there is a condition. [Golhan] Of course there are conditions. The conditions were different yesterday and they have changed today. I hope Turkey will not be worse off in the next five to 10 months. I hope the situation will not be more critical. [Birand] If we want to summarize the conditions based on what you have told us, military service will be reduced after the PKK is defeated, and after Syria, Iran, Iraq, and Russia stop being a threat. [Golhan] I am not naming names. I am not naming the neighbors, you are. [Birand] Yes, I am naming them not you. [Golhan] You will remember, elections were held in our neighboring countries. You are also aware of the foundation these elections were based on. [Birand] Then those who will be drafted in the future will have to wait a while for these conditions to be fulfilled. [passage omitted] [Golhan] Turkey has always aspired for peace. For the last 70 years, we have been repeating the slogan "Peace at home, peace in the world." In spite of this, you are well aware that certain of our neighbors view Turkey as a potential threat and plan their deployment accordingly. [Birand] In a while, we will be broadcasting an interview with Zhirinovskiy, who described Turkey as a threat. [Golhan] See, you have already disclosed one of them. [passage omitted]
