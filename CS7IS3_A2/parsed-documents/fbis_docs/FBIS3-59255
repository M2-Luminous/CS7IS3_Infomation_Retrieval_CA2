With President Clinton's election in the United States, the policy stand that advocates active government intervention in the economy is on the ascendent, replacing the 1980's laissez-faire as advocated by former British Prime Minister Thatcher and former US President Reagan. I. Emphasize Stimulating Economic Growth; Besides Monetary Policies, Attention Is Focused on Fiscal Policies, Especially Direct Government Investments It began in the United States, Canada, and Britain and was followed by Japan and Germany -- nations have gone into economic recession since entering the 1990's. To stimulate economic recovery, many have lowered the interest rates again and again. For example, in the United States, the Federal Reserve has lowered the federal fund and discount rates 17 times between 1990 and 1992. The federal fund rate has dropped from 10 percent to 3.25 percent and the discount rate has fallen to 3 percent, the lowest in 27 years. Even Germany, which has always made controlling inflation its primary economic goal, has been under pressure from other nations and has lowered its interest rates six times since last September, and at the end of July, its discount rate had dropped to 6.75 percent and its collateralized loan rates had fallen to 7.75 percent. However, because of the 1980's monetary overexpansion, enterprises and individuals in the West are busy paying off old debts now that interest rates are down and are not increasing investment or spending, and therefore this monetary policy has not done much to stimulate the economy. For this reason, the United States, Europe, and Japan are seeking help from fiscal measures and increasing government spending to promote economic growth. Japan took the lead last August in announcing a 10.7 trillion yen ($86 billion) government spending plan. This April, it further proposed an unprecedented 13.2 trillion yen ($117 billion) package to combat recession: One-half of the money will be invested in the construction of public facilities. The European Community ratified an economic revitalization plan worth 42 billion in Eurocurrency at a summit meeting in Edinburgh last year and at the financial and economic ministers meeting this April, and in the summit meeting held in Copenhagen this June, they decided to add another 3 billion Eurocurrency's worth of investments. Primarily, they intend to increase government spending on infrastructure, encourage private investments, and help medium and small enterprises. To help the U.S. economy get out of the economic doldrums of the last several years, upon taking office, President Clinton unveiled a plan to use government investments to stimulate economic growth. The short-term measures include government investments of $28.3 billion this and next year. The money will be spent on the construction of public facilities, extending unemployment insurance, creating jobs, and providing tax credits to businesses. Although the Congress has only approved a very small portion of that plan, the plan itself is an indication that when it comes to "Clintonomics," the government will have a bigger role. Using government investments to stimulate economic growth is not a new theory or political stand. If we look at the history of development of this century's Western economic theories and economic policies, we will find that the period before the crisis of the 1930's was dominated by Marshall's neoclassical theory of free market economy. The great depression of the 1930's, a crisis of unprecedented depth, protraction, and scale, pronounced the bankruptcy of laissez-faire's claim that market mechanisms could achieve full employment and stability. Keynesianism which emphasized state interventions gradually swept the West and became the main theoretical basis for economic policies in many countries. Keynesian theory on controlling effective demand led to widespread state interventions, resulting in "big government, big spending, high taxes, and expensive welfare." Although it helped the Western developed nations achieve a high rate of economic growth after the War and through the 1960's, by the mid-1970's, its defects became increasingly obvious, manifesting themselves in the phenomenon of "stagflation," a condition of prolonged economic stagnation accompanied by runaway inflation. The late 1970's and early 1980's marked the rise of a new kind of laissez-faire in the form of monetarism as advocated by British Prime Minister Thatcher and in the supply-side economics which former U.S. President Reagan firmly believed in. "Thatcherism" and "Reaganomics" temporarily halted the stagflation in the West and helped sustain a fairly long period of slow growth, but they also left behind the ill consequences of big deficits, large debts, and high unemployment rate. Eventually in the early 1990's, another serious post-war economic recession erupted, again putting the theories of laissez-faire in jeopardy. The Bush administration, which inherited "Reaganomics," had no remedies and eventually lost the election. With the Democrats in the White House, the "anticlassical" school of Western economics is now on center stage. Of course, "Clintonomics" is not a complete revival of Keynesianism, and Clinton himself said that he has chosen a "third road" between Keynesianism and laissez-faire: While increasing government intervention, he wants to streamline government and reform the welfare system to cut budget deficits. "Clintonomics" in fact represents a new direction in today's Western economic policies, that is, Keynesianism is dead, and laissez-faire has gone through its rise and fall. Efforts must be made to combine the two to develop a new kind of economic theory and create new mechanisms. II. Putting Industrial Policy on the Government's Policy Agenda Industrial policy is the policy a government formulates to directly interfere in the development of some industries as a way to supplement the market's inadequate role. In Europe and the United States, because they believe in a relatively free economy, unless national security is threatened, they generally do not advocate government interference in industrial development. They believe that the government's choice of industries is often influenced by political interests while the rise and fall of industries should be determined by the market. Although some European countries and the United States have at times adopted policies to help certain industries, they have mostly been in the form of assistance and not direct promotion, and they have never been systematic. Since the late 1980's, the end of the Cold War has made economic competition, especially competition in science and technology, the focal point of international relationships. Amid the intense competition, Japan, which has a clear industrial policy, has seized the upper hand, and increasingly European and American industries are unable to compete. This is demonstrated by the large trade deficits against Japan and the fact that they are gradually losing ground to Japanese advanced technologies. In 1992, the United State ran up nearly $50 billion in trade deficits against Japan, which accounted for more than half of its foreign trade deficits. The European Community also has more than $30 billion in trade deficits against Japan. Faced with Japan's overwhelming offensive, and upon studying the Japanese government's success with the development of its automobile, electronics, and computer industries, advocates of European and U.S. industrial policies believe that the "market economy by itself cannot nurture industries deemed vital to the national economy, and therefore the government must intervene." To win in future economic competition and come out ahead in international competition, European and American governments have formulated important industrial development policies and plans, the most important of which are: 1. Setting up specialized government agencies to lead and coordinate national scientific research work. U.S. President Clinton has already proposed the setting up of a federal science, engineering, and technology coordination committee to plan government-funded R&D projects. The committee will be headed by the President's science and technology adviser and chairman of the White House Science and Technology Policy Office. The European Community Committee proposed a new set of scientific research guiding principles in March of this year which suggested setting up a technical assessment agency responsible for coordinating regional, national, and European Community tasks to strengthen the integration of their scientific and technical work. 2. Putting the emphasis on high-tech industries. With the constant development of science and technology, what determines the comparative advantage of a nation in terms of its ability to compete is no longer natural resources but scientific and technological resources. Therefore, a policy on science and technology has become the core of every nation's industrial policy. U.S.President Clinton pointed out again and again that "the key to a nation's economic success lies in taking the lead in technological invention and commercialization." Soon after he took office, he went to the Silicon Valley and announced that the government will try to form a partnership with industries to build more companies like those in the Silicon Valley which will introduce even more new technologies to help the United States maintain its lead. He also proposed specific plans to support the computer and telecommunications and others in the information industry and develop high-speed trains and a new generation of automobiles. In the Fourth General Research and Development Plan (1994-1998) proposed by the European Community in April of this year, scientific research outlay was increased to 13.3 billion in Eurocurrency, which more than doubled that under the Third Plan. Specifically, three-quarters of the funds will be spent on information and telecommunications technologies, industrial technologies, environmental science, life science, and energy industry. 3. Increasing the propagation and application of the results of R&D. Superiority in basic science and technology research is only potential ability to compete. To achieve real capability, the results of advanced science and technologies must find commercial applications. Therefore, while science and technology policy is the focal point of any industrial policy, the commercialization of the results of R&D is the focal point of any science and technology policy. The major policies most nations have adopted today are: A) Making R&D projects more practical. The United States has identified that the focus of federal R&D projects is on new technologies of significance to economic growth and has removed the word "Defense" from DARPA [Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency], changing it to ARPA, to put the emphasis on civilian technology research. The European Community meanwhile is prepared to allocate 600 million in Eurocurrency over the next few years to fund the assessment, development, and application of R&D results. B) Increasing the exchange of information between government and civilians. The United States will open up its national laboratories to civilians and is going to raise $80 billion before 1997 to set up an information network covering the nation's 50 states, so as to make sure that the government can play a more effective role in coordinating the propagation of information nationwide and in transferring the results of R&D. C) Providing financial and material support to the development of civilian R&D institutions. The United States has estimated that this step will cost the government an additional $6 billion over the next 4 years. To guide civilian enterprises in the development and utilization of advanced technologies, the U.S.government has also decided to set up a "Critical Technologies Research Institute" to turn the results of some R&D projects, such as numerically controlled machine tools and robotics, into products that can compete internationally within the next two to three years. 4. Emphasizing education and training. To improve the workers' technical skills so as to increase enterprise productivity and competitiveness, Europe and the United States have implemented educational reform and have raised the level of basic knowledge while adopting various measures to enhance the workers' professional training. In the EC's Fourth Science and Research Development Plan, for the first time, the importance of education and training was stressed, and 785 million in Eurocurrency was allocated to education. "Clintonomics" even emphasizes "putting people first." The federal government plans to spend $60 billion in the next four years on raising educational standards and training workers. In his new science and technology policy, President Clinton proposed implementing an education and training program to make sure that all American workers have a chance to continue their education. To make education and training more technology-oriented, the government will support the development of computers and telecommunications equipment used in schools and for professional training in enterprises. In addition, they have adopted active foreign trade policies to create an environment of "fair" competition, and internally they have amended their antitrust laws to encourage enterprises to join forces to meet foreign competition. III. Trade Management Has Become the Theme of the West's Trade Policies As the Western nations gradually put their industrial policies into effect, they also make drastic changes in their trade policies. Since the end of the War, the world trade system has been dominated by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT] whose purpose is to advance free trade. Despite the constant trade conflicts among nations, up through the Bush administration, free trade has been the main theme. Since President Clinton took office, however, he has pursued a more aggressive trade policy than his predecessors. He fights trade protectionism on the one hand and emphasizes fair trade on the other hand. Analysts believe that the developed nations, led by the United States, are changing their trade policies from free trade to managed trade. Its characteristics are: 1. More trade conflicts resulting from efforts to capture "fair" trade opportunities. Unlike protectionism's building of barriers to keep out foreign competition or the policy of non-intervention under laissez-faire, managed trade advocates highly competitive international trade, that is, it supports opening up the markets but meanwhile it seeks "fair" trade opportunities and emphasizes active government participation. Accordingly, while the Western governments continue to attach importance to mechanisms of multilateral cooperation, they often adopt unilateral measures of sanctions and retaliation. As soon as Clinton took office, he immediately adopted an aggressive trade policy. On 27 January, the Commerce Department announced the imposition of punitive tariffs on steel materials imported from 19 countries including those in Europe and Japan. Subsequently, it put pressure on Europe and Japan regarding government contracts and the aerospace, semi-conductor, and automobile industries and so on. At a US-Japan summit meeting, President Clinton directly asked Japan to formulate specific goals to open up its markets. Meanwhile, Europe and Japan have been waging a tit-for-tat battle. On 28 May, the United States announced a ban on several EC companies from bidding on U.S.federal government projects. In retaliation, at the 12 nation EC foreign minister meeting held on 8 June, U.S. companies were banned from bidding on EC member nation projects. Japan has also openly criticized the United States, saying that "using managed trade measures and unilateral threats will not resolve its trade balance problems." All these are attributable to the fact that since the end of the Cold War, economic security has become the focal point of foreign relations for all nations. President Clinton, who has made revitalizing the U.S.economy his primary administrative goal, has put opening up foreign markets as his foreign policy goal. His foreign policy clearly puts economics above all else. In a series of meetings with heads of states since he took office, Clinton has without exception put economic and trade issues first. Because of uneven economic and trade development, and adding the effects of the recession, it is expected that economic and trade conflicts among the United States, Europe, and Japan will further intensify. 2. More non-tariff trade barriers. Under GATT, nations have gradually lowered their tariffs. Today, the developed nations are imposing an average of 5 percent tariff on manufactured goods, and the developing nations' average tariff is only around 15 percent. For this reason, non-tariff trade barriers are becoming increasingly important, and governments too are playing an increasingly bigger role. Non-tariff barriers fall into five main categories. Besides the usual voluntary export limits, import quotas, and price controls, there are quasi tariff measures and administrative measures. The former measures refers to taxes imposed for the purpose of raising the price of imports. They include tariff quotas and seasonal tariffs. The latter refers to administrative measures to control the import of sensitive commodities. They primarily include the checking and monitoring of import prices and quantity and antidumping and antisubsidy measures, and specifically antidumping measures are most common. Based on GATT statistics, from July 1989 to June 1990, there were 96 antidumping cases in the international markets, but between January 1991 to June 1992, there were 237 cases. Some experts believe that antidumping has become a hidden EC industrial policy. Frequent antidumping activities have jeopardized GATT's success in reducing tariffs. It is estimate that if we add the antidumping tax, the average U.S.tariff on manufactured goods is 23 percent and not the nominal 6 percent. 3. The formation of regional economic blocs increases bilateral and regional cooperation. With the inauguration of the unified European market, the signing of NAFTA, and the emergence of economic cooperation mechanisms at different levels throughout Asia, the world economy is gradually separated into three major economic blocs comprised of America, Europe, and Asia. Because these three economic blocs control the absolute majority of world trade, regional economic blocs will dominate the development of trade policies of all nations. Currently, there is no consensus on what effects regional economic blocs will have on the world economy and on world trade, but one point is certain: The development of regional economic blocs will cause nations' trade policies to change from the kind of multilateralism advocated by GATT to those extending mutual benefits on a bilateral or regional basis. Most developing nations which have been excluded from the three major blocs will be at a disadvantage. 4. The scope of commodity management widens. With the constant improvement in the mix of products being traded, more and more products are put under trade management. European antidumping measures which included products such as ethanol, cement, and aspirin have expanded to cover forklifts and computers. The United State's agricultural product, automobile, steel, and semi-conductor industries are constantly putting pressure on the government for protection. In the 1990's, managed products not only will include labor intensive products and agricultural products but will also include labor and services and high tech products. The developed nations will especially stress protection of intellectual property rights. The developing nations will face increasingly greater pressure.
