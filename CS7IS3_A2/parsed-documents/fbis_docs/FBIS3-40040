Now the war of nerves will begin. Norway is pursuing a tough negotiating line in the final spurt of the EU negotiations. Yesterday Trade Minister Grete Knudsen refused to agree to a proposal from the EU to the effect that only regions north of the 62d parallel should enjoy additional agricultural support. She made it clear that the whole of Norway must be covered by any such arrangement. Briefly, the EU's proposal is that the Nordic countries can give additional agricultural support to the regions north of the 62d parallel and only in rare cases elsewhere. For Norway this would mean that only the regions north of Maloy in the west and Femunden in the east would be considered to have such difficult conditions affecting cultivation that they can be given lasting support arrangements. Another criteria is that the regions that qualify for support must have fewer than eight inhabitants per square kilometer. During yesterday's relatively short negotiating meeting, it emerged that the EU had adopted the 62d parallel because in its fisheries policy Norway has defined northern regions through the use of this line of latitude. However, in the view of the Norwegian negotiators these two things have nothing to do with each other. There are a number of regions in southern Norway that also have extremely difficult growing conditions. Grete Knudsen told the EU representatives that Norway is remaining firm on a system of support that is based on the number of growing days -- that is, the number of days every year when there is enough sun and warmth for agricultural produce to grow. One hundred and ninety growing days or less has been proposed as the limit. Finnish Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto said that Finland would ideally like to have everything north of the 60th parallel defined as Nordic agriculture, and 180 growing days as the limit. Norway and Finland are coordinating their policies in this area. Nor is Knudsen satisfied with the EU's latest initiative in the field of regional policy, even though we are here probably much closer to a negotiated agreement. The EU has proposed that the four northernmost provinces in Norway -- Finnmark, Troms, Nordland, and Nord-Trondelag -- should receive regional support from the EU's structural fund. The EU wants to introduce a completely new target category for regional support for the three Nordic countries. The so-called Objective 6 category will be in addition to the five categories the EU already has today. Ideally, Finland and Norway would like the countries to be covered by the Objective 1 classification that is the EU's main tool for support for regions where people have an annual income lower than the EU average. In practice support is given to areas where the average income is less than 80 percent of the EU average, and Norway takes the view that this is why this classification should be used. "If Objective 6 embraces the same as we want -- Objective 1 -- then it makes no difference what it is called," Grete Knudsen said. Like her Nordic counterparts, she will now take a closer look at the effect this will have on Norway, but the prospect is for a 10-percent-lower level of support with Objective 6 than Objective 1 would have given. The EU is proposing a 175 million ECU -- around 1.5 billion kroner -- framework for regional support in the Nordic area. Norway would probably receive around one-third of this money. Negotiations have not even started on the most difficult problems in the agricultural sector -- such as the demand for introduction of EU prices for agricultural produce from day one of membership. These problems are being saved up until the upcoming "superweekend," but the fronts seem deadlocked. Here Norway is standing shoulder to shoulder with Finland and Austria.
