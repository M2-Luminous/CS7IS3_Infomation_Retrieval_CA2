Yuriy Mikhaylov, the vice premier's advisor, told an ITAR-TASS correspondent that the prospects for bilateral cooperation were examined at the meeting. During the talks Oleg Soskovets noted that Russia continues to view Syria as a friendly state. "We must not waste all that we have achieved before in our relations," he said. "We have been friends for too long." Mustafa Talas supported the position of the Russian first vice premier. Nevertheless, the general noted a certain cooling in mutual relations between the two states, particularly in the last few years. He spoke of Syria's readiness to open a new page in cooperation with Russia. Oleg Soskovets described the agreement on cooperation between our two countries, which is being prepared for signing within the framework of the Russian delegation's visit, as first and foremost a political step. "The position of the Russian leadership is clear -- to enter into normal cooperation," he stressed.
