It is the first time that police have come across the devices by a pager signal, the police spokesman, Major Jose Lourenco, said. "It was not the work of amateurs, but of people who have a very precise knowledge of electronics and explosive devices," Lourenco said. Two men, aged 25 and 27, were arrested by police after a raid on a flat in Rua do Almirante Costa Cabral at about 7am on Saturday [26 March]. They were expected to appear before Macao District Court today. A team of officers from the Macao public security police discovered 30 detonators, a Chinese-made Makarov pistol, 20 rounds of ammunition and an amount of explosives. He said the men were arrested 24 hours after they had tried, unsuccessfully, to rob the Chan Hang frozen meat shop on Rua de Erva on Friday. The men left behind two pager bombs when they fled the shop after the proprietor bit one of them on the hand, triggering a gun shot that accidentally hit the other bandit. The bombs were defused by police but 15 minutes after they had been deactivated, the two pagers reacted to calls from the central paging station. Macao police sources said that the pager bombs were "extremely worrying for their criminal cunning". "Imagine someone putting a pager bomb somewhere in Macao, then after that travelling to China or Hong Kong and phoning from there to a pager station in Macao in order to trigger the explosion," one source said. "You could call it cross-border remote control." "Theoretically, you can put a pager bomb somewhere in America, then you leave that continent to make your pager station call from Asia or Europe."
