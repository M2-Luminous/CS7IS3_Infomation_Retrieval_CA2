Meet the Social Democrats"] [Text] What is Social Democracy? Social Democracy originated on the basis of a merger of the ideas of liberalism and the reformist current of the workers' socialist movement. Its ideological roots are Christian ethics, enlightenment, humanist philosophy, and the experience of the people's and national liberation movement and the struggle for women's emancipation. The basic values of Social Democracy are freedom, justice, and solidarity. Social Democracy was not immune to mistakes in the past. In fact, considerable harm was done to it by failure to appreciate the nationality factor and by enthusiasm for Marx's utopia, but in time Social Democracy has overcome these mistakes and taken firm positions of pragmatism. What is the content of Social Democracy's basic values (freedom, justice, solidarity)? The Social Democrats' credo is that every human being is born free, every human being has the right to be free of political dictatorship and violence. Freedom also means freedom for the dissident. No one should be oppressed by fear or material want. The other person's freedom defines the boundaries that constitute the condition for every individual person's freedom. Social Democrats believe that justice means equal rights and opportunities and the elimination of any national or social oppression of human beings. It means social protection for the individual, and equality of men and women. A condition of justice is every person's independence from proprietors and politicians. Freedom and justice are impossible without solidarity. It is the practical reflection of compassion manifested toward the victims of injustice. Every human being needs the support of other human beings. Every human being who is destitute or in trouble must be able to count on society's solidarity. Neither submissive collectivism nor selfish individualism can create the prerequisites for the individual's self-determination. It is possible only through the joint actions of free human beings. What is your attitude toward democracy and politics? Democracy is incompatible with totalitarianism and anarchy. It means self-government by the people. But it does not mean mob rule. Democracy is a reflection of the will of the people based on inviolability of the law. It is genuine only when government can be changed by peaceful means. Democracy must guarantee the rights of the minority. By its nature it can only be pluralistic. The Social Democrats do not believe that politics is the art of immorality (although politics and morality are not synonyms). What the Social Democrats strive for is to bring more moral motives into politics, to make it more humane and just. This means, in particular, that the people must be told the truth, however bitter it may be. Are the Social Democrats materialists or idealists? The Social Democrats take the position of a pluralism of world views. Hence, they include materialists and idealists. Do you believe in God? People of various creeds have rallied around the Social Democrats, people whose attitudes toward religion vary. Our ranks include believers and atheists. In our view, the state cannot be either atheistic or theistic. At the same time, we do deem it possible to have the best cadres of religious circles take active part in state and social affairs. The leadership of Georgia's Social Democratic Party [SDP], for example, includes clergymen. What does your symbol, the rose, mean? The rose is the acknowledged symbol of all Social Democrats. It is the symbol of harmony, nobility, beauty, and compassion. What is your attitude toward socialism? While communists view socialism as a social formation, the Social Democrats use the word to mean constant, moral movement toward an increasingly humane, just, and democratic society. We are not trying to impose some new way of life on people. All we are trying to create is the political, legal, and economic conditions necessary for people themselves to change their way of life. This should take place through reform rather than by revolution. How else do you differ from the communists? Communists deny political and world-view pluralism, the multi-party system, the market economy, and belief in God. They view justice as a state in which everyone is equalized. What we believe is that justice is reflected in equality of opportunity. The communists fight against wealth; the Social Democrats fight against poverty. How do the Social Democrats differ from the right-wing parties? The Social Democrats represent a left-of-center people's party. We differ from the right-wing parties (liberals, conservatives, Christian democrats) in that we try to use state regulation of chaotic market conditions to redistribute material goods to all members of society, so that every person's freedom is materially guaranteed. The Social Democrats strive to broaden democracy not only in the political but also the economic and social spheres of life. Whom do you categorize as "working people"? Both hired workers and proprietors. Both strata do labor that is useful to society. Therefore, the Social Democrats try to harmonize their interests through social partnership. This is accomplished through trilateral contracts of mutual obligations between hired workers (the trade unions), proprietors (entrepreneurs' associations) and the state (government). What is your attitude toward capitalism? Capitalism in the classical sense does not exist in any country today. As a result of structural reforms brought about through the efforts of the workers' movement, the trade unions' active struggle, and the social democratic parties, corporate capitalism has taken shape in the Western countries, which is based on group and joint-stock ownership of the means of production. This has radically improved the material wellbeing of the working man and made his life better, although many social problems remain unsolved. What is your attitude toward private property? We favor a variety of forms of property ownership--private, state, group, and mixed ownership. However, we do prefer group, joint-stock ownership, which makes it possible to realize our motto "Every Working Man Should Become a Proprietor, Every Proprietor Should Become a Working Man." Experience has shown that no one form of property ownership by itself guarantees freedom and justice. The important thing is who has the right to manage the property. Our main concern, therefore, is to see to it that the immediate producer of things is involved in exercising that right. What is your attitude toward social insurance? In our opinion, social insurance needs to be personified. The total amount of insurance contributions accumulated during every person's working career should be returned to him in the form of a pension. The same thing is true of health care. In the case of a worker's untimely death, the remaining insurance ought to be turned over to his family. People who do not work (for various reasons) should be provided aid and medical assistance by the state. How do you see the transition from the post-communist society to the market economy? The world has no experience of a transition from a post-communist society to a market economy. We cannot accomplish the task if we go by the methodology of the transition from feudalism to capitalism. There's still no way to make an egg out of an omelet. Making the transition from a post-communist society to a market economy by way of revolutionary-extremist, so-called "shock therapy" has shattered economies and impoverished the people. Georgia provides a clear example of this. The Social Democrats offer society a conception for establishing a socially just and ecologically safe market economy. It calls for a phased transition to market relations. At the same time, state regulation of the process is vitally important. It is the state that must create market institutions and legislative foundations, carry out financial-credit reform, implement a selective protectionist policy, train a corps of managers, harmonize private and social interests, and provide for the people's social and ecological protection. How do you view privatization? The Social Democrats make a distinction between the privatization of management and property. They believe, at the same time, that privatization of state property ought to be preceded by the privatization of state management of the economy. Factories and plants now owned by the state ought to be transferred to the relevant collectives, to group, joint-stock ownership. As for the private production sector, it should basically be formed by having individuals pool their money to create new private enterprises. Retail and consumer service establishments should be sold to individual persons or groups of persons. Individual farm operations should be established in the countryside. Kolkhozes should be converted into individual farmers' cooperatives; state farms should be turned into joint-stock operations. The state sector of the economy, which, as in the Western countries, is not subject to privatization, should be converted to a commercial footing. What ought to be done about mass unemployment? First, new jobs need to be created. Public works need to be organized, professional retraining centers need to be established, and work time needs to be reduced through the adoption of modern technologies. We Social Democrats believe we ought to adopt a free year: once every five years every worker should have the right to take up to one year off to take care of personal business while retaining minimum salary, his job, and his time in service. What is your attitude toward trade unions? Unfortunately, we do not have genuine free trade unions in Georgia. Members of existing trade unions include both proprietors and hired workers, which makes the trade unions an adjunct to state administration and powerless to fight. Trade unions ought to include only hired workers as members; factory and plant executives ought to join entrepreneurs' associations. It is time for Parliament to pass a law on trade unions which will ensure their independence from management. In your opinion, how can we solve the problem of interethnic relations? The Georgian SDP denounces chauvinism, national nihilism, national arrogance, and isolationism, and calls on all ethnic groups to work together for mutual benefit. The party's ranks include representatives of various nationalities who live in Georgia and respect its sovereignty and territorial integrity. It is a matter of the Georgian people's honor to foster the free development of national minorities living in Georgia. One of our special concerns is the protection of the interests of the Abkhazian people and Georgians living in Abkhazia, and ensuring the full autonomy of Abkhazia within Georgia. Systematic democracy alone can achieve interethnic harmony. Georgian Social Democrats believe that national minorities living in Georgia whose ethnic territory lies outside of Georgia ought to be given cultural-national autonomy. This means giving them the opportunity to create national societies which operate on self-governing principles and engage in creating their own schools, cultural centers, publishing houses, and so on. What importance do you attribute to the factor of Russia in regard to consolidating Georgia's independence? The Georgian SDP has repeatedly stated in public that our homeland is of strategic concern to Russia; we must take account of this concern and satisfy it, of course, in consideration of modern realities. At the same time, Russia must also take account of and satisfy the Georgian nation's national interests. Only in this way can we create a civilized system of Georgian-Russian relations. Trying to talk tough to the Russians and threaten them with the UN and NATO is just Quixotic and, naturally, does not bring good results. Abkhazia and Samachablo [South Ossetia] are clear proof of that. Anyone who tries to make confrontation points against Russia is undermining Georgia's independence. What is your assessment of Georgia's joining the CIS? The only sad thing is that the decision to do so came so late. Isolationism did much harm to Georgia's national interests. Our economy was destroyed and ruined, our people were impoverished and made destitute, cultural development halted, senseless conflicts sacrificed the lives of thousands of young people, and the tragedy of Abkhazia turned countless numbers of people into refugees. We could have avoided all of this with a more conciliatory policy toward Russia. In the form that the CIS has now it does not properly reflect the level of actual integration of the states that used to be part of the Soviet Union. In this regard, Georgia can have its own say regarding the gradual transformation of the CIS into a Eurasian Home which will have common work-coordination bodies and a multi-national secretariat headed by a General Secretary. Some political parties are in favor of a federal system for Georgia. How about you? We are categorically against it. Dividing Georgia up into Kartli, Guria, Mingrelia, Kakhetia, and other provinces, with their own governments, will foment parochialism and split the country. Therefore, Georgia must remain a unitary state; at the same time, the autonomies should be granted broad rights of self-government. Is your party a member of the Socialist International? Georgia's SDP is a part of international Social Democracy. In more than 20 countries today (Austria, Norway, Spain, Holland, Greece, Australia, and others) the government is headed by Social Democrats. Outstanding leaders of international Social Democracy include F. Mitterand (the President of France), F. Gonzales (the Prime Minister of Spain), F. Vranitzky (the Chancellor of Austria), and others. International Social Democracy is a powerful anti-communist movement, and for this reason it has been the target of constant pro-communist attacks both here and abroad. International Social Democracy is coordinated by the Socialist International, which was revived in 1951. Its members include ruling and opposition socialist, social-democratic, and labor parties in over 100 countries, parties adhering to the same principles. From 1976 to 1992, the Socialist International was headed by former German Chancellor Willy Brandt; its chairman now is former French Prime Minister Pierre Maurois. Last year, Georgia's SDP became a member of the Socialist International with the status of permanent guest. When was Georgia's SDP created? Our party was created in November 1918. It was founded by Noe Zhordania, Noe Ramishvili, Silibistro Dzhibladze, and others. Both then and now, the party's basic program calls for freedom of the nation and the individual and material wellbeing as the cornerstone of human life. Are you the heirs of the mensheviks? The mensheviks represented the reform wing of Russia's Social Democratic Workers' Party. They opposed bolshevism, that is, Leninism. Under Noe Zhordania's leadership, Georgian Social Democrats also opposed Russia's mensheviks. It would be wrong, therefore, to call Georgian Social Democrats mensheviks, because at the time they were the majority in Georgia while the bolsheviks were in the minority. Then and now, Georgian Social Democrats have taken the position of Europe's Social Democrats. Who killed Ilia Chavchavadze? The man who actually killed the Great Ilia was Gigola Berbichashvili, a representative of the bolshevik wing of Russia's Social Democratic Workers' Party who was later a state official in Communist Georgia. Blaming this shocking assassination on Georgia's SDP is just a treacherous trick of the communists. Ilia Chavchavadze was murdered in 1907; our party, on the other hand, was formed 11 years afterward, in 1918. Despite the ideological differences between Ilia Chavchavadze and Noe Zhordania, both became victims of bolshevism. As Mikhako Tsereteli wrote, "Being sacrificed for the nation and oppressed by the same enemy raised both these personages to the heights." The SDP led independent Georgia from 1918 to 1921. What accomplishments did it achieve? That was Georgia's little Golden Age. The Georgian Social Democrats created history's first Social Democratic republic and laid the foundation for the kind of model of social development that has now come to be known as the Swedish model. Georgia's Social Democrats established a social market economy, political pluralism, municipal self-government, the institution of trial by jury, a democratic constitution, and national armed forces; they restored the autocephaly of the Church, opened the first Georgian university, and so on. It is no wonder, therefore, that Noe Zhordania's government was accorded high praise by England's Prime Minister Ramsey MacDonald, who wrote: "I have studied its constitution and its social and economic reconstruction, and what I saw there is the kind of life I would like to see in our country." The Georgian experience at that time served to enrich international Social Democracy. What was the cause of the downfall of the Georgian Social Democratic republic in 1921? After Azerbaijan and Armenia were seized by Bolshevik Russia, the 200,000-man Red Army invaded Georgia and took it over. For a month and a half, Georgia's Social Democratic government and the Georgian army put up staunch resistance against the aggressor. The war cost the lives of 30,000 Georgians, and the Georgian government, under Noe Zhordania's leadership, was forced to emigrate abroad, where they worked actively to expose the act of aggression. The whole world learned the truth that communist rule was established in Georgia not by a people's uprising but as a result of Bolshevik Russia's intervention. What happened to your party after Georgia was taken over? Georgia's SDP went underground. Despite communist repressions which cost the lives of about 80,000 party members, the Georgian Social Democrats never stopped fighting to restore Georgia's independence. The SDP led the uprising in 1924. The party held its Third (illegal) Congress in 1925 and its Fourth (illegal) Congress in 1930. The party had an illegal, functioning Central Committee in Georgia until the start of the 1950s. After its members were arrested and shot, the Central Committee's functions went over to the party's foreign bureau that had been operating in France since 1923. How did the Georgian SDP come to be restored, and when? An initiative group was formed in the 1980s, in Tbilisi, to restore the party. In February 1990, on the instructions and with the encouragement of the party's foreign bureau, the Georgian SDP's Fifth Congress was held in Tbilisi; the Congress adopted the party's new program and charters and restored its leadership bodies. Many people probably don't know that the rebirth of the Social Democratic movement in Georgia had Merab Kostava as one of its leaders. Does the party have its own press organs? The Georgia SDP publishes a journal called CHVENI DROSHA [Our Banner] abroad, specifically in Paris; in Georgia it publishes the newspaper ERTOBA [Unity] and a journal, SOTSIAL-DEMOKRATI. What was your party's attitude toward the "Rounds?" At first, the Roundtable put together a seemingly reasonable program which called for achieving Georgian state independence by stages. Later on, unfortunately, it renounced the program; as the saying goes, temptation got the better of it and it resorted to revolutionary-extremist methods, resulting in confrontation with Russia, a standoff with the intelligentsia, the resurrection of authoritarianism, splitting of the nation, and finally the political collapse of the "Rounds" and the ex-President. To be totally truthful, however, overthrowing the "Rounds" by force of arms was an unconstitutional act, and, as in the case of all other armed coups, this one also resulted in Georgia's grave predicament that persists to this day. What is your attitude toward the present government? Despite our deep respect for Eduard Shevardnadze, we have to say that he lacked sufficient principle to resist the pressure of extremist and nationalist forces, which has resulted in an unrealistic policy toward Russia and fetishization of the Western aid factor. This has cost us all dearly, and now we are reaping the fruits of those mistakes. Does your party have an armed force? Our principles and ideas are our weapons. We have no other arms. Any political organization that has them ought to be banned by law. Who is the chairman of your party? Guram Muchaidze is the Chairman of the SDP of Georgia. He was born in October 1948, in a worker's family. He graduated with honors from Tbilisi Secondary School No 3 and from the History Faculty of Tbilisi State University. He was awarded the candidate of science degree for his diploma work. At the age of 30 he defended his doctoral dissertation and was given the rank of professor. He worked as head of the Political Science Department. He has written over 100 scholarly works. He is married and has two children. How many deputies do you have in Parliament? Only two, unfortunately. What is the structure of the party's leadership bodies? The party's highest leadership body is the Congress; between congresses it is the Central Committee, which convenes once every six months. Between meetings of the Central Committee the party's affairs are handled by its Political Council. The party's foreign bureau is accountable to its Political Council. What regions are your party's local organizations operating in? Almost all major regions. The party organization's activities are presently paralyzed in Abkhazia and Samachablo. Do you have permanent staffers? We do. The apparatus of the Political Council numbers twelve staffers. How many members does your party have? The Georgian SDP's members number over 5,000. How is your party funded? Our financial sources are: membership dues and registration fees, contributions from its foreign bureau and from members and sympathizers, and income from publishing activities. Do you have an account where contributions can be made? Here are the particulars: Georgian SDP, MPO 520096, Account 000700302, Aragvi-Biznes Bank, Tbilisi. Where is your headquarters and how can you be contacted? The Georgian SDP is located in Tbilisi, at No 2 on 9 April Street. Our phones are 99-95-22 and 99-95-50. We're hoping to meet you!
