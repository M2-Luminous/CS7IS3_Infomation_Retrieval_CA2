Saito, Semiconductor Division, NEC] [Text] Introduction Current TFT-LCD issues include making them larger, giving them higher resolution, more colors, and lower power consumption, making them lighter and thinner, and applying them in multimedia. The LSI driver holds an important key to solving all these problems. With this in mind, in this article I discuss the importance of the LSI driver in the LCD display system, present LSI driver technology, and future trends with special reference to LSI drivers for TFT-LCDs in the rapidly developing field of office automation. Present TFT-LCDs and LSI Drivers 1. LCD Driver Circuits for Personal Computers The largest number of TFT-LCDs mass produced for personal computers are 8-12 inch diagonal panels with 640x400 or 640x480 pixels, and they are mainly used in notebook and laptop computers. Based on the number of scan lines, in mainstream displays the gate bus line scan time is 30-40 �s, the LSI driver has 8-16 levels, and there are 4096 colors in the display. The main drive methods include one that uses an 8-16 level digital driver (multi-level driver), and one that drives a liquid crystal with a low cost 5 V output driver (8-16 levels) by altering the common voltage in opposite phase to the pixel voltage (the common inversion drive method).[.sup]1[/] Moreover, multi-level display methods include the frame rate control method (abbreviated FRC below) and the dither method.[.sup]2[/] Of particular interest is the development of the 5 V output, 64 level LSI driver that enables the realization of 256 levels when combined with FRC. The reduction in picture quality, which is the shortcoming of combining the 5 V output driver and the common inversion drive method appears to have been overcome as well by a new drive method[.sup]3[/] in which the driver oscillates. 2. LCD Driver Circuits for Workstations (WS) This class of displays has a much higher number of pixels than personal computer displays, with more than 4096 display colors and more than 800,000 pixels, so the driver must work much faster. For example, there are dot clocks of more than 100 MHz, and because the pixel signal cannot be input directly into the driver at present, phase expansion must be used to reduce the speed of the pixel signal clock to match the operating speed of the driver.[.sup]4[/] For applications that mostly deal with text, this is possible with the number of levels created by combining FRC with a digital driver, but to utilize current workstations to their full potential, at least 64-256 levels are required. For engineering workstation (EWS) applications the operating frequency of the LSI driver reaches 50 MHz, and it is practical to expand to two phases to convey digital data to the LSI driver. However, 48 (8x3x2) input pins are needed to carry 8-bit data, so this is not practical from an installation standpoint. Therefore, development is underway to use phase expansion with analog drivers that obtain a sufficient output accuracy and have 20 mV or less in output voltage fluctuation.[.sup]5[/] Present LSI Drivers 1. Present LSI Driver Device Technology When we build an AC drive for a TFT-LCD using LSI driver output, we need an output amplitude of about 12 V, and the 5 V series control logic must be about 12 MHz at the personal computer level. From a structural standpoint we need as much commonality as we can get between the high-voltage and low-voltage CMOS in the LSI driver device, and we need a device formed by a consolidation process built under optimal conditions on the same substrate. Figure 1 shows an example of a device made by the consolidation process. For the high-voltage CMOS it is necessary to make the gate oxide film thicker than the gate voltage's insulation withstand voltage, and we need a low-concentration offset layer to mitigate the gate and drain field concentration, which results in a complex structure. A high-concentration guard ring layer is also needed to achieve high-voltage CMOS element isolation. Therefore, consolidation is much more complex than the low-voltage CMOS process alone, and higher manufacturing costs are unavoidable. Because the mutual conductance gm drops and parasitic capacitance increases when we make a high-voltage CMOS, it is not possible to obtain high speed and high accuracy with a high-voltage CMOS analog circuit. Making the voltage higher also increases the design rule, and this is disadvantageous from the standpoint of integration. Figure 1 Structure of LSI Driver Device Moreover, when heat diffusion is used to obtain the high-voltage CMOS withstand voltage after the ion implantation process of the V[.sub]T[/] (threshold voltage) control gate, V[.sub]T[/] control becomes poor, and this limits low-voltage CMOS miniaturization. In current 20 V class LSI drivers, the high-voltage CMOS design rule is about 4-8 �m, and the low-voltage CMOS design rule is about 1.2-3 �m. For 5 V LSI drivers, a VLSI low-voltage process is used with a design rule of about 0.8-1.5 �m. Table 1 compares the consolidation process and the low-voltage process. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1 Comparison of Consolidation Process and 5 V Process | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Consolidation Process |5 V Process | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |High-Voltage |Low-Voltage | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Operating Voltage |-20V |5V |5V | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |L poly |�4 �m |�1.5 �m |�1.2 �m | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |T[.sub]OX[/] |600 Ang. |300 Ang. |250 Ang. | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Wiring |Al poly, 1 layer |Al 2 layer | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2. Current LSI Drivers As shown in Figure 2, LSI data drivers can be divided into digital drivers and analog drivers. Digital drivers input digital multi-level data, and analog drivers input analog multi-level data. The number of output pins for both is a relatively large 120-192. Figure 2 Block Diagrams of Digital and Analog (1) Digital Drivers Digital drivers store multi-level data for one horizontal time frame in data memory at a high speed. When the next horizontal time frame begins, the output circuit is activated. As far as operation is concerned, within one horizontal time frame the driver needs to drive a TFT-LCD within about 30 �s for a personal computer and within about 15 �s for an EWS. Therefore, high speed is easily achieved. However, as the number of levels increases, the number of input pins also increases, which is a drawback. A. 8 Level Drivers The 8-16 level, multi-level drivers, which are the digital drivers most often manufactured, have an analog switch for each level in the output circuit, and they select a voltage source, supplied from the outside, for each level. Because the circuit construction is simple, high-voltage LSI drivers can be easily built, and those with an operating frequency of 15-20 MHz have been made into commercial products. Moreover, a special _g_ correction circuit is not needed because _g_ correction can be performed merely by adjusting the voltage sources of the different levels. Moreover, the driver itself does not require an analog circuit, so its low power consumption is an advantage. However, because the number of analog switches for the output circuit and voltage sources for the levels increase as the number of levels increases, the chip size of the LSI driver becomes huge and wiring the voltage sources for the levels on the LCD module becomes a problem. Therefore, its upper limit is about 16 levels. B. 64 Level Drivers Right now, there is active development of 5 V, 64 level LSI drivers that contain a D/C converter for the output circuit, and they utilize a 0.8-1.5 �m VLSI low-voltage process. In the past, adequate drivers could not be made with the high-voltage process, but with the adoption of the miniature VLSI low-voltage CMOS process, it has become possible to construct a highly integrated D/A converter with high accuracy and low power consumption. By incorporating the D/A converter into the output circuit, a voltage source is not needed for each level, but the driver must have a _g_ correction circuit. If a correction is not made inside the LSI driver with a non-linear D/A, a D/A converter with about two bits more than the gradation data is needed. Therefore, many of the 64 level drivers now under development employ the method of supplementing with 3 bits between two voltage sources from among the 9 external voltage sources for the levels (Fig. 3). Figure 3. _g_ Correction Method for 64 Level In terms of physical properties, the drivers under development have an output deviation of +/-20 mV, an operating frequency of 20-35 MHz, and a power consumption of about 30 mW. (2) Analog Drivers Analog drivers keep analog multi-level data in an output S/H (sample and hold) circuit by sampling pulses and make their output through an analog amp. Therefore, in principle they are full color, and their circuitry is simple, but it is difficult to obtain a high accuracy analog amp and high speed/high accuracy S/H circuits with a high-voltage CMOS. In the past, among the analog drivers for general use, those used mainly in commercial televisions had an output deviation of about +/-50 mV, an operating frequency of 5-15 MHz, and a power consumption of about 200 mW. At NEC, however, we have developed a dynamic range, 15 V analog driver for EWS with an output deviation of +/-20 mV, an operating frequency of 15 MHz, and a power consumption of 100 mW through improvements in the consolidation process (high-voltage CMOS). One example is shown below (Figure 4). Figure 4 Example of EWS Analog Driver A. Number of Input Ports The analog signal coming into the driver directly enters the S/H circuit, but because the S/H circuit control signal passes through a 5 V control circuit, a dispersion in the 5 V control circuit is necessary as a sampling dynamic margin. Based on the sampling circuit, we can figure that this value will be several ns, and the sampling time will be about 15 MHz. Therefore, we chose 12 (RGBx4) as the number of analog input ports for the EWS. B. Analog Amp We encounter special difficulties with the analog amp at the output stage in terms of power consumption and accuracy. With power consumption, the TFT-LCD load capacitance of 100-200 pF becomes a problem. At the loaded drive stage, if we consider the source follower, to obtain a through rate of 1 V/�s, we need a constant current source such that 200 pF x 1 V/�s = 200 �A. When we reach a power source voltage of 15 V and 192 output pins, we already have surpassed 500 mW. For the output stage analog amp, past methods include allowing a large current flow only at the instant when the current of the constant current source of the loaded driver stage source follower charges and discharges its load, or raising the output to the power source voltage and then driving it only in the direction taken by the analog amp drive current. The former does not lower power consumption sufficiently, and with the latter drive time is shortened, and a large current is stored in the panel when a large load capacitance is raised to the power source voltage. Therefore, we lowered power consumption by employing a pseudo-push/pull operation by combining an analog amp to handle the drive current during buildup and another analog amp to handle the drive current during trail off. In terms of accuracy, we encountered particular difficulty in constructing the high-voltage CMOS. The bonding depth of the offset layers required for high voltage tends to deviate due to heat dispersion. Therefore, the channel length formed between two offset layers also tends to deviate, which often results in V[.sub]T[/] deviation. The offset deviation in the CMOS differential amp is dependent on V[.sub]T[/] deviation, so this results in an offset deviation of several tens of mV. We attempted to reduce V[.sub]T[/] deviation without lowering the withstand voltage by reducing this thermal hysteresis as much as possible to increase the accuracy of the high-voltage CMOS analog circuit. C. S/H Circuit Analog drivers require a high speed, high accuracy S/H circuit. Generally, the S/H circuits used with analog drivers are basic, non-feedback S/H circuits consisting of an analog switch and a hold capacitor. They are simple circuits in which high speeds can be easily obtained without increasing chip size. This type of S/H circuit corrects the feed-through voltage of the analog switch, which is the cause of error voltage, with a dummy switch half the width of the analog switch gate. In principle, however, this does not provide sufficient correction, and with a high-voltage CMOS the gm is low, so we must not only increase the channel width, but it is also extremely difficult to obtain high speed and high accuracy because the gate voltage is so large. To solve these problems we have reduced the surface area of the high-voltage CMOS gate and lowered the feed-through voltage to obtain the same gm by improving our consolidation process (high-voltage CMOS) described above. D. Analog Input Chip Selection In the past the analog input capacity of an analog driver has been about 1 pF/pin, but with the EWS we have 1280 pF, and there is a heavy burden on the peripheral circuits, so it is very difficult to convey a high-speed, accurate analog signal to the LSI driver. Because it is impossible to realize a high-speed, high accuracy, high-voltage CMOS analog amp, we could not place the analog amp in the analog input area, and input capacitance of the output S/H circuit appears in the analog input. We have reduced the analog input capacitance to 100 pF when ten drivers (192 output) are used by setting ON only the analog input of the chip that performs sampling, and by using analog input chip selection functions. Future Trends in LSI Drivers We can expect the 64 level 5 V digital driver that uses 0.8-1.5 �m CMOS technology to bring about a diversification of the TFT-LCD through drive methods such as common inverse drive. However, when we make drivers more accurate, and make larger, more accurate TFT-LCDs, the peripheral circuit power will increase even if the TFT-LCDs themselves consume less power. We can manage to reduce the load on the peripheral circuits when we make high-voltage CMOS 64 level digital drivers that consume less power, and we can do this by improving the consolidation process (improving processes that reduce the causes of high-voltage CMOS deviations) and improving the circuitry. We can expect wide use of analog drivers as well in applications that utilize analog input and theoretical full color properties; for example, in television, in the full color EWS, and in analog interfaces that require CRT compatibility. There is a report of a 5 V LSI driver that incorporates a high-speed amp for analog input and uses 5 V miniature process analog technology.[.sup]6[/] This greatly reduces the capacitance of analog input. Right now the mainstream number for driver output is 192, but in the future we can expect S-VGA applications with an output of 240 and a slimming down in the external dimensions of the driver. The key points in using LSI drivers are the power consumption of the total system and the cost. Therefore, depending on the application we can expect system optimization that chooses between digital and analog drivers and between high-voltage LSI drivers and 5 V LSI drivers. References 1. H.
