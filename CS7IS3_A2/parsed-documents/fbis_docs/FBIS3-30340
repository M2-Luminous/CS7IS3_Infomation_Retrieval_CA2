After talks with Svetozar Marovic, secretary general of the Democratic Party of Socialists, and meetings with the Montenegrin opposition parties -- only the pro-Montenegrin bloc did not attend -- Zhirinovskiy held a rally in the capital of the republic. The fervent atmosphere during the meeting did not result in trouble. After being addressed by the Russian leader, the crowd of over 50,000 people dispersed peacefully and enthusiastically. This enthusiasm was caused by Zhirinovskiy, who greeted them with the words that a great Serb had come to his brother Serbs. With the victory of his party, Zhirinovskiy said, the Russian people had determined a new course in policy, particularly toward the events in the former Yugoslavia. No one must strike against Serbia, as that would be a strike against Russia. The world wants to divide the Balkans into many little statelets, so that the West can catholicize half the peninsula, and islamize the other half, Zhirinovskiy said. They are trying to destroy our Orthodox religion, and your only fault, Zhirinovskiy said, is that you are on the border with the West, and therefore the attacks on you are all the fiercer. The Russian Army, some 300,000 troops, is still in Germany, but if need be it will be moved to the Balkans so as to protect its brother Serbs. As for the sanctions, Zhirinovskiy said, they can keep them in force. Russia has all you need, and will buy everything you can offer. As for defense, if there is an attack, you should not give it so much as a thought, Zhirinovskiy said, and added that Russia had not only state-of-the-art weapons, but also a secret sonar weapon -- as it is called -- which it will use for its own defense and for the defense of her Orthodox brothers on the territory of the present Yugoslavia. Russian might has to be displayed to the world, so as to force it to leave the Slavs to live in peace. Russia will make it clear that Serbia should not be taken lightly.
