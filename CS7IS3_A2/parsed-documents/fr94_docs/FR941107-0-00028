FR941107-0-00028 FR941107-0-00010 The Commission agrees with the commenters that exempting listed debt securities from the Exchange Act's borrowing restrictions will eliminate an unwarranted regulatory disparity, with possible benefits to the corporate bond market. First, the Commission believes that Rule 3a12&hyph;11(a) should provide broker-dealers with flexibility in financing their inventory positions. Specifically, the new rule will enable a broker-dealer borrowing against a listed debt security to choose among prospective lenders based solely upon the terms of the credit they offer. This should facilitate, among other things, repurchase agreements with non-bank institutional investors. As a result, adoption of Rule 3a12&hyph;11(a) may reduce the cost of dealer operations and may encourage broker-dealers to take positions in listed debt securities, thereby adding depth and liquidity to the corporate bond market. Second, the Commission finds that Rule 3a12&hyph;11(a) should eliminate one competitive barrier to the exchange-trading of debt securities. As noted in the comment letters, current Section 8(a), among other factors, may provide underwriters or investment bankers with an incentive to recommend that debt securities be traded in the OTC market, rather than listed on an exchange. The Commission believes that such an impact on the structure of the debt market is unwarranted. By equalizing the credit treatment of corporate bonds, adoption of Rule 3a12&hyph;11(a) may provide a greater opportunity for exchanges to compete with the OTC market for debt listings. The Commission has concluded that the modifications suggested by the commenters to conform Regulations T and U with Rule 3a12&hyph;11(a) are not necessary. In this regard, staff of the Federal Reserve Board has confirmed that the section of Regulation T discussed by the commenters 27 and the section of Regulation U governing agreements by non-member banks 28 were adopted pursuant to Section 8(a). 29 Federal Reserve Board staff agrees with the Commission that consequently Rule 3a12&hyph;11(a), as proposed and as adopted, will have the effect of exempting listed debt securities from those provisions of the Federal Reserve Board's rules. 30 Federal Reserve Board staff supports the Commission granting such an exemption. Listed debt securities will continue to be nonexempted securities for all other purposes under Regulations T and U. 31 27 As noted above, Section 220.15 of Regulation T parallels Section 8(a)'s restrictions on the sources of credit available to broker-dealers borrowing against listed securities. See n. 25, above, and accompanying text. 28 Section 221.4 of Regulation U requires a non-member bank to file an agreement conforming to the requirements of Section 8(a). See, n. 16 and 25, above. 29 See letter from Scott Holz, Senior Attorney, Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation, Federal Reserve Board, to Beth Stekler, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, Securities and Exchange Commission, dated September 19, 1994. 30 Id . 31 Specifically, listed debt securities will continue to be nonexempted securities for purposes of Regulation T's margin requirements. Accordingly, a broker-dealer who extends credit secured by such collateral must comply with the applicable rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board. Further, the Commission has considered the commenters' suggestion that the exemption from Section 8(a) apply to all listed securities, debt and equity. The new rules and amendments being adopted today, however, were designed to achieve competitive balance for the corporate bond market. Consistent with that goal, the Commission proposed and, at this time, has decided to adopt a rule that is limited to debt securities, rather than significantly change the exemptive rule by broadening it to cover equity securities. Nevertheless, the treatment of listed equity securities for loan purposes may warrant further exploration by the Commission and other appropriate regulatory organizations. With respect to the definition of the term ``debt security'' for purposes of new Rule 3a12&hyph;11, the Proposing Release solicited comment as to whether the term should include any security that is not an ``equity security'' as defined by the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder, 32 or whether the term should be more specifically defined. 33 Commenters supported the broader definition primarily because of the risk that certain innovative securities may not fit squarely within pre-conceived categories. Given this concern, as well as the desire of the Commission to simplify an issuer's determination as to whether a debt or equity security is at issue, new Rule 3a12&hyph;11 provides that the term ``debt security'' will include any security that is not an ``equity security'' as defined by the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder. 34 32 The term ``equity security'' is defined in Section 3(a)(11) [15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(11)] and Rule 3a11&hyph;1 [17 CFR 240.3a11&hyph;1] thereunder. Equity securities would include, among other items, stock or similar security, certificates of interest or participation in any profit sharing agreement, voting trust certificate or certificate of deposit for any equity security, limited partnership interest, any security that is convertible, with or without consideration, into an equity security or any warrant or right to subscribe or purchase an equity security. 33 The Proposing Release provided an example of a definition that enumerated specific characteristics of securities that would be considered ``debt securities'' under the proposed rule. 34 Exchange Act Rule 3a12&hyph;11(c).
