Only after this meeting will he make a final decision concerning his appointment. Upon his return from India, President Lech Walesa said at the airport that he had not been consulted concerning Rosati's candidacy and that he does not know him. The SLD insists upon appointing Rosati as quickly as possible; the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] has not submitted any objections and has left the decision to the prime minister. Yesterday's meeting of the coalition leadership at the Parkowa Hotel lasted only two hours. Jerzy Szmajdzinski, general secretary of the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic, did not conceal after the meeting that the SLD would like Dariusz Rosati to be appointed to the post of deputy prime minister and finance minister as soon as possible. "The prime minister is, by his nature, a tight-lipped man, and he is not willing to express his opinions," replied Szmajdzinski, when asked about the prime minister's opinion on the candidacy of Rosati. The prime minister has put off making a final decision until after his meeting with the candidate, for which "he reserved a lot of time." Dariusz Rosati told us on the night of 8 March that he has an appointment to hold such a long meeting with the prime minister on Saturday and that he has so far only spoken with him twice on the phone. Also discussed at the evening meeting was the announcement by National Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk that he will submit an objection in the Constitutional Tribunal to the provisions of the Budget Law, which obliges the Ministry of National Defense to purchase equipment from Polish factories, including Mielec. We hope, Szmajdzinski said on behalf of the SLD, that Minister Kolodziejczyk will be able to fully present his stance in the Senate. We get the impression that it is not all that clear. The Senate should hold a satisfactory discussion of the budget. In the Senate, Kolodziejczyk is supposed to take the floor on behalf of the government, not the ministry. It was agreed that, after the government forwards the law on ratification of the Concordat to the Sejm, it will be necessary for parliamentary clubs to discuss the procedures, pace, and time of the first reading of this law. The coalition members declared on behalf of the government that they are ready to conduct talks with Solidarity and reach compromises. The PSL deputies are "quietly waiting for new developments," said Franciszek J. Stefaniuk, deputy chairman of the club, before the meeting at Parkowa street. The PSL has not submitted any objections to the candidacy of Rosati and left the final decision to the prime minister. Rosati's statement that he would continue the policy pursued by Borowski disturbs the peasants. "Why, we will not question the budget that we have ourselves passed," he says. "Rosati declares an honest privatization policy, which is exactly what we want." "I do not know him personally; however, from publications and opinions of the milieu, I know that he was critical of the Balcerowicz plan, which draws us closer to him. One can count on good cooperation with him," said Sejm Deputy Waldemar Michna (member of the Budget Committee).
