This corresponds to the treaty on reducing conventional armed forces in Europe. A more substantial reduction had originally been envisaged. The army's significance, however, will increase appreciably, among other things, because of the continuing conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and in the southern regions of the former Soviet Union, said Oldrich Holecek of the Defense Ministry's Press Department. At the moment, the planned number of Czech Army personnel is 92,599. The actual number is somewhat lower. Roughly a third of the army is made up of career soldiers. In two years, however, professionals should make up 50 percent of the army, while soldiers on their basic service should make up the other 50 percent.
