[passage omitted] This massacre, which was committed by the Zionists inside the Tomb of the Patriarch in Hebron and in the middle of the blessed month of Ramadan, coincides with what is being publicized as peace with the Israelis, which led to direct negotiations between Israelis and Arab sides in Washington. It also coincides with direct talks between Israelis and officials from the Fatah organization to implement what has been labelled as the Gaza-Jericho agreement. Today's incident brought to light the falsity of this alleged peace, and exposed the plot that is being hatched, which is that what is taking places these days is not peace, but a method to force the Arabs to submit unconditionally, to destroy their nation, and annihilate their people. This massacre also confirms other facts, the most important of which are: This massacre represents one aspect of the outcome of the so-called Gaza-Jericho Agreement. What has been committed by the Zionist occupiers represents the real terrorism that has been condemned and denounced by all international norms and treaties. This type of terrorism epitomizes the highest level of human rights abuses, that the West boasts to safeguard and protect. This begs the following question: What will the West do about this abhorrent act of terrorism? What will the UN Security Council do? This Security Council which is controlled by Western countries that claim to hold the torch to combat terrorism. These countries also level accusations of terrorism against anyone who does not follow their policies and does not succumb to their blackmail and orders. The Israelis would not have continued to carry out their barbaric massacres and their annihilation of the sons of the Arab Palestinian people without the unlimited support lavished on them by the West through a supply of arms and funds, and through a policy of cover-up of their crimes and turning a blind eye on their accumulated arsenals of weapons of mass destruction. This policy falls within an alliance between the Jews and the Christians against the Arabs and Islam. This massacre would not have happened if we did not have some Arabs who rushed to recognize their enemy and submit to it.
