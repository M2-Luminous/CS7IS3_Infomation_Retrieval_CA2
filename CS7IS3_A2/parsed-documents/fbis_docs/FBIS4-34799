Macchi said that he wished "our stock market was an exception, but it is really impossible to escape from these trends once they take place," adding that he is not greatly worried about the current situation. Macchi -- speaking on the radio from Canada, where he is accompanying President Carlos Menem as part of his retinue -- asserted: "It is the rise in the price of commodities that is causing a decline in securities that represent capital and -- concurrent with this -- a rise in interest rates." He further stated that this situation may act as a brake on the inflow of capital into Argentina, but at the same time, "we will have a better exchange balance parity as the dollar loses against other currencies and the prices of beef, grain, and oil go up." With regard to Menem's state visit to Canada, Macchi said: "We have met with businessmen and have come to the conclusion that Argentina is now considered a more credible country." He also underlined that Argentina "stands out from other countries in the so-called emerging markets as it is more attractive for the direct investment of capital."
