Work is under way in this direction and documents earlier drafted by Russia are being polished. This was disclosed in an interview with Interfax by the head of a Russian Foreign Ministry department Yuriy Ushakov. He said the documents should reflect the latest developments, including the ideas expressed during a recent debate in the State Duma. He said amendments are being made to the presentation document which has the working name "Basic Parameters of Cooperation with NATO". Ushakov emphasized that diplomats are working hand in hand with colleagues from the Defense Ministry and other interested agencies. "I cannot say for sure what Defense Minister Pavel Grachev meant when he spoke of working on a new document on relations between Russia and NATO. We drafted the documents that are now being finalized but the foundation remains the same," he said. Ushakov announced that a mixed commission on cooperation with NATO chaired by Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin held a regular session on Tuesday. It consists of representatives of the Ministries of Defense, Foreign Affairs, Finance and the Interior as well as the Security Council and the Foreign Intelligence Service. The essence of cooperation was discussed as well as various ways of reflecting the special role of Russia in cooperation with NATO. Participants agreed that cooperation with NATO should be expanded and the Partnership program should not be given up despite all its shortcomings, restrictions and shapelessness. The program is not ideal, the diplomat said, and Russia is going to make considerable changes in a document that is going to be worked out between Russia and NATO. When asked what he meant by Russia's special role Ushakov replied: "This means equal partnership at all levels when the opinion of such a side as Russia must be taken into account before making decisions on key matters concerning acute situations in the world. This is the first and foremost consideration."
