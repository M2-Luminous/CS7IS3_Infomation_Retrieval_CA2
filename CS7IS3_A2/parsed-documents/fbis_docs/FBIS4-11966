One, to set up a subversive body inside the administration that will secretly carry out a policy the administration publicly opposes, as John Poindexter did in the Irangate affair under President Reagan. Second, to have frightful rows with the secretary of state, as Zbigniew Brzezinski did with Cyrus Vance, and the third, to write articles in the daily or professional press, hoping the White House will read them more earnestly than internal memorandums. Anthony Lake, President Clinton's new national security adviser, chose the third way. In an article published in FOREIGN AFFAIRS magazine, he proposes -- as a sequel to his assistant Martin Indyk's article -- a dual containment policy. In practical terms, this policy means that instead of pitting Iran against Iraq and vice versa, a pro-Western alliance would be formed, comprising Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Israel, and possibly Syria, too. The alliance would be a security belt against the influence of reactionary countries. The unveiling of the new strategy causes concern. The strategy is slightly reminiscent of Reagan's caricature world map. In that map, the world was divided into four parts: the Soviet Union and the Evil Empire; Europeans and those who do not speak our language; we, the Americans, who are the greatest; and an empty area comprised mostly of Africa. The world is simple. We will curb and eradicate the evil nations and pay off the good ones. This is what Lake is also proposing. Except that his plan, which looks enticing on paper, is potentially as dangerous as a telephone diagnosis. The United States has never clearly defined the term reactionary country. Is Saudi Arabia, which cuts off thieves' hands, reactionary, or is it perhaps a progressive state because it takes pains to restrain elements more reactionary than herself? Is Turkey a progressive state only because it is a NATO member, or is it backward because it has been massacring the Kurdish minority? Another vague definition pertains to the term alliance. Does Lake envision a NATO-like alliance in the Middle East, in which Turkey is member but Iran is not, although the two share the same interest in restraining the Kurds and both have announced their objection to carving up Iraq? If Lake hopes that such an alliance will offset the Hizballah control of Lebanon, what will block radical Islam in Egypt, Algeria, and Sudan? And what is Israel's contribution to the war against the Islam? An even greater danger is the possibility that establishing one pro-Western pact will immediately generate another composed of Iran and Iraq, Libya and India, Afghanistan and the rich Islamic central-Asian states of Indonesia an Malaysia. The latter alliance may engage the endorsement of China and perhaps the support of Japan, currently in a tacit economic war with the United States. What price is the United States ready to pay today for preventing the creation of such an alliance? Is the blocking of Hizballah worth the loss of thousands of American jobs resulting from the counter-alliance's decision to boycott one single American product? The national security adviser would have done well to look up the origin of the term containment, which was invented by George Keenan, who was the U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union 45 years ago. Writing in -- what a surprise -- FOREIGN AFFAIRS -- in 1947, he suggested applying a containment policy to Stalin's USSR, but in his memoirs written twenty years later, he warned that the containment policy should not constitute a sequel to the status quo, but rather be a bridging policy toward an era in which the United States and the USSR would be able to hold an effective dialogue on how to avoid the perils of status quo. "And if the plan fails," Keenan wrote, "it will happen because of our government's inability to spot the emerging opportunities to establish an effective political dialogue, and because of its excessive preoccupation with the military aspects of the conflict." The Arab alliance that will constitute the double containment proposed by Lake is none other but a semantic description of the current status quo. Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, and certainly Israel are considered pro-American countries. Iraq is sealed off by an international embargo anyway, and Iran is already subject to every possible American sanction, excluding a military attack. What additional containment can the United States expect? Some observers believe there is even now an opportunity to move on to the post-containment stage, to a slow resumption of relations with Iran and the gradual lifting of sanctions on Iraq. There are indications that at least Iran is interested in resuming the ties with the United States, provided the latter stops meddling in its domestic affairs. Would it not be better if the national security adviser stopped defining existing situations and instead, probed the situation to verify that the United States was not missing another opportunity?
