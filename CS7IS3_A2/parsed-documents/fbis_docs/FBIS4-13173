FBIS4-13173 "drnes074dd_94001" FBIS-NES-94-074 Daily Report 16 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs Hamas Reacts to Israeli Threats Against Jordan Hamas Reacts to Israeli Threats Against Jordan JN1604085694 Amman AL-RA'Y in Arabic 16 Apr 94 p 29 JN1604085694 Amman AL-RA'Y Arabic BFN [Text] London -- Quds Press -- Hamas in the occupied territory has rejected threats made by senior Israeli officials against Jordan for allowing Hamas activists to carry out political and media activities within its territory. In a telephone contact with the Quds Press, an authoritative source in Hamas said that his movement strongly disapproves of the arrogant threats made by Israeli rulers against the brothers in Jordan, adding that Hamas believes that such threats are desperate attempts to drive a wedge in the strong and close relations among the sons of the same people in Jordan and Palestine. The source said Israelis' failure to arrest those who carry out the attacks forced them to move the confrontation outside the occupied territory, to claim that armed operations are not launched from within the occupied territory, and to make frivolous threats against Arab brothers. Asked if he believes that his movement will face a secret war by the Israeli Intelligence Department similar to that campaign launched against the PLO two decades ago, the source said: We warn against any hostile acts, including terrorist assassinations, which Israeli officials would carry out -- motivated by their bloody background and feelings of frustration and despair -- against any of our brothers or against Hamas symbols and spokesmen. The source noted that his movement has preliminary information on an Israeli scheme to kill figures from Hamas. The source, however, did not give further details. Commenting on the accusations made at the joint news conference held by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres that the military operations are being planned outside the occupied territory, the spokesman [as published] said that the movement carries out no activities of a military nature in any Arab or non-Arab state, adding that the military activities' planning, command, and announcements are made inside the occupied territory. The source stressed that his movement is concerned about Jordan's security and stability, adding that the movement does not want to give the Israelis any excuse to infringe upon the country's unity and security. The source said: We condemn any Israeli attempt in this regard. The source added that Hamas has no organizational structure outside the occupied territory, noting that the Arab brothers are aware of this fact and understand the movement's great concern about their countries' security and stability. The source strongly criticized U.S. sympathy with the Israeli threats, saying that this is all aimed at widening the gap and preventing dialogue between the forces of the Palestinian people and official U.S. quarters. The source called on Washington to reassess its political positions and to show more understanding and realization of the nature of the political structure of the Palestinian people. The source warned that certain officials in charge of U.S. foreign policy are attempting to demolish the bases of peaceful relations. He added that this would create further hotbeds of tension and increase anger, resentment, and hostility toward everything related to the U.S. course.
