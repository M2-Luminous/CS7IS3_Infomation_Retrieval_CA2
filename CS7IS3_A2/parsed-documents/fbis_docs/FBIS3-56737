In his opinion, "the premier does not seem to be very fond of uncontrolled budget spending," while the government on the whole will sooner or later face the need to choose between stricter budget and monetary policies for the sake of preserving the budget and an additional emission in order to prevent the industries from falling to pieces. Yasin admitted that intentionally maintaining the ruble's stable rate and regular stepping back on promises "on the whole could not but exhaust themselves." "It is even more understandable that Fedorov fall victim to his own persistence and his well-known relations with the country's chief banker, Viktor Gerashchenko," he added. The head of the experts' council "fails to see anything terrible in the fact that the dollar will trade at 200-300 rubles more if it corresponds to the pace of inflation." According to his prognosis, the inflation rate in January will amount to 22-24%, "which is comparable with recent months." Speaking on Fedorov's possible successors, Yasin pointed to the current Deputy Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin as having the highest chances to replace Fedorov. "Sergey Konstantinovich has great professional experience with budget issues, and what is important as well is that he is not inclined to give away money right and left either," Yasin said. As Interfax learned from Dubinin's staff, no talks of his possible appointment had been held.
