Zedillo reacted in a written statement issued through the National Executive Committee of his party. Zedillo noted that Carpizo's resignation from his post as interior secretary is not acceptable under any circumstance considering his political and moral attributes and his contribution to democracy, the protection of human rights, and the country's domestic policy of tolerance and concerted effort. There is an interesting paragraph in the Zedillo letter which reads: The PRI confirms its commitment to contributing to the efforts being made by Dr. Carpizo. The PRI supports Dr. Jorge Carpizo and cordially asks the government of the republic not to accept his resignation and to provide its fullest support for the work done by Dr. Carpizo. The PRI also called on the Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD] to immediately respond with conviction to the dialogue initiatives made by Carpizo in his roles as interior secretary and president of the General Council of the Federal Electoral Institute [IFE] to achieve the goals of the political forces and of all citizens. The PRI also asked the PRD and its supporters to respond to the proposals made by Dr. Carpizo at the sessions held at the General Council of the IFE on 18 June, in which he appealed for no more attitudes of confrontation. It is also important to note that Ernesto Zedillo learned about Dr. Carpizo's letter in Toluca, Mexico State during a political event held with students at the technological institute, but the meeting was not very successful for Dr. Zedillo. There was much emotion and joy, but that was because of the Mexican soccer team's victory. Dr. Zedillo said the following: [Begin Zedillo recording] [Words indistinct] is for the national soccer team. [Students cheer] The rally has ended. Let us win on 21 August! [end recording] When the political rally ended, Dr. Ernesto Zedillo said he would issue a statement on the resignation of the interior secretary at the PRI. He eventually did issue his statement through an information bulletin. At the rally, he said: Please let me learn more about the matter.
