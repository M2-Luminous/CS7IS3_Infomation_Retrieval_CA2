Furayhah briefed 'Uwaydat on the investigation process of the bombing of the church in Zuq Mikha'il. After the meeting, Judge 'Uwaydat made a statement in which he denied a report published by the newspaper AL-DIYAR yesterday that he had exonerated the Lebanese Forces as an establishment of the charge of bombing the Sayyidat al-Najat church. He said the aforesaid newspaper's headlines differ from the article's text. He noted that what he really had said was that a judicial finding can only be decided on after completion of an investigation and will be declared subsequently in an indictment. He said that this rule pertains to the judicial procedure mechanism and does not mean anyone has been cleared, as the paper incorrectly concluded. He regretted the use of his statement for narrow-minded political purposes and as a pretext for a defense in the media aimed at detouring the investigations from their natural course. He noted that we need to continue the investigations in an objective atmosphere and in strict secrecy free from distortions of facts.
