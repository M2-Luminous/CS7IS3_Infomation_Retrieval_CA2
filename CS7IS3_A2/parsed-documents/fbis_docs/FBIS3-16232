[Meskauskas] The absolute majority of those who work here have come to work for the president without any reservations and doubts. Certainly, not all of them understood immediately how they should work. The president is very tactful, friendly, and sincere but he is also a demanding person and he does not like to repeat things twice. All of us try to perform our duties as honestly as possible. [Rameliene]The president's staff lead quite a settled way of life. Only one "ordinary" adviser and the chief one [Rajeckas was appointed ambassador to Great Britain] left over the first year. By the way, was it impossible to realize before the first anniversary that the position of the chief adviser is unnecessary? [Meskauskas] The question could be whether the function of the chief adviser was interpreted correctly. The president, as well as the majority of our staff, likes to deal with people directly -- with those who directly analyze some problem, work on some issue, and so on. Certainly, Mr. R. Rajeckas is a man with extraordinary skills. However, such were the circumstances. I do not know whether we will retain this position in the future or not. [Rameliene]People say that another adviser will soon leave for a Lithuanian Embassy abroad. [Meskauskas]I really do not know and cannot say anything about this. [Rameliene] In your opinion, which of the links at the President's Office is the weakest? [Meskauskas] I do not even know. Sometimes these links may lack coordination. We have three structures: Advisers with their own experts, the economic division, and the chancellery which engages in certain bureaucratic work. Therefore, sometimes we really have slight misunderstandings in our relations. We are trying to overcome them. [passage omitted] [Rameliene]How would you define relations between the president and the Seimas [parliament]? Do you not think that there would be fewer problems if you did not live under the same roof? [Meskauskas] To a certain degree, yes. The presidential institution would be clearly separated from the Seimas. We have not had any more serious problems in our relations with the legislature. True, the president rejected a couple of draft laws and sent them back to the Seimas for repeated consideration. However, this is normal -- both the parliament and the president can make mistakes. Eventually, one of the president's duties is to stabilize contradictions among different political forces. It is difficult to achieve this now: Both the community and the Seimas are very much divided. I think, however, that no one could reprimand the president for supporting only one force. [Rameliene] Nevertheless, some members of the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party faction say that it is as if people from the President's Office are trying to raise themselves above the Seimas.... [Meskauskas] None of us really intends to do so. However, one of the most important principles for the existence of a normal state is a clear and strict division of powers. Thus, we are seeking its implementation. In other words, we want the Seimas, the government, and the president whose functions are quite clearly defined in the Constitution to each do their work and not to interfere with the others. The president signs draft laws adopted by the Seimas. Thus, his advisers are primarily interested in the logic of these documents. As I have mentioned, it is this logic that they failed to find several times. [Rameliene]Have you not had any conflicts with the majority faction because of that? [Meskauskas] Not any serious ones. [passage omitted] [Rameliene]You have known A. Brazauskas for many years. Do you think that he has changed after becoming president? [Meskauskas] Probably not. I particularly appreciate that he has remained sincere. He praises us rather seldom, but we are not small children. If something is wrong, he tells about this immediately, without beating about the bush. He has always been exacting and industrious. In general, his life over the past several years has not been easy. While in the opposition, he was spited on and berated by anyone who would take the trouble. All this left a certain impression on him as if suppressing his vitality. The president is indeed a very lively person by nature.
