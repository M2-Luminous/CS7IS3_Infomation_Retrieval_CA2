OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the December 8, 1993, Federal Register (58 FR 64529), provided an opportunity for a public hearing of meeting on its substantive adequacy, and invited public comment on its adequacy (administrative record No. UT&hyph;879). Because no one requested a public hearing or meeting, none was held. The public comment period ended on January 7, 1994. During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns relating to the provisions of Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553.110, backfilling and grading of disturbed areas; Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553.500 and .600, the organization of Utah's rules pertaining to retained highwalls; Utah Admin.

R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553.500 and .523, stability criteria for retained highwalls; Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553.620, AOC variances; Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553.650, AOC and stability requirements of highwall retention; Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553.651, height and length of retained highwalls; Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553.652, the applicability date of Utah's AOC alternative; and various editorial comments concerning Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553.120, .631, .650, and .655. OSM notified Utah of the concerns by letter dated March 31, 1994 (administrative record No. UT&hyph;908). Utah responded in a letter dated April 18, 1994, by requesting a meeting between the Utah Division of Oil, Gas and Mining (Division) and OSM for the purpose of addressing the issues set forth by OSM in the March 31, 1994, letter (administrative record No. UT&hyph;918). On May 12, 1994, an executive session between the Division and OSM was held at the Western Support Center in Denver, Colorado to discuss Utah's revised program amendment regarding highwall retention. Notice of the executive session was posted in the Western Support Center (administrative record No. UT&hyph;925). A summary of the executive session was recorded by OSM and entered into the administrative record (administrative record UT&hyph;942). Utah responded to the concerns identified in OSM's March 31, 1994, letter and the issues discussed at the May 12, 1994, meeting by submitting a revised amendment dated June 28, 1994 (administrative record No. UT&hyph;941).
