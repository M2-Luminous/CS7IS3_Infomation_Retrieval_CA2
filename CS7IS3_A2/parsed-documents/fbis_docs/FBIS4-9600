Croatia's army has recently accumulated units and military equipment in Posavina, on the left bank of the River Sava, mainly in the wider areas of Slavonski Brod and Zupanja. According to the same source, large numbers of Croats and Muslims from Posavina are members of these units, and some new units have also been founded.
