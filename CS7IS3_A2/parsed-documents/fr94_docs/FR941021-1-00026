FR941021-1-00026 FR941021-1-00009 Background On April 15, 1982, the FAA announced the adoption of Amendment 67&hyph;11 (47 FR 16298; April 15, 1982) to the FAR (14 CFR part 67). The amendment revised, among other things, the special discretionary procedures for issuing airman medical certificates to persons who do not qualify for certification under §§67.13, 67.15, or 67.17 of the FAR. In the preamble to that amendment, the FAA announced that, in compliance with Executive Order 12291, Federal Regulation (February 17, 1981), it intended to conduct an overall review of the medical standards in part 67 of the FAR. A complete review of the regulations was needed to bring the standards and procedures for airman medical certification up to date with advances in medical knowledge, practice, and technology. Therefore, Amendment 67&hyph;11 was considered interim clarification until a comprehensive review of the medical standards contained in part 67 could be concluded. The FAA began the review of the medical standards for airmen and of its certification practices and procedures (47 FR 30795; July 15, 1982) by requesting public comment. In addition, the FAA initiated a contract with the American Medical Association (AMA) to provide professional and technical information. The AMA presented its report, ``Review of Part 67 of the Federal Air Regulations and the Medical Certification of Civilian Airmen'' (AMA Report), on March 26, 1986. The public was again invited to comment on part 67 in ``Announcement of the Availability of a Report'' (51 FR 19040; May 23, 1986). The AMA Report detailed the results of a comprehensive review of the standards for airman medical certification and of their application. The AMA Report considered pertinent advances in the field of medicine since 1959, recommended changes in FAA medical standards and explained the rationale for such changes. In a separate but related issue, on May 11, 1979, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) petitioned to amend §61.23 to require medical examinations for private pilots at 36-month intervals rather than at 24-month intervals. In response to the petition, the FAA reviewed the literature, surveyed the medical practices of the Department of Defense, and considered a preliminary analysis of its own aeromedical certification data. The FAA then contracted with Johns Hopkins University to prepare a detailed statistical analysis of information collected by the FAA from annual examinations on approximately 31,000 air traffic controllers over a 15-year period. The study sample was demographically similar and broadly comparable to the private pilot population, and the examinations were similar to airman medical examinations.
