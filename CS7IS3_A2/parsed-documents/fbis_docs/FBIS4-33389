Investments and production must be in the country. Here is a report by Jaime Guerrero. [Begin recording] [Guerrero] For the federal government, there is no alternative. Either one invests and produces in Mexico or the products of other countries will not be able to enter the North American free trade zone. President Salinas clearly stated that our country will not be a mere springboard for other nations to export to the United States. [Salinas] That is why these investments, especially German investments, are taking place now so as to take advantage of that opportunity, which the treaty has opened and which in fact means more jobs for our fellow countrymen. [Guerrero] The president spoke after inaugurating the first industrial complex of auto parts in Puebla. The inauguration came during his tour dealing with electricity services. In the past six years, the electric power generating capacity increased more than 35 percent. This is equivalent to supplying the Federal District and Mexico, Nuevo Leon, and Puebla States with electricity. In short, electric power service in the country is guaranteed. [Salinas] Without sufficient electric power, the foundations for additional economic growth for Mexico could not have been laid. [Guerrero] Salinas inaugurated the San Lorenzo Almecatla electricity substation in Puebla. Afterwards, in Guerrero State, he inaugurated the Presidente Plutarco Elias Calles thermoelectric plant. It is the biggest in Latin America and represents an investment of $2.5 billion. In this tour, President Salinas inaugurated three infrastructure projects which received investments from three different countries. [Salinas] We do not depend on either a single market or a single investor. [Guerrero] The results of this administration in the area of electricity service are positive. Twenty-one million Mexicans began receiving service and by the end of the government's six-year term, 95 percent of the population will have electricity. [end recording]
