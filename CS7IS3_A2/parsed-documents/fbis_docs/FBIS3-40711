Narasimha Rao, and the External Affairs Minister, Mr Dinesh Singh, said here on Tuesday. India also offered to train para-medical staff from Gaza and Jericho town, which had been granted self-rule by Israel and provide scholarships and seats to Palestinian students in its universities and colleges. The Prime Minister in his message here on the occasion of the observance of the international day of solidarity with the Palestinian people, said "we hope that all involved in the middle-east peace process will seize the opportunity of the peace accord for the advancement of the cause of peace and for just comprehensive settlement, which restores to the people their legitimate rights." Speaking at a function here, Mr Dinesh Singh said India will offer goods worth $1 million to the Gaza-Jericho self-government authority. A team of experts will be deputed to these areas to conduct feasibility studies for setting up a common facilities centre to impart training in small and medium scale industries and thereby generate employment. Mr Dinesh Singh said the world must face the challenge of terrorism unitedly. It is the need of the hour to denounce all forms of destabilising terrorism wherever it exists, "including cross-border encouragement and subversive activities from neighbouring countries." He said the signing of the declaration of principles on interim self-government arrangements was a notable first step towards ensuring peace and stability in West Asia. India will lend its good offices whenever required towards confidence building measures in the area, he added. "We hope that these steps would lead to further positive developments aimed at achieving the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people."
