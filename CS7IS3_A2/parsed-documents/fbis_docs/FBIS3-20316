His Friday [25 March] meeting with top Finnish representatives focused on Finnish experience concerning the process of entry of Finland to the European Union [European Union], something the Czech Republic would like to draw on when trying to join the EU. At the meeting, Klaus repeated several times his belief that the Czech Republic would be the next new EU member. He received assurances from the Finns that Finland would back the Czech entry into the EU. During the talks, both sides took position on the Partnership for Peace projects. Klaus said that the Czech Republic saw the project as a way to a full NATO membership, while Finnish Premier Esko Aho said his country was above all interested in peace-keeping operations under the project. Both sides said there were no obstacles in the Czech-Finnish bilateral relations and expressed disappointment that the present bilateral free trade agreement would have to go as a result of Finland acquiring EU membership. They agreed, however, that mutually, all possible measures would be taken to offset possible repercussions of the changes. On the weekend, Klaus visited Lapland in north Finland as the non-official part of his stay. Besides holding informal talks with Aho, Klaus availed himself of the opportunity to relax. Finnish media gave Klaus's visit high profile, expressing admiration over the results of Czech economic transformation.
