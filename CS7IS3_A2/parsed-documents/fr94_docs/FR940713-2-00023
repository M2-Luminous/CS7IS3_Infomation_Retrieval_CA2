Take notice that on June 17, 1994, Cranberry Pipeline Corporation (Cranberry) filed a petition for rate approval pursuant to section 284.123(b)(2) of the Commission's regulations. Cranberry requests that the Commission approve as fair and equitable a systemwide rate of $0.773 per Mcf for transportation services to be performed on its integrated (Meadville) Pennsylvania system under section 311(a)(2) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA). Cranberry states that it is an intrastate pipeline within the meaning of section 2(16) of the NGPA and it owns and operates discrete pipeline facilities in the States of West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Cranberry proposes an effective date of June 17, 1994. Pursuant to section 284.123(b)(2)(ii), if the Commission does not act within 150 days of the filing date, the rate will be deemed to be fair and equitable and not in excess of an amount which interstate pipelines would be permitted to charge for similar transportation service. The Commission may, prior to the expiration of the 150-day period, extend the time for action or institute a proceeding to afford parties an opportunity for written comments and for the oral presentation of views, data, and arguments. Any person desiring to participate in this rate proceeding must file a motion to intervene in accordance with sections 385.211 and 385.214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All motions must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission on or before July 22, 1994. The petition for rate approval is on file with the Commission and is available for public inspection.
