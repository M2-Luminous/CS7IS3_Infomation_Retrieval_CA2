FKI, chaired by Sunkyong Chairman Choe Chong-hyon, was authorized to form a single consortium to carry out the multibillion U.S.-dollar project by late next month. Getting all of the bidders to form a single consortium and selling stock in state-funded Korea Mobile was the government's way of finally getting the show on the road since Sunkyong had to give up the business license after beating five competitors in August 1992 over suspicion of nepotism as Choe was related to then- President No Tae-u by the marriage of their children. It now looks as if Sunkyong will be the main stockholder in Korea Mobile, and either POSCO or Kolon the leading shareholder in the new cellular phone company. In an unofficial board meeting at the weekend, Choe said that his group had decided to give up the second mobile phone project to live up to the expectations of the government and the public and for the sake of business unity. Ssangyong Group Chairman Kim Sok-won said his group will not seek to be leading shareholder of the new mobile phone company. That narrows the competition down to Sinsegi Mobile of Pohang Iron and Steel Co. and Second Mobile of the Kolon Group. Dongbu Mobile of the Dongbu Group and Tongyang Mobile of the Tongyang Group did not apply for the leadership position. After Choe announced that his group was withdrawing, FKI gave its support for Sunkyong to be prime shareholder of Korea Mobile. With the unanimous support for Sunkyong in its bid for Korea Mobile, POSCO is likely to concentrate on gaining control of the new cellular phone company.
