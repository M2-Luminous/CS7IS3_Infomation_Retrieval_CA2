But they believe banking authorities will permit conversion once the dust has settled on the yuan exchange-rate reforms. From January 1, all foreign companies were required to open yuan accounts with their banks for payments received in local currency. But remittances in hard currencies from yuan accounts will have to wait until the banking authorities have worked out the regulations. This follows the decision to unify the two-tier currency system by adopting a single managed-float exchange rate of about 8.7 yuan to the U.S. dollar, close to what was previously available in swap centres. Previously, the other rate used was the official rate of 5.8 yuan to the dollar. Several foreign airlines have reported that conversion into foreign currencies from these accounts has been frozen, whereas they do not encounter any problems with foreign exchange certificates (FECs), which are still freely converted into U.S. dollars at the old official rate of 5.8. British Airlines manager Charles Phelps-Penry said, "We are still able to remit FECs at the old rate of 5.8 to the dollar. But at the moment, they are not allowing yuan remittances because the Chinese authorities are still working out the regulations. We have been given to believe that this is a temporary situation, pending publication of final regulations." Because FECs are being withdrawn gradually from circulation, they are converted immediately into U.S. dollars when companies deposit them into their bank accounts. FECs can also be switched into yuan, but they are first converted into U.S. dollars at the old exchange rate of 5.8 and then re-converted into yuan at the new rate of about 8.7. Hans Hauri, China World Hotel's general manager, said that yuan payments through credit cards by his hotel guests could be converted directly into U.S. dollars. Conversion for cash payments in yuan was also allowed but was slightly more complicated. The chief representative of another airline said, "They are allowing deposits from credit-card sales in yuan to be remitted although it is a different matter for yuan cash deposits." He added that as long as the freeze was temporary, it would not pose a problem as the airline could use the bulk of the yuan earnings to finance its local expenses. Hong Kong Bank's Beijing chief representative, Gordon Lam, said he expected the freeze in yuan remittances to be only temporally and that the Bank of China would clarify the situation once it had come to terms with the changes. Many foreign investors who have been in China for the last three to five years hope that this problem can be resolved soon, as their operations are at a stage where they are beginning to produce profits to be repatriated. For them, the availability of foreign exchange is a source of concern, because they are competing with domestic enterprises and the Chinese for the limited hard currencies. "Although you still have the swap market to go to and exchange yuan into foreign currency, how available is the foreign exchange -- especially to investors now in their third or fourth year of operation, where there is enough profit being generated for repatriation?" said Johnny Chen, treasurer of the American Chamber of Commerce. "There is not enough hard currency for investors as a whole," said Mr Chen.
