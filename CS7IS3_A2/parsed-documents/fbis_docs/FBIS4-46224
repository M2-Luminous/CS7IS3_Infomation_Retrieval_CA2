[passage omitted] The last known rightist attack on a politician came in March 1992 when a shot was fired at Shin Kanemaru, the disgraced kingmaker of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Hosokawa, who has been burdened with questions surrounding his financial dealings, resigned last month as head of a fragile coalition government which replaced four decades of rule by the LDP. He has since maintained a low profile, reportedly staying at his Karuizawa retreat and at Tokyo hotels.
