Under journalistic and diplomatic cover, he worked a total of 12 years in the United States and then became deputy head of the KGB counterintelligence unit in Leningrad. Because of the strong accusations, declarations and disclosures from this unit, Mikhail Gorbachev stripped him of his rank of general and of his 22 decorations, but he regained them from Yeltsin later. Oleg Kalugin appears in the Western press regularly. In the course of one of his visits in London, he was imprisoned for a short time on suspicion that he was connected with the Markov-assassination with the poisoned umbrella. Our correspondent interviewed him in the hall of an elegant hotel in Moscow. [Horvath] Two years ago, Russian Intelligence Head Yevgeniy Primakov suggested that the United States and Russia mutually stop spying against each other. Was this a realistic offer? [Kalugin] Not at all. I do not think it was a serious offer either, because neither the interests of the West nor the interests of Russia can be asserted without spying today. In addition, the intelligence services now have more work to do with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the former predictable and monolithic system. It is the obligation of the intelligence services to inform their governments about the potential threats coming from the enemies of reforms within Russia and from the peripheries that are in flames today. We hope that the time will come when Primakov's offer can be implemented but, today, even clear allies like Israel, Japan, America, and France spy against each other. As for Russia, the tasks of our intelligence service have narrowed down, and there is a considerable difference between the former activity of the KGB and the current activity of the Foreign Intelligence Service. Formerly, we allocated tremendous energy to psychological warfare and to undermining the prestige and influence of our enemy. We are no longer engaged in such activity. [Horvath] Is that true? [Kalugin] I will explain why not: The CIA is no longer interested in Russia's disintegration and Yeltsin's fall. On the contrary, the United States is interested in maintaining and continuing the democratic changes. Nor is Russia interested in supporting communist parties all over the world. [Horvath] However, Washington might oppose the idea of Ukraine and Belarus joining Russia again.... [Kalugin] This does not fall in the jurisdiction of the CIA; they do not have so much power to decide on the fate of countries. One should not exaggerate the possibilities of intelligence. [Horvath] In the current international politics, what is the role of the information obtained by various states through illegal means? [Kalugin] Regarding today's Russia, the role of such information is extremely low. Our society is open now, and we hardly have any secrets. It is very difficult to keep back even the really confidential information. Nor is there any Russian secret policy against the United States, NATO, or the West. On the contrary, we would like to be the first to join NATO and precede all the other candidates. Today's intelligence service works more as an analysis center: It gathers and analyzes the information originating from various sources. [Horvath] Where is the dividing line between a diplomat gathering information legally and a secret agent under diplomatic disguise? [Kalugin] Honestly speaking, the difference is becoming increasingly smaller. For example, formerly we spent huge amounts of money to obtain inside information from the U.S. State Department, because the United States was interested in weakening the Soviet Union. We no longer have such motives. [Horvath] Thus, the current spy hysteria is totally unfounded. [Kalugin] The current American campaign is a rather hypocritical thing, because American agents are also active in Russia, and even within the KGB. There were people who were caught and condemned -- and even executed -- according to the law. But the Russian leadership never engaged in a noisy propaganda war. The Russian leadership regarded this as an "operational accident." True, I understand and partially excuse Clinton, because the U.S. conservative circles are suspicious of the too rapid rapprochement with Russia. After all, the loud declarations are only political gestures toward these circles. America is actually trying to help us, so the use of the principle of "tooth for tooth" would be irrational. On the other hand, intelligence is playing a considerable role in science and technology and in obtaining new markets, even among friendly nations. For example, Central Europe used to be the traditional market for the Soviet industry and it would not be fortunate to lose it. [Horvath] What role could the intelligence service play in this? [Kalugin] A wide role. It might seem unbelievable today, but I remember how proud the officials of the Hungarian intelligence were when they succeeded in obtaining some American types of corn with which one could increase production. At the time, we even looked down at them a little, although it really was an achievement, because they saved their country a lot of money. [Horvath] Suppose that the Russian intelligence is also active in Central Europe. Is obtaining such economic information among its major tasks? [Kalugin] Precisely so, and this is not aimed at forcing these countries back into the Warsaw Pact, because this would be a useless effort. [Horvath] In other words, we are not talking about support for pro-Russian parties and influencing election results. [Kalugin] This would only push Central Europe away from Russia. But there is sense in economic intelligence. For example, we learn that Hungarian-French talks are being held on the supply of certain products, while there is also a competitive Russian offer in that area. In that case, it is in our interest to discover the financial conditions offered by the French in order to lower our price and obtain or preserve our market positions. There is nothing morally condemnable in this. Moreover, intelligence services can even cooperate in the struggle against terrorism or drug trafficking, and then they actually contribute to some countries becoming closer to each other.
