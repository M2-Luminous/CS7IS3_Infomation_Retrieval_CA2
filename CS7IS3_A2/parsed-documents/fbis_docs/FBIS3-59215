As the minister said after the cabinet had approved the annual economic report for 1994, he will not allow his views to be altered by "professional Cassandras." Moderate wage agreements and low interest rates mean above all that the "growth" of between 0.5 percent and 1 percent in western Germany and between 6 percent and 8 percent in eastern Germany predicted by the government is realistic. An increase in prices of about 3 percent is not "too rosy a picture." As for the level of unemployment, which is supposed to rise by "about 450,000" in 1994, "a change of direction will only become possible in 1995." That is because this year, adjustments will still take place in large companies to make production cheaper. Criticism from the opposition and industrial associations to the effect that the government is being too optimistic about economic development was described as "carping and much ado about nothing" by Rexrodt. Rexrodt also demanded "fair treatment" for "the program for more growth and employment." It is incomprehensible that "some associations are already complaining that we have not done anything yet." However, along with the annual economic report, the government has already repealed the law on discounts as well as produced bills for a new conversion law and the introduction of small-scale joint-stock companies. Over the next few weeks, things will proceed "one after another." That particularly applies to labor measures, which include "sensational things" contained in the "action program." At the same time, the FDP politician complained about "spiritual ossification" in Germany, which manifests itself above all in hostility toward technology and "bureaucratic senility." Quoting Bismarck, the minister said: "Heavy industry always has a hard time." Rexrodt stressed that investors need "reliable budgetary perspectives." Scope must be created for "the necessary reduction in taxes and dues." Hermann Rind, FDP spokesman on economic affairs, criticized statements made by Joachim Gruenewald of the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] that in the next term of office, there will only be reform of company taxation that is neutral in its effects on revenue. As soon as the budgetary situation permits, the FDP would be more inclined to effect a genuine reduction in the taxation burden on companies, which is high in international terms.
