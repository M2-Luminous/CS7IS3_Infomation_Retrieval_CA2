For the Commission, there was President Delors, Mr. Van den Broek and Sir Leon Brittan. Mr. Tobin, moreover met European Commissioner for Fisheries Mr. Paleokrassas. The Transatlantic meeting allowed for an overview on: - the economic situation in the EC, Canada and at world level; - strengthening Euro-Canadian relations; - the prospects for NAFTA (North Atlantic Free Trade Association); - APEC's role (Forum for Asia/Pacific Economic Cooperation which held a meeting in Seattle, the United States, in November, without Europe having been invited). Mr. Delors said that the Community would like to have a "minor role" in these meetings, at least as observer: Mr. Chretien said that, given the traditional links between his country and Europe, it was up to Canada to transmit European concerns to the APEC countries; - the situation in Bosnia (Canadian troops are in Srebrenica), Russia and Ukraine (Canada has a large Ukraine minority). At the specific meeting over fishing, the following subjects were raised: (a) ratification of the new EC-Canada fisheries agreement. Both parties hope that the ratification will be over on both sides sometime this year; (b) access for Community vessels to Canadian ports, as provided for in the new agreement (this access has been closed since 1987); (c) the question (raised by Minister Tobin) of European vessels fishing off the Canadian coast under flags of convenience.
