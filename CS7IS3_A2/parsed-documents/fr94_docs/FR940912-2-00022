FR940912-2-00022 FR940912-2-00019 Financial Assistance Award; The National Academy of Sciences AGENCY: U.S. Department of Energy, Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center. ACTION: Notice of intent. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy (DOE), Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center, announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i) criteria (B) and (D) it intends to make a Non-Competitive Financial Assistance Award to The National Academy of Sciences for the support of its Board on Earth Sciences and Resources. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: U.S. Department of Energy, Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center, Acquisition and Assistance Center, P.O. Box 10940, MS 921&hyph;118, Pittsburgh, PA 15236, Attn.: Nancy Toppetta, Telephone: (412) 892&hyph;5715. Comments or inquiries should be submitted within 14 days of the date of this announcement. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The purpose of this proposed award is for the National Academy of Sciences to coordinate the National Research Council's advice to the federal government on solid earth science issues. The board will identify opportunities for advancing basic research and understanding, report on application of earth sciences in such areas as disaster mitigation and resource utilization and analyze scientific underpinnings and credibility of earth science information for resource, environmental and other applications and policy decisions. The project period for the grant is three years. In accordance with 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i) criteria (B), and (D), the National Academy of Sciences has been selected as the grant recipient. Criterion (B) is satisfied in that the NAS would conduct the proposed project using their own or third party resources. In addition to DOE, various other federal agencies, including DOI, NASA, NRC, and NSF are potential financial supporters of the Board's studies. Also, DOE/PETC will contribute only 6% of the total dollar of the three year project. Criterion (B) is also satisfied in that DOE support of the NAS Board on Earth Sciences and Resources will enhance public benefit. Specifically, benefit will result from the Board's studies in areas of overall health of the earth science disciplines (and education of earth scientists) that are vital to the nation in maintaining and increasing its capabilities to make wise use of the earth and its resources. Additionally, Criterion (B) is satisfied in that DOE knows of no other entity planning to accomplish the above stated purposes. Criterion (D) is satisfied in that, consistent with 41 U.S.C. 253, the National Academy of Sciences is a uniquely qualified (external) organization chartered by Congress in 1863 to conduct studies in the science and art when called upon by any Department of the Federal Government.
