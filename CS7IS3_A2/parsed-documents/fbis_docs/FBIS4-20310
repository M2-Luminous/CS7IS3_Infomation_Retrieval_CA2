Substantial progress has been achieved in nearly a month's time since the unification of exchange rates: first, the People's Bank publishes market exchange rates on a daily basis; second, the designated foreign exchange banks are all actively studying and implementing the announcement, making preparations for handling foreign exchange settlements and deposits; and, third, independent operators (enterprises engaged in foreign-exchange swap transactions) on the foreign-exchange swap markets have withdrawn from the swap markets, and the framework of transactions between foreign exchange banks is being gradually established. Thus, in terms of unifying exchange rates, the unification of exchange rates has been basically completed in a formal sense; the focus of work in the future should be put on observing the impacts of the reform of the exchange rate system on various areas and on exploring ways of achieving a "controlled floating" exchange rate system. First, with regard to the use of unitary exchange rates, during the transition period before 1 April, it is necessary to pay attention to the impact of exchange rate adjustments, and it is particularly necessary to study the issue of the extent to which the adjustments affect the macro economy, fiscal revenues and expenditures, and bank credits, thereby affecting the price level. Current analyses are conducted under a situation where the impacts of the unitary exchange rates on various area are not yet clear. In the beginning stage of the reform of the foreign exchange system, only by making further tracking observations will it be possible to find correct operating procedures. Second, in the "controlled" floating exchange rate system, floating is appearance, representing a normal phenomenon in regard to the trajectory of exchange rate movement and foreign exchange trading; but, it is "control" that is the key issue. How to do a good job of controlling the unitary floating rates so that "they may float but are not chaotic, remaining stable amid movement," thereby providing a stable exchange rate environment for the growth of the national economy, is a new issue facing us. Specifically, if a "controlled" floating exchange rate system is to be maintained, the central bank's intervention in the market is indispensable. It is necessary to study all the practical operational issues, including issues of time, location, and mode of intervention (if it is direct quantitative intervention, there will be the issue of the amount of foreign exchange to be sold or bought) as well as related issues of market analysis and of the understanding of market psychology. Third, the central bank's intervention in the market entails the issues of determining target areas, of the functioning of the mechanism of market trading, and of operating mechanisms. Unitary exchange rates have resolved the issue of dual exchange rates, but have not provided a stable exchange-rate level which the central bank must maintain in order to ensure the steady and rapid growth of the national economy. Whether unitary exchange rates can be stabilized at an appropriate (perhaps only relatively appropriate) level depends on whether there are a set of indicators used in observing the economy and market and a set of market transaction mechanisms which can serve to ensure the stabilization of the rates at an appropriate level. Therefore, it is necessary to actively cultivate and develop an interbank foreign-exchange trading market, making it both serve the trading on foreign exchange markets itself and be useful to the central bank in its intervention in foreign exchange markets. In order to establish a unified standardized national interbank foreign exchange market, the People's Bank of China and the State Administration of Exchange Control have decided to establish the Foreign Exchange Trading Center of China in Shanghai; through communications facilities, foreign exchange trading centers in all the major cities across the country will constitute a foreign exchange trading network centered on Shanghai. Furthermore, the central bank will also make the relevant rules and, together with designated market foreign-exchange banks, conduct actual examinations of banks' quoted exchange rates which are based on the central bank's market rates and of the appropriateness of the rates used by banks in their transactions with customers. Ultimately the central bank should formulate a time-point or time-period framework of its intentions regarding the regulation of the foreign exchange market. Fourth, although "floating" exchange rates only represent appearance and form, they still need to be further studied. The ideal situation of movement of RMB exchange rates should be a situation of some floating in the medium and long term without too much floating in the near term. Exchange rates which remain fixed for a long time will lose the flavor of "floating," and will even become fixed rates. If floating happens too frequently and too violently, RMB exchange rates will be in a chaotic situation governed by no laws, thereby producing many harmful effects on the reform of the foreign exchange system and on the development of the national economy. Fifth, to further reform the exchange rate system and the foreign exchange system as a whole, it is necessary to carry out supporting reforms in various areas. For instance, exchange rate fluctuations will result in enterprises facing exchange rate risks. All this on the one hand requires that further reform of enterprises' operating mechanisms be carried out so as to establish a modern enterprise system, and on the other hand also requires that our designated foreign exchange banks be able to provide enterprises with risk-avoidance services commonly seen on the international financial market, such as value-preserving forward hedging and foreign currency forward trading. Sixth, the floating and control of exchange rates raise higher demands on the domestic money and credit supply, adjustment of interest rates, and the central bank's use of those means to adjust macro-monetary policy. The central bank should adopt different measures to flexibly control floating rates in view of different situations; sometimes it should intervene in the market to directly affect exchange rates and prices for foreign exchange, but sometimes it should pursue the root causes or take facilitating measures to provide support, raising or lowering interest rates and tightening or loosening the retrieval of RMB so as to achieve the goal of "stability amid floating." Finally, more detail-oriented work will also be needed to improve the management of foreign debts and foreign-owned banks and to achieve other objectives.
