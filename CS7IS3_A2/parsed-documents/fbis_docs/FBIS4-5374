FBIS4-5374 "dreas069_d_94017" FBIS-EAS-94-069 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 South Korea Shipment of U.S. Apache Helicopters `Deployed' Shipment of U.S. Apache Helicopters `Deployed' SK1104115894 Seoul YONHAP in English 1150 GMT 11 Apr 94 SK1104115894 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 11 (YONHAP) -- The United States had by last Sunday deployed in South Korea part of the up-to-date Apache attack helicopters it plans to bring into Korea to build up the battle ability of the U.S. Forces in Korea, a Japanese daily reported Monday. In a dispatch from Seoul, the ASAHI SHIMBUN quoting a South Korean military source said the first batch of ground-to-air Patriot missiles, too, is expected to arrive in South Korea toward this weekend and early next week timed with U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry's visit to Korea. Both Apache helicopters and Patriots are designed to help prepare against contingency on the Korean peninsula, the paper said. ASAHI said they were initially set to be deployed in Korea by mid-March but their deployment has been delayed in consideration of the inter-Korean contacts that had been going on at that time on the issue of exchanging special envoys. About 30 Apache helicopters are set to be taken into Korea, including those already deployed at U.S. military installations north of Seoul, it said.
