Police have also arrested three Shenzhen-based labour activists accused of organising workers in sweatshop factories in southern China, according to a Chinese source. Diplomats in Beijing said these hardline measures could endanger China's chances for renewal of Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status with America. The arrests could also destroy the points scored by Beijing by its "medical parole" recently granted to "black hand" dissidents Wang Juntao and Chen Ziming. Dissidents and Justice Ministry sources said top officials had decided against a more lenient three-year administrative sentence in a labour camp for Wei, who is considered the father of China's pro-democracy movement. Instead, Beijing would prosecute him on charges of "plotting to overthrow the Government using foreign forces", said a source with close ties to the Justice Ministry. Wei, 44, angered Chinese leaders when he met U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights John Shattuck in February and asked him to use the threat of revoking MFN to gain improved treatment of political prisoners. On April 1 he was stopped by police as he tried to enter Beijing from a forced exile in nearby Tianjin. Four days later police accused Wei, who had been released last year after almost 15 years in prison, of unspecified new crimes. Authorities had been gathering evidence against the outspoken Wei since his release on parole last September, including alleged evidence that he and his secretary, Tong Yi, who is also to be tried, were living together but not married. After his April detention government officials allegedly pressured Tong's estranged husband to sue her for adultery. Under China's vague and arbitrary administrative detention regulations, police could then have sentenced both Wei and Tong to long labour camp sentences for "lack of morals", thus avoiding a trial, one dissident said. Tong's husband did not sue his wife. The prosecution of Wei as a direct result of his contact with a high-ranking U.S. Government official carries serious implications for U.S. President Bill Clinton. The weekend parole of Chen Ziming had apparently made Mr Clinton's decision on renewing MFN easier. But the prosecution of Wei, who was first incarcerated on the personal orders of senior leader Deng Xiaoping in 1979 for his calls for political reform, could change that. In addition to his alleged collusion with the U.S. Government, dissident sources said, Wei could also be prosecuted for writing an "illegal" autobiography, as well as his efforts to provide financial assistance to blacklisted dissidents. The three other men were arrested for trying to organise an independent union in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone. They had put out two issues of a mimeographed underground newsletter that aired worker complaints over low pay, forced overtime and unsafe work conditions, and informed workers about laws and regulations protecting their interests. A Chinese source identified the three as Li Wenmin and Kuang Lezhuang, both college students, and Liu Hutang, a factory worker. The first issue of their newsletter attacked authorities for allowing a Hong Kong-owned factory in Shenzhen to ignore safety regulations, resulting in a fire that killed 84 workers. "Rights will not be bestowed on us, but are something we must fight for," it urged. "If we unite, we will become a powerful force." In March and April, police arrested four Beijing men and briefly detained several others suspected of trying to form unofficial worker organisations. One of the four escaped from prison and fled the country, but the others remain held incommunicado without any formal charges. [passage omitted]
