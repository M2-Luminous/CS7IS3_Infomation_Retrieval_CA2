Deputies Mistrust Post-Soviet Laws"] [Text] Today, the State Duma is scheduled to hold hearings on the consistency of the constitutions and charters of the Federation components with the Constitution of the Russian Federation. According to the hearings' sponsors -- members of the State Duma committee on the affairs of the federation and regional policy -- the presidents of Kalmykia, Tuva, and North Ossetia agreed to attend the hearings. The other regions will be represented by "the authors of local constitutions and charters." The staff of the Russian president will apparently be represented by Sergey Filatov, who "promised to come to open the hearings if he can." The sponsors have said that Sergey Shakhray, who, although removed from the post of minister for the affairs of nationalities and regional policy, evidently is not going to weaken his contacts with the regional leaders, also plans to be present at the hearings. Federation Council Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko will not attend because he is currently in Latin America, so the Senate will be represented by his deputy, Ramazan Abdulatipov. Aleksandr Arinin, member of the Federation Committee, said that "the Treaty on Social Accord is designed to speed up the process of bringing regional constitutions in line with the federal one." A total of 17 out of 21 republics that are part of the Russian Federation have their own constitutions. According to Mr. Arinin, territorial constitutions "can be divided into three types:" old constitutions of Soviet socialist republics (in Mordovia, Chuvashia, Udmurtia, Mari-El, Kabardino-Balkaria, North Ossetia, and Dagestan); new constitutions adopted before 12 December 1993 (Tatarstan, Sakha-Yakutia, Chechnya, and Tuva); and constitutions adopted after the new Russian Fundamental Law went into force (Bashkortostan, Buryatia, Ingushetia, Komi, and Karelia). Activists of the State Duma committee have told your SEGODNYA correspondent that, in their view, "republican constitutions adopted after 1992 are most inconsistent with the Russian Fundamental Law." As for the "Soviet-type" constitutions, Deputy Valentin Mikhaylov thinks, "they have minor deviations that can be eliminated fairly easily." To all appearances, an entirely different view will be held by an expert commission of the Central Electoral Commission and the executive authorities, which has recently "studied the Mordovian Constitution as to its consistency." Even according to the experts' preliminary impressions, Mordovian laws are inconsistent with the new Russian Constitution precisely because "they effectively recreate the Soviet system." Duma deputies were not certain, however, that the commission's findings would be made public during the parliamentary hearings. Interestingly, at yesterday's news conference State Duma Deputy Yegor Zhirkov, an author of the Sakha-Yakutia Constitution, protested against the Federation Committee members' using unlawful terms, such as "the violation of and inconsistency with the Russian Constitution," regarding his republic's fundamental law. "Our Constitution was checked by expert commissions from Moscow; in particular, Boris Topornin noted its full consistency with the fundamentals of the constitutional order," Deputy Zhirkov assured. The committee members promised that they would insist on setting up "a joint commission on constitutional reform" to include representatives of executive and legislative authorities of the center and the regions so as "to devise a single approach to making on a contract basis possible changes to both regional constitutions and the new Russian Constitution." However, the deputies themselves conceded that reaching "a common approach" would be nearly impossible even during today's hearings, because some influential State Duma factions think that republics may only be formed according to the territorial principle, while Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, for instance, even demands that all republics be reduced "to the level of governorates."
