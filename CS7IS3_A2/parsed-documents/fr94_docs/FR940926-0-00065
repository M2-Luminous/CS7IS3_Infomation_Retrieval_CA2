ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: In this final rule, RSPA is correcting editorial errors, making minor regulatory changes and, in response to requests for clarification, improving the clarity of certain provisions to the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR). In addition, RSPA is revising legal citations in the HMR based on the codification of the hazardous materials transportation laws. The intended effect of this rule is to enhance accuracy and reduce misunderstandings of the HMR. The amendments contained in this rule are minor editorial changes and do not impose new requirements. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 26, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jennifer Antonielli, Office of Hazardous Materials Standards, (202) 366&hyph;4488, Research and Special Programs Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590&hyph;0001. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background RSPA annually reviews the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) to detect errors which may be causing confusion to readers. Inaccuracies corrected in this final rule include typographical errors, incorrect references to other rules and regulations in the CFR, inconsistent use of terminology, and misstatements of certain regulatory requirements. In response to inquiries RSPA received concerning the clarity of particular requirements specified in the HMR, certain other changes are made to reduce uncertainties. In addition, RSPA is revising all legal citations contained in the HMR to reflect the codification of transportation laws relating to hazardous materials under 49 U.S.C. 5101&hyph;5127. Since these amendments do not impose new requirements, notice and public procedure are unnecessary. For the same reason, there is good cause to make these amendments effective without the customary 30-day delay following publication. This will allow the changes to appear in the next revision of 49 CFR. The following is a section-by-section summary of the amendments made under this final rule. It does not discuss editorial corrections (e.g., typographical, capitalization, and punctuation errors) or changes to the legal citations. Part 106 Section 106.3. Paragraph (b) is revised to reflect the correct title of the Associate Administrator for Pipeline Safety, and a new paragraph (c) is added which delegates authority to the Associate Administrator for Research, Technology and Analysis. Appendix A to Part 106. Appendix A to part 106 is removed because it duplicates the provisions in §106.3. Part 107 Section 107.329. In paragraphs (a) and (b), references to ``subchapter B of this chapter'' are revised to read ``this subchapter''. Section 107.403. In paragraph (c), references to ``Director'' are revised to reflect the correct title of the Associate Administrator for Hazardous Materials Safety. Section 107.503. Paragraph (c) is revised to reflect the correct reference to the ASME Certificate of Authorization. Part 171 Section 171.2. The term ``rail freight car'' is replaced with ``rail car''. Section 171.7. The entry for Compressed Gas Association is revised to reflect the correct address. Section 171.8. In the definition of ``NPT'', the wording ``in compliance with the'' is revised to read ``conforming to'' for consistency. Section 171.11. In paragraph (d)(6)(i), the wording ``§171.203(d)(1)(iii)'' is revised to reflect the correct section reference. Section 171.12. In paragraph (d)(1), the wording ``§171.203(d)(1)(iii)'' is revised to reflect the correct section reference. Part 172 Section 172.101. All references to ``the appendix'' in paragraph (c)(8) are revised to read ``Appendix A''. In paragraph (g), the reference to ``subpart D'' is revised to read ``subpart E''. In addition, paragraph (d)(4) is amended to refer to ``§173.150 (e) or (f)'' since both provisions set forth criteria for reclassing a material as a combustible liquid. The Hazardous Materials Table (the Table). In the Table, the entry ``Ethylene oxide and carbon dioxide mixtures, see Carbon dioxide and ethylene oxide mixtures, etc.'' is removed because ``Carbon dioxide and ethylene oxide mixtures'' is not listed as a proper shipping name. Section 172.102. Special Provision 14 is amended to clarify the definition of motor fuel antiknock mixtures. Special Provision 42 is removed because the same provision appears in §173.218. In Special Provision B33, the phrase ``is subject to the following requirements.'' is revised to read ``must conform to Table 1 as follows.'' In paragraph (c)(7)(ii), the statement ``These provisions apply only to transportation in IM portable tanks:'' is removed because it duplicates the introductory text of paragraph (c)(7). Special Provision T31 is amended by correcting the abbreviation ``kpa'' to ``kPa''. Additionally, in Special Provision T31, the temperature ``65 ○C'' is revised to read ``65.6 ○C''. Section 172.203. Paragraph (h)(2)(i) is amended by replacing the word ``to'' with the word ``of'' preceding the words ``this subchapter''.
