It has been in first place in Japan since 1977. Aichi has a broad range of industries. It has local industries such as textiles, ceramics, and food processing. It is in a broad range of fields involving mechatronics, including automobiles, machine tools, electrical equipment, and precision machinery. It is also achieving noteworthy developments in new technology fields such as fine ceramics and aerospace. Aichi's excellent record in ``making things'' has been attributed to: a wealth of natural resources such as land, water, and ports; its position in the middle of the Tokaido megalopolis stretching from Tokyo to Osaka; its superb transportation infrastructure of railroads and highways; and its reliable management resources and local networks which have been fostered since the time of the Owari daimyo. Facing the twenty-first century the Tokai region centering around Aichi hopes to become even more of an industrial capitol focused on manufacturing as a key region in manufacturing technology which is open to the world. Aichi is culturally active. In October 1992 Aichi opened the Aichi Arts and Culture Center where opera can be fully staged. Aichi also has long fostered the traditional theatrical arts. Preparations for a Headquarters of R&D and Exchange: Science and Technology Exchange Center Plans and Toyohashi Science Core Aichi is planning an important development and research area called the Aichi Science R&D Center which will center in the 20 kilometer hilly region to the west and east of Nagoya. It is trying to build a national center for research exchange which will rival Tsukuba and the Kansai region by attracting leading technology companies, laboratories, and universities for research centered in this geographic zone. As part of its plan, Aichi is planning a Science and Technology Exchange Center (tentative name) as a center for researchers' exchange. This will be the pioneering project of its central zone area, a candidate for a 21st Century world's fair (see below). Currently, Aichi aims to set up by 1994 the foundation that will be the main organization. It is making final adjustments as it develops a consensus among the region's industry, academia, and national research institutes. It is already, as expected, expanding research exchange by establishing and running exchange groups organized on a membership basis and by holding forums. According to the plan, once the facilities are completed the work of education, information dissemination, and promotion of cooperative research will begin in earnest using the Center as headquarters. This will be part of a process of establishing a world-class industrial technology R&D region which will be a center for disseminating scientific and technical around the world. Moreover plans are being carried forward for Science Create 21 which would establish a industry-academia-government R&D base centered on Toyohashi Technical University of Technology in Toyohashi, the main city in the Toyokawa region. Toyohashi Science Core was completed in November 1992 as Science Create 21's key facility under Civil Law (minkotsu) Number 1. It will be operated by the third sector Science Create 21 K.K. which was established to promote the improvement and activity of the Toyokawa region's industry. It is developing projects in areas such as joint R&D, personnel training, industry-academia exchanges, and support for nurturing new companies. It will thereby support the region's R&D and technology development activities. Strengthening the Development of Frontier Technology and Design: Chubu Aerospace Industry Technology Promotion Center and International Design Center Aichi is aggressively addressing the issue of promoting next generation frontier technologies at the same times as it builds an R&D base. The 1988 Aichi Prefecture Industrial Technology Promotion Plan named frontier technologies which the region should target: mechatronics, new materials, aerospace, artificial intelligence, and biotechnology. In addition to promoting the location in Aichi of national-level research laboratories in these technology areas, Aichi is promoting international technology exchange by attracting various international conferences. Since the small but concentrated aerospace industry involves advanced technology with applications to many industries, in 1989 the Chubu Aerospace Industry Technology Promotion Research Center was established through industry-academia cooperation. In September 1993 it was expanded into the Chubu Aerospace Industry Technology Promotion Center for the purpose of expanding its work and strengthening its structure. The Center will promote the region's policy initiatives, research exchange, and diffusion of technology to other industries. The Tokai region already accounts for about 50% of the nation's aerospace assembly work, but it's planning to increase that concentration by attracting related large-scale testing and evaluation facilities such as high Reynolds number wind tunnels. The prefecture is also putting its energy into improving design development ability, another part of strengthening research capabilities. Design is playing a more and more important role in linking industry and life and in linking high technology and emotions. The prefecture is building an International Design Center to strengthen design capabilities and to establish a base for the world-wide transmission of design information. For that purpose a third sector corporation was set up with the cooperation of the prefecture, Nagoya city, and business. The building is planned to open in 1996. Strengthening Regional Information Transmission: Transportation Infrastructure Preparation and Holding a World's Fair in 2005 Aichi and the rest of the Tokai region are strongly promoting the expansion of the region's transportation infrastructure for the 21st century, including roads and the Tokai-Hokuriku line, through three big public-private projects: Chubu New International Airport, Number 2 Tokyo-Nagoya/Nagoya-Kobe Highway, and the Chuo Shinkansen train line. Aichi's prosperity as an industrial region has rested on its fortunate geographic location in the center of Japan, a strategic point in national transportation, including roads, railroads, and ports. However, it is important that Aichi improve its transportation system so that it increases its role as an information base open to Japan and to the world. Only then can Aichi change towards a more balanced industrial structure less skewed toward processing and assembly. Only then can it hope to step up to become a key region for industrial technology open to the world, the kind of region advocated by the Fourth National Comprehension Plan? of the 21st century. Aichi is planning to complete this infrastructure by 2005 because it will hold the 21st century's first world's fair. Aichi is trying to attract [participants] from all over the world and is engaging in various kinds of preparation -- with the support of the relevant ministries such as MITI and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs -- for the 21st Century World's Fair (tentative name) which is planned to be the largest exhibition in Japan since the 1970 world's fair in Osaka. The candidate region has selected the southeast portion of Seto City in the heart of the above-mentioned Aichi Science R&D Zone. It has a theme rooted in the area's potential: Technical and cultural exchange--Creation of a new world. The Committee for the Basic Concept of the 21st Century World's Fair (chairman: N. Kimura, professor emeritus, University of Tokyo) made up of learned persons from various fields is moving towards selecting a basic concept by June 1994. An interim report echoed the basic significance of a world's fair by proposing ``a `New world's fair as a grove for exchange among global citizens' in which the world's people think, discuss, propose and identify solutions, and disseminate their information to the world.'' The committee is groping for a new approach to operation, participation, and other aspects of holding the event. After the basic concept has been accepted by Aichi and the nation has decided to go ahead with holding the fair, a formal application will be made to the Bureau of International Expositions (BIE) in 1996, nine years in advance. Aichi has done public relations work with foreign countries at the World's Fair in Sevile and the Genoa exhibition in 1992 and at the Taejon, Korea, exhibition in 1993. Hopes are high that if the BIE grants permission and the world's fair is held successfully, then the incredible information-spreading power of a world's fair will offer an opportunity for rapid progress in the region and, in turn, will foster information and develop the region's industry.
