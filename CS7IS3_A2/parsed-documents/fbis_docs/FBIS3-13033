It has been learned that in such a case, Israel will agree to push forward the implementation of some parts of the Gaza-Jericho first agreement. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin yesterday said that the Gaza-Jericho first agreement can be implemented in "half the time" stipulated in the Declaration of Principles. Meanwhile, political sources yesterday denied reports on contacts aimed at organizing a Rabin-'Arafat summit in the near future.
