In practice, it achieved all its planned aims and created the conditions for the success of the upcoming general strike on 17 May. KNSB President Professor Krustyu Petkov declared this at a news conference today. A few hours later, the KNSB Executive Committee decided at a meeting to instruct the KNSB National Strike Committee to start preparing for the general strike tomorrow. The committee also decided to support the Union of Democratic Forces' [SDS] proposal for updating the national budget. The KNSB Executive Committee appeals to the parliamentary groups of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP], Rights and Freedoms Movement [DPS], Union of Democratic Forces [SDS], and other members of the dynamic majority not to cast their votes against the cabinet retaining its present membership. The KNSB leadership has unfortunately established that the government ignored the strike and encouraged repressive actions aimed at threatening the strikers and trade union leaders. Following his visit to Dupnitsa today with General Kosta Bogatsevski [chief secretary of Interior Ministry], Professor Krustyu Petkov stated that the KNSB has no claims in connection with the action taken by the local police there, but believes that the police were ordered to counteract the strike action there and that the order came from people above Interior Minister Viktor Mikhaylov. The actions of the KNSB may bring the communists to power, Dr. Konstantin Trenchev, president of the Podkrepa Labor Confederation, declared at a news conference today. Podkrepa's view that the government is procommunist and is promoting active recommunization remains unchanged. According to Trenchev, the solution is to hold elections. At the moment, Podkrepa is waiting to see how the situation develops because no further mistakes can be allowed to occur, Dr. Trenchev said. However, the confederation's position might change to an aggressive stance if the Podkrepa Confederative Council decides so at its meeting on 9-10 May in Pazardzhik.
