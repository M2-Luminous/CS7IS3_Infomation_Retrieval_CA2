FBIS4-13692 "drnes078_o_94003" FBIS-NES-94-078 Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 Syria U.S. Diplomacy Must Go Beyond `Mailman's Mission' U.S. Diplomacy Must Go Beyond `Mailman's Mission' JN2104143394 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 1130 GMT 21 Apr 94 JN2104143394 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Station commentary] [Excerpts] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will begin a new tour of the region within days in a mission aimed at advancing the peace process. The U.S. secretary's visit comes after a lengthy halt in the Washington peace talks and in the wake of a premeditated Israeli attempt to conceal the peace process behind a thick wall of blood and fire. Meanwhile, the Israeli rulers stabbed the peace process in the back, undermined it, and derailed it from the bases set for it. This has created a gloomy and disappointing atmosphere, making it hard to be optimistic about the possibility of advancing the peace process and extricating it from the difficult situation created by the Israeli rulers. Perhaps the phrase advancing the peace process has been rendered meaningless. It has been repeated so many times without any really positive result. U.S. officials have made many journeys between Washington and the region in a mission they call advancing the peace process, or helping the parties overcome difficulties and return to the negotiating table. This is because those officials' tours, visits, and talks have not gone beyond a mailman's mission. They have not placed the wheels of the peace train on the track to the aspired and set objective of a just, comprehensive peace. There is a great difference between the mission of advancing the peace process and a mailman's mission. There is a great difference between the role of a full partner and impartial broker on the one hand and the role of a silent partner ignoring Israel's evasion of the objectives of the U.S. initiative and disavowal of its bases and frameworks. The full-partner role the United States has chosen to play has not led to a change in the role played by U.S. officials. Thus, it has been revealed that the U.S. partner is a partner only in terms of complaining about the halt in the negotiations and about the looming difficulties and obstacles. Besides, this partner evades the requirements of this partnership, represented by the need to call for adopting the bases set for the peace process and respecting international legitimacy and its resolutions. Moreover, two days ago, a U.S. official called on the Arabs to appease Israel, fully normalize relations with it, to end the Arab boycott, and to meet other similar requests previously made by the Israeli rulers. This shows Washington absolutely adopts the requests of one party, and absolutely ignores the requests of the other party. It seems the memory of some Washington officials is weak. They do not remember, or rather do not want to remember, that the party occupying others' territory is Israel, that the party confiscating others' rights is Israel, that the party that launched aggressive wars is Israel, that the party that defied the resolutions of international legitimacy is Israel, and that the party that rejected the bases of the peace process and conspired against it is Israel. On the other hand, the Arabs have been the victims of the Israeli rulers' aggression, expansionist policy, and constant threat of using weapons, including weapons of mass destruction. In this case, we ask: Who is required to prove their good intentions: The Arabs or Israel? The Arabs have accepted UN resolutions and cooperated with all international initiatives to establish peace. The Arabs did all that in a quest for a just, comprehensive peace. No peace can be established and last unless it is just and comprehensive. However, others should know that the desire for peace cannot lead the Arabs to capitulate to the law- breaking Israeli rulers. Nor can it lead the Arabs to accepting that dictates are imposed on them, as wished by Rabin and those who sympathize with him. [passage omitted] However, what happened after the Geneva meeting between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton made many parts of the world news media pose a legitimate question about whether the U.S. Middle East policy is drawn by the elected U.S. President, who has adopted the peace process and its bases and called for a just, comprehensive peace, or by other parties who want to appease Israel at the expense of the Arabs and their rights, justice, peace, and international legitimacy.
