"The crisis in the East Africa region threatens every nation in the region and is caused by drought conditions and civil conflicts," White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said in a statement. "At this early stage, it is still possible to avoid widespread famine," Myers said, "but an estimated 20 million people are currently at risk and may have to leave their homes to search for food." Brian Atwood, administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, is the head of the bipartisan delegation that includes members of Congress and representatives of volunteer organizations working in the area. The delegation left here today and will travel to Ethiopia, Eritrea and Kenya.
