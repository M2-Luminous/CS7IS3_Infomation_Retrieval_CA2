In the late 1940s Inner Mongolia had not even the capability to produce nails or matches. But since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 the central government has sent experts to help the region set up universities, and natural and social sciences institutes there. By the end of last year the total number of scientists and experts of various disciplines was 455,000. The number of experts from minority nationalities is 96,000, some 61 percent of the region's cadres from ethnic nationalities. They have achieved remarkable successes in the fields of veterinary science, medicine, forestry, and new building materials. Li Donggen, a professor of the Korean nationality, has applied remote-sensing technology to forestry resources. Xu Gorigan, a scholar of the Mongolian nationality, is now president of Inner Mongolia University. He produced the world's first test-tube goat and has made new progress in animal fertilization tests. He received a doctorate in Japan for research on techniques of external fertilization of sheep. Female scientists account for almost half of the total. They are engaged in research into medicine, mechanics, wool spinning and steel making. Zhang Jiahua, a professor at the Inner Mongolia Institute of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, won a scientific progress prize for her new polyploidy beet breed.
