FR941003-0-00080 FR941003-0-00014 Although most population surveys are likely to involve only Level B harassment or no harassment at all, pinniped rookeries are an area of concern because many pinniped species stampede into the water when startled or otherwise threatened by a potential predator or by human activity. When a stampede occurs in a haulout area (in the non-reproductive season), it generally does not involve a potential injury, but in a rookery situation, a stampede has the potential to injure pups. The 1,000 ft (305 m) threshold for aerial surveys over pinniped rookeries serves as an objective standard that may be used to determine whether such research may be conducted under the General Authorization or may involve potential injury to marine mammals (i.e., Level A harassment) and, therefore, require a permit. In this regard, NMFS is interested in comments on whether different species-specific aerial survey altitudes or methods associated with minimal disturbance have been established definitively in the scientific literature. In the interest of simplicity and predictability, the interim final rule limits research activities that may be conducted under the General Authorization to only those types listed in ยง216.45(a)(3). In preparing this interim final rule, however, NMFS considered including provisions that would have allowed research activities other than those types listed in ยง216.45(a)(3) to be included under the General Authorization; Provided , That in the letter of intent the applicant described the activity and furnished supporting documentation sufficient for NMFS to determine that the activity likely would involve only Level B harassment. For example, although bleach marking of pinnipeds in the wild is a type of research that could injure marine mammals (Level A harassment), if the activity is being conducted by an experienced researcher using only non-toxic bleaching agents and proven direct application methods on a species for which there is an established record of tolerance of such methods without any disturbance with potential to injure (e.g., Northern elephant seals, Mirounga angustirostris ), NMFS, upon receipt of a letter of intent containing sufficient documentation, could determine such activity likely would involve only Level B harassment and that the activity could be conducted under the General Authorization. NMFS is requesting comment on whether the final rule should include such flexibility; i.e., allow persons to conduct, under the General Authorization, a research activity that has not been listed in the regulations as a type of research likely to involve only Level B harassment, if sufficient documentation is submitted to NMFS to make a determination that the activity is bona fide scientific research and does not involve the potential to injure marine mammals or marine mammal stocks. Applicants An applicant submitting a letter of intent to conduct scientific research under the General Authorization must be the principal investigator, or the appropriate institution, government entity, or corporation responsible for the supervision of the principal investigator. If the research involves co-investigators, a single principal investigator, who will be primarily responsible for the research to be conducted under the General Authorization, must submit the letter of intent, with all co-investigators identified as such. Identification of both principal and co-investigators ensures accountability for activities conducted under the General Authorization. All persons conducting an activity under the authority of the General Authorization must possess qualifications (e.g., education or experience) commensurate with their duties and responsibilities, or must be under the direct supervision of a person with such qualifications. Applicants must enclose with the letter of intent, curricula vitae for themselves and any co-investigators that may conduct research activities under the General Authorization. NMFS will consider this information in determining whether the research as described in the letter of intent can be expected to be conducted in a manner involving no more than Level B harassment of marine mammals or marine mammal stocks. Letter of Intent Persons intending to conduct a scientific research activity of the type listed in ยง216.45 (a)(3) under the General Authorization must submit, at least 60 days before commencement of such research, a letter of intent by certified return/receipt mail to the Chief, Permits Division, F/PR1, Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, 1335 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910&hyph;3226. Persons issued an ESA scientific research permit authorizing the take of marine mammals in the wild by Level B harassment, however, need not submit a letter of intent. Those Level B activities are covered by the General Authorization, and no letter of confirmation is needed. All letters of intent must include the name, address, telephone number, qualifications, and experience of the applicant (i.e., principal investigator) and any co-investigator(s). Curricula vitae must be provided for each, including a list of publications by such investigator relevant to the objectives, methodology, or other aspects of the proposed research. Each letter of intent must be signed, dated, and include the certification statement specified at ยง216.45(b)(3). Each letter of intent must include brief statements responsive to the information requirements of section 104(c)(3)(C) of the MMPA: The species or stocks of marine mammals (common and scientific names) that are the subject of the scientific research and any other species or stock of marine mammals that may be harassed during the conduct of the research; the geographic location(s) in which the research is to be conducted, e.g., geographic name or lat./long.; the period(s) of time over which the research will be conducted (up to 5 years), including the field season(s) for the research, if applicable; the purpose of the research, including a description of how the proposed research qualifies as bona fide research; and the methods to be used to conduct the research. Confirmation Letter or Notification of Permit Requirement No later than 30 days after receipt of a letter of intent, NMFS will issue a letter to the applicant either: Confirming that the General Authorization applies, notifying the applicant that all or part of the proposed research does not qualify for the General Authorization and that a scientific research permit is required, or notifying the applicant that the letter of intent was insufficient to determine whether the General Authorization applies and identifying the deficiencies to enable the applicant to revise and resubmit the letter. The Marine Mammal Commission (MMC) and Committee of Scientific Advisors were established under Title II of the MMPA to, among other things, review applications for permits for the taking or import of marine mammals and provide comment and recommendations to NMFS. Although the 1994 Amendments do not provide for the involvement of either the MMC or the Committee of Scientific Advisors in the General Authorization for Scientific Research, a copy of each letter of intent and NMFS' response will be forwarded to the MMC. This will allow the MMC to review all research activities involving marine mammals, including research conducted under the General Authorization.
