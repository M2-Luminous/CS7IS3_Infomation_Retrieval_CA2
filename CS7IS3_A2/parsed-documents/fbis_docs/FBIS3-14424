The IDF officers said it was the irresponsibility and lack of discipline shown by the SLA officers who, on their own initiative, shelled al-Nabatiyah and the outskirts of Sidon, which led to the firing of Katyusha rockets at the Galilee this week. Four Lebanese citizens were killed and 30 were wounded in the shelling, most of them schoolchildren from al-Nabatiyah. Our correspondent in the north Yo'av Aviv reports that last night, the terrorists sneaked out of the SLA outpost they had seized in the Jazzin enclave. The body of a missing SLA soldier was later found at the scene. South Lebanon was quiet last night.
