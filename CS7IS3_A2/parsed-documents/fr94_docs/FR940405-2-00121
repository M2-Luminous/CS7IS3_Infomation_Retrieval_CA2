FR940405-2-00121 FR940405-2-00043 98. Regulation: 24 CFR 990.109(b)(3)(iv). Project/Activity: A request was made by the Clarkson, NE Housing Authority to use its actual occupancy rate of 60% in determining its operating subsidy eligibility for its fiscal year ending (FYE) 3/31/93 and to use a projected occupancy rate of 60% for its FYE 3/31/94. Nature of Requirement: A public housing agency (PHA) that has completed a Comprehensive Occupancy Plan (COP) without achieving a 97% occupancy percentage or having an average of five or fewer vacant units must use a projected occupancy rate of 97%. Granted By: Joseph Shuldiner, Assistant Secretary. Date Granted: August 5, 1993. Reason Waived: The Clarkson Housing Authority is a small PHA of 30 units, primarily elderly. There has been a significant decline in the town's population according to census data, as well as loss of businesses and medical staff during the past two years. Because the documented lack of demand was basically beyond the control of the Authority, the PHA was allowed to use 60% for both the requested years. 99. Regulation: 24 CFR 990.109(b)(3)(iv). Project/Activity: A request was made by the Jetmore, KS Housing Authority to have a three-year Comprehensive Occupancy Plan (COP) approved for its fiscal year (FYs) 1993&hyph;1995. The Authority had completed a COP in its 1992 FY without achieving the goal of having five or fewer vacant units. Nature of Requirement: A public housing agency (PHA) that has completed a Comprehensive Occupancy Plan (COP) without achieving a 97% occupancy percentage or having an average of five or fewer vacant units must use a projected occupancy rate of 97%. Granted By: Joseph Shuldiner, Assistant Secretary. Date Granted: August 5, 1993. Reason Waived: The Jetmore Housing Authority is a small PHA of 20 units, primarily elderly. The Authority had undertaken several steps to increase demand for its units but met with only limited success. Because the documented lack of demand was basically beyond the control of the Authority, the PHA was allowed to use 75% for both its 1993 and 1994 FYs. The request for a new COP was not approved. 100. Regulation: 24 CFR 990.109(b)(3)(iv). Project/Activity: A request was made by the Red Cloud, NE Housing Authority to use its actual occupancy rate of 69% in determining its operating subsidy eligibility for its fiscal year ending (FYE) 6/30/93 and to use a projected occupancy rate of 69% for its FYE 3/31/94. Nature of Requirement: A public housing agency (PHA) that has completed a Comprehensive Occupancy Plan (COP) without achieving a 97% occupancy percentage or having an average of five or fewer vacant units must use a projected occupancy rate of 97%. Granted By: Joseph Shuldiner, Assistant Secretary. Date Granted: August 5, 1993. Reason Waived: The Red Cloud Housing Authority is a small PHA of 55 units, primarily elderly. In spite of outreach activities to inform the community about the availability of housing assistance and the granting of a waiver to admit income-eligible, non-elderly, the waiting list is non-existent. Because the documented lack of demand was basically beyond the control of the Authority, the PHA was allowed to use 69% for both the requested years. 101. Regulation: 24 CFR 990.109(b)(3)(iv). Project/Activity: A request was made by the Olney, TX Housing Authority to use its actual occupancy rate of 68% in determining its operating subsidy eligibility for its fiscal year ending 9/30/94. Nature of Requirement: A public housing agency (PHA) that has completed a Comprehensive Occupancy Plan (COP) without achieving a 97% occupancy percentage or having an average of five or fewer vacant units must use a projected occupancy rate of 97%. Granted By: Joseph Shuldiner, Assistant Secretary. Date Granted: August 5, 1993. Reason Waived: The Olney Housing Authority is a relatively small PHA of 190 units. It is located in a rural town with a declining population and poor economy. Extensive efforts to increase occupancy through modernization of the units and outreach activities during the past several years have not met with success. Because the documented lack of demand was basically beyond the control of the Authority, the PHA was allowed to use 68%.
