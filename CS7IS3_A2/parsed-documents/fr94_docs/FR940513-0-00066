FR940513-0-00066 FR940513-0-00018 Some commentators characterized the cash payment requirement as a significant limitation on the exception for preferred returns and guaranteed payments. The principal objection voiced on this point is that requiring a cash payment may prevent partners from achieving their economic deal. Since real estate partnerships often lack free cash in their early years, the money partners are forced to rely on the partnership having sufficient income in subsequent years to ultimately provide them with their preferred return. The IRS and Treasury Department are concerned that if the requirement were eliminated, partnerships might attempt to optimize their overall economics by allocating significant amounts of partnership income and gain to QOs in the form of preferred returns and guaranteed payments. It is believed that in many instances this would be a departure from the normal commercial practice followed by partnerships in which the money partners are generally subject to income tax. Taxable partners generally are not willing to bear the tax burden attributable to income allocations that precede the corresponding distribution of cash by many years. A suggestion that partnerships be required to compound allocated but unpaid amounts could exacerbate the problem. Compounding would increase the amount of undistributed income or gain allocated to the tax-exempt partners. The final regulations retain the cash payment requirement. However, the regulations also provide more explicitly that the normal rules of accrual accounting are overridden with respect to the deduction of reasonable guaranteed payments. The deduction is delayed until the partnership taxable year in which the payment is made in cash. (Similarly, the inclusion of the guaranteed payment in the QO's income is delayed because the regulation does not change the existing rule under ยง1.707&hyph;1(c) that a guaranteed payment is included in income in the same taxable year it is deducted by the partnership.) For partnerships that are concerned about the availability of sufficient future income to ensure the payment of a preferred return, this clarification may help them use guaranteed payments to achieve greater assurance that the partnership ultimately will pay a return on capital. D. Chargebacks and Offsets The final regulations continue to provide exceptions for four types of chargebacks and offsets: (1) Allocations that charge back prior disproportionately large allocations (i.e., in excess of a qualified organization's fractions rule percentage) of overall partnership loss to a qualified organization, or prior disproportionately small allocations of overall partnership income to a qualified organization; (2) minimum gain chargebacks of nonrecourse deductions; (3) chargebacks of partner nonrecourse deductions (and of compensating allocations of recourse deductions to another partner); and (4) qualified income offsets. The final regulations also continue to provide that allocations of minimum gain that may be made with respect to distributions of proceeds of nonrecourse liabilities are taken into account only to the extent an allocation is actually made (to avoid technical violations of the fractions rule that would otherwise arise from including a minimum gain chargeback provision in a partnership agreement). In addition, a limited new chargeback exception (described in greater detail below) applies to allocations of minimum gain attributable to certain distributions of proceeds of nonrecourse liabilities. A suggestion that all chargebacks be permitted without regard to whether the initial allocation was ``disproportionate'' was carefully considered and rejected. A principal consideration in rejecting the proposal was that it would represent a significant departure from the mechanical approach contained in the proposed regulations, which, overall, is relatively simple for taxpayers to apply and for the IRS to administer and enforce. Accordingly, the final regulations retain the basic approach of the proposed regulations, but add a number of technical and clarifying changes. In addition, two examples have been added to further clarify the operation of these provisions. The final regulations clarify that disproportionate allocations need not be reversed in full, but may also be reversed in part. In addition, the provision requiring that an initial allocation of less than the entire overall partnership income or loss consist of a pro rata portion of each item of partnership income, gain, loss, or deduction now excepts from the pro rata requirement nonrecourse deductions and certain other allocations relating to nonrecourse debt. Absent this change, the disproportionate chargeback provisions might have overly limited applicability, because real estate partnerships typically have borrowed on a nonrecourse basis.
