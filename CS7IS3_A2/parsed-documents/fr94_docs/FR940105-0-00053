FR940105-0-00053 FR940105-0-00010 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms 27 CFR Part 9 [T.D. ATF&hyph;352; RE: Notice No. 781] RIN 1512&hyph;AA07 Lake Wisconsin Viticultural Area (92F&hyph;017P) AGENCY: Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), Treasury. ACTION: Final rule, Treasury decision. SUMMARY: This final rule establishes a viticultural area in Columbia and Dane Counties, Wisconsin, to be known as Lake Wisconsin. The petition was submitted by Mr. Charles W. Dean, Viticultural Area Consultant, on behalf of Wollersheim Winery located near Prairie-du-Sac, Wisconsin. The establishment of viticultural areas and the subsequent use of viticultural area names as appellations of origin in wine labeling and advertising will help consumers better identify the wines they may purchase, and will help winemakers distinguish their products from wines made in other areas. EFFECTIVE DATE: February 4, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert White, Wine and Beer Branch, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, 650 Massachusetts Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20226, (202&hyph;927&hyph;8230). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On August 23, 1978, ATF published Treasury Decision ATF&hyph;53 (43 FR 37672, 54624) revising regulations in 27 CFR part 4. These regulations allow the establishment of definite American viticultural areas. The regulations also allow the name of an approved viticultural area to be used as an appellation of origin in the labeling and advertising of wine. On October 2, 1979, ATF published Treasury Decision ATF&hyph;60 (44 FR 56692) which added a new part 9 to 27 CFR, providing for the listing of American viticultural areas. Section 4.25a(e)(l), title 27, CFR, defines an American viticultural area as a delimited grape-growing region distinguishable by geographical features, the boundaries of which have been delineated in subpart C of part 9. Section 4.25a(e)(2) outlines the procedure for proposing an American viticultural area. Any interested person may petition ATF to establish a grape-growing region as a viticultural area. The petition should include: (a) Evidence that the name of the proposed viticultural area is locally and/or nationally known as referring to the area specified in the petition; (b) Historical or current evidence that the boundaries of the viticultural area are as specified in the petition; (c) Evidence relating to the geographical characteristics (climate, soil, elevation, physical features, etc.) which distinguish the viticultural features of the proposed area from surrounding areas; (d) A description of the specific boundaries of the viticultural area, based on features which can be found on United States Geological Survey (U.S.G.S.) maps of the largest applicable scale; and (e) A copy of the appropriate U.S.G.S. map(s) with the proposed boundaries prominently marked. Petition ATF received a petition from Mr. Charles W. Dean, Viticultural Area Consultant, on behalf of Robert P. Wollersheim and JoAnn I. Wollersheim, proprietors and landowners of Wollersheim Winery near Prairie-du-Sac, Wisconsin, to establish a viticultural area in south-central Wisconsin to be known as ``Lake Wisconsin.'' The viticultural area is bounded by the shoreline of Lake Wisconsin and the Wisconsin River on the north and west. Wollersheim Winery is the sole winery located in the 28,000 acre viticultural area and there are currently twenty-three acres planted to wine grapes.
