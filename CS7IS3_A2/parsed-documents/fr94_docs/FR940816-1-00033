FR940816-1-00033 FR940816-1-00007 As noted above, EPA will interpret PSD BACT and PM&hyph;10 BACM as generally similar because, despite the similarity in terminology, certain key differences exist between control measures applicable in the PSD and PM&hyph;10 serious nonattainment area programs. The BACT under the PSD program applies only in areas already meeting the NAAQS, while PM&hyph;10 BACM applies in areas which are seriously violating the NAAQS. This difference in policy goals, arguably, suggests that the PM&hyph;10 BACM control standard should be more stringent than that for PSD BACT. On the other hand, the burden of installing efficient controls during construction of a new source or source modification is generally less onerous than retrofitting an existing PM&hyph;10 source with similar controls. If one compares both programs in terms of these factors, the differing regulatory and economic burdens and the different policy purposes tend to offset each other. Nevertheless, EPA believes that the differences in policy goals_i.e., preventing further pollution under the PSD program and reducing existing pollution under the PM&hyph;10 nonattainment program_counsel against adopting the interpretation and implementation of PSD BACT in its entirety for PM&hyph;10 nonattainment purposes. Rather, EPA considers it reasonable to use the approach adopted in the PSD BACT program as defined in section 169(3) of the Act as an analogue for determining appropriate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment control measures in serious areas, while at the same time retaining the discretion to depart from that approach on a case-by-case basis as particular circumstances warrant. 2. Preventive Measures The EPA considers measures that prevent PM&hyph;10 emissions over the long term (e.g., requiring gas logs in new fireplaces) to be preferable to those measures that will only temporarily reduce emissions (e.g., curtailment of wood stove use during air pollution episodes or treatment of fugitive dust sources with water). This is because such preventive measures are inherently more effective and involve significantly fewer resources for surveillance, enforcement, and administration. Moreover, increasing emphasis on prevention over mitigation is more likely to be both economically and environmentally beneficial over the long term. 3. De Minimis Source Categories The BACM are required for all categories of sources in serious areas unless the State adequately demonstrates that a particular source category does not contribute significantly to nonattainment of the NAAQS. While EPA regards the BACM standard applicable in PM&hyph;10 serious areas as a more stringent control standard which calls for a greater degree of emissions control for the source categories to which it applies, EPA also believes that it has the authority to limit the applicability of BACM to those source categories which ``contribute significantly'' to violations of the NAAQS. The Act leaves unresolved the question of whether BACM is intended to be an all-inclusive requirement applicable to every PM&hyph;10 serious area source category. It should be noted that in section 189(b)(1)(B), which contains the requirement that serious area PM&hyph;10 SIP's provide for the implementation of BACM, Congress has not used the word ``all'' in conjunction with BACM. Congress has also not stated anywhere in the relevant law or legislative history that BACM must be applied to all serious area source categories. Even if the statute on its face were interpreted to require States to impose BACM on all source categories in serious PM&hyph;10 areas, the Agency believes, based on the decision in Alabama Power Co. v. Costle, 34 that it has the authority to exempt from regulation those source categories in the area which contribute only negligibly to ambient concentrations which exceed the NAAQS. The EPA believes the court's test for invoking the de minimis exemption authority would be satisfied in circumstances where a State demonstrates conclusively that, because of the small contribution of the source category's emissions to the nonattainment problem, the imposition of additional controls, such as BACM, on a particular source category in the area would not contribute significantly to the Act's purpose of achieving attainment of the NAAQS ``as expeditiously as practicable.'' The EPA will have to determine from the record that, with respect to particular serious area PM&hyph;10 source categories which contribute to emissions in excess of the NAAQS, requiring application of BACM would produce an insignificant regulatory benefit. 34 The inherent authority of administrative agencies to exempt de minimis situations from a statutory command has been upheld in contexts where an agency is invoking a de minimis exemption as ``a tool to be used in implementing the legislative design'' on the ground that ``the burdens of regulation yield a gain of trivial or no value'' ( Alabama Power Co. v. Costle, 636 F.2d 323, 360&hyph;61 (D.C. Cir. 1979)).
