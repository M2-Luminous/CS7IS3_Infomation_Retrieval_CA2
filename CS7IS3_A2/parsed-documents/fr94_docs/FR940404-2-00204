FR940404-2-00204 FR940404-2-00093 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On February 15, 1994, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) published regulations requiring drug and alcohol testing of over 7 million safety-sensitive employees in transportation industries. These regulations were mandated by Public Law 102&hyph;143, the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act. Rules were issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), Federal Transit Administration (FTA), and the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) requiring employers in the regulated aviation, commercial motor vehicle, railroad, transit, and pipeline industries to implement anti-drug and alcohol misuse prevention programs. The rules generally require implementation starting January 1, 1995, for large companies (with generally 50 or more safety-sensitive employees) and January 1, 1996, for small companies. The conferences' agendas will include: drug and alcohol testing procedures, reporting and recordkeeping requirements, compliance and enforcement issues, random testing rates, prohibited conduct and consequences, return-to-duty requirements, employee confidentiality, and education and training requirements. The first day of the conferences will focus on the requirements of the alcohol misuse prevention programs. The second day agenda will focus on anti-drug program requirements. Representatives from the FAA, FHWA, FRA, FTA, and RSPA will conduct specific sessions providing the requirements for the employers they regulate. Although RSPA is unable to conduct a modal-specific session at the Washington, DC conference, gas and liquid pipeline operators may wish to attend the general sessions. Issued in Washington, DC on March 24, 1994. Donna R. Smith, Acting Director, Drug Enforcement and Program Compliance.
