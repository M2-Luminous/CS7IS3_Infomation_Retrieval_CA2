Last week, the Russian state-run gas giant cut down deliveries to Moldova by one third and threatened to cut off gas supplies completely unless the Republic repaid its debt. According to Sangheli, Moldova has already paid off part of its gas debt. The point at issue now is 108 billion rubles owed by Moldovan gas consumers, mostly from the Dniester region which is suffering grave economic difficulties at the moment. The Moldovan prime minister reported that Kishinev and Tiraspol experts were presently considering possibilities of finding money to urgently repay the republic's debt. He expressed hope that the issue would be solved by joint efforts and supplies of Russian gas would be resumed in the full volume.
