Fujii described the dollar's fall in Tokyo below 100 yen as "speculative" and said, "rapid movements are undesirable and this is a consensus among G-7 nations." Fujii said G-7 partners are communicating on whether to take joint measures as they did last Friday, when the dollar fell below 100 yen in New York. As for Japan, Fujii said, "we will tenaciously take utmost efforts" to defend the dollar against the yen. Market sources said the bank of Japan bought billions of dollars when the Tokyo market opened Monday, after watching the dollar plunge below 100 yen in earlier trading in Sydney. Asked if Japan's political turmoil contributed to the yen's rise, Fujii just repeated the movements are "speculative." Fujii declined to comment on possible joint G-7 actions on credit policies, saying, "monetary measures are for the central bank to decide." When the dollar tumbled in may on a broad front and nearly sank below 100 yen, G-7 nations intervened in currency markets and also took action on credit policies. The United States raised its key rates, Germany cut its key rates, other European nations followed suit and Japan maintained a loose stance on the money market. Higher U.S. rates and lower rates in other nations will help the dollar become stronger as dollar assets will become favorable.
