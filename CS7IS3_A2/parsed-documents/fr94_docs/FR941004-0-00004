FR941004-0-00004 FR941004-0-00001 The total cost impact figures discussed above are based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. Regulatory Impact The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety. Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1.

Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: 94&hyph;20&hyph;10 McDonnell Douglas: Amendment 39&hyph;9039. Docket 93&hyph;NM&hyph;221&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;15, &hyph;30, and &hyph;40 series airplanes and KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes; as listed in McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;10 Service Bulletins 55&hyph;24 and 55&hyph;25, Revision 1, both dated August 3, 1994; certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent reduced structural integrity of the airplane, accomplish the following: (a) For Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10 and &hyph;15 series airplanes: Prior to the accumulation of 12,000 total landings, or within 90 days after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later, unless previously accomplished within the last 4,500 landings, perform either an initial an eddy current inspection or visual inspection to detect fatigue-related cracking of the forward spar upper caps on the horizontal stabilizer, in accordance with McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;10 Service Bulletin 55&hyph;24, Revision 1, dated August 3, 1994. Note 1: Eddy current inspections accomplished in accordance with McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;10 Service Bulletin 55&hyph;24, dated October 25, 1993, are considered acceptable for compliance with this paragraph. (1) If any crack is detected, prior to further flight, repair the crack in accordance with a method approved by the Manager, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate.
