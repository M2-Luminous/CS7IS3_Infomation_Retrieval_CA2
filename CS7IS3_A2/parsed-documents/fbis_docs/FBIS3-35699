KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA's correspondent talks to him. [Gamov] Valeriy Dmitriyevich, what is your frame of mind as you return to the judge's seat? [Zorkin] I would like to sum up my feelings in one word -- hope. Hope that everything will gradually settle in such a way that we can move forward along a lawful road, and not along the path of 3-4 October. [Gamov] Judge Viktor Luchin actively fought for your powers to be reinstated, and he even declared a hunger strike. While you made no effort at all in this direction. Why? [Zorkin] That by no means signifies that I am incapable of going on hunger strike. I swore an oath to be a judge, and in my opinion I carried out my duty honestly. It seems to me that society must find a means of defending a judge if he becomes the object of injustice. [Gamov] What kind of Zorkin is returning to the Constitutional Court? Is he the same man he was in September and October, or is he someone else? [Zorkin] If you are talking about the principles of compliance with constitutionality, then I am the very same Zorkin that I always was. Although, of course, I have changed in some ways. I, too, have learned certain lessons from everything that has happened... [Gamov] Do you intend to fight for a seat as chairman of the Constitutional Court and again fill the niche of peacemaker? [Zorkin] Everybody has to be a peacemaker, but not to the extent of offering the other cheek when people are prepared to slice off your head. In brief, the issue of the chairmanship does not worry me in the least.
