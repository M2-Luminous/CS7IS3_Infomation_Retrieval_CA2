When Poland becomes a member of NATO, its entire Army or a part of it may find itself under foreign command, Milewski said today during a meeting with journalists in Warsaw on Poland's defense policy. Milewski and other high-ranking representatives of the National Defense Ministry emphasized that Poland will not be able to defend itself in anything greater than a local conflict. According to them, there is no great threat of an outbreak of a global conflict or a great conventional war in Europe today.
