All the conditions will be met so that the legislative elections can take place on 23 January and 6 February. Contrary to the statement of certain opposition parties claiming that the revision of voters registers is not yet complete and that the distribution of voters cards could not begin, the minister of territorial administration and security wishes to make the following clarifications: The results of the revision of voters registers made by the administrative commissions, composed of representatives of all political parties legally constituted, were transmitted to the National Electoral Commission [CEN] on 31 December 1993. The electoral code stipulates that the National Electoral Commission will be responsible for the personification of voters cards while the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Security will be responsible for their distribution. To accelerate these last two phases of the preparations for the legislative elections -- the personification and the distribution -- the CEN and the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Security have adopted the procedure proposed by French and German experts permitting the simultaneous personification and distribution of the cards in the presence of voters. The structures set up in the electoral constituencies and polling stations will make it possible for all voters to withdraw their cards before 23 January. To this end, the minister of territorial administration and security requests the representatives of political parties, who are members of distribution commissions, to assist the chairmen of the local electoral committees and prefects. The government will do everything possible so that the legislative elections of 23 January will be regular, democratic, open, and fair. Signed by Georges Combevi Agbodjan.
