They said the teachers of the sole Moldovan school in the city are harassed and threatened to be fired if they do not comply with orders of Dniester authorities to use Cyrillic script. Pupils' parents decided to protest by not letting their children attend the school beginning with 7 February. Their initiative is supported by the parents of pupils attending the two Moldovan schools in Tiraspol and Tighina (Bender). With the emergency state decreed by Igor Smirnov, Moldovans have no right in Dniester to protest against the imposed Cyrillic script and the aggravated economic crisis, caused by the Tiraspol leaders' refusal to use Moldovan national currency. They also cannot protest against Smirnov's decree according to which all state employees are compelled to adopt until 15 February Dniestrian citizenship. In their opinion, measures to stop the libertinism of Dniester's leaders should be undertaken. President Snegur stated that for preserving Moldova's integrity only political methods will be used and this corresponds with CSCE Mission's recommendations. The president requested Richard Samuel, new head of the CSCE Mission to Moldova, to consider the complaints of Rabnita inhabitants. Richard Samuel talked to representatives of Rabnita soon after their meeting with Snegur, states the Presidential Press Service.
