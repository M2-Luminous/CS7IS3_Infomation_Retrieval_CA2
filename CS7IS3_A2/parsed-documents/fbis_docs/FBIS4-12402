While speaking about Arab unity, al-Ahmar is interrupted by the Iraqi poet, who recites a short poem hailing al-Asad and criticizing Iraqi President Saddam Husayn, stressing that Saddam should quit. Al-Ahmar continues to speak about Arab unity, the crisis it is facing, and the Ba'th ideology for attaining this unity. He elaborates on the Ba'th Party's struggle and thoughts and on the efforts made by President al-Asad to unleash the capabilities of the Party and Syria. He refers to political and economic pluralism in Syria and the development program in the country as well as national unity. He says Syria is working to realize Arab solidarity with the aim of restoring the occupied territories and rights, and stresses that the right to self-defense and to defend land and rights are guaranteed by all laws. Al-Ahmar emphasizes: "As in the past, al-Asad's Syria today will not be dissuaded from its pan-Arab role that defends the Arab rights by any pressures, false accusations, or unjust lists, on which the Zionist lobby insists." He says this lobby is trying to harm Syrian-U.S relations and to influence Syrian peace positions. He adds "this lobby, and its assistants, are annoyed because of Syria's adherence to its Arab rights and constants and the diplomatic successes it realized, which were clearly manifested in Syria's dealing with the peace process." On the peace process, al-Ahmar reiterates the Syrian call for a just and comprehensive peace, and refers to the Syrian efforts to render this process successful. He says: "Syria does not accept that this process be derailed from its specified track, and the formula agreed on in Madrid." He says Israel maneuvered to obstruct this process in a bid to impose capitulation on the Arabs. He is interrupted by a group of young men chanting patriotic Palestinian songs. He refers to the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and the church explosion in Lebanon, which he says were aimed to obstruct the peace process. He says "the Security Council Resolution 904 shows that the whole world began to complain about Israel's terrorist behavior." On the church explosion, he says that it exposed those who have links with Israel. He is interrupted by people chanting slogans hailing Syrian-Lebanese relations and by the Iraqi poet who recites a poem hailing al-Asad's position at the Geneva summit with President Bill Clinton. Al-Ahmar stresses that Syria will not relinquish any Arab right and insists on having just and full peace in the region. Speaking about international issues, al-Ahmar notes that the end of the Cold War has not brought world peace, and that conflicts and wars broke out in several places.
