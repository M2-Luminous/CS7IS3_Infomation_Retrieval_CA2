FBIS3-28412 "dreas025_d_94017" FBIS-EAS-94-025 Document Type:Daily Report 7 Feb 1994 South Korea Papers Examine Perry's Letter SK0502082994 SK0502082994 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Local vernacular dailies on 4 and 5 February carry reports, articles, and editorials on new Secretary of Defense William Perry's "pressuring" of ROK Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae last December to purchase the reportedly "defective" Airborne Self-Protection Jammer (ASPJ) for the Korean Fighter Project (KFP) for installation on F-16 fighters to be flown by the ROK Air Force. The moderate HANGUK ILBO on 4 February carries on page 1 a 500- word report by Washington-based correspondent Chong Il-hwa headlined "Letter Uncovered Confirming U.S. Defense Secretary Nominee (Then Deputy Defense Secretary) Pressuring the ROK To Buy Arms--HANGUK ILBO Obtains Letter Urging Minister Yi To Buy Faulty Radar Jammer, Requests Purchase Outside FMS Channels, Contrary to Common Sense, Raises Suspicion of Lobbying for U.S. Manufacturers." Featuring a photo copy of Secretary Perry's letter to Defense Minister Yi Pyong- tae dated 23 December 1993 recommending that the ROK purchase the ASPJ via commercial channels instead of through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) process, the report says, "It was confirmed on 3 February that William Perry, U.S. secretary of defense-nominee, sent an official letter to Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae to sell the ASPJ, the radar jammer for F-16 fighters, to the ROK on disadvantageous terms." Citing the letter's file number of 1-93/004246 and the gist of the contents of the letter, the report says, "The letter leads us to suspect that he in fact pressured for the procurement of the ASPJ deviating from the normal practice in arms deals. In particular, because this offer is made under the situation where the shortcomings of the ASPJ had been found in a trial flight, suspicion arises that Secretary-nominee Perry might have been asked to lobby for ITT and Westinghouse, the manufacturers of the ASPJ. Meanwhile a U.S. Defense Department official said, 'We understand that the ASPJ was found to be short of its expected functions in the U.S. Defense Department's test flight in 1992.'" The report cites an article by THE NEW YORK TIMES that said the letter would have been a problem at Perry's confirmation hearings. The moderate TONG-A ILBO on 5 February carries on page 3 an 800- word editorial entitled "Transparency, Fairness Required for Arms Procurement." The editorial notes ongoing "unsmooth" U.S.-DPRK nuclear negotiations which could lead to war on the Korean peninsula. The editorial then notes the report on the deployment of Patriot missiles to the ROK and the "rumor" on U.S. pressure to procure the ASPJ, adding, "It is natural that these have become hot political pending issues." The editorial then notes, "The issue of procurement of the ASPJ leads one to suspect that it involved U.S. pressure on us to buy it deviating from the normal practice of an arms deal." The editorial then goes on to say, "The lobbying by major powers in their endeavor to sell their arms should not become a high-handed one hurting friendly relations between the countries concerned. If the major powers regard our country as a country for dumping their arms waste, it should be regarded as a grave matter hurting the mutual friendly relations." The editorial then notes the ROK Ministry of National Defense (MND) clarification concerning the issue that the MND does not regard Secretary Perry's letter as intending to pressure the ROK to purchase the ASPJ and that "although the ASPJ in question falls short of the standard required of the test, it is not defective equipment and that it is better equipment than the equipment in current use." The editorial then concludes, "The important thing is our attitude. We must procure the arms we need at the most reasonable price." The moderate TONG-A ILBO on 5 February carries on page 4 a 600-word article by reporter Ha Chun-u entitled "Why the ROK and the United States Differ in Their Opinion--Focus on the Procurement Method of Radar Jammers--Commercial Contract With U.S. Firms Disadvantageous Pricewise." The article notes that attention is focused on the cause and background behind the method of procuring the ASPJ since the ROK and the United States are showing differences over the method of its purchase. The article then notes, "The U.S. operational test of the ASPJ in 1992 proved some of its functions to be short of the standard required of the test. The U.S. military authorities wanted to solve this problem but suspended the development project because of defense budget cuts." The article notes the disadvantage of purchasing the ASPJ through the commercial sales process over the purchase through the FMS process. The article then concludes, "The MND, therefore, is demanding that the United States employ the FMS process as originally agreed. It appears that the MND will watch the U.S. attitude until the United States makes an official specific proposal for a change in the procurement agreement." The moderate HANGUK ILBO on 5 February carries on page 3 a 1,200-word report by Washington-based correspondent Chong Chin-sok entitled "Defense Secretary's Nomination Ratified Without Mentioning His Pressure on Arms Purchase--U.S. Senate Keeps Silent in Consideration of National Interest, Arms Sale to ROK Creates 20,000 Jobs, the Press Which Criticized Inman Now Remains Dumb." The article notes U.S. Senate ratifying on 3 February U.S. defense secretary nominee as secretary of defense without making issue of his reported pressure on the ROK to buy ASPJ. The article notes, "The press, which was so critical of Inman for a minor thing now remained silent," despite his alleged recommendation that ROK buy faulty arms through commercial channels. The article says, "The senators must have had a good preconception of Perry because he is a person with a background of a military-defense industry complex, which leads the Arms Services Committee, whose relationship with defense industrialists is inevitable, to have a good opinion of him." The article notes, "If the ROK buys the ASPJ in question, the manufacturers of Westinghouse in Baltimore and ITT in New Jersey will have a sudden boom in business creating 20,000 jobs for the American people." The article then observes, "The possibility of ROK-U.S. friction because of the Perry letter seems remote in view of the sensitive nature of the episode." The editorial concludes, "Nevertheless, one has to give serious thought to the comment of those in the political circles who say, `This episode is reported at a time when the security situation on the Korean peninsula is delicate, leading us to worry that it could affect the security cooperation system between the ROK and the United States.'" The moderate HANGUK ILBO on 5 February carries on page 3 a 1,400-word article by reporters Chong Pyong-chin and Son Tae-kyu on the position of the MND, the Chongwadae presidential offices, and Foreign Ministry on Secretary Perry's letter. The article notes the MND position, notes MND's embarrassed position, MND's worries that the report on Perry's letter could adversely affect the ROK-U.S. military diplomacy and cause the damage to the reputation of the F-16 fighters. The article refers to a remark by An Pyong-kil, second assistant defense minister, who stated on 4 February, `It is not desirable that our relations with the United States are affected by this minor problem. New Secretary of Defense Perry could fall into a difficult position because of this report, and this situation is not desirable for us.' The article notes that this position of the MND comes from the MND judgment that Perry's letter is not a means of applying pressure but advice. The MND thinks that because of the friction between the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Administration, "the ROK's purchase of the ASPJ became difficult through the FMS process as originally agreed, Perry requested our side to buy it through commercial sales." Assistant Minister An noted that "ASPJ is only part of the electronic device of the airplane, and the MND is worried that the report on the shortcoming of some function of the device could arouse misunderstanding that there is a problem for the new generation fighter project as a whole." The article then notes the Chongwadae position, notes its embarrassed position, and refers to the comment of a Chongwadae official, who says: "We have periodically demanded that the United States ensure our purchase of the electronic jammer according to the contract. We did so having in mind the indemnity in case of a breach of contract. As for the letter sent by the then Deputy Defense Secretary Perry, the United States might have wanted to leave a ground of informing us of the possibility for the purchase of the ASPJ through commercial channels in case its fulfillment of the contract becomes difficult for failure to get the U.S. Government approval." As for the so-called pressure on the ROK to buy the ASPJ through commercial channels, the Chongwadae official said, "It is far from truth. The United States informed us of its will that it will understand it if we think we should purchase through the commercial channels the electronic jammer which failed to get the U.S. Government approval in its performance test. We have reconfirmed our position to the U.S. side that we hope intergovernmental procurement will be made according to the F-16 purchase plan. It is absolutely impossible for us to buy it through commercial channels." The article then notes the Foreign Ministry official's remarks, who says: "We have no knowledge of the Perry letter. If our government regards this letter as pressure on us, the Foreign Ministry can consider a corresponding diplomatic measure. In view of the fact that defense secretary was unanimously approved in the U.S. Senate in the ratification hearing, the United States does not seem to regard this letter as 'an illegal document intended to exert pressure,' the Foreign Ministry, therefore, holds a position that we should treat this issue prudently." The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN on 5 February carries on page 3 a 300-word report on the MND position on the Perry letter. It quotes An Pyong-kil, second assistant defense minister, as saying on 4 February: "We have reconfirmed our position that our position of purchasing the ASPJ through the FMS process, rather than the commercial sales channel as advised by the U.S. Government, and we will continue to maintain this position."
