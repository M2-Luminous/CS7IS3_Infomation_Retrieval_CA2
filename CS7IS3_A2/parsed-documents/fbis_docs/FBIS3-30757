He justified this by saying that Mr. Cernak had refused to give guarantees that he would coordinate the parliament's session on 16 February in a way that would ensure a joint action by all coalition members. Speaking at a news briefing, the prime minister went on to say that representatives of the opposition held talks on methods of turning the discussion on the big privatization bill into an immediate political solution and noted that they would express a lack of confidence in Parliament Chairman Ivan Gasparovic. This failed to happen only because the Party of the Democratic Left rejected it, Vladimir Meciar added. SNS Honorable Chairman Jozef Prokes confirmed the prime minister's statement that they proposed an open coalition [otvorena koalicia] to the Party of the Democratic Left [PDL]. He said the response of PDL representatives was slightly negative but not altogether dismissive.
