In his first-ever state of the nation message addressed to the parliament, Yeltsin urged Russian lawmakers to lay a "legal foundation for Russian entrepreneurship." Among most vital tasks for 1994, the president listed the creation of a modern settlement system, a deep reform of the central bank in order to create a federal reserve system. Yeltsin said he will himself control the reform of the central bank as it is of a key importance to economic reforms in the country. According to the president, 1994 should become a year of creating financial and industrial groups. He said it is necessary that they emerge on a voluntary basis and do not reanimate the old government ministries. The current year should also see major changes in state support to agriculture, Yeltsin said, urging to carry out a real reform in the agro-industrial complex rather than provide unlimited subsidies to it.
