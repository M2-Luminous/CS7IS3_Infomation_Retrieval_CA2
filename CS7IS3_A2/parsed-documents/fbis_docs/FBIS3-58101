Speaking at the Epiphany meeting of the Free Democrats in Stuttgart on Thursday [6 January], Rexrodt said that the Union is, like the SPD, "torn by internal divisions, blind in its populism, and incapable of taking unconventional decisions." Thus the CDU wants to "outdo the Social Democrats in the politics of redistribution of wealth." Rexrodt added that the Union has "become paralyzed, cautious, anxious, and preoccupied with its different wings." The FDP has the unique opportunity "to put itself at the head of the movement which is fighting for the renewal of our economic and social order." Prosperity for all cannot be guaranteed with the traditional recipes. What is needed is a return to classical liberal ideas of a state based on the rule of law, market economy, and social responsibility. [passage omitted]
