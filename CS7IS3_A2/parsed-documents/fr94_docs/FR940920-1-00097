FR940920-1-00097 FR940920-1-00008 j. MACT for Nitrogen Oxides for Small MWC Plants. Uncontrolled NO X emissions from MWC's are about 225 ppmv on average. The MACT floor is no control. The addition of SNCR postcombustion NO X control has not been demonstrated on any modular starved-air MWC's, and the performance of such a system on a modular starved-air MWC is in question. Since NO X control is not required by the MACT floor and SNCR has not been demonstrated on modular starved-air MWC's, postcombustion NO X control is not being proposed for small MWC's. The MACT guideline for NO X for MWC's at small MWC plants is based on no control. Section VIII of this preamble discusses ``no control'' emission limits for NO X . G. Selection of Format for the Proposed Guidelines The February 11, 1991 emission guidelines described a format for MWC acid gases (SO 2 and HCl), MWC metals (PM and opacity), MWC organics (dioxins/furans), and MWC operating practices (CO, load, and flue gas temperature), and that same format is being adopted by today's proposed guidelines, except for dioxins/furans. The selection of the format for the emission guidelines for the above pollutants is described in previous Federal Register notices (54 FR 52209, December 20, 1989 and 56 FR 5514, February 11, 1991). For dioxins/furans, the proposed guidelines establish dioxin/furan guideline emission levels on both a total mass dioxins/furans basis and a TEQ basis. The format for the proposed emission guidelines for NO X is the same as the format of the 1991 NSPS (56 FR 5488, February 11, 1991) and today's proposed subpart Eb NSPS. The selection of the format for the 1991 NO X standard is in previous Federal Register notices (54 FR 52251, December 20, 1989 and 56 FR 5488, February 11, 1991). The same format will apply under the emission guidelines for NO X proposed today for MWC's at large plants. The specific formats of the proposed emission guidelines for Cd, Pb, and Hg are discussed below. As required by section 129(a)(4) of the Act, the proposed emission guidelines would establish numerical emission limitations for Cd, Pb, and Hg. For the purpose of regulating Cd and Pb, the format selected in the proposed emission guidelines for the numerical emission limitations would be a numerical concentration limit (mg/dscm) corrected to 7 percent O 2 . For the purpose of regulating Hg, the format selected in the proposed emissions guidelines would be both a numerical concentration limit (mg/dscm) and an alternative percentage reduction requirement. The numerical Hg emission limit reflects the emission level that can be achieved based on activated carbon injection in combination with acid gas/PM control. An alternative percentage reduction requirement may be met instead of the numerical emission level because emissions of Hg can be highly variable and dependent on the Hg input level. Even at the same MWC, test data show occasional spikes of high Hg emissions due to variability in the waste feed. In cases where Hg levels are temporarily elevated, the 0.080 mg/dscm level may not be consistently achievable. However, the control devices could achieve an 85-percent reduction during such episodes. Therefore, a combination of a concentration level and an optional percentage reduction format best assures the maximum achievable Hg control while accommodating potential spikes in Hg emission levels. As discussed above, the proposed emission guidelines for SO 2 , HCl, and Hg include two formats: (1) A percent reduction format, and (2) an emission limit (concentration) format. The EPA requests comment on and test data supporting the appropriateness of promulgating final guidelines for SO 2 , HCl, and Hg which include only the emission limit format. For each pollutant, the commenter should specify an appropriate emission limit (without an associated alternative percent reduction format) and provide rationale for the limit. Based on the comments received, the EPA may promulgate final emission guidelines for SO 2 , HCl, and Hg in the form of emission limits that are higher or lower than the proposed emission limits. The EPA has proposed emission guidelines that reflect the performance levels achieved by MWC's equipped with properly designed, constructed, and operated air pollution control systems. The proposed emission guideline levels would apply during all periods of MWC operation. To comply with the proposed guideline levels, the air pollution control system would be designed and operated such that actual emissions are less than the proposed guideline levels. Where continuous monitoring systems are available, such as for SO 2 and NO X , the proposal would require their use to determine compliance on a continuous basis. For other pollutants, an annual stack test would be required. The EPA requests comment on whether continuous monitoring methods exist for any additional pollutants. The EPA also seeks comments on alternate formats of the guidelines that would encourage optimal control system operation and optimal performance, thus minimizing emissions. For example, the guidelines could provide incentives, such as reduced testing and reporting, for MWC's that operate well below the guideline emission levels. One approach would be to structure the guideline such that, for an MWC with three units, if all units demonstrated emissions at least 30 percent less than the limit, then only one of the units would be tested each year. The unit selected for testing would be rotated such that each unit would be tested once every three years.
