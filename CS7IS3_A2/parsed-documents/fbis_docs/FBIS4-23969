[Begin recording] [Larome] I also had the honor of holding talks with the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] president, Kanyarengwe. In Kigali, we met the government Army hierarchy. [passage omitted] [Mugunga] What did you discuss with the RPF president? [Larome] I think you should put that question to the president. [Mugunga] But you can also answer since you took part in the meeting. [Larome] The president of the RPF explained to us his concern and his position. I gave him a message from Alain Juppe, the minister of foreign affairs, and the humanitarian proposals of [words indistinct] minister of humanitarian action [words indistinct]. [Mugungua] Don't you think the declarations of Mr. Alain Juppe, for whom you work, his latest declarations over Radio France International will be interpreted by the RPF with whom you have just had discussions as a declaration of war? [Larome] No. It is not a declaration of war. I, myself informed the president that there was no question of such a thing. [Words indistinct] I know the intentions of the minister and I know (?that the) president of the French Republic expressed himself and that the media often wrongly translate what one wanted to say.
