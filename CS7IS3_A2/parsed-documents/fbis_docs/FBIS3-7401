As a result, signs are showing that ROK-U.S. trade disputes will grow. In particular, the United States is expected to try to extensively discuss the trade disputes between the two countries and step up its trade pressure on the ROK at the 16th ROK-U.S. working- level trade conference scheduled to be held in Washington on 4-5 March. A ROK Government official concerned said on 27 March: "The United States has complained about the ROK's 10-percent tariff on imported U.S. cars, saying it is too high. It has strongly asked the ROK to lower the tariff and remove such non-tariff barriers." He also said: "The United States is expected to warn the ROK that it could renew the Super 301 trade provision and take other retaliatory measures if the ROK did not accept its demand at the Washington working-level trade conference. This official went on to say: "The U.S. Carmakers Association will send a large delegation to the ROK in mid-April to ask the ROK to open its automobile market. Also, it has asked the U.S. Government to take retaliatory trade measures if the ROK does not open its car market any wider." At the 20th regular ROK-U.S. Trade Council meeting held on 23 March in Seoul, the United States asked the ROK to allow imports of corn flour and reprocessed plums and advertisements for dog food. It also asked the ROK to reclassify imported vitamins for pets and raised an objection to the ROK's inspection of the viscera of pigs. The United States also raised an objection to the ROK's practice of allowing heat-treated frozen U.S. sausages to be sold in ROK markets only within 30 days after they were produced. It asked the ROK to allow them to be sold up to 90 days after they were produced.
