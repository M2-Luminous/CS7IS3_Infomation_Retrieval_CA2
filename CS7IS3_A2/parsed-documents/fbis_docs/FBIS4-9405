Vavra; place and date not given: "EBRD Must Help in High Risk Regions"] [Text] The annual meeting of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) was to outline the role of the bank in the future. Most states are not satisfied with its operation so far. The Czech Republic was represented at the meeting by Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik, whom we asked for an interview. [Vavra] How did the Czech Republic and the other countries assess the operation of the EBRD? [Kocarnik] Of course, the assessment of the operation of the EBRD was marked by the election of Jacques de Larosiere as new president. All central bank governors and other representatives of individual countries expressed full support for him in his efforts to transform the bank and introduce a cutback program (salaries and expenditures freeze). We expect J. de Larosiere to give the EBRD a new face. Personally, I was very critical in assessing the operation of the bank, particularly in the sphere of small and medium-scale business. Last year, for instance, we agreed on certain measures in this sphere, which, unfortunately, have not been implemented. This theme remains topical. [Vavra] What basic goals have been set for the future? [Kocarnik] We were asked to table the main ideas regarding the future orientation of the bank. The main change should be that the EBRD will approach the solution of the problem of support for business much more intensively and in cooperation with the domestic banks. [Vavra] Have you made any demands on the EBRD? [Kocarnik] First, I expressed the wish that the EBRD participate much more in the actual industrial sphere than in banking. We do not need it to enter our banks. The EBRD was founded to take on a certain part of the risk in the transforming countries rather than to enter problem-free institutions. It also came up in the discussion that the EBRD selected approximately 25 of our medium or larger enterprises on which it intends to work. I believe that these enterprises are the optimum ones for the first entry of a bank, and they correspond to our ideas.
