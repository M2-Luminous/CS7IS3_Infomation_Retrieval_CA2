To this end, two strains of plague microbe--one vaccinal (Yersinia pestis EV1290) and one virulent (Yersinia pestis 1300)--are used in an experiment in which the strain sensitivity to antibacterial preparations is measured by a series of dilutions in LB agar. Systematic data processing is carried out by Boyarskiy's method at a confidence interval I[.sub]95[/] for p=0.05. The plague microbe cell sensitivity to such antibacterial preparations as ampicillin, cefaxime, gentamycin, streptomycin, rifampicin, doxycyclin, and polymyxin B, the effect of their subinhibitory concentrations at various temperatures on the catalase activity, and the effect of their subinhibitory concentrations on the virulence of Yersinia pestis 1300 are summarized. The study reveals that introduction of sub-inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin, cefotaxime, or gentamycin to the cultivation medium leads to a significant decrease in the catalase activity of the plague microbe and that virulent Yersinia pestis 1300 strain cells grown at a 37ï¿½C temperature in the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin or cefotaxime have a lower ability to cause the death of laboratory animals.
