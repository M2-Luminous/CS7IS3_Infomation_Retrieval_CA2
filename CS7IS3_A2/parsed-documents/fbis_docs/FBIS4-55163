During its term of office, Meciar's government was frequently criticized by the then opposition for being dilatory in applying the screening law and for using it expediently for political ends. As premier, Vladimir Meciar said on several occasions that there were 235 Slovaks occupying important posts who had received certificates showing them to be former agents or collaborators of the Communist secret police. In the 1992 election campaign, the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) promised to abolish the screening law, but it never took this step in parliament and in the end the government decided to deal take the issue to the Constitutional Court. Meciar's cabinet said the screening law was, to its full extent, at odds with the Slovak Constitution because it discriminated against certain categories of persons, did not respect the presumption of innocence and the need for cases to be judged by an independent court. At its session today in Kosice, east Slovakia, the Constitutional Court's board declined to deal with the proposal of the since fallen government, since it said the court had already made a decision on the matter once. The present prime minister, Jozef Moravcik, announced recently that after appointing the new government he had asked for its members to be screened. The results are to be made known in several weeks' time. The Slovak press is already saying that Minister of the Economy Peter Magvasi may be having problems with screening positive. Magvasi, however, insists that his conscience is clear and connects the whole "affair" with his disputes with government colleagues over privatization. Deputy Premier Roman Kovac told CTK today that the governing coalition was considering amending the screening law, but was waiting for the Constitutional Court's verdict before making a decision. "It has started to be asked how long the validity of the screening law should last, and some are of the opinion that this time should be shortened," Kovac said.
