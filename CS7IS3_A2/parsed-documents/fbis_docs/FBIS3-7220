In this package, the government expressly states such principles as the following: 1) to completely abolish or consider for review all regulations barring the import of foreign products; 2) to ease the system of standards, licensing, and labeling to levels comparable to those in other nations; and 3) to completely abolish dual inspection procedures whereby products which have been inspected prior to being shipped from a foreign country are reinspected after being imported into Japan. It is expected that based on these principles, the government will consider nearly 100 items for deregulation. In February, the government compiled "ways to promote administrative reforms in the future" (administrative reform outline), which includes a list of 161 items for deregulation. Regarding these items, the government expressly states in its draft deregulation package that a comprehensive draft bill on deregulation will be submitted during the current Diet session to implement deregulation promptly. Ever since the breakdown in the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks, the United States has stepped up its market-opening demands against Japan. Taking this into account, the government has spelled out measures to drastically ease regulations, standards, and licensing procedures for the import of foreign products. Concerning discrete Japanese regulations which virtually bar the import of foreign products, the government intends to consider plans to completely abolish them, or, if this is difficult, to at least ease them to the level in other Western nations. In addition to such principles, the government plans to prepare on 29 March a separate list of items for deregulation, including inspection procedures for electrical appliances and standards and licensing procedures for automobiles. Moreover, the Administrative Reform Headquarters working panel on import promotion, market liberalization, and distribution systems plans to start on 28 March to hold discussions on items for deregulation which are to be included in the second stage of the compilation of the government's external economic policy in late June. During these discussions, a study will be made of such matters as regulations on the sales of pharmaceutical products through mail and the labeling of qualitative indicators on textile products.
