FR941219-0-00042 FR941219-0-00014 Comment 4: One commenter thought the Roe Island salinity criteria would have significant impacts on carryover storage in the Sacramento River Basin since meeting those criteria would account for a large portion of carryover storage, and consequently, affect winter-run salmon temperature requirements. Service Response: The Service is addressing, in recovery planning efforts and in section 7 consultations, the concern that compliance with Roe Island criteria will cause reductions in carryover storage in upstream reservoirs. Recovery planning recommendations for winter-run chinook salmon will be included in the delta smelt recovery plan process through coordination of the respective recovery teams for these species. Section 7 consultations will address any competing needs for winter-run storage in Shasta Reservoir. Comment 5: One commenter thought that the State Water Project and the Central Valley Project reservoirs located upstream of the Delta lacked the capacity to release enough controlled outflow to regulate salinity at Roe Island on a continuous basis, when recreational safety, flooding, travel time and upstream riparian right constraints are taken into account. Service Response: The Service notes the isohaline need not be located at Roe Island on a continuous basis, since EPA's Roe Island standard is triggered only when uncontrolled runoff has placed the 2 ppt isohaline seaward of Roe Island. The SWP and CVP reservoirs have the capacity to release outflow to meet the Roe Island criteria once the criteria are triggered. Comment 6: One commenter believed sampling biases and temporal and spatial variability in the data can be factors that distort or confound the abundance indices used to support the EPA's water quality standards. Service Response: The Service addressed the concerns regarding data bias in the final rule to list the delta smelt as a threatened species (58 FR 12856), noting that the Service is obliged under the Act to use the best available scientific and commercial information in making a listing determination. The Service also must use the best available information in designating critical habitat, and must take into consideration the economic impact, and any other relevant impact, of specifying any particular area as critical habitat (section 4(b)(2)). Comment 7: One commenter thought the salinity standards as proposed by the EPA were not protective enough of the delta smelt, and recommended that_(1) additional days be added to the Roe Island standard in below normal to critically dry years to buffer against years when storm flows or reservoir releases place the 2 ppt isohaline at Roe Island for the first time late in the year, (2) a stipulation be added for an eleventh-hour invocation'' of the 2 ppt standard if it appears that the 2 ppt requirement will fail to be invoked at all, and (3) the Service include a Middle Ground standard in addition to the Roe Island standard, having the Middle Ground standard implemented independently of any type of trigger or stipulation. The commenter thought water quality criteria at Middle Ground were necessary not only to provide rearing habitat immediately west of Chipps Island (since habitat in that area is positively correlated with delta smelt abundance), but also would allow delta smelt to access the expansive shoals of Grizzly Bay through Honker Bay. Another commenter worried that simply reproducing historic habitat conditions would not be sufficient to recover the delta smelt. Service Response: The Service believes that EPA's water quality standards, as proposed, will afford protection and promote recovery of the delta smelt. Adding additional independent (i.e., no trigger) criteria at Middle Ground location (between Roe Island and Chipps Island) would defeat the purpose of the Roe Island standard by dampening any variability in the yearly pattern of outflow as discussed in the preceding response. Use of the term ``conservation'' in the definition of critical habitat indicates that its designation should identify areas that may be needed for a species' recovery and delisting. However, when critical habitat is designated at the time a species is listed, the Service frequently does not know exactly what may be needed for recovery. In this regard, critical habitat serves to preserve options for a species' eventual recovery. The Service will address the cause(s) and remedies for delta smelt decline in the recovery planning process and in future section 7 consultations as new information develops.
