FBIS4-6808 "dreas079_m_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-079 Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 Thailand Iran Agrees To Exchange Crude Oil for Rice Iran Agrees To Exchange Crude Oil for Rice BK2504041594 Bangkok THE NATION in English 25 Apr 94 p B2 BK2504041594 Bangkok THE NATION English BFN [Text] THAILAND and Iran have finally agreed in principle to exchange Thai rice with crude oil from Iran after the Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) suggested the government refine the low-quality crude oil at lower costs in a third country, instead of burdening the local refineries with the additional costs of refining the crude oil, which contains higher sulphur and metallic contents. The PTT suggested the government refine the problematic oil in Italy because if the local refineries are to refine the crude oil, it would have to spend additional funds for the installation of machinery designed to properly refine the crude oil from Iran, said Oranut Osathanan, director-general of the Foreign Trade Department. Iran has long been the customer of rice from Thailand, but Thailand has been reluctant to buy oil from Iran because the Iranian oil possesses an undesirably high sulphur and metallic content. Thai and Iranian governments agreed a few months ago to conduct a counter trade by exchanging Thai rice with the crude oil from Iran, but so far they have yet to exchange their goods because the local refinery, Petroleum Authority of Thailand, has asked for compensation to offset the additional cost associated with refining the crude oil from Iran. The two sides last week signed the MoU, said Commerce Ministry Uthai Phimchaichon, speaking upon his return trip from Iran. He said Thailand agreed in principle to export 300,000-400,000 tonnes of Thai rice to Iran in exchange for crude oil. The amount of crude oil under the deal has yet been disclosed. PTT will decide how much Iran crude oil Thailand should buy before submining the proposal to the cabinet for approval, Oranut said. "Iran is a regular customer, and if we want to maintain our rice market we should buy its crude oil," she added. Oranut Osathanan, director-general of the Foreign Trade Department, without elaborating on the compensation, said Iran has allowed Thailand to refine the crude oil at Singapore and Okinawa in Japan.
