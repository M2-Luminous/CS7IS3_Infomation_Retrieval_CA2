He concluded secret agreements with Russia on oil some time ago. It has now become apparent that he is supporting the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK]. He has appointed several PKK sympathizers to the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic Internal Affairs Ministry. They have facilitated the move of PKK members from Turkey to Armenia through Nakhichevan. Furthermore, Aliyev, who is one of Moscow's underlings, has used state funds to finance and distribute DENGE KURD, a newspaper that opposes Turkey. Geydar Aliyev, who is known for his support of initiatives against Turkey, is on Ankara's agenda [as published] because of his support for the PKK. Aliyev describes Turkey as a friendly and fraternal country whenever he finds himself in a difficult situation. However, he has tried to stab Turkey in the back at every opportunity. Meanwhile, another of his deceptive moves has been exposed. Aliyev has cooperated with Armenia in providing funds and logistical support to the PKK, which is trying to divide Turkey. He has appointed PKK sympathizers, who are known to be militants, to the Nakhichevan Internal Affairs Ministry. They have facilitated the move of PKK terrorists from Turkey to Armenia and Azerbaijan. Geydar Aliyev is known as an indispensable person for Russia. He has supported PKK's printed propaganda activities in Azerbaijan. Recall that not so long ago Aliyev placed all of Azerbaijan's press organs under his control and obstructed those opposed to his regime. Meanwhile, his administration has met all the needs of DENGE KURD, from ink to paper. That newspaper is printed in Cyrillic in Baku. Furthermore, he has allowed PKK members to open 20 shops in Baku. DENGE KURD is a newspaper opposed to Turkey. Aliyev has guaranteed its distribution through the help of his administration. While conveying friendly messages to Turkey, Aliyev has exposed his true face by supporting the treacherous elements. DENGE KURD is a PKK newspaper supported by Aliyev. It describes southeastern Anatolia as a part of Kurdistan. Furthermore, it describes Abdullah Ocalan, who is the leader of the PKK terrorists, as the "national leader of the Kurdish people." The following are several passages from the October 1993 edition of DENGE KURD, which is supported by Aliyev: "The Turkish State is a servant of imperialism. The liberation of the Turkish people depends on the strengthening of the PKK and the independence of the Kurdish people." "I organized the Kurdish people's struggle for independence not because I am a Kurd but because I am a socialist." (Quotation from Abdullah Ocalan) "Everyone is fighting in Kurdistan at the present time. Of course, the children are fighting as well...." "Turkey has not changed its chauvinist and Kemalist traditions. Meanwhile, the Kurdish people are changing to achieve progress in accordance with the training they receive from the PKK. That will guarantee our future...." Aliyev served as a KGB general and then as first deputy prime minister in the former Soviet Union. He has been known as one of Moscow's most favored employees for more than 25 years.
