The deportation of the Iraqi diplomats might not be carried out tomorrow [words indistinct]. [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]? [Buwayz] There is a problem and [words indistinct] by tomorrow. [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] will U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher tour the Middle East? [Buwayz] Yes. [Correspondent] When? [Buwayz] No dates have been given. I believe it will be next week. [Correspondent] Do you know whether he will come to Lebanon? [Buwayz] No. I don't know. [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]? [Buwayz] The issue is a legal one. [Words indistinct] it was a political decision that the government had to make. It did so. It decided to sever relations and to deport the diplomats who are here. As for the judiciary decision, since there is immunity in this particular case and in view of the overall circumstances of the case, it is up to the court to decide. The court, the judiciary, will be the one that will take the Vienna Convention and its own interpretations and apply them to this case. It will decide either that this case falls within the context of the Vienna Convention and, therefore, there is immunity or that the circumstances are beyond the Vienna Convention and that the Lebanese judiciary is not qualified to decide on the issue. The decision is up to the judiciary. [Correspondent] Which judiciary? [Buwayz] By judiciary I mean the court. [Correspondent] Minister, Iraq is asking for the Lebanese investigation committee, is it not.... [Buwayz, interrupting] The state's employees should stop speculating.
