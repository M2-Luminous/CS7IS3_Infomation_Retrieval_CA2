It is our obligation to serve the people. But these days, many of the rural tasks really bewilder and puzzle us. First, there is family planning. Family planning is the nation's fundamental policy, but to us, it is the most difficult task on earth. Second, we have to collect grain payment and taxes. In the past, it was the crown grain and state taxes which no one could refuse. Last year, grain prices were decontrolled and the villages' unified apportionment and procurement responsibilities with regard to grains were rescinded. But this year, our superiors have forced us to get money and grain from the peasants based on their past apportionment and procurement responsibilities; otherwise they would refuse to pay wages. In the past, agricultural tax could be offset by grain payment, but today, grain prices are higher than the agricultural tax--generally the difference is 5 yuan per dan. If the peasants pay all of their agricultural tax but do not deliver some grain for the remaining apportionment and procurement responsibilities, they must pay 5 yuan per dan to cover the price difference. Most of their money is handed over to the grain stations, and the peasants do not even get a piece of paper as receipt. We feel that we are the "bandits" and are in turn "robbed." Even though we do not want to be "bandits," the peasants have no choice but to look at us coldly with frowning brows. Third, we have to make the peasants buy insurance. Our wages were docked last December and we still have not been paid. This is because we have not completed the insurance tasks that were assigned to us. According to our assignment, each peasant must pay the insurance companies 10 yuan for insurance. In the remote and poor countryside, this is indeed a task we cannot accomplish. Fourth, our superiors come to check on us: When the leaders come, they eat, drink, and have a good time. Afterwards, they sometimes even want us to pay them wages. Fifth, the public security bureaus and local police stations send people to the homes of criminal elements to collect fines. Thousands and thousands have been collected, but there is not a single receipt. Faced with poverty and corruption, what should we do? What are the responsibilities of the county, district, and village cadres? How do we do our jobs? We would appreciate the public's comments.
