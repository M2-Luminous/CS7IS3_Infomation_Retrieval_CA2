New research conducted in East Sussex indicates that the level of knowledge displayed by young people in the country is generally comparable to those in provincial towns. The finding comes two months after Government statistics revealed that the biggest increases in drug offences are now taking place in rural areas. Researchers surveyed 26 secondary schools in urban parts of East Sussex and the rural district of North Wealden. They found that the majority of schoolchildren claimed never to have tried drugs. But three quarters of the teenagers said they knew someone who used cannabis, ecstasy or amphetamines. A third said they had been offered those drugs and of those, two thirds had tried either cannabis, amphetamines, solvents and hallucinogenic substances. Boys were more likely to be offered drugs and most often agreed to take them. Researchers assessed the level of drug use among East Sussex 14 and 15-year-olds as 20-23 per cent. The level for North Wealden was 17-23 per cent. They concluded the level of "drug involvement" for the East Sussex teenagers was lower than the same age group in the large inner cities. But they said they are "generally higher than those found in samples in comparable areas elsewhere in the country."
