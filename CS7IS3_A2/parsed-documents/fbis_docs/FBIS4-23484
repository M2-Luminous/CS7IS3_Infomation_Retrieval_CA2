What is the position? [Hanekom] No, it's not really true that I have been at loggerheads with our deputy minister. There is a clear provision in the constitution for compensation, and we would of course adhere to the constitutional provisions, but it requires a lot more thought. The constitutional provisions say that there will be just compensation, fair and equitable, in fact. What it means, and what it also says is that various factors will be taken into account -- the historical terms of acquisition. So what we are saying is that if in the event of farmers having obtained the land under favorable conditions, in fact conditions of less than market value, then we could certainly not justify a case of farmers profiteering out of forced removals, in other words getting market value in compensation when they paid less than market value originally. If that is the case.... [Robinson, interrupting] But at the same time they, having lived on the farm for a number of years they had made some improvements, and that certainly must also be taken into account. [Hanekom] Absolutely. I don't see any difference between myself and Mr. Meyer, unless he has made certain public statements which I'm not aware of. In my discussions with him, we recognized that where improvements have been made on the land full compensation would only be fair if people had erected fences and built dams, and put up structures. They would have to get paid at full market value for those improvements on the land. [Robinson] Let's just get down to basics now. As I understand it, the date stipulated in the constitution is the 19th of June 1913 -- no claims can be made further back than that, and as from now, whenever this new process starts, and that must be some time in August I believe, when this law comes into effect through Parliament, the new Parliament, then within three years the claims must be put to the new commission. So when is that new commission going to start operating? [Hanekom] Well, as soon as possible. We would see that as being one of our priority policy moves, if you like. We have to pass the necessary legislation in order to set up the land claims court. We would like to see absolutely minimum delay in getting the land claims court fully functional. The minimum delay probably means not before October this year. It's an act required to be passed by Parliament, and then a certain minimum time delay to set up the necessary structures which means the court on the one hand, and commissions based on all of the provinces on the other hand. [Robinson] And that can take until the end of this year to get that all practically implemented? [Hanekom] Realistically, it could well take until the end of the year. In the mean time, the present government appointed with its tasks, albeit of a very limited nature. [Robinson] But that has no real standing in law because all of those things must go through the to-be-appointed commission, and then going to the land claims court. [Hanekom] Correct. But in the meantime the commission on land allocations is a legitimate body. It has limited terms of reference, it has to deal with those cases in front of it as effectively as possible, and then as soon as possible we get the land claims court operational with the accompanying new commission. [Robinson] Obviously, the immediate thought is that most of those people who will go to the commission and to the land claims court will be black people, people who have been driven off their land. But at the same time white farmers have also been forced, so to speak, from their land because the state needed their land to consolidate it into homelands. Will they on the same basis equally be able to go to the land claims court? [Hanekom] Your first mistake, Freek, is that the state did not need their land to consolidate homelands. They should never have embarked on a homeland consolidation program in the first place. But never mind... [Robinson] That's not my mistake, of course. That policy was in place as you know. [Hanekom] If they wanted to implement such policies then in theory they needed that land, yes, correct. But be it as it may, white farmers were expropriated, and certain white farmers may indeed go to the land claims court to go back to the land from which they were also forcibly removed in a sense. Circumstances were different. They were different in a sense that white farmers were compensated at full market value, and of course had the opportunity to buy land of equal value elsewhere in the country. Black people were paid far less than market value, if they got any compensation at all, and had very little opportunities to resettle themselves elsewhere. [Robinson] How many claims have you received so far? All in all? [Hanekom] We haven't received any claims insofar as the claims are still going to the commission on land allocations. They received something in the order of 1,300 claims. Many of them would be claims that would not fall under the jurisdiction of the land claims court we are talking about. We have in our department approximately 90 rural claims which would certainly fall within the definitions of the land claims court, within the constitutional provisions of the land claims court. [Robinson] Now I would like to continue with this discussion, and later we will come to the practical side of how to help people who are on the land. But can we just try to clarify a few things? If you have so many claims, it's doubtful that you will be able to process all of those claims within three years. As I understand it, those complaints must be lodged within three years, but actually getting to the practical implementation of settling their claims will take a lot longer. [Hanekom] Yes, firstly we would like those historical claims not to drag on forever. It is an ugly part of our history, and a shameful part of our history which we want to deal with as quickly as possible, and as fairly as possible. So we are saying that we can't go on forever. People can't rediscover claims forever and forever, therefore, we say there should be a three-year period during which people can lodge their claims. Clearly there will be a delay. We are hoping that the whole process will be completed within a five-year period. [Robinson] And how much will it cost? [Hanekom] It is quite difficult to say because it is not like housing where you can say we are going to build x-number of houses over the next five years. Because we don't at this point know exactly how many claims will come forward, but we're looking at a possible cost of the entire land reform program of something in the order of two and a half billion per year, something of that nature, which would include the broader redistribution program as well as the restitution program. [Robinson] There's a perception that you will institute a special land tax to pay for it. [Hanekom] It certainly is a matter under consideration, not alone tax to pay for the restitution program, but a land tax as part of a land reform program. A land tax is not really intended for central government revenue at all. The cost of the restitution program has to be paid for out of government coffers in the same way that housing is paid for out of central government coffers, and education, and health services and so forth. So we don't see the land tax as a source of revenue to cover a land reform program, but it could have other desirable effects in the interests of land reform. [passage omitted] [Robinson] Let us just talk about the criteria of people who have to return to their land. Are there any criteria -- just the fact that they lived there before, or do you also look at whether they will be able to use that land productively? [Hanekom] Freek, may I just say something before I return to your question. It was indeed an inspiration for me to see just now what happened in Riemvasmaak. I was there personally. It was the most fantastic experience of my life, and I must say it in Afrikaans, because although I am mainly English speaking, I was there and we spoke Afrikaans to each other, and it was just fantastic. It was also the first real public event in my new responsibility in my office, and it has been such an inspiration. I must say it tells us what it's all about. It is about justice, about creating opportunities, and so on. Now to come back to your question. Yes, in the first place there are many people who have the right to return to their own land, and for that provision has been made in court, irrespective of how they want to use that land, or whatever their plans are. Of course, we very much want them to use that land well, and they must get the necessary support for that, but that is their own land, and they have the right to return to their land. There are of course many other cases where there is a need for land. There too state assistance is needed. But those are different cases, they will not go through the courts. [Robinson] But if these people end up on their land then that land should at least be used productively. To what extent will you help the people to do that? [Hanekom] In the first place, it is the responsibility of the state, because the people were forcibly removed from their land, and in many respects people lost their skills, and are not in an immediate position to make full use of the land which they have now got back, and we must take into account those factors. People, white farmers enjoyed a lot of support. We are not saying that we want to go through the same subsidy systems and get people indebted on the land, but we are saying that white farmers enjoyed a certain amount of support which got them going. And we are saying that these people who are going back to their land, they do have skills, they have energy, they would like to work their land, but they will be in a much better position to do so if they are given some support by the state. However we don't believe it's state responsibility alone, and that was the nice thing about your footage. Where we have situations where the farmers assist, where local or adjacent farmers assist the people returning to their land, that is really a win-win situation. That's the most desirable situation, because those farmers next door to the land, they know the conditions better than anyone else and they are right there to give support. So we really do like to see situations of full cooperation between those going back to their land and the farmers who are there. [Robinson] But I imagine there must be some kind of formal structure to give training to those people, apart from the training that they can get from farmers next door? And whose responsibility is that? Is it yours, or with the minister of agriculture, or the minister of provincial affairs, or who? [Hanekom] There is a whole package of support which would have to go along with the return to land. On the one hand it is agricultural training to help people to make better decisions -- in other words, good extension work which would be provided by the Department of Agriculture. But there is a whole planning process which goes into the return of land. People have to make decisions -- where are we going to build our houses, how are we going to get water? Water affairs would most certainly be involved, because we have to see it in the context of the whole Reconstruction and Development Program. It is one component of a much bigger program of rural development and the improvement of people's quality of lives. [Robinson] Who will coordinate that process? Mr. Jay Naidoo or you, will have a lot of work to do, that's for sure! [Hanekom] No, no, Mr. J. Naidoo would give us as much support as possible, and would certainly see himself as assisting when it comes to coordinated activities between the relevant departments. For example, housing, water affairs, and the parks board could be involved in certain cases.... [Robinson, interrupting] But the principle.... [Hanekom, continuing] The main responsibility would lie in my department. We are responsible for land reform and ensuring that people who go back to their land are given the necessary support that they can take full advantage of the new opportunities opening up for them. [Robinson] And just one last one -- the matter of communal farming. Is that something that you will leave up to the people to decide for themselves, or will you encourage them to be individual productive farmers? [Hanekom] In certain cases people would choose to be individual productive farmers, in other cases people will farm under the traditional system, and they do it well. They understand the system, and if that is what they choose, we would certainly not wish to impose anything else on people. [Robinson] Mr. Hanekom, thank you very much for your participation here tonight, and I'm sure we will hear more in the future on this very sensitive matter, but anyway we now have a few guidelines. Thank you very much. [Hanekom] Thank you very much, Freek.
