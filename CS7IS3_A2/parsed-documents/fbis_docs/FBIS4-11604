FBIS4-11604 "drlat083_l_94013" FBIS-LAT-94-083 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 Bolivia DEA Agents Caught in Road Blockade Freed DEA Agents Caught in Road Blockade Freed PY2904141494 La Paz Radio Fides Network in Spanish 1100 GMT 29 Apr 94 PY2904141494 La Paz Radio Fides Network Spanish BFN [Interview with Cochabamba tropical region peasant leader Evo Morales by Jaime Murillo in El Chapare -- live] [Text] [Murillo] We are talking with peasant leader Evo Morales. Can you tell us what is going on in Villa Tunari? We heard that many people are worried because traffic to Santa Cruz has been interrupted. [Morales] Yes, since 0200 yesterday all national roads have been blocked. It is true that traffic to many places, that is to Santa Cruz or San Pedro de Cochabamba, has been interrupted. Within this framework, I heard that the [word indistinct] passengers are holding Villa Tunari mayor, who belongs to the MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement] hostage in demand for a solution to this problem, that is, they are helping him find a solution. [as heard] Evidently other people, including women and children, are worried about this. We are seeking a solution to the problem of people who must urgently travel to Santa Cruz and Cochabamba. [Murillo] We have heard that some pregnant women are not receiving medical attention in the Villa Tunari health units. [Morales] This is totally false. We are the ones who are making the medical attention possible. Fortunately, the doctor of Villa Tunari is my friend. He attended me after I was attacked by Umopar [Mobile Police Unit for Rural Areas] agents in 1989. He is a great friend of mine and therefore he is giving medical attention in the most direct and practical manner in the area. [Murillo] Will traffic be opened for people who have an emergency? [Morales] We are authorizing transshipments to Santa Cruz and Cochabamba, but nothing more can be done. Yesterday it was still possible to travel because the Cochabamba-Villa Tunari road was not blocked. Blockades began last night. [words indistinct] There are some drivers who want to continue with their personal business rather than to protect the lives of women and children and they are trying to discredit and force the lifting of road blockades. [Murillo] What is the situation now in tropical Cochabamba region? We understand there are 20 injured individuals as consequence of a clash that took place yesterday. [Morales] I have heard nothing from Bulu Bulu and Ivirganzama. However, there was a clash in Sinaota at about 1700 or 1800 yesterday when the Sole Federation of United Centrals and the Sinaota people began blocking the roads. Two U.S. DEA vehicles were stopped. They were carrying DEA members, that is, gringos. They asked for reinforcements to recover their freedom. Umopar agents came to help them and the DEA agents were freed. The road blockade was later reinstated in Sinaota. I have no information about injured people. In Villa Tunari, the Federation of Tropical Region Peasants is totally optimistic regarding the road blockades. They are proud and have stamina to continue imposing the road blockade. We will meet at 0800 to plan and organize many more actions. We will establish shifts to guarantee the road blockade. [end recording]
