In principle, the agreement will give the two nations equal standpoints to jointly cope with problems related to the global environment. In this sense, its approach is quite different from existing environment aid programs, which are one-sidedly given from Japan to China. The agreement was proposed by China two to three years ago; however, some ministries have been opposing the proposal, noting "such an agreement may be used as an excuse for spending larger official development assistance (ODA) funds for China." The Japan-China agreement will become the first case in which Japan offers an equal position to a developing nation for cooperation in environmental protection. This is expected to contribute a lot to settling environmental problems affecting the two nations, such as acid rain from China. The agreement's final draft consists of a preamble and nine articles. The preamble notes: "To protect the global environment, the two nations will work together on their common problems and further promote international efforts." Article 2 lists nine problem fields the two nations should jointly cope with, and "acid rain and air pollution" is on top of the list. China has been insisting that acid rain caused by its air pollution is "nothing more than a domestic problem since its influence on Japan is not proven." However, the agreement is going to clearly note for the first time that China's acid rain is a problem not only for China but also for Japan. Since Japan already has given environment aid to China under ODA programs, the treatment of existing aid programs has long been the biggest obstacle to the new cooperation agreement with China. The Foreign Ministry has been negative toward the agreement, saying "the agreement may be used as an excuse to concentrate allotment of ODA funds to China." The Ministry of International Trade and Industry also said the agreement may adversely affect its "Green Aid Plan," an energy aid program under way in China. Inter-ministry talks were held on this point, and ministries finally agreed with the government plan on the condition that "the agreement should not influence existing aid projects."
