Senator Evans says there is no shortage of available troops, and the decision has been taken out of respect for Australians with ties to the former Republic of Yugoslavia. In a television interview, he said that once a country provided troops it was hard to appear impartial. Sen. Evans said the Bosnian conflict had a strong emotional impact on important sections of the Australian community--including Croats, Serbs, and Bosnian Muslims. He said they were represented in Australia in large numbers and, in such a situation--if troops were committed--it would be hard to avoid being seen to take sides.
