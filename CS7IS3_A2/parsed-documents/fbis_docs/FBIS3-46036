The news reports said Fedorov, also deputy prime minister in charge of financial affairs, had rejected the post of finance minister in the new government which did not carry with it a deputy prime minister's role. Fedorov made the decision after Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and his first deputy Oleg Soskovets refused to meet his demands to sack chief banker Viktor Gerashchenko and Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha. According to the radio, Chernomyrdin asked Fedorov to remain in the cabinet, but the latter refused after his demands had been rejected. In a related development, First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar resigned on Sunday. Gaydar, Yeltsin's architect of the country's market-oriented economic reform, is the leader of the "Russia's Choice" bloc. Well-informed sources told reporters earlier today that Chernomyrdin would discuss the list of the new government with President Boris Yeltsin this afternoon.
