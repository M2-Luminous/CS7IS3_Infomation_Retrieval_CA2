Energy, Telecommunications and Post Minister S. Samy Vellu said Monday that as an emerging economy, the Malaysian telecommunication industry offers huge potential of investments, especially for highly sophisticated and imported equipment. Malaysia's national telecommunication carrier, Telekom Malaysia Berhad [Limited], he said, would invest RM670 million for its local network and RM160 million for its international network. It would also fork out RM500 million for switching equipment, RM550 million for transmission and RM1.7 billion for rural telecommunications he added. [passage omitted] The minister said private telecommunication companies like the ART 900 operator would invest RM800 million to provide high quality services while Time Telecom is expected to spend RM2 billion to build its Telecommunications network. Malaysia currently has two major local manufacturers of telecommunication equipment, he said. In view of strong growth in demand for telecommunication services, we are encouraging joint-venture projects with multinational manufacturers to produce or assemble telecommunication equipment locally. Malaysia is strategically placed to play this role, he said. On the telecommunication networks and services in Malaysia, Samy Vellu said that for the period 1991 to 1995, the government had targetted more than 100 per cent increase in the number of telephone subscribers to about 3.4 million. In the subsequent five-year period (1995-2000), we hope to push our basic telephone to 7.8 million (subscribers), an increase by more than 4.4 million over the Sixth Malaysia Plan period, he added. Samy Vellu also offered the use of Malaysia's first satellite, Measet I, to other Asia-Pacific countries on a mutually beneficial commercial basis once it is launched into orbit in 1995. He said Measat would provide economic and commercial benefits to users for both fixed and mobile telecommunication services such as telephone, telex, facsimile, data, video conferencing and television broadcasting.
