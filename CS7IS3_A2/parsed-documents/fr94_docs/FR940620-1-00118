ACTION: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: The Department is proposing to amend its rules implementing the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by adopting as its standards revised accessibility guidelines issued by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board). The Access Board has published these revised accessibility guidelines as interim final rules elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register . The proposed rule would also make a conforming change to the Department's rule implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended. The rules would expand the Department's accessibility standards to cover public rights-of-way and other subjects added by the Access Board to its guidelines. DATES: Comments are requested by August 19, 1994. Late-filed comments will be considered to the extent practicable. ADDRESSES: Comments on this proposed rule should be sent, preferably in triplicate, to Docket Clerk, Docket No., 49602 Department of Transportation, 400 7th Street SW., Room 4107, Washington, DC, 20590. Comments will be available for inspection at this address from 9:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. Commenters who wish the receipt of their comments to be acknowledged should include a stamped, self-addressed postcard with their comments. The Docket Clerk will date-stamp the postcard and mail it back to the commenter. Comments on the Access Board interim final rule establishing revised Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities, which underlies this rule and which is published elsewhere in today's Federal Register , should be sent to: Office of the General Counsel, Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board, 1331 F Street, NW., Suite 1000, Washington, DC, 20004&hyph;1111. For further information on comments, see the beginning of SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION . FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert C. Ashby, Deputy Assistant General Counsel for Regulation and Enforcement, Department of Transportation, 400 7th Street, SW., Room 10424, Washington, DC, 20590. (202) 366&hyph;9306 (voice); (202) 755&hyph;7687 (TDD). Copies will be made available in alternative formats on request. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: All timely comments received by the Access Board on its guidelines published December 21, 1992 (57 FR 60612), and on its interim final rule published today, will be deemed by the Department to have been submitted in response to this proposed rule and will be considered fully as the Department works toward a final rule based on this proposal. Therefore, it is not necessary for any comments submitted to the Board on its proposed or interim rules to be resubmitted to the Department. Elsewhere in today's Federal Register , the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (ATBCB) is publishing amendments to its accessibility guidelines for buildings and facilities, relating to state and local government facilities. The Department's September 6, 1991, final Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) rule (49 CFR Part 37) adopted the original version of these guidelines, known as the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG), as its accessibility standards for facilities subject to Part 37. The standards are codified as Appendix A to 49 CFR Part 37. This proposed rule would adopt the amended Access Board guidelines as a new Appendix A to Part 37, replacing the Department's current Appendix A. The Access Board received public comments on its proposed guidelines, published on December 21, 1992, and will receive comments again on today's interim final rule. As a member of the Access Board, the Department will be actively involved in the review and analysis of comments the Access Board receives and in making any revisions on the guidelines in response to those comments. Therefore, the Department has proposed to adopt the amended guidelines as its accessibility standards. Comments submitted to the Access Board will be considered by the Department as comments on this proposed rule, and need not be separately submitted to the Department. Consistent with the Department of Justice's existing rule implementing Title II of the ADA, for state and local government facilities, the Department's rule implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (49 CFR Part 27) gives recipients the choice, in some circumstances, of complying either with the ADAAG or with the older Uniform Federal Accessibility Standard (UFAS). In its ADA proposal being published today, DOJ is proposing to eliminate the option to use UFAS. Title II entities would have to use ADAAG in all cases. To remain consistent with Access Board and Department of Justice actions, the Department is also proposing to eliminate the UFAS option. To this end, the Department proposes to revise its 504 rule to require design, construction, or alteration of all facilities subject to Part 27 to conform to the revised AADAG. As a technical amendment, the Department is also proposing to update a reference in Part 27 to Department of Justice ADA regulations.
