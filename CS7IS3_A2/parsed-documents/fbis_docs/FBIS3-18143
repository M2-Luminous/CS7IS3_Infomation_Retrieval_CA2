Attilio Romita reports: [Romita] Occhetto gave no formula for a postelection government. On the other hand, he put forward the idea of a national democratic government of reconstruction. This is one of the PDS's three goals. Beating the right is the first and main goal. The right, according to Occhetto, is becoming aggressive again. There is a risk that the worst fascist culture may reemerge. The first goal comes in the form of an appeal made by Occhetto to the progressives: to fight for security, stability, and national solidarity. This is why the PDS leader warned everyone against the climate of fighting, division, and hatred which may become prevalent among Italians. These were the main things Occhetto said at the opening of the election campaign. He could not speak loudly: he had very little voice left after his trip to London.
