No doubt, they are right in their denunciation. But if these sincere ones have denounced the position of the Arabs who are colluding with imperialism and Zionism, we are astonished about the position that has been taken by others in imposing a different kind of blockade on us. Do not be amazed, for here are the details. We are members of the al-Khalis Youth Committee of the Ambassador League for International Pen Pals, which belongs to the General Federation of Iraqi Youths, Diyala branch. Our league has succeeded in making a name for itself, pen pals from different countries. It has also contributed toward breaking through the cultural blockade that has been imposed on us, since we have received many letters of solidarity with Iraq, the Iraqis, and their beloved leader Saddam Husayn, may God preserve and protect him. The letters expressed sentiments of support for the just Iraqi stand, thanks to our efforts in explaining our position and answering our friends' many questions, which revealed the extent of the false Western propaganda to which they have been exposed. Unfortunately, however, most of the valuable parcels coming from our friends do not reach us, although they have been sent by registered mail. At first, we thought that only our league faced this problem, then we discovered to our great amazement that many other pen pals face the same problem in the country. So, I personally checked with the central post office in Baghdad on 12 April. We asked them about the parcels. Their answer was: Make sure about registered mail numbers. Yet, most of our friends' letters carried registered mail numbers and they also are surprised that the parcels did not arrive!! The answer was vague. Is it right for these parcels to get lost so easily, and who is responsible for this?
