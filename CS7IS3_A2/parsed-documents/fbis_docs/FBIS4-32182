The law on bilingual names for towns and villages inhabited by ethnic minorities will be discussed for the third time this year. The bill, which pertains mostly to the 560,000-strong ethnic Hungarians, has been twice rejected. "The law will make it possible for the towns and villages with at least 20 percent of ethnic population to have their place names also in the ethnic language, while a list of the eligible communities will be a part of the law," Carnogursky reported. The list will not include 13 cities bearing the names of Slovak cultural personalities (during the previous voting, this was the reason for some ethnic Hungarian deputies to vote against the law). This time the Hungarian leaders did not insist on them and promised to support the bill. The law will also bar the names from the era of Magyarization and Horthyite occupation (1938-1945), Carnogursky added. According to the deputy chairman of the coalition Democratic Left Party (SDL), Milan Ftacnik, the law assumes that change be made on the strength of a local referendum for which a 80-percent turnout will be necessary. The present (Slovak) place names will be still exclusively used in official contact, while that in ethnic language will be applied only for traffic signposts, he explained.
