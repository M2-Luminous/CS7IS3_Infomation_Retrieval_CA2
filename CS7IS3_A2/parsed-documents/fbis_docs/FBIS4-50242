Liu made the call during his inspection tour of defence industrial enterprises in Sichuan Province. China's defence industry began to shift to civil production more than ten years ago upon the call by Deng Xiaoping. Taking advantage of its advanced technology and equipment, the defence industry has become a force to reckon with in the process of establishing a market economy. Liu Huaqing urged defence industrial enterprises to seize the current opportune moment and take further steps to readjust their structure, lower costs, renew their products and make themselves highly responsive to market demand. He also urged these enterprises to improve the living and working conditions of the workers, who have made major contributions to the country under very harsh conditions. Liu also visited Chinese people's liberation army and armed police stationed in Sichuan, urging them to improve the quality of officers and men and actively support local economic development.
