Makarov, commander of Separate Berlin Order of Bogdan Khmelnitskiy Motorized Rifle Guards' Brigade of Russian Armed Forces, by Aleksandr Polotskiy of RIA NOVOSTI under the "Out-of-Turn Parade" rubric; place and date not given: "Russia, Dismiss! With Belongings! May 1945: They Came. June 1994: They Left"] [Text] Today, 25 June, the farewell parade of the Separate Berlin Order of Bogdan Khmelnitskiy Motorized Rifle Guards' Brigade of the Russian Armed Forces will take place in the capital of Germany. Our correspondent met with Major General Yuriy Petrovich Makarov, its commander. [Polotskiy] The allies left with music, riding on combat hardware. But we? [Makarov] Ten T-80 tanks are ready for the parade, but the German authorities are very afraid for "the asphalt and the road markings," which they might damage, and also for the streetcar lines, of which there are rather a lot in this part of East Berlin. Some six weeks ago, however, when a brigade of the French armed forces took its leave of the city folk in the environs of its Berlin garrison, the French drove not even 10 but a whole 30 of their tanks into the streets -- the world was not turned upside down. Berliners gave the French military a very benevolent welcome. [Polotskiy] Is the motherland ready to receive you? [Makarov] We will send all our combat hardware and armament to Russia before 5 July, and all the families will leave before 1 August. Only servicemen who will participate in the final ceremonial send-off of the Russian troops from Germany, scheduled for 31 August in the presence of President B. Yeltsin and Chancellor H. Kohl, will remain in Berlin. We will set out in two trains for the motherland, for Russia, 1 and 2 September. A ceremonial welcome for the Berlin Brigade is already scheduled for 3 September in Moscow and for 4 September in Kursk. I will state frankly that we have been very lucky with our new stationing location -- housing for officers is already ready for us there, and there is a barracks for soldiers. We are taking with us another two prefabricated-panel barracks, which will house the medical unit and the staff, and we are reckoning on settling in entirely normally in the new place by fall or the beginning of winter. A Turkish firm is constructing a military camp there with 1,326 apartments, schools, clubs, and an artificial reservoir with funds taken from the sum of 7.8 billion marks allocated by the FRG Government. [Polotskiy] In conclusion: Yuriy Petrovich, which of the Russian servicemen, nonetheless, will be the last to leave Berlin? [Makarov] We are people who respect both ourselves and others. Therefore, in order to leave the garrison in Karlshorst clean and in full order, we propose to entrust this work to a special recultivation group from our brigade. It will consist of up to one company. This group will have through 5 September to "tidy the apartment" being left to its owners.
