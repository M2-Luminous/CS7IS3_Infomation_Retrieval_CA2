FR941205-0-00002 FR941205-0-00001 OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 5 CFR Part 890 RIN 3206&hyph;AG40 Federal Employees Health Benefits Program; HMO Plan Applications AGENCY: Office of Personnel Management. ACTION: Interim regulations with request for comments. SUMMARY: The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing interim regulations to clarify the policy under which it invites applications from comprehensive medical plans (HMO's) after a determination that it would be beneficial to enrollees and the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program to do so. This clarification is necessary in order to ensure that OPM and the HMO's are providing the best possible service to FEHB enrollees. DATES: Interim regulations are effective January 4, 1995. comments must be received on or before February 3, 1995. ADDRESSES: Written comments may be sent to Lucretia F. Myers, Assistant Director for Insurance Programs, Retirement and Insurance Group, Office of Personnel Management, P.O. Box 57, Washington, DC 20044; delivered to OPM, room 4351, 1900 E Street, NW., Washington, DC; or FAXed to (202) 606&hyph;0633. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mary Ann Mercer, (202) 606&hyph;0191. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: OPM is issuing interim regulations to clarify the policy under which the Director of OPM invites applications from HMOs interested in participating in the FEHB Program. As administrator of the FEHB Program, it is necessary that OPM consider the needs of FEHB enrollees and the FEHB Program in determining whether to invite applications from HMOs for a given contract year. Consequently, each year, the Director makes a determination whether or not it would be beneficial to enrollees and the FEHB Program to invite HMOs to apply. This authority parallels OPM's discretion to consider changes in the rates and benefits of participating plans when the Director of OPM deems it in the best interest of enrollees and the FEHB Program (ยง890.203(b)). With only limited possible exception, OPM does not intend to accept HMO applications for the 1996 contract year. We also plan to keep in place for the 1996 contract year the benefits that go into effect in 1995 for plans already participating in the FEHB Program. Further, OPM will print no new plan brochures for existing plans or comparison guide for contract year 1996. On a limited basis, OPM will entertain applications from HMOs where it would improve the access to medical care in a medically underserved state. That is, we will consider applications from HMOs only in states designated as medically underserved areas (MUAs), as determined by OPM under the methodology cited in 5 U.S.C. 8902(m)(2)(A), where the choice of an HMO is limited or would otherwise be nonexistent. To be considered by OPM, the plan must be in a state that qualifies as an MUA on January 31 of the year preceding the FEHB Program contract year for which the application has been submitted. OPM expects that, under this exception, plans will be accepted only under rare and unusual circumstances. Except in these situations, the information disseminated during the November&hyph;December 1995 Open Season will be limited to rate change information for plans currently participating in the Program. In the future, OPM will publish a notice in the Federal Register inviting applications from plans interested in participating in the FEHB Program. We anticipate considering all applications for contract year 1997.
