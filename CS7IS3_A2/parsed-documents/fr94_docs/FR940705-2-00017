FR940705-2-00017 FR940705-2-00010 11.3␣Interpretation of FIPS M. The National Institute of Standards and Technology provides for the resolution of questions (see FIPS PUB 29&hyph;3, Interpretation Procedures for FIPS Software, 29 October 1992) regarding the specifications and requirements, and issues official interpretations as needed. All questions about the interpretation of this standard should be addressed to: Director, Computer Systems Laboratory, Attn: FIPS M Interpretation, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, Voice: 301&hyph;975&hyph;2490, Fax: 301&hyph;948&hyph;6213, E-mail: dashiell@ecf.ncsl.nist.gov. 11.4␣Validation of M Processors. Implementations of FIPS M shall be validated in accordance with the NIST Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL) validation procedures for FIPS M. Recommended procurement terminology for validation of FIPS M is contained in the U.S. General Service Administration (GSA) publication Federal ADP & Telecommunications Standards Index , Chapter 4 Part 2. This GSA publication provides terminology for three validation options: Delayed Validation, Prior Validation Testing, and Prior Validation. The agency shall select the appropriate validation option and shall specify whether a Validation Summary Report or Certificate of Validation is required. The agency shall specify appropriate time frames for validation and correction of nonconformities. The agency is advised to refer to the NIST publication Validated Product List for information about the validation status of M products. This information may be used to specify validation time frames that are not unduly restrictive of competition. The agency shall specify the criteria used to determine whether a Validation Summary Report (VSR) or Certificate is applicable to the hardware/software environment of the M implementation offered. The criteria for applicability of a VSR or Certificate should be appropriate to the size and timing of the procurement. A large procurement may require that the offered version/release of the M implementation shall be validated in a specified hardware/software environment and that the validation shall be conducted with specified hardware/software features or parameter settings; e.g. the same parameter settings to be used in a performance benchmark. An agency with a single/license procurement may review the Validated Products List to determine the applicability of existing VSRs or Certificates to the agency's hardware/software environment. M implementations shall be evaluated using a NIST approved test suite. For further information contact: Director, Computer Systems Laboratory, Attn: FIPS M Validation, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, Voice: 301&hyph;975&hyph;2490, Fax: 301&hyph;948&hyph;6213, E-mail: dashiell@ecf.ncsl.nist.gov. 12. Waivers. Under certain exceptional circumstances, the heads of Federal departments and agencies may approve waivers to Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS). The head of such agency may redelegate such authority only to a senior official designated pursuant to section 3506(b) of title 44, U.S. Code. Waivers shall be granted only when: a. Compliance with a standard would adversely affect the accomplishment of the mission of an operator of a Federal computer system, or b. Cause a major adverse financial impact on the operator which is not offset by Government wide savings. Agency heads may act upon a written waiver request containing the information detailed above. Agency heads may also act without a written waiver request when they determine that conditions for meeting the standard cannot be met. Agency heads may approve waivers only by a written decision which explains the basis on which the agency head made the required finding(s). A copy of each such decision, with procurement sensitive or classified portions clearly identified, shall be sent to: National Institute of Standards and Technology; Attn: FIPS Waiver Decisions, Technology Building, Room B&hyph;154; Gaithersburg, MD 20899. In addition, notice of each waiver granted and each delegation of authority to approve waivers shall be sent promptly to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and shall be published promptly in the Federal Register . When the determination on a waiver applies to the procurement of equipment and/or services, a notice of the waiver determination must be published in the Commerce Business Daily as a part of the notice of solicitation for offers of an acquisition or, if the waiver determination is made after that notice is published, by amendment to such notice.
