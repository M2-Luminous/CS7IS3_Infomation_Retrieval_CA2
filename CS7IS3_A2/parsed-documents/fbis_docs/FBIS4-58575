It undermines the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and the resolutions of the national councils, even the UN resolutions that we do not believe achieve all the Palestinian people's demands. This accord has also given up on these resolutions. Needless to say, the economic accord recently signed in Paris which places not only Palestine, but also the entire Arab region and the Middle East [sentence incomplete as heard] and opens the door to the Arab and Middle East region. This issue also concerns you, I mean Iran. Why? Because this accord opens the door to the entire Middle Eastern region.
