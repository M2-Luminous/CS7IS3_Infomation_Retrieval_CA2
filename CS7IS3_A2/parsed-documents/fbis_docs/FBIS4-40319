At the beginning of the meeting, Colonel General P. Kazlowski said the election campaign has entered its final stage. Candidates for Belarusian president meet with working teams and servicemen and present their election platforms and views on the current political processes in the country on radio and television. They also criticize economic reforms carried out by our government in a bid to attract as many voters as possible. To win the trust of the general public, they often resort to various tricks. Sometimes, not only are they untactful toward each other, but they also cast shadow on entire public groups, including the Armed Forces and their leadership. Facts, arguments, and proof mean nothing to them. What matters to them is smearing everything with black paint and adding as much slander and even lies as possible. These are the kinds of weapons they fight with. The reason for this may be that teams of some candidates include people of dubious reputation. Unfortunately, their instructions are indiscriminately used in public appearances. The Defense Ministry, Colonel General P. Kalzowski said, closely watches the election debates and will certainly react to attacks targeted at it. The objective of all commanders, staff officers, and educational structures is to help the personnel listen to televised addresses by the presidential candidates, carefully study them, and select the best one. It stands to reason that the future president will have to care for Belarus, its Armed Forces, and the people's well-being. Therefore, he should have a broad life experience, an extensive professional background, and have good organizational and personal skills. He should be a man who instead of wasting his breath, will wisely and consistently conduct socioeconomic transformations and protect the security of his country. Lieutenant General N. Churkin, General Staff chief and first defense minister, presented a report at the meeting. He stressed that the Armed Forces is a state institution. The Army properly performs its constitutional duties, reliably protecting boundaries of its Homeland. Complying with the law, all servicemen will participate in the presidential elections. And they do care who will occupy the highest post in the state. This is why one needs to meet people constantly to explain to them the presidents' programs, and to help them properly understand the current situation so that the servicemen make the right choice. Reports were also made by A. Tushinskiy, first deputy defense minister; Lieutenant General A. Zuyev, deputy defense minister for logistics; Major General A. Sikora, deputy defense minister for military construction and housing; Major General V. Lepeshinski, chief of the Engineering Troops Administration; Colonel V. Chekov, chief of the Relations and Information Administration; and other officials who expressed their attitude toward populist and groundless statements by some presidential candidates about the Armed Forces, and presented their proposals for involving servicemen, the full-fledged Belarusian citizens, in election campaign events. The Defense Ministry Collegium adopted a declaration. It also examined other important issues.
