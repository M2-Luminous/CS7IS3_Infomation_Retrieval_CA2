In a press statement Aliyev stressed the importance of the meeting and noted in particular the friendly character of relations between the two neighboring states. Of late, he said, many steps have been taken to successfully develop and strengthen these relations. Nevertheless, a broadening of cooperation in Aliyev's view requires closer contacts, including closer military contacts. The interests of strengthening the security of both Azerbaijan and Russia require this. He took the opportunity to ask Pavel Grachev to convey the most cordial greetings to Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the Russian people on their Independence Day and wished them happiness, prosperity, and success on the path of building a democratic society. Grachev also advocated the organization of multi-faceted cooperation between the two countries and raising it to a higher level. In this matter, he stated, Azerbaijan will always meet with full understanding on Russia's part. The Russian minister said that his trip to Azerbaijan was a familiarization and working visit. He expressed confidence that the discussion of the planned issues would be successful.
