For three days Cuban officials extended VIP treatment to Collor and his entourage despite the vehement denials of the Cuban Government. Collor tried to see Fidel Castro but failed. The Cuban president chose to avoid him after receiving a number of telegrams of protest from the Workers Party and other Brazilian leftwing parties. The former president stayed at a modest guest house located a few meters from the posh mansion which Al Capone, the gangster, used in the thirties. Francisco Marchante, a bodyguard whom the Cuban Government had reportedly assigned to the former Brazilian president, accompanied Collor wherever he went in Cuba. This episode undermined Fidel's credibility; the nickname Red Pinocchio suits him just fine.
