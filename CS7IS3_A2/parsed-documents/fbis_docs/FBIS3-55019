Slezevicius, the country's sixth head of government since it won independence in 1990, says Lithuania is well past the worst stage of economic recession, raising the hope for an increased flow of foreign investment in 1994. He said talks were under way for as many as five credit lines with the World Bank alone. The prime minister forecast that next year's inflation will be lower than an increase in incomes and pensions because of appropriate groundwork being laid down in the past six months which he called "a very difficult period indeed." Slezevicius said when the government arrived in office nine months ago, it inherited a combined debt of USD 71 Mln [$71 million] for imports of gas and nuclear fuel. The problem has now been resolved, he said. The monthly 25 percent rate of inflation has now been kept down to less than that for one quarter of the year, he said. The prime minister said the opposition does not appear to be happy about the signs of stabilization. Slezevicius spoke of farmers threatening a general strike since August and a series of sporadic rallies and pickets which he described as politically-motivated actions aimed at unsettling the situation. And he added that the Conservatives did not conceal their wanting to overthrow the government. However, the social basis for strikes is diminishing, Slezevicius said. The prime minister warned against attempts to try to rock the boat, saying the government would go ahead with its policy of liberalizing the economy, steadying the currency, and resolving social issues.
