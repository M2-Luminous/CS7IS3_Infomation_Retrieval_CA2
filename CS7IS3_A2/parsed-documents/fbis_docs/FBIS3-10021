Patiently, he ended up talking about his work and his trip, his last as foreign minister, eight months ago. This kind of disinterested attention is one of the secrets of Fernando Henrique's success in making even enemies like him, despite monthly inflation rates of 40 percent. He maintains his charm and credibility despite the current economic situation and partial defeat of his stabilization plan at the hands of Congress. "I do not know the reason for this charisma, I only know I have the deepest admiration for him and really envy him for it," admits Deputy and former Minister Roberto Campos (PPR-RJ) [Progressive Renewal Party, Rio de Janeiro State]. "This success of his is a mystery. With inflation rates like these, I would have been tarred and feathered." The enigmatic success of Fernando Henrique, 62--a senator, the son of a military officer, and grandfather of three--generates envy, especially within the administration. It is believed in some offices along the Esplanade, for example, that his secret has to do with being in the good graces of the media. "Fernando is incredible," President Itamar Franco never tires of repeating when people ask him why the finance minister holds onto his job. "I do not know whether I would be as lucky with the press," he commented, recently. Itamar uses very few words to justify his faith in his government's fourth finance minister. "Our friendship is fraternal. I believe in his work, and his plans make sense, logical sense." Fascination Still, the president is also impressed by Fernando Henrique's personality; he finds him an intelligent academic. It is stimulating to deal with him, notes a diplomat who worked with Fernando Henrique for seven months at Itamaraty. Perhaps this explains the fascination that even his closest aides feel for him. "The minister has an electrifying personality, and anyone who talks with him is almost bound to be charmed." A man of many interests--he adores politics, science and technology, theater, music, the visual arts, and buying meringues at the corner bakery--Fernando Henrique is genuine, according to those who work with him. This could be yet another explanation for why he is still unscathed despite the economic crisis. "The finance minister has worked alone. He is his own man, whether in the Executive or the Legislative Branch," argues former Minister Mailson da Nobrega, who once held the same portfolio and is now a successful businessman in Sao Paulo. Mailson took over the economy during the Sarney administration when inflation was running at about 15 percent a month. By the time he got out, the rate had risen to the incredible level of 84 percent. Even so, he was not scorned. Which also goes to show that the Fernando Henrique phenomenon has occurred before. Secret "Today I can walk the streets in peace, and people even mention me with a certain affection," Mailson reports. He tries to explain that charm is not enough to bewitch the voters in times of high inflation rates. "Credibility is the secret," he said. "In Fernando Henrique's case, this is explained by his background, his resume, integrity, and work ethic." Mailson and a former minister in the Itamar administration who once occupied FHC's chair but prefers to remain anonymous would almost go so far as to say that Fernando Henrique is irreplaceable at the helm of the economy. "He is the tent pole that you had better not kick," remarked Mailson. "He is not that good, but the possibility of replacing him could lead to the uncertainty of hyperinflation," the other former minister commented. Antonio Britto, a former colleague in the Cabinet, is another who spares no praise for the finance chief and his plans, even though he [Britto] did not show up for last Thursday's vote on the provisional measures. "He tells the country the truth. And since the country is tired of magicians and lies, now it believes he really knows that the right road is the one he wants us to take." Whatever the secret of Fernando Henrique's success, and even with high inflation rates, the number of letters addressed to the Ministry of Finance grows with every passing day. Most are from women, who are particularly concerned about his backaches.
