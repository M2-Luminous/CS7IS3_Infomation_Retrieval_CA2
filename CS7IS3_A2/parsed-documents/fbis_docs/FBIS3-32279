According to (Andres Rosenthal), Mexican deputy secretary of foreign relations, yesterday's meeting, held by a subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives, which was summoned by Robert Torricelli, is anti-Mexican and seeks to interfere with the domestic affairs of his country. (Rosenthal) said that according to the Mexican people, it is unacceptable for the U.S. to try to judge or tarnish the reputation of his country because of some people's resentment that Mexico enjoys normal diplomatic relations with the Cuban Government. Furthermore, (Rosenthal) added, Torricelli is one of those who is offended at having lost the battle against the free trade agreement, which was recently established among Mexico, the United States, and Canada.
