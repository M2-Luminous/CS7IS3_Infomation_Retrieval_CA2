Our correspondent met Talgatbek Abaidildin, a member of the Central Election Commission, and asked him to clarify this information. This is what he said: [Begin Abaidildin recording] In our republic there were 10,224 polling stations. Foreign observers visited about 30 of them, mainly in the city of Almaty, the town of Kapchagay [Almaty Oblast]. In my opinion, it is at least unethical on the part of observers to draw conclusions that the election in the republic of Kazakhstan was not democratic. When we spoke to the journalists, their group did not have unanimous opinions. For instance, I can show written references from other observers that testify to the opposite. They say that the election in Kazakhstan was democratic. Yes, we did have some facts of negligence, even transgression at some polling stations. Currently the Central Election Commission is taking measures. If the [election] code has been violated, we might hold results obtained at these stations as invalid. Our foreign observers, on the whole, expressed their gratitude to the president of the republic and to the Foreign Ministry, as well as to the Central Election Commission for this invitation and for the official possibility given to them. We are not hiding anything from them. This attitude disarmed them. When coming here, they thought that Kazakhstan's sovereignty is very new, this is the first ever election code and there might be many discrepancies. I might be mistaken but they certainly had some prejudices. But they saw for themselves that we are open, we speak openly at all levels, literally. This has disarmed them. Yesterday evening we talked to the head of the CSCE group and he said that they would pass on to us some of their wishes, but in general they are satisfied with their visits to the polling stations and the procedural side of the election. But [word indistinct] it turned out to be different. I do not think there were any serious transgressions or any remarks about serious mistakes made. But in any case we will work on these remarks in order to avoid such mistakes in future. [end recording]
