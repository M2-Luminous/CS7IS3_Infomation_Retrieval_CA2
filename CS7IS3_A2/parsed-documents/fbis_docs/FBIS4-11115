Cavallo's idea is to buttress regional economies so they will be able to compete with good-quality products both domestically and on the international market. The package of measures will be announced by President Carlos Menem on 1 May during the opening of a new session of Congress. According to what official spokesmen reported after the cabinet meeting, the trade balance deficit also was discussed at the meeting. In order to reduce it, Cavallo reportedly confirmed the decision to promote import restrictions and an export drive. In light of the fact that agroindustries and agricultural production primary will play a central role in boosting trade, new measures to aid regional economies will reportedly be implemented and others already under way will be enhanced. The economy minister reportedly explained to the president and his colleagues that one should bear in mind that of the $13,040 [figure as received] exported last year, more than $8,200 [figure as received] -- approximately 60 percent -- corresponded to primary commodities and manufactured products from the agriculture and livestock sector. The plan for industry, which is fundamentally geared to providing aid to small- and medium-scale enterprises (PyMEs), will include financial aid through soft loans granted by the BICE [Bank of Investment and Foreign Trade] and the Argentine National Bank, a program for the development of suppliers -- the so-called productive areas, and the support program for the reorganization of the PyMEs.
