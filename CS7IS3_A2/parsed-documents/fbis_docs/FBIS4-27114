The United States is trying to break up and stifle socialist countries in Asia with its "peaceful transition" strategy as well as its policy of "strength" and put other non-socialist countries under its control by applying the American view of value, but it is met by a storm of objections in these countries, the paper notes, and goes on: The United States has got nothing from its anti-socialist moves. The Korean people have firmly defended socialism, their life and soul, pushing aside the U.S. strategy of "peaceful transition". The U.S. strategy of "peaceful transition" to isolate and stifle Asian socialist countries and revive capitalism has become impotent. It has also failed in its maneuvers against Asian countiries which aspire after independence. In recent years the spirit of independence has grown in Asian countries and there are such positive movements as promoting bilateral and multilateral cooperation in various fields and taking joint steps in external relations. This is a reflection of the aspiration of people to develop independently free from the domination and intervention of the imperialists. Developing countries in Asia are rejecting the West's "standard of human rights", saying "it cannot be a model." They are also rejecting the "democracy" of American style, saying "it is not suitable for them." The Asian people are maintaining their mental and cultural traditions, turning down "freedom" and "democracy" of American style. All facts show that whatever means and ways the United States may apply, it can never stamp out socialist countries and developing countries in Asia.
