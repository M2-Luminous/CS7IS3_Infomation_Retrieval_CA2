What can one expect from Rosati? [Balcerowicz] I know Dariusz Rosati. He is an ambitious and capable man, with quite a good economic education, by Polish standards. The fact that he admits to having changed his mind puts him in a good light because not many people have the courage to do that. I think his change of heart was caused by the fact that Poland has experienced the biggest economic success out of all of the postsocialist countries, some of which were in a similar situation to ours and others in an even better one. Rosati is certainly intellectually qualified to lead the Polish economy in the right direction. Much depends on whether he will want to maintain Poland on the rapid development path, or whether he will do anything just to maintain his post. The political circumstances accompanying his mission are another issue. I think the experience with his predecessor, Marek Borowski [fired by Pawlak for exceeding his authority], strengthens his chances rather than weakens them. [WPROST] What is the chief danger to the economic reforms? Is it the striking Solidarity's attitude of making demands, or is it the Polish Peasant Party's [PSL] bid to win comfortable jobs for its members? [Balcerowicz] The danger is whether Poland can continue its fast economic development. This depends on political stability, a strong convertible zloty, and far-reaching institutional changes, especially an acceleration of privatization. Solidarity's postulates clash with all of the rules of accelerated economic development. This is not the first time this has happened. In 1993, the union upset the political situation and overthrew the Suchocka government without realizing the consequences of this action. However, in today's Solidarity, which has not much in common with the Solidarity of the past, I detect a clear group of union activists who are little more than politicians in a trade union disguise. They once tried to enter the Sejm as trade unionists, not as members of a party. Therefore, their current protests are an extraparliamentary attempt to remain on the political scene. But I hope their activity will bear little fruit. As far as the PSL is concerned, this is a unified party, but not as far as its program is concerned. There are major differences within the PSL concerning the program. How else can one explain the fact that the PSL's most vociferous members, who prided themselves on supporting private farming under the People's Republic, are now reluctant about privatization? For the sake of Poland, one hopes that the PSL becomes unified in every single respect and that it joins the right side. [WPROST] If you were in the opposition, would you vote for the budget? [Balcerowicz] Being a political "outsider" [previous word in English], I have the luxury of not having to bother with such thoughts. But I can tell you I would be happier if the budget deficit were smaller. [WPROST] Speaking on behalf of the Democratic Union, Hanna Suchocka has accused the government of "lacking a long-term economic concept," a description she also applied to the present budget. But can a budget that is so heavily burdened with expenditures on social security and the servicing of public debts have any room for an "economic concept"? [Balcerowicz] One should remember that Poland and the other countries of this region emerged from socialism with a very high proportion of budget incomes and expenditures out of the national income. In capitalist countries with a similar level of development as Poland's, this proportion is not so high, although it has been gradually rising since the 1930's, resulting in the spread of social-democratic trends in economic policy. On the other hand, the Asian tigers have a very low proportion of budget incomes and expenditures out of their national income, as a result of which these tigers are becoming richer; the rich capitalism of the West cannot bear this burden, and, under the influence of the economic crisis, the social democratic model undergoes revisions. The conclusion for us, who still have a long way to go before we attain developed capitalism, is that the implementation of a social-democratic type of policy, aimed not at increasing the distribution of global incomes and expenditures but at maintaining them at their present levels, would be a harmful anachronism. By pursuing that path, we would quickly waste the chance of rapid development. [WPROST] But Professor Stanislaw Gomulka has accused you, as former finance minister, of having social democratic leanings, illustrated by your preference to spend budget funds on the social services. [Balcerowicz] I have no deliberate inclinations like that. I merely failed to stop certain moves in pensions policy in time, as a result of which budget spending exploded, the budget deficit increased, and investment outlay was reduced, all in 1991. This also had unfavorable political consequences because, when one increases spending and then decreases it, one ends up with a politically undesirable "give and take" image. We failed to push through the adjustments we undertook in 1991 because of the election campaign. It is paradoxical that, despite the fact that pensions in Poland have risen faster than in any other country in Europe, the opposition of 1991 succeeded in convincing society that the pensioners were the most economically threatened sector of society. [WPROST] Do you agree that today's Cabinet is footing the bill incurred by the previous governments, which permitted a huge budget deficit to arise and failed to reform the social security system? [Balcerowicz] Definitely not. After all, in the previous Sejm, the political grouping from which the present government stems tried to block changes to the pensions system and demanded even further spending. This grouping tried to compel the government to print an extra 20 trillion zlotys in 1993 to finance this extra spending. President Walesa put a stop to it just in time, after he had received a warning letter from a group of economists to which I belonged. So this group has no right whatsoever to complain. [WPROST] You once appeared on television in a program on agricultural policy, and you mentioned social justice. I must admit it sounded rather funny coming from you. [Balcerowicz] That just shows how strong the stereotypes about me are. Indeed, I do not use the term "social justice," which is abused so often for political purposes. But that does not mean I do not appreciate the problem of social justice. In that program, I said that the EEC's agrarian policy, which most of our peasant parties wish to emulate, is wasteful and socially unjust because it involves raising the prices of agricultural produce above market levels by means of state intervention. To do this, first of all so-called intervention prices, called minimum prices in Poland, are introduced, and. later on, mechanisms are introduced that make it impossible to reduce these prices. The purpose behind all of this is to block imports, with the aim of equalizing payments. As a result, the prices of food rise, resulting in a fall in the demand for food, especially on the part of the poorest sectors of society. At the same time, the increase in prices causes an increase in production costs and the emergence of food surpluses. To get rid of these surpluses, one must subsidize exports, in this way wasting money that could be better spent on other things, such as filling the culture gaps in rural areas. This system is socially unjust because, first, the high prices affect the poorest consumers, and, second, the advantages fall mainly to rich farmers because a farmer with, say, 50 hectares gets 10 times more than a farmer with just 5 hectares. Therefore, the increase in prices has to be divided by the size of production. For these very reasons, the West is trying to abandon the policy of antimarket agricultural protectionism and is warning us against getting involved in it. [WPROST] According to the press, you might run for the chairmanship of the new party that is due to be formed as a result of the merger between the Democratic Union and the Liberal-Democratic Congress. How far can your political ambitions go if you claim to be a political "outsider"? [Balcerowicz] My greatest ambition is the success of the Polish economic reforms. I have a very personal interest in that. That is why I have been trying to influence public opinion since 1991, because I think that a reduction in society's susceptibility to demagoguery is vital to the success of democracy and the market reforms. Unfortunately, our Polish society is considerably susceptible to demagoguery because of the mass of negative experience and its exposure in recent years to a barrage of extremist populism.
