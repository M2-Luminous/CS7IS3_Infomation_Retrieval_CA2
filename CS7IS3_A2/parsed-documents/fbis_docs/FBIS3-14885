Lysenko is accused of espionage. The prosecutor is demanding a five-year prison sentence for Lysenko. Asked by a UNIAN correspondent to comment on the "Lysenko case", SBU Chairman Yevhen Marchuk said: "We have been trying for a long time now not to make any comment at all on this regrettable incident in mutual relations between our two neighboring, friendly states. I would like to say only that SBU Major Anatoliy Lysenko has nothing to do with our intelligence. He had no mission and went to Poland with his wife and children to attend to personal matters. The only thing that he may be rebuked for is that he went abroad without having waited for the SBU leadership's consent, thus acting in breach of service discipline. Our view is that the Polish special services' actions with respect to Lysenko were instigated by someone else: There probably are certain forces in Poland that do not want rapprochement between our friendly people. Nevertheless, we hope common sense will prevail".
