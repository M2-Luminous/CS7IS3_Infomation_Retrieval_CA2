"A real peace can be established only through Israel's unconditional compliance with U.N. resolutions, return of Palestinian refugees to their homeland and holding of a referendum," Rowhani told Canadian Ambassador to Iran Donald McLennan. Rowhani, who is the secretary of the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) reiterated that Palestine was not confined to a single person and that it was the Palestinian nation that should give final approval to such an important issue as peace. "We have time and again expressed our views on the Palestinian issue...we have never decided, nor will we ever decide, to take a military action in the region," he said. The Iranian parliamentarian maintained that it is only the Palestinian people, and no one else, who can make decision on the fate of Palestine. "What has been signed by (Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasir) 'Arafat is an insult to the Palestinian people," he said. He felt confident that the Palestinian people will one day seize power as the majority black people of South Africa did. The Majles vice speaker also criticized the United Nations for its failure to fulfil its duties in Bosnia-Herzegovina in defiance of its charter. He said that in view of the sensitivity of the Persian Gulf region as a key energy supply center, Iran's strong presence in the region has always guaranteed security of the region and will continue to do so in the future. Pointing to the importance of parliamentary relations between Iran and Canada, Rowhani called for exchange of delegations between the parliaments two countries.
