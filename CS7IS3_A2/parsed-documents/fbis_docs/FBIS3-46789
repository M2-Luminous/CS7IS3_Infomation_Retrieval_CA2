Assistant First State Minister for Political Affairs An Kyong-chin and Second State Minister for Political Affairs Chong Chin-yong changed places as a result of the recent discovery that An is a brother-in-law of First State Minister for Political Affairs So Chong-won. An, who is seven years older than his new boss, married So's elder sister while he was in the Home Affairs Ministry. So was then studying politics and diplomacy at Chungang University. Born in Wonju, Kangwon Province, An served as deputy governor of Kangwon and director-general of the civil defense headquarters before settling in at the Ministry of Political Affairs I in 1991. He said he had never dreamed his brother-in-law, a Democratic Liberal Party lawmaker and close aide to President Kim Yong-sam, would become his superior. The "too-close-for-comfort" partnership lasted 15 days, until An was made to change seats with Chong of the Ministry of Political Affairs II on Wednesday. "Never was there a case when brothers-in-law worked in the same office with the superiority order reversed," a ministry official noted, adding that although An had reason to be uncomfortable he did not show it.
