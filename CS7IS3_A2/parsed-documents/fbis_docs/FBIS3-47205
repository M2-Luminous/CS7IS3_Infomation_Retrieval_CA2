"That is a very fine thing," Hosokawa told reporters. Hosokawa's remarks came after U.S. President Bill Clinton announced Monday in Brussels that Ukraine will sign an agreement with Russia and the United States on Friday on the scrapping of its 176 intercontinental ballistic missiles and 1,800 warheads. A government source noted that the fate of nuclear weapons left on Ukrainian soil after the disintegration of the Soviet Union has served for some time now as a source of anxiety. The source called it "good news" that Ukraine will agree to remove them. But when asked about the prospect for Japanese technical or financial assistance in helping Ukraine with that task, the source replied that no such assistance is planned.
