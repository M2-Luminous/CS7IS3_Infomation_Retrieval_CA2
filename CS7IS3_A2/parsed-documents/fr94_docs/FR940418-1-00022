FR940418-1-00022 FR940418-1-00005 Subsequent to the July 8, 1985 promulgation, the stack height regulations were again challenged in NRDC v. Thomas, 838 F.2d 1224 (D.C. Cir. 1988). On January 22, 1988, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued its decision affirming the regulations, for the most part, but remanding three provisions to the EPA for reconsideration. These are: 1. Grandfathering pre-October 11, 1983 within-formula stack height increases from demonstration requirements [40 CFR 51.100(kk)(2)]; 2. Dispersion credit for sources originally designed and constructed with merged or multiflue stacks [40 CFR 51.100(hh)(2)(ii)(A)]; and 3. Grandfathering pre-1979 use of the refined H + 1.5L formula [40 CFR 51.100(ii)(2)]. However, none of these provisions is at issue here. B. Regulatory Requirement for Stacks Greater Than GEP GEP has been established by the regulations to be the greater of: (1) 65 meters, (2) the height derived through application of one of two formulas which base GEP on the dimensions of nearby buildings, or (3) the height demonstration through a field study or fluid modeling demonstration to be necessary to avoid excessive concentrations of any air pollutant due to downwash, eddies, or wakes caused by the source itself or nearby buildings or terrain obstacles (40 CFR 51.100(ii). Where EPA or a State finds that a source emission limit is affected by dispersion from a stack in excess of GEP, the State must then model to establish an emission limit which will provide for attainment of the NAAQS when stack height credit is restricted to GEP. The term ``excessive concentration'' is defined in the regulations to be a 40% increase in concentrations of an air pollutant due to downwash which also results in an exceedance of an applicable NAAQS or prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) increment. In order to demonstrate that stack height in excess of the GEP formulas is needed, a source owner must show through the use of fluid modeling that, when meeting emission rates equivalent to the new source performance standard applicable to the source category, excessive concentrations would result from the use of a shorter stack height. However, a source may demonstrate that the NSPS emission limit is infeasible, establishing an alternative emission limit that represents the most stringent degree of emissions control feasible for the particular source. In making this demonstration, source owners may generally rely on EPA's Guidelines for the Determination of Best Available Retrofit Technology for Coal-Fired Power Plants and Other Existing Stationary Facilities, EPA 450/3&hyph;80&hyph;009b, November 1980 (BART Guideline).
