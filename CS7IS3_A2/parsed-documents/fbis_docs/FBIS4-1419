Judge Kriegler has some other commitments tonight. Thus we have to wind up in 30 minutes. I'm going to hand over to Judge Kriegler for an opening statement, and then I will take your questions. Please to facilitate it, introduce yourself and your organization. Let's limit it to one question per person, no supplementaries, no two double-barreled questions so we give everyone a chance. We need to be out by 30 minutes. Judge Kriegler, let me hand over to you. [Kriegler] Good evening, Pieter, good evening ladies and gentlemen in the auditorium there and to viewers elsewhere. In view of the limited time at our disposal I'll be very brief so as to allow the maximum time for questions and answers. General view of the day -- excellent in parts, good in others, fair in others, and downright poor in others. The poor areas, the East Rand, some parts of Soweto, some parts of the Eastern Cape, some parts of the northern [Orange] Free State, some parts of the Northern Transvaal. A breakdown in detail at this stage I have in front of me. I'll deal with it if questions are asked about it. Generally people stood very, very patiently for very long in queues. Some of them fruitlessly. To them the IEC wants to extend its apologies and its gratitude for forbearance and their patience. In respect of the problem areas, the major constraints were shortages of ballot papers, shortages of the marking ink, and in some areas shortages of ballot boxes which got overstuffed much quicker than we had anticipated because of the unusually high turnout. With respect to those three problems, 5.6 million ballot papers are being printed tonight and being distributed to the problem areas. As I speak to you the first packages -- made up packages of ballot papers, both national and provincial are being dispatched from our central warehouse here to the East Rand and to Soweto, from pour Durban offices particularly up to Empangeni to service Northern Natal. With regard to the marking ink, we have ordered and we have introduced overnight -- in fact I can't tell you how many thousand liters of the fluid, but an ample supply for all voting stations that run out. With regard to ballot boxes, we have made an arrangement with the political parties and with the post office, postal bags lacked and sealed and tagged will be used to empty ballot boxes in voting stations so that the ballot boxes can be reused. That's as far as the measures being taken at the moment. If you ask me will all voting stations be opening tomorrow on time, the answer is no. If you ask me will they largely be opening, will the majority be opening, the answer is yes. Perhaps not sharp at seven, some will be later, it's a question of getting the supplies to the voting stations. With regard to the third main issue of the day, Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi's public intimation earlier this evening that he and his central committee of the Inkatha Freedom Party were considering their position, I have not only been in communication telephonically with the chief minister, so has my vice chair, I have written him a lengthy letter tonight, I have no reason to think that the Inkatha Freedom Party will indeed withdraw from the race. I should add that I would regard that as a tragedy in the light of the effort that has been put in by so many tens of thousands of people. Not only of the IEC and not even particularly of the IEC, but of the millions of people who stood patiently and waited for this election which they all look forward to. It would be a great pity for us to spoil it now. That is as far as the opening statement is concerned, if there are questions, please. [Cronje] Your questions for the judge. Over there please. [Correspondent Shaun Battersby] Shaun Battersby from the CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR. Judge, I would like to ask you a question about two categories of ballot papers -- those that did not bear the sticker of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and yet people voted for another party, and secondly, those that did not bear the sticker of the IFP and people trying to indicate their preference for the IFP by making some kind of a mark on the ballot paper. My question in relation to these ballots is, as I understand, they will be considered as a special category in terms of Section 47 of the Electoral Act, which implies there has been some kind of irregularity. My question is that why should voters who have gone out, bona fide voters, and voters in good faith, for a party -- why should their votes be under any question at all - selections for the voters as I understand? [Kriegler] I fully agree with you. They shouldn't be under any doubt. In terms of the letter of the Electoral Act those ballots have to be regarded as invalid. That's because of the letter of the law and it's precisely because the real purpose of the election is to test the view of the people, that we will be taking the way via Section 47, to take those ballots into account in any event. [Cronje] Karen? [Correspondent Karen Rijnaardt] Karen Rijnaardt, RAPPORT. Judge, yesterday there was a high turnout. Could you quantify that? How high was it? [Kriegler] I can't give it to you in numbers. I am sorry. [Correspondent Paulo Barnard] Paulo Barnard from Italy. Judge, what will happen to the electoral process if Inkatha, indeed, pulls out? [Kriegler] The electoral process will proceed. There is in any event no way to pull out. They're in the race. They may pull out the horse but the race will continue and they'll still be in the race. They may come last. [Unidentified correspondent] Judge, I'm a little confused as to why so many more vote papers have to be printed. I understood that 90 ...around about 90 million vote papers were printed originally. You're printing now an extra 9.3 million. That means that -- it seems an extraordinary high number of ballot papers, even if every polling station had twice as many ballot...[changes thought] expected people, there ought to have been enough polling...ballot papers. Can you explain this? [Kriegler] There are a number of inferences to be drawn from the known data at the moment. The first and most probable is that the large-scale redistribution of population since the census figures entailed that we sent too many ballot papers to areas where the population is no longer as dense, and not enough to the areas where the population has since increased tremendously in density, more particularly in the major metropolitan areas. Now you can ... you may well then ask why don't you get the ballot papers from where there are too many to where there are too few. That's easier said than done. There are over 10,000 votings stations, many of them out in the bundu [isolated areas], in very, very inaccessible areas, very difficult to get to and believe you me, it's not so easy to get a presiding officer voluntarily to surrender ballot papers once they have been delivered to his voting station. He or she fears that there may be a shortage there and they hang on to them. That's the most probable. The second most probable inference to be drawn from the facts is that we, and everybody else, grossly under-calculated or underestimated the population of the country. It seems to me a less likely inference. The third inference is that there was some major hitch in the distribution pattern. That is a less likely probability. There is also a possibility that there was a deliberate attempt to upset the electoral process by disrupting the distribution process. I think that was the least likely of the possibilities but we have, in any event, as a precaution and to ensure that our activities are examined by an outside agency, invited the Commissioner of Police to appoint investigators to check the whole of our train of distribution of ballot papers. [Cronje] Linda. [SABC correspondent Linda van Tilburgh] Linda van Tilburgh, SABC. Judge Kriegler, people are worried about the fact that IFP leader is threatening to withdraw from the process. Can you divulge to us some of the details -- the letter you've written, the conversations you've had with him and his people, just to get some indication of what is the IEC doing to try to placate the chief minister. [Kriegler] I would very much like to take you into my confidence but that would be breaching another one. I can't do that. [Cronje] THE STAR please, over there. [Correspondent] Justice Kriegler, I'm from THE STAR newspaper. This afternoon when you had (?press) briefing -- that there was no need for an extension in the number of voting days, and there was no need for voting to continue on Friday, but you have said just a few minutes ago that there is a possibility again that polls might open later tomorrow than they should be opening. Do you still hold the view that there is no need at all for the number of voting days to be extended to Friday? [Kriegler] I still hold the view that at this stage it is not necessary to take a decision on that point. However, I want to make it perfectly clear that if toward noon tomorrow it is apparent that substantial numbers of people will not be able to exercise their democratic right, we will most certainly make the necessary recommendation to the authorities, but it is only if it transpires to be necessary. [Cronje] WEEKLY MAIL AND GUARDIAN. [Correspondent Steven Harbor] I'm from WEEKLY MAIL AND GUARDIAN. Judge Kriegler, I wonder whether you could tell us something about the contingency planning that the IEC had in place for the possibility that there were going to be situations like the ones you encountered this morning, for example, on the East Rand, and perhaps as part of that whether you could explain to us why it was not possible, with in just a few minutes a presiding officer discovering in Katlehong, for example, that he didn't have what he needed, to jump in a car and drive over to IEC headquarters and get the necessary supply? [Kriegler] Because the necessary supplies were not at IEC headquarters. Once we had to provision an extra 600-odd voting stations in the Transkei, and approximately an equal number -- I think a little more in KwaZulu -- we simply had no reserves at head office. We had to provision those voting stations and that depleted our reserves. [Cronje] Over there, SOWETAN please. [Correspondent Lola Maluti] Judge Kriegler, I'm Lola Maluti from SOWETAN. It would seem that despite your repeated utterances that, you know, this is not the IEC's election, you know, and that people would have to be patient -- at the end of the day people are putting the blame for what is happening at the moment squarely on the shoulders of the IEC. Now, with regard to the particular program of IFP stickers. Wouldn't it have been logical for provisions to be made to service areas such as KwaZulu-Natal and the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region, where there is a concentration of IFP people, in priority, you know, in terms of the other regions. [Kriegler] Madam, let's get one thing quite clear. If we're looking for a place to put the blame, I'm not looking for anybody else. What went wrong today is the IEC's fault, but what I'm saying is the solution does not lie in our hands alone. With regard to the stickers, of course you're right and that's precisely what we did. That the logistics went wrong at the last moment, because of the urgent addition of a number of additional packs, in fact 10,000 extra packs of stickers to go to each voting station in the country, is unfortunate, but we most certainly did look to the provisioning of the voting stations where the logistics would be most difficult, communication would be most difficult, and of course we couldn't put stickers by preference in areas of presumed Inkatha support because that would not have been politically impartial. All ballot papers throughout the country must have those stickers. [Cronje] Over there please. [Correspondent Dale Lautenbach] Judge Kriegler, Dale Lautenbach from the PRETORIA NEWS. Reading media reports that are coming in hourly and listening to radio stations taking calls from people out there, some of whom have had a great experience voting, others not, you ran a very upbeat ad at the weekend: You're Ready, We're Ready -- Let's Do It. It was an encouraging motivation from the IEC. Given the position today a lot of frustration out there, a lot of people confused by explanations regarding Section 49, and 47, etcetera. Would you have to revise the content of that ad, and say actually, in retrospect, we weren't ready? [Kriegler] You're quite right, and the appeal at this stage is be patient with us, it's your election that we are doing our level best to offer you. [Correspondent Mary Hammond] Earlier today you said that most of the problems had been in the rural areas, and this is because you didn't have good communication systems, or transport was difficult to those areas. Will the voting in rural areas be better tomorrow and have you yet found out ways to sort out these problems of communication and transport? [Kriegler] Voting will be better tomorrow. We have not resolved all of the problems in communication and transport. We never hope to resolve all of them, there are voting stations in which we do not have telecommunications. It's just that kind of election. [Harbor] Judge Kriegler, simple arithmetic tells us that even if all the expected voters voted today, there are some 30-35 million ballot forms unaccounted for. It seems to me the reason, the five possible reasons you have given for the missing ballot forms cannot explain that many missing forms. It's an extraordinary quantity, 30 or 35 million. Surely that can't be just misplaced in the wrong station? [Kriegler] No, Mr. Harbor, your arithmetic is not simple, it's simplistic. If you take 10,000 voting stations for which we have estimated a 3,000 per voting station turnout, plus 1,200 for safety, you see already that we are well over the figure that you seem to have taken as a subtractive in your arithmetic. [Harbor] But those forms are missing. They are not there. [Kriegler] Not missing. You don't know they are missing, and I don't think they are missing. I think that they are up there in the sticks in 10,000 little voting stations, and I'm virtually prepared to put my head on a block that that is the ultimate answer. But I can't say that categorically because I don't know the facts. But I do not think it advances the public interest to make simplistic arithmetic and cast doubt on an electoral process that all of us sincerely hope will prove to have been a legitimate one. [Correspondent Pierre Claasen] Judge, you have already said that you expect things to go better tomorrow, but can you tell us whether you think that tomorrow will be sufficient to finish off this election? [Kriegler] I think that it should be clear from what I said earlier that I can't tell you now what the conclusion will be. There was an abnormally high turnout in the whole of the country. In some parts of the country which I have identified, we have not been able to meet that demand. In many, many other areas we did, and at this stage to speak of thinking about a general extension in those circumstances would be grossly irresponsible. [Correspondent Patrick Ellery] Judge, apart from Chief Gatsha Buthelezi, have any other political party leaders expressed dissatisfaction to you directly for any procedure? If so, who, and what have they expressed to you? If not, does that imply that the rest of the political parties are quite satisfied with the way things are going? [Kriegler] I don't know of a single leader of a political party that didn't have a complaint. I would be surprised if it were otherwise in the game of politics. There were complaints ranging for the trivial to the substantive, namely that a voting station did not open in a particular place whereas it should, or that the supply of stickers in a particular voting station area had not arrived. The gravity of your question as I really understand it, has anybody else adopted as firm a stance as Chief Minister Buthelezi? The answer is no. In fact the very reason why I have to be brief with this interview is that I want to go and meet with the representatives of the parties so that we can between us see how best to resolve the problems still facing the country as a whole. [Correspondent Peet Kruger] Judge, would it be irresponsible to talk of a general extension, would it be responsible to talk of extensions in specific areas, and if so, what kind of extension are you looking at? Simply voting till say 12 o'clock tomorrow night or voting on Friday as well? [Kriegler] Obviously both alternatives will have to be looked at if it proves to be necessary by approximately noon tomorrow. They are alternatives. [Correspondent] Judge, you gave us figures earlier for the success rates at different polling stations. One of those success rates was a 70 percent success rate in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region. If I said to you that if on the first day of voting there's a 70 percent success rate in the most populous region of the country, and on the second day of voting this improves to an 80 percent success rate, but that is not a free and fair election, would you agree with me? [Kriegler] No. [Correspondent Dale Lautenbach] We understand that to a degree you have to appear confident, but to what extent is the entire process under threat, to what extent are you besieged right now? [Kriegler] We are certainly facing problems. I am not under threat, and I'm not besieged. We have decided problems, we are addressing those problems. If we do not resolve them satisfactorily, then we may have a crisis. But at the moment, certainly not. [Correspondent] These elections -- and I'm looking at this from the point of view of somebody who looks at South African politics from miles and miles away. If at the end of these elections, say 15 percent of the population of South Africa could not vote, will that be free and fair? [Kriegler] It would not in itself render it unfree and unfair. If that 15 percent were distributed across the whole of the country, across all of the constituencies, more or less evenly, that would not per se, render the election unfree and unfair. However, if it were a selective disadvantaging of certain members of the overall electorate, particular sectors thereof, it may well result in such a finding being made. [Cronje] Linda. [Van Tilburgh] Linda van Tilburgh again. Linked to the whole issue of possible missing votes, there's a rumor floating around that there's 22 million ballot papers missing. What would you say to that rumor? [Kriegler] Madam, have you been present this evening. I thought I've addressed that as fully as it could conceivably be. There are not 22 million ballot papers missing. If you want to float that rumor some more, do it without my assistance. [Cronje] Harbor? [Harbor] Steven Harbor from the WEEKLY MAIL AND GUARDIAN again. We were given a figure a little earlier in a press briefing here, of 70 percent functioning rate of polling stations in the PWV region. Turning that around that means that 30 percent didn't function today. If that remains that way tomorrow, are you going to declare the PWV region not free and not fair, and if you are required to do that, what then? [Kriegler] First of all I don't accept that it will remain the same tomorrow. Secondly, the fact that 30 percent of the electorate in a particular area did not manage to vote, if spread evenly across that society would not per se render it unfree and unfair. If it remains selective as it is at the moment, that would be a very serious consideration in the evaluation of the PWV election. That is not a disaster. It's not a national disaster. The Electoral Act makes express provision for what we do then as does the constitution. There will have to be a rerun in this particular province within 12 weeks. [Cronje] Ladies and gentlemen, if there are no further questions could we wind this up by thanking you all for your attendance. From the IEC media center at Gallagher Estate, thank you. Goodnight.
