Ms. Deng made the remarks in reply to questions related to the state of her father's health when attending a press conference at the State Council press office in her capacity as the Vice Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission, together with the Vice Minister of the State Planning Commission Mr. Chen Yaobang, both of whom elaborated on a White Paper on China's population, environment, and development in the 21st century. Ms. Deng said that she understood the wide concern for her father's health and that she and her family members were used to various rumours regarding her father's state of health and even joked about them. She repeated that her father was in a good state of health and clearly showed his care for the build-up of the country including the White Paper on the outlook for China in the next century. Speaking on the White Paper, Mr. Chen said that it employed the spirit of the United Nations Environment and Development Convention held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in June, 1992, and was worked out by the Chinese Government with the participation of 52 departments and social institutions involving 300 experts with four revisions. The paper was discussed and endorsed at a meeting presided over by Premier Li Peng last March 25. The paper, based on the State situation and population as well as environment and development, makes known the general strategy for promotion of coordination of the economy, society, resources, and the environment in a bid to achieve continuous development. It will serve as a guiding document for a medium- and long-term programme for national economic and social development. It will also be used as a reference in the formulation of the Ninth Five-Year Plan and the programme for the year 2001.
