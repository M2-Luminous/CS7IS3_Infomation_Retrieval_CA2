The main conclusion I drew from my conversation with the new minister: He would be glad to help the press, which is suffering a financial collapse, but his possibilities are not great. So, poor brother journalist, as they say--the minister helps those who help themselves.... [Andreyev] Leonid Aleksandrovich, I will not undertake to speak for the entire journalistic fraternity, but I personally do not understand why our Moscow Ministry of Press and Information was created. [Belov] Our department is not an ideological department like the former division of propaganda of the party gorkom [city committee], which at one time was in charge of the media and adjusted their political line. On the whole, the ministry's main task is to provide for constant information communications between the residents and the government of Moscow. Muscovites must know about all steps and decisions taken by the government, and it, in turn, must adjust its socioeconomic policy taking into account the demands and opinions of the city residents. We maintain close contacts with all departments of the mayor's office and government and with the prefectures, we conduct sociological research, and we regularly publish collections of information on various aspects on the life and activity of the city. The mass media are a most important part of our work: the newspapers, magazines, radio, and television. And of course printing, dissemination of printed products, and the information and artistic arrangement of the city. [Andreyev] Many new Moscow newspapers, including KURANTY, have ended up in an extremely difficult material position. Is it possible for them to count on any support from your ministry? [Belov] By a directive from the top official of the government, Yuriy Mikhaylovich Luzhkov, benefits that give them a break on the rent for their premises have already been established for the editorial offices of all Moscow newspapers, including KURANTY. Our department is now considering the question of the possibility of reducing charges for electric energy for printing facilities, which consume a very large amount of it here, and this, of course, will have an effect on the cost of printing services and newspapers. [Andreyev] All of the so-called independent newspapers are still dependent as long as they do not have their own premises and printing base. Could the Moscow government not make a goodwill gesture during these days that are so difficult for newspaper people: turn modest premises and a printing base over to them to be owned by them free of charge? [Belov] I do not rule out such an arrangement regarding premises, but I do not want to get your hopes up: The market is the market, you must earn money and support yourself in interaction with commercial structures. Now about the printing base. It is in a most difficult position. The Moskovskaya Pravda publishing house, where the majority of Moscow newspapers and magazines are printed, is not owned by the capital but is federally owned. The money is pumped out of it and there is practically no help from the Russian authorities. For this reason the publishing house is unable to complete capital construction, make current repairs, or purchase new equipment. [Andreyev] Why does the capital government not get the Moskovskaya Pravda publishing house turned over to Moscow ownership? [Belov] This question has been raised repeatedly with the Russian government. The mayor has just received a negative response to his last letter. [Andreyev] God forbid, but let us say that the Moskovskaya Pravda publishing house was over-strained and stopped functioning. Are there any alternative plans? [Belov] We are taking all possible measures to launch a second section of the Chertanov printing base, but things are very tight with money. We are conducting negotiations with the Moscow Business Bank and foreign companies. Perhaps they will become involved in this matter. [Andreyev] At one of the recent sessions of the capital government your department was given a good dressing down for poor street advertising in the capital. What a strange combination--the press and advertising. Is it really not possible to create a specialized advertising office? [Belov] There is a state (municipal) enterprise called "advertising-service." The task of our department's advertising division is to develop and implement a standard advertising policy which would meet the three requirements set by the capital's mayor: It must be attractive, information-filled, and advantageous. And the main thing is that the advertising that interests Muscovites should be not only in the center, on Tver Street, but in all the administrative and municipal districts. Taking Western experience into account, we have prepared a concept of advertising and it will soon be considered by the capital government. [Andreyev] For two years in a row with the participation of the Department of Press and Information winter evening balls for journalists have been held in the mayor's office on Novyy Arbat. Will this tradition continue? [Belov] We intend to have another ball but we do not yet know where. We have to lease premises and find sponsors. [Andreyev] Previously, Leonid Aleksandrovich, you were deputy chairman of the Moscow Soviet. Which position do you like better? [Belov] I like better the lively, specific work which is conducted in the executive structures. You see the results of your work more quickly here, and that is stimulating. [Andreyev] All Muscovites hope that the new organ of representative power--the City Duma--will not become a mini Moscow Soviet, that it will really think reasonably and calmly, but work effectively for the good of the city. What do you have to say about this? [Belov] I too hope that Moscow will finally have a normal, effective representative power. But this can happen only with clear-cut delimitation of functions between the Moscow government and the Duma and also with the highest degree of responsibility on the part of deputies for the decisions that are made.
