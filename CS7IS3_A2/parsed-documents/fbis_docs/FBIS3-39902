Now there must be a "follow-up": A conclusion must be the establishment of additional security zones -- which we have been demanding for one year: Bihac, Tuzla, Gorazde, Srebrenica. There must be military reactions to every violation of these UN protection zones. This means that NATO has to continue to maintain its operational readiness at any time. If two to three real security zones are created -- as has, for example, now been achieved in Sarajevo -- a new, large-scale peace conference would be conceivable. However, a concept has not yet been developed. The problem of Sarajevo has not been solved yet by the observation of the ultimatum. Effective humanitarian help has to be organized now. After the conclusion of negotiations with the European Union, I will increasingly devote myself to the Bosnian conflict. At present, I am making intensive efforts to gain partners for a children's hospital in Sarajevo and for an action that enables children from Sarajevo to relax in Vienna.
