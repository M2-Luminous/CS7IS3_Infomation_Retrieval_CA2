A reporter asked at a news conference this afternoon: Around the New Year's Day this year, Lien Chan paid a visit to some countries having diplomatic relations with China in the name of "a private vacation," which Taiwan describes as "vacation diplomacy." Do you have any comments on the event? Wu Jianmin pointed out: China never takes exception to non- governmental contact between Taiwan and countries having diplomatic relations with China. However, the relations between some of those countries and Taiwan have recently gone beyond that limit. We firmly opposes any form of official contact between Taiwan and those countries having diplomatic relations with China.
