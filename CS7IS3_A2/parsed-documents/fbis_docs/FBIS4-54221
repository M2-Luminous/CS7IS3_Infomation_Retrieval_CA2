During the negotiations on 25 May, the IAEA stressed that replacing fuel rods while not allowing inspection was a serious violation of the nuclear accord but North Korea only reconfirmed its previous stance that IAEA's demands cannot be accepted due to its special position of withholding the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. According to a well-informed IAEA source, the negotiation will continue on 26 May even though there is no sign that the replacement of nuclear fuel rods may be suspended during the negotiations. Relevant IAEA officials said that the IAEA inspection team completed its mission of inspecting North Korea's radiochemical laboratory but failed to extract samples from spent fuel rods of the five-megawatt reactor in question.
