The message says that the historic start of the party work by the sagacious leader Comrade Kim Chong-il on June 19, 1964, was a solemn declaration announcing the inheritance of the chuche cause and full efflorescence and development of the Workers' Party era and a political event worthy of being specially recorded in the history of the chuche revolution. Reviewing the feats performed by Comrade Kim Chong-il over the last 30 years, the message notes that he has developed and enriched the chuche idea with new principles and contents through his unique ideological and theoretical activities and strengthened and developed the Workers' Party of Korea to be a chuche-type revolutionary party with his experienced and fresh art of leadership. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, a great brilliant commander, has built the Korean People' Army to be a matchless and invincible army of the party equipped with modern defensive and offensive means, made the Army and people a crystal of the unity of loyal subjects and filial people, which cannot be broken even by an atomic bomb and firmly built the whole country into an impregnable fortress which any formidable imperialist enemy cannot provoke and led to one victory after another the most acute ever political and military confrontation with the U.S. imperialists hell bent on stifling the northern half of Korea, the message says. It declares that Hanminjon will build up the independent driving force of the change by stepping up the awakening of the people to the consciousness of independence and their organisation under the banner of the chuche idea and accelerate the glorious victory of independence, democracy and reunification by intensifying the anti-U.S., anti-war, anti-nuke and anti-fascist struggle. The message wishes Comrade Kim Chong-il good health and a long life.
