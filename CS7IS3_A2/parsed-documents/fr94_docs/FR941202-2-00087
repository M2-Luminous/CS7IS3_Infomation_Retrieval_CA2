These regulations have been designated as imposing an administrative burden of one hour, because the actual regulatory burdens are established by the individual forms that refer to the items in the regulations. No change in the burden hours assigned to Regulations S&hyph;K and S&hyph;B will result as a consequence of the revisions. Regulations 13D and 13G govern the disclosure of information relating to beneficial ownership of securities issued by public companies. An estimated annual average of 6,536 respondents file documents pursuant to these regulations. If the revisions to Regulation 13D are adopted as proposed, the estimated burden hours per submission will increase from 13.75 hours to 14.75 hours, for a total annual burden of 96,406 hours. Rule 13e&hyph;3 governs the disclosure of information by an issuer that is going private. An estimated annual average of 221 Schedules 13E&hyph;3 are filed pursuant to Rule 13e&hyph;3. If the proposals are adopted, the estimated burden hours per filing will increase from 139.25 hours to 140.25 hours, for a total annual burden of 30,996 hours. Regulation 14A sets out the requirements for disclosure documents relating to proxy solicitations. An estimated annual average of 7,980 filers file proxy materials pursuant to this regulation. If the changes are adopted as proposed, the estimated burden hours per filing will increase from 85 hours to 86 hours, for a total annual burden of 686,280 hours. Regulation 14D contains the disclosure requirements associated with tender offer transactions. An average of 366 documents are filed pursuant to this regulation each year. If the proposed changes to this regulation are adopted, the estimated burden hours will increase from 353.25 hours per submission to 354.25 hours per filing, for a total annual burden of 129,656 hours. Regulation A sets out the disclosure obligations of designated issuers who rely on certain exemptions from registration of securities. An estimated average of 201 issuers file documents pursuant Regulation A. If the revisions to this regulation are adopted, the estimated burden hours per filing would increase from 620 hours to 621 hours, for a total annual burden of 124,821 hours. General comments regarding the estimated burden hours should be directed to the Clearance Officer for the Securities and Exchange Commission at the address below. Any comments concerning the accuracy of the estimated average burden hours for compliance with Commission rules and forms should be directed to Richard T.
