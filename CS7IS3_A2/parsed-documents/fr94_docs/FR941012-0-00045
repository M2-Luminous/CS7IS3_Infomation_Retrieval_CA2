It should be noted that in a majority of cases where an employee slipped or fell, the fall was due to an uneven surface. Many of these employees lost their balance on those uneven surfaces, such as standing on felled trees. Other employees slipped and fell from slippery or loose bark, sudden shifting of trees or logs, protruding roots, deadwood, leaves, vines, other wood litter and rocks. As stated above, one-fifth of all employees were injured while operating chain saws, as shown in Table 9. Of these employees, about two-thirds were hurt when the chain saw kicked back.
