FR940728-0-00040 FR940728-0-00014 Copyright Office 37 CFR Parts 201 and 211 [Docket No. 94&hyph;5] Fees AGENCY: Copyright Office, Library of Congress. ACTION: Interim regulations with request for comments. SUMMARY: The Copyright Office is adopting interim amendments concerning fees with a request for comments. These fee adjustments are limited to special services, and reflect the actual cost of providing the services. They include full-term storage of copyright deposits, special handling of copyright registrations, and other expedited services. The effect of these interim regulations is to increase or institute fees for special services as authorized under the Copyright Code. DATES: Effective date: September 26, 1994. Written comments should be received before September 12, 1994. ADDRESSES: Fifteen copies of written comments should be addressed, if sent by mail to: Eric Schwartz, Acting General Counsel, Copyright GC/I&R, P.O. Box 70400, Southwest Station, Washington, DC 20024. If delivered by hand, copies should be brought to: Office of the General Counsel, Copyright Office, James Madison Memorial Building, Room 407, First and Independence Avenue SE., Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Eric Schwartz, Acting General Counsel, U.S. Copyright Office, Library of Congress, Washington, DC 20540. Telephone: (202) 707&hyph;8380. Telefax (202) 707&hyph;8366. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Today we are issuing two separate but associated documents concerning fees for providing certain discretionary services to the public. This document contains interim regulations to increase or institute fees for special services authorized under the Copyright Code. Published elsewhere in today's Federal Register is an associated document dealing with proposals for fees to cover costs for providing and maintaining Deposit Accounts. Copyright Office Funding The Copyright Office is funded annually by Congressional appropriation; however, the total appropriation includes a credit based on income from projected fees. We base this projection on an estimate of the fees we expect to receive over the course of the next fiscal year from services provided during that period. If revenue from fees falls short of our estimate, the total Congressional appropriation is decreased by the amount of the shortfall. In fiscal year 1993, our receipts failed to reach the projected level. Analysis of current fees indicates that the total received in fiscal year 1994 will again fall short of the projected amount. Not only has Congressional funding been reduced, but the fee income has also declined because the number of copyright registrations, and the consequential fees they generate, have not increased in recent years. There are several possible explanations for this shortfall, including an increase in group registrations and fewer renewal registrations resulting from legislation in 1992 making renewal registration optional. Congressional Authorization Title 17 of the United States Code authorizes the Register of Copyrights to require payment of fees for services specifically described in section 708(a)(1)&hyph;(9). In addition, paragraph 708(a)(10) permits the Register to require ``for any other special services requiring a substantial amount of time or expense, such fees as the Register of Copyrights may fix on the basis of the cost of providing the service.'' The final sentence in 17 U.S.C. 708(a) provides that ``[t]he Register of Copyrights is authorized to fix the fees for preparing copies of Copyright Office records, whether or not such copies are certified, on the basis of the cost of such preparation.'' Paragraph 708(d) further permits the Register to prescribe regulations for the refund of ``any sum paid by mistake or in excess of the fee required. . . .'' Actual Costs of Providing Special Services Before proposing these fee adjustments, we consulted the Library of Congress' financial managers and conducted a comprehensive economic analysis of the operating costs involved in providing special user services to ascertain the actual costs of providing these services. Our analysis concluded that the current fees charged for special services do not offset the costs of the services provided. Most of the fees for special services have not been adjusted in almost a decade. Special services entail high administrative costs because requests for these services disrupt the normal work flow, are labor intensive, and are moved ahead of regular requests. The analysis included an examination of all the discretionary fees set under authority of 17 U.S.C. 708(a)(10). It identified the special services currently offered, and it calculated the cost of providing each service, taking into account staff time, overtime, and storage. In the past, the Office has chosen not to charge any fee for some services. Our analysis confirmed that we should adjust fees in order to justify the disruption to our normal work-flow and the high cost of these services, and to recapture actual cost; it also confirmed that we should impose charges for certain other administrative expenses. Fees for Expedited Services Users who request expedited services need information or certified documents in order to meet extraordinary time deadlines, usually for business or litigation purposes. In these situations a user asks us to move his or her request ahead of the hundreds of pending requests; in most cases, if sufficient reason is given, we will comply. Compliance requires additional staff time or overtime to respond to the request in an expedited manner. It is appropriate to charge special service fees that reflect the actual costs of these services to avoid other users or the general public from having to subsidize these services. We are not proposing adjustments to the statutory fees set under ยง708(b) or seeking any legislative change in these fees. We will continue to provide regular searches, certifications, or copies of registration or recordation materials at the current fees. 1 1 See Copyright Office Circular 4 for current schedule of fees. II. Special Handling Fees Special Handling Procedure Although the effective date of registration is the date the application, required fee, and deposit are received, it usually takes us several weeks to process a claim and mail the certificate of registration. Special handling is granted at the discretion of the Register in a limited number of cases as a special service to copyright applicants who have a compelling reason for the expedited issuance of a certificate of registration or recordation of a document pertaining to copyright. A request for special handling is granted only for claims involved in pending or prospective litigation, customs matters, or contract or publishing deadlines that necessitate expedited service. For many years, we used an informal procedure for special handling of applications. When we began providing this service, we noted that we could not continue to absorb the extra charges for providing such a service, but did not establish a fee for special handling until 1982 when these procedures were formalized. 47 FR 19254 (May 4, 1982). Work Involved in Special Handling Under normal work procedures, applications for registration or documents for recordation pass through various administrative and examining processing steps. Special handling requests disrupt the regular workflow procedure and require expedited handling outside the normal first-in, first-out basis. These claims require special handling at each step and routing between work stations that supersedes the normal, chronological processing. A separate system of controls must be maintained to assure that each claim moves expeditiously through each stage and that these claims can be quickly located. Special handling claims take staff away from processing all other claims, including those received earlier, in order to process them in a substantially shorter time period. Under regular procedures these same employees could more efficiently process many standard claims. Multiple Applications Another special workflow problem for the Office arises from processing multiple applications accompanied by a single deposit when the request for special handling is limited to one claim or fewer than all of the multiple claims. Because all the applications share the deposit for the special handling claim, all claims must be processed in the same expedited manner. A $50 surcharge is currently applied to each additional claim attached to the deposit used for the special handling claim and processed at the same time. This surcharge will remain at $50, but it may be avoided by submitting a separate deposit. Fees for Special Handling When a fee is charged for special handling, this fee is added to the regular fee for registration ($20.00) or recordation ($20.00 for a document listing no more than one title).
