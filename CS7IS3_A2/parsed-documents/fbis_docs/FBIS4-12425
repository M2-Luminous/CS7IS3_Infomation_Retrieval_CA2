Who Are the Enemies of Peace in Palestine?"] [Text] We should not permit the enemies of peace to be victorious! This was a remark by U.S. President Clinton at the conclusion of his talks with the prime minister of the Israeli regime at the White House. Regardless of the fact that, in itself, this remark is quite correct and logical and, in practice, one should prevent the enemies of peace from becoming victorious in Palestine, one must first see who are the "enemies of peace." These enemies of peace are none other than the Zionists and their supporters. It has become clear to world public opinion today that the debacle of the slaughter of the Muslims in al-Khalil [Hebron] did not take place without the direct support of the Israeli armed forces. The Israeli press and Western supporters have also admitted this fact. The slaughter of fasting Muslim worshipers who were prostrate in the mosque of Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) has ripped the mask from the visage of the true enemies of Islam and revealed their repulsive faces. Are the enemies of peace anyone other than those who for many years have usurped the first qiblah [direction in which Muslims say their prayers] of the Muslims and kill the Muslim youth residing in those areas every day? The U.S. President, who is a champion of human rights, ignores all these crimes and shamelessly alleges that PLO leaders should not permit incidents such as the al-Khalil [Hebron] carnage to hinder progress toward peace and not expect greater concessions from Israel for resumption of talks! Is support of a criminal not tantamount to being an accomplice? The United States is as much responsible for the shedding of the blood of innocent Muslims in Palestine as Israel is, as it not only prevents their condemnation at international forums but encourages this terrorist regime by various kinds of economic and political assistance. After many years of psychological war and adverse propaganda against those they describe as "enemies of peace," the United States and Israel should note that such opinions will not in any way affect the determination of the Palestinian Muslims all over Palestine for the liberation of dear Jerusalem. Clinton should realize that the era of such efforts to deceive the people has ended. How is it possible that the greatest criminals in history and their supporters speak of peace and consider themselves peace-seekers? The day is not too far away when the true enemies of peace, security, and freedom will face a disgraceful defeat.
