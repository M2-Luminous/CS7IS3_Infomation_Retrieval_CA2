The proposal was officially announced by Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim. It calls for the gradual lifting of customs tariffs in South American countries until a total liberalization of regional trade is achieved by 2005. The same sources added that although the Brazilian proposal was not rejected, there was no enthusiasm for this new Latin American integration proposal in the short term. The foreign ministers of Mercosur [Common Market of the South] countries will discuss this issue in their next meeting scheduled for March in Buenos Aires. They will also discuss the state of negotiations toward a common Mercosur customs tariff and the Brazilian proposal. Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu did not comment on the issue but specified that the Brazilian proposal does not contradict Mercosur. The foreign ministers attending the ALADI meeting avoided any specific comment on the eventual establishment of free trade zone in the short term. They reasserted their willingness to strengthen regional integration. In a speech he delivered on 11 February at the ALADI meeting, the Argentine representative stressed the need to strengthen Latin American integration. He specified, however, that subregional organizations must first be enhanced. If the Brazilian proposal is to be implemented on the same terms as those explained by Foreign Minister Amorim, negotiations should be undertaken this year so that the 10-year timetable for the elimination of custom tariffs may begin by 1995.
