The Defense Ministry is currently examining calls from the industry for several hundred million German marks [DM] occasioned by sluggish development, technical modifications, and the usual price increases. It is understood that a sum of up to DM670 million is at stake, only DM300 million of which are regarded as justified in Defense Ministry circles. However, the ministry does not intend to give an official assessment of the industry's demands until the Eurofighter has undertaken a successful maiden flight. This is not expected to take place until next spring. The fighter's maiden flight has already been postponed several times because considerable technical problems have arisen in the flight control system. After Gripen-type test aircraft crashed in Sweden, the industry decided to proceed with extreme caution. The Defense Ministry now expects the maiden flight to take place in April 1994. Only when a test flight has been successfully accomplished will the ministry enter into negotiations over the increased development cost. The industry is, of course, prepared to bear part of the extra cost, because it is itself responsible for the delay in development. At the Defense Ministry they say that the negotiations on the new development price will be extremely difficult and could take months, because the economic situation has hardly put industry in a mood for compromise. The industry's demand is referred to as mere figure-work that can only serve as a basis for an initial position. If the extra development costs were accepted, they could only be billed on completion of the development work, thus not affecting the Bundeswehr's current budget. The technical and military requirements that the aircraft will have to meet so that the sale price can be reduced will also be decided by next spring. The heads of the air forces of the four countries involved (Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain) will decide in January on the new performance specification. Defense Minister Volker Ruehe had referred to DM90 million as an ideal price, but the industry has so far scaled its calculations down from DM123 to 102 million. According to a Defense Ministry report, preparations for production are now scheduled to begin in 1996 owing to the development delay, so Parliament could vote whether or not to purchase the aircraft in 1995. Daimler-Benz group subsidiary German Aerospace AG (DASA), which is based in Munich, does not rule out a withdrawal from the defense sector if the defense budget suffers further reductions. DASA intends to cut 2,500 of its remaining 11,600 jobs in its defense and civil systems business division by the end of 1996.
