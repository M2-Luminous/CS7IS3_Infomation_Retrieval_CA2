This technique is a very powerful means to reduce contamination of a hot fusion plasma by oxygen and metal impurities released from vessels. On a technical side, however, some difficulties remain: 1) the use of highly toxic and explosive gas diborane (B[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]6[/]) requires considerable efforts for safe handling; 2) boron films are not uniformly coated because of extremely large devices; 3) removal of degraded boron films is necessary after long-term use. In this paper, we present new methods of boronization developed in a small-scale laboratory experiment. First of all, we have proposed the use of a much less hazardous boride, decaborane (B[.sub]10[/]H[.sub]14[/] 99.7�C mp, 213�C bp)[.sup]1,2[/] and the technique has been successfully applied to the JT-60U, one of the largest three fusion devices in the world. A hydrogen atom content in boron thin films was measured by [.sup]15[/]N resonant nuclear reaction and the analysis revealed a rapid decrease in the H content with increasing deposition temperature (150-300�C). Secondly, a scaling law for nonuniformity of boron film deposition has been investigated with a pressure and a discharge current as parameters. The measured dependence of the e-folding length for the nonuniformity agreed with a prediction in a one-dimensional fluid model for plasma chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Thirdly, boron thin films were deposited by thermal decomposition (pyrolysis) of decaborane in the absence of a glow plasma. High deposition rates on a hot wall (� 350�C) were obtained with the activation energy of 39 kcal/mol. Finally, we proposed in situ boronization by injecting a decaborane pellet into a hot fusion plasma. A small pellet of solid decaborane can easily be fabricated by warming up and pressing a decaborane crystal into a small hole. References 1. M. Yamage, T. Ejima, H. Toyoda, and H. Sugai, J. NUCL.
