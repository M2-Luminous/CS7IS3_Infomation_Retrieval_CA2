The audience was attended on the Algerian side by Mokdad Sifi and Mihoub Mihoubi, advisers on diplomatic affairs and presidential official spokesman. On the Palestinian side, the meeting was attended by the Palestinian ambassador to Algeria, Abu al-'Iz, and Yasir Abd Rabbu, head of the PLO Information Department. On leaving the office of the head of state, Mr. 'Arafat made the following statement: [Begin recording] ['Arafat] First, I had to come here following the formation of the first Palestinian administration on the first liberated Palestinian territory. I had to come to Algeria; this country that always stood by its Palestinian brothers; Algeria, which has reiterated and continues to reiterate that we are with Palestine, irrespective of whether this Palestine was in the right or in the wrong. I briefed the head of state on the latest developments in our land, and on the formation of the administration and the challenges facing us. I thanked him for the support he has provided for the Palestinian security forces -- these forces that left this country for our land. Yesterday, these forces made moves using all their equipment; all this highlights the significance of these deeply rooted and original Palestinian-Algerian relations. Also, we tackled all the problems facing the Palestinian national authority, especially now that we are starting from zero. Our underlying structure was totally destroyed by the Israeli occupation. The head of state reiterated to me and to my brothers that Algeria will remain on the side of the Palestinian people until, God willing, we pray in holy Jerusalem. [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, what are the priorities of the political program? ['Arafat] You have seen the published program. The most important issue for us now is to stress our national unity, because we look forward to establishing a modern and democratic state. We take into consideration the pan-Arab relations that link us with our Arab nation. We also take into account the far-sightedness, originality and religions and spiritual foundations of Palestine, the first of the two kiblahs and the third holy mosque; sacred places for both prophet Mohammed, God's peace and prayers be upon Him, and Christ, peace be upon Him.
