Mitsui Trust & Banking will lead all eight banks in increasing it percentage of investments in domestic stock in relative to total assets by 5 percentage points over holdings as of the end of fiscal year 1993. The reason is that banks feel the economy will improve during the fiscal year and that stock prices will rise moderately. No consistent pattern has been established in investments in domestic bonds and foreign currency-denominated assets. Operating profits of company pension funds are expected to remain sluggish in this fiscal year and the asset balances of the funds at the eight trust banks are expected to rise by 2 trillion yen, to a level of about 30 trillion yen. Mitsubishi Trust & Banking, among trust banks, assumes the spreading viewpoint that "stock prices will enter a rising trend in the second half of the fiscal year." The majority of the trust banks expect a return of 10 percent on stock investments and will aggressively allocate any additional funds available during the fiscal year to investments in domestic stocks. Toyo Trust & Banking will allocate funds primarily to issues with high growth potential and those that are relatively cheaply priced in its effort to increase the rate of return. However, the prevailing view is that the rise in stock prices will be minimal. Many trust banks predict that the Nikkei stock average will rise to about 22,000-23,000 yen in the second half of the fiscal year, but that there will be a time when it breaks through the 20,000 yen level and return to the point where it was at the beginning of the year. As stated by Sumitomo Trust & Banking, it appears that "we will have to watch our timing in purchasing additional stock as we monitor price movements." In the area of investments in domestic bonds, trust banks are divided into two camps; i.e., those that take a cautious stance in expectation of rising interest rates and those that plan to purchase additional bonds as a source for long-term income. Yasuda Trust & Banking plans to reduce its allocation of funds for investment in domestic bonds by 5 percent during the current fiscal year, based on the assessment that "interest rates will rise when the economic recovery becomes visible." Since Mitsui Trust & Banking's proportion of funds allocated for bond investments is low compared to other banks, it plans to add to its holdings in the current fiscal year. Nippon Trust Bank disposed of bond holdings between the end of 1993 and the beginning of this year on the premise that bond prices were hovering at a high level, leading to a lower proportion of domestic bond holdings, and now plans to raise investments in bonds during the fiscal year. With respect to foreign currency-denominated assets, Yasuda Trust & Banking says, "We will expand the number of nations in which we invest and aggressively pursue investments in foreign stocks." On the other hand, some banks, such as Sumitomo Trust & Banking say, "We will maintain our current proportion of foreign assets, because it is difficult to predict the future of foreign exchange rates." Company annuity funds represent the total of welfare annuity funds and tax qualifying annuity funds held in trust. Company annuity fund asset balances based on book value held by the eight trust banks as of the end of March 1994 were about 27.6 trillion yen. The banks predict that asset balances will increase by 5-10 percent or by a total of 2 trillion yen during the year.
