Together with the Left Party, Ingvar Carlsson has a lead of all of 17.5 percent over the bruised nonsocialist government three months before the election. Despite the fact that the Moderates have gained 3 percentage points, the nonsocialist bloc hardly makes any net gains among the electorate. At the same time the Left Party has strengthened its position above the 4-percent threshold for representation in the Riksdag. The Christian Democratic Party, however, is lying exactly on the threshold and the Green Ecology Party falls 1 percent under it. The Center Party -- which today holds its national congress in Falun -- and the Liberal Party are having a difficult time in the shadow of the Moderates. New Democracy attracts only 1 percent of voters and can now be considered to be out for the count. The poll was carried out between 8 and 15 June, and was therefore completed the evening before Olof Johansson left the government. The crisis began on 11 June when Prime Minister Carl Bildt announced in the Riksdag that everything was ready for a yes to the bridge and this made the Center Party leader/environment minister feel that he had been steamrollered. Telephone interviews were carried out with 1,012 persons who were asked how they would vote if there were an election today. Results in percent with changes since the May poll in parentheses: - Moderate Coalition Party 23.0 (plus 3.0) - Liberal Party 6.0 (minus 1.5) - Center Party 6.0 (unchanged) - Christian Democratic Party 4.0 (minus 1.0) - Social Democratic Party 51.5 (plus 1.5) - Left Party 5.0 (plus 0.5) - New Democracy 1.0 (minus 0.5) - Green Ecology Party 3.0 (minus 1.0) - Other parties 0.5 (minus 1.0). The proportion of don't knows is 11.5 percent, an increase of 1.5 percent since May. The proportion of respondents who indicated their party sympathy and are "sure" of their choice is 64.5 percent, a small increase since the last poll. In May the Social Democrats and the Left Party together had 54.5 percent against the government parties' 38.5. In June this lead has increased to 56.5 (plus 2.0) against 39.0 (plus 0.5). In the government the Moderates -- with the their highest Temo showing since the beginning of 1992 -- are now 7 percentage points bigger than the other three government parties -- something that is unlikely to stimulate their interest in government. Bengt Westerberg is also reported to have been very afraid in Thursday's [16 June] lengthy crisis negotiations with the Center Party of being left alone in the government with two "right-wing parties." The Left Party's 5 percent is the party's best Temo score in the election period. Gudrun Schyman cannot feel safe, but with the Social Democrats' top score of 51.5 percent there ought to be some scope for support votes for the Left Party from Comrade 4 Percent. The Green Ecology Party moved up to the magic 4 percent immediately after the publicity surrounding its congress. However, the Greens have long been steady around 3 percent and cannot be counted out. New Democracy, however, can be. Since the previous poll they have held a new chaotic congress in Vasteras that led to a new step toward annihilation at national level.
