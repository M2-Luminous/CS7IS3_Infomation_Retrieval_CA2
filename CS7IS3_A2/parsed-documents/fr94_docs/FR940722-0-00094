FR940722-0-00094 FR940722-0-00019 II. Executive Summary 7. In this Fifth Report and Order , we set forth the specific auction procedures for broadband PCS licenses. We have decided to conduct three auctions: the first for the 99 available PCS licenses in MTA blocks A and B, the second for the 986 PCS licenses in BTA blocks C and F, and the third for the remaining 986 PCS licenses in BTA blocks D and E. That is, the first auction will award licenses for the 30 MHz blocks for large geographic areas. The second auction will award licenses for smaller geographic areas for the two blocks that, as explained below, we have reserved for bidding by relatively small companies. In these ``entrepreneurs' blocks,'' we have designed procedures to ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies and businesses owned by women and minorities, which we collectively refer to as designated entities, have ``the opportunity to participate in the provision'' of PCS, as Congress directed in Section 309(j)(4)(D). In the third auction we will award licenses for the remaining 10 MHz blocks. 8. We intend to conduct each auction through simultaneous multiple round bidding with simultaneous stopping rules. Under that approach, no license awarded until the bidding closes on all licenses in the auction. We have determined that simultaneous multiple round bidding is appropriate where the value of the licenses is high compared to the cost of conducting the auction and the values of licenses are interdependent. See Second Report and Order at ¶106&hyph;111. We believe the former condition is met here because other government agencies project that the boardband PMS licenses will be auctioned for as much as $10.6 billion. See id. at ¶177. The latter condition is also satisfied because the record demonstrates, for example, that a license for the Philadelphia MTA or the Richmond MTA will likely be valued more highly if it is held in conjunction with the license for the Washington-Baltimore MTA. We are adopting a variety of rules governing bid increments and bidding activity to move the auctions toward completion in a reasonable period of time. We are also retaining the ability to use other approaches, including sequential auctions for the licenses, and to make other adjustments to the auction process as necessary. 9. As mentioned above, we establish by this Order a number of rules to implement Congress's mandate in Section 309(j)(4)(D) that we ensure that designated entities are ``given the opportunity to participate in the provision of spectrum-based services'' such as broadband PCS. To accomplish this objective, Congress directed us to ``consider the use of tax certificates, bidding preferences, and other procedures.'' 47 U.S.C. §309(j)(4)(D). We construe this congressional directive as a mandate that we take the steps that are necessary to ensure that designated entities have a realistic opportunity to obtain broadband PCS licenses. We apply that mandate in light of Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC , 497 U.S. 547, 564&hyph;565 (1990), which held that ``benign race-conscious measures mandated by Congress *␣*␣* are constitutionally permissible to the extent that they serve important governmental objectives within the power of Congress and are substantially related to achievement of those objectives.'' The rules we adopt also further Congress's objectives, set forth in Section 309(j)(3)(B), of ``promoting economic opportunity and competition and ensuring that new and innovative technologies are readily accessible to the American people by avoiding excessive concentration of licenses and by disseminating licenses among a wide variety of applicants, including small business, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women.'' Each of the steps adopted here is directly related to carrying out Congress's stated objective of promoting economic opportunity by disseminating broadband PCS licenses to a wide variety of applicants, including designated entities. 10. The record clearly demonstrates that the primary impediment to participation by designated entities is lack of access to capital. This impediment arises for small businesses from the higher costs they face in raising capital and for businesses owned by minorities and women from lending discrimination as well. In this regard, it should be noted that although auctions have many beneficial aspects, they threaten to erect another barrier to participation by small businesses and businesses owned by minorities and women by raising the cost of entry into spectrum-based services. 11. Congress has recognized that ``small business concerns, which represent higher degrees of risk in financial markets than do large businesses, are experiencing increased difficulties in obtaining credit.'' 5 Congress further found that women and minorities face particularly severe problems in raising capital. 6 A study of mortgage lending conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston in 1992 illustrates how problems arise. That study showed that in cases in which lenders exercised discretion in deciding whether to make a loan to a borrower who presented some problems (which includes most mortgage applicants), that discretion tended to be exercised in favor of whites. As a result, a minority applicant for a mortgage who was identical in all pertinent respects to a white applicant nevertheless was 60 percent more likely to be denied a mortgage loan. 7 At the same time, discrimination was difficult to show in any particular case, although it emerged clearly when data concerning hundreds of mortgage applications were reviewed. 5 Small Business Credit and Business Opportunity Enhancement Act of 1992, Section 331(a)(3), Pub. L. 102&hyph;366, Sept. 4, 1992. 6 Id . Sections 112(4) and 331(a)(4). 7 Mortgage Lending in Boston: Interpreting HMDA Data, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Working Paper 92&hyph;7 (October 1992). 12. The first measure we adopt to fulfill Congress's mandate that we ensure that designated entities have the opportunity to participate in providing broadband PCS is to reserve the 30 MHz licenses on block C and the 10 MHz licenses on block F, both of which are to be licensed in each of the 493 BTAs, for bidding by entities with annual gross revenues of less than $125 million and total assets of less than $500 million. These limits will exclude many large telecommunications companies from bidding on these two blocks. We will not allow one entity to obtain more than 10 percent ( i.e. , 98) of the licenses on these two blocks. By excluding large companies from bidding in these two blocks and by limiting the total number of licenses that one entity can obtain in these blocks we create numerous opportunities for small entities to become PCS providers and thereby ensure that broadband PMS licenses will be disseminated ``among a wide variety of applicants,'' as required by Section 309(j)(3)(B). 13. Reserving blocks C and F for bidding by relatively small companies will not, by itself, be sufficient to ensure that small businesses and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women have the opportunity to obtain broadband PCS licenses. Under the definition we apply or purposes of this Order, ``small businesses'' are those with gross revenues not exceeding $40 million, and those businesses will be at a disadvantage in competing against companies with gross revenues of as much as $125 million. In addition, businesses owned by members of minority groups and women face discrimination that poses additional obstacles for these firms. Accordingly, we take five related steps within the entrepreneurs' blocks to assist designated entities in attracting the capital necessary to obtain a broadband PCS license.
