It is estimated that the F-104 fighters will continue their service for three to four more years to make up for the inadequacy of combat effectiveness during this period before the F-16 and Mirage-2000 fighters purchased from the United States and France, respectively, are delivered. The following is a report filed by Liu Yu-mei: [Begin recording] [Liu Yu-mei] Separated by a distance of merely 70 plus miles from the mainland, the Air Base in Hsinchu occupies an important strategic position. While undertaking the all-weather air defense mission, fighters at the base are standing by for immediate takeoff within 3, 5, or 15 minutes after orders are received to intercept intruding enemy aircraft, because it will take three to four more years before the F-16 fighters purchased from the United States and the Mirage-2000 fighters purchased from France can be successively delivered. All the F-104 fighters had been grounded due to their long service life but, after their control system's hydraulic pipes and electronic circuits were completely replaced with new ones and after improvements were made in their fuselages, the Air Force has by now completed the inspection and repair of some of the fighers to let them undertake the necessary mission of being on the alert and intercepting any intruding enemy aircraft. The 499th Wing of the Air Force recently conducted a Spring Festival combat readiness exercise at the Hsinchu Air Base. The F-104 fighter squadron under the 2d Wing sent four F-104 fighters whose test and inspection had just been completed plus four (?F-5E/F) and four AT-3 trainers and fighters to conduct combat exercises. Lieutenant General Sun An-kuo, director of the Air Force's General Political Warfare Department, said that Air Force flyers deem it their highest honor to be able to sacrifice their holidays to undertake the air patrol mission. [Sun An-kuo] All Air Force officers and men will make great efforts, such as undertaking the missions of being on the alert, on patrol, and so forth, to protect the safety of the treasured island [Taiwan] during the Spring Festival every year. We wish all the civilians of the country a very good time during the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays. Though we sacrifice our holidays, we feel it is our greatest honor. [Liu] Due to the important strategic position occupied by the Hsinchu Air Base, most of the Mirage-2000 fighters will be deployed there after they are delivered in the future. At present, the Air Force already selected more than a dozen language and technical experts and sent them to France for training to become certified instructors. It is estimated that overall equipment replacement [of the fighters] will be completed by the end of the century. [end recording] The above report was filed by Liu Yu-mei, reporter of the Broadcasting Corporation of China, at the Hsinchu Air Base.
