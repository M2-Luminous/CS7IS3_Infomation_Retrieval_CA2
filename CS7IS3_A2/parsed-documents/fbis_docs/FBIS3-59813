The rocks contain 15,000 tons of uranium, the production of which will begin at the end of the present five-year plan that ends in 1997. He said that work on those locations has been going on for more than 15 years, during which time more than 70 locations were discovered in various parts of the republic. Infrastructures, including plants, research units, and equipment have been installed near those locations during this time. He added that there is no alternative to the utilization of uranium, now that it is being employed in all peaceful aspects of life, including treatments in hospitals, fertilizing agricultural land, operating turbines for electric power generation. Egypt's electricity production does not exceed 60 billion kilowatt hours annually, while a nuclear reactor can produce 600 megawatts with the power of 100 tons of uranium. He said that so far Egypt did not produce any uranium. Uranium production no longer poses a danger after adequate safety measures have been created. He said that the whole world now uses uranium in all fields of life. According to IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] estimates, world oil deposits will run out within 30 years, natural gas within 45 years, and coal within 200 years, while uranium deposits are sufficient to last 500 years on the basis of current utilization. He said that while the search for uranium is being carried out, the Authority has been producing other minerals, such as rutile, which is used in manufacturing steel rods, paints, amd monazite, which used in manufacturing floor materials, and zircon in manufacturing ceramics. He denied that Egypt came under foreign pressure over the production of urnaium, stressing that the IAEA only wants to know the magnitude and quantity of produced uranium and how it is being used.
