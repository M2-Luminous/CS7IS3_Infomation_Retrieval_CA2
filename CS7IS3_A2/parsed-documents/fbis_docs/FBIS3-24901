W. de Klerk said on Thurdsay [3 February]. Speaking at a press conference during the Natiomal Party's [NP] federal conference at Kempton Park, Mr de Klerk said the NP believed in a balance of power as well as the division of power to various levels of government. "The ANC made these concessions reluctantly, but they have a hidden agenda to revert to their old policies of centralism if they get too much power," he said. The NP had refrained from making unachievable promises in its manifesto. "We say we will do what is possible within the bounds of what the country can afford. That is why we say that only if there is economic growth will we be able to build houses, schools and clinics. Because of fatal flaws in the ANC's policies, if they are approved, there will not be economic growth and their policies will not be worth the paper they are written on."
