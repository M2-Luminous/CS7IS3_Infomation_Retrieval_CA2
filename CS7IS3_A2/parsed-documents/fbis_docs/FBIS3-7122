During the meeting, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet said: The Vietnamese Government has always regarded the search for Americans missing in action as a humanitarian issue which is in line with the Vietnamese people's tradition. The Vietnamese Government, past and present, has done its best in searching for MIAs. The Vietnamese Government will continue its best efforts to carry out this task in the days ahead. The government also urges people in localities throughout the country to report to the authorities all information which are of interest to families of the American MIA. The prime minister also said he hoped to receive new, positive, and effective cooperation from the NLPMF in searching for American and Vietnamese soldiers missing in action. He stressed that this is a compensation for the losses experienced by both sides in the past.
