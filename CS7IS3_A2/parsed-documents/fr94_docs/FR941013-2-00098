FR941013-2-00098 FR941013-2-00075 [Docket Nos. 50&hyph;369 and 50&hyph;370] Duke Power Company; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License Nos. NPF&hyph;9 and NPF&hyph;17 issued to Duke Power Company (the licensee) for operation of the McGuire Nuclear Station, Units 1 and 2, located in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. The proposed amendment would correct a technical deficiency existing in the Technical Specifications (TS) which has caused difficulty to plant operations when swapping of the NV pumps was needed in Modes 4, 5, and 6. This amendment is requested to permit flexibility in the operation of the NV pumps during unit startup. McGuire Unit 1 is currently in cycle 10 startup process. Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. Basis for Conclusion That the Amendment Would Not Involve a Significant Increase in the Probability or Consequences of an Accident Previously Evaluated: No significant increase in probability of an accident previously analyzed will occur. While the probability of the mass addition pressure transient will increase slightly, this increase is judged to be insignificant due to the short time of operation with two NV pumps (>15 minutes) and the accompanying TS 3.4.9.3 requirement for two operable NC system PORVs. The consequences of the mass addition pressure transient accident will not increase for the same reasons described above. 2. Basis for Conclusion that the Amendment Would Not Create the Possibility of a New or Different Kind of Accident From Any Previously Analyzed: The accident related to the operation of an additional NV pump is the mass addition pressure transient accident as previously analyzed and documented in the basis for TS 3.1.2.3, 3.1.2.4, and 3.5.3. No other new accident or different kind of accident will be created by allowing two NV pump operation for 15 minutes via this proposed TS Amendment. 3. Basis for Conclusion That the Amendment Would Not Represent A Significant Reduction in A Margin of Safety: The margin of safety regarding the mass addition pressure transient will not be appreciably decreased due to the short duration (>15 minutes) of two NV pump operation combined with the operability of two NC system PORVs required by TS 3.4.9.3 in Mode 4 (>300 â—‹F). Additionally, the margin of safety will be marginally increased as relates to the NC pump seal failure small break LOCA due to the increased assurance of NC pump seal flow during NV train swaps. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the Federal Register a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page number of this Federal Register notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.
