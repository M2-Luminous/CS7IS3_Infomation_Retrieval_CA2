FR940304-2-00109 FR940304-2-00047 [Docket No. AB&hyph;156 (Sub-No. 19X)] Delaware and Hudson Railway Co., Inc.; Abandonment Exemption; in Saratoga and Warren Counties, NY Delaware and Hudson Railway Company, Inc. (D&H), has filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR part 1152 subpart F_Exempt Abandonments to abandon approximately 38.00 miles of rail line known as the Adirondack Branch, between milepost 55.00, at Corinth, and milepost 94.96, at North Creek, in Saratoga and Warren Counties, NY. 1 1 D&H states that it plans to consummate this abandonment on or after February 1, 1994. Because the notice must be filed with the Commission at least 50 days before the abandonment/discontinuance is to be consummated, consummation cannot take place here before April 3, 1994. See 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(2). D&H has certified that: (1) No local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) overhead traffic on the line has been rerouted over other lines; (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a State or local government entity acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period; and (4) the requirements at 49 CFR 1105.7 (environmental), 49 CFR 1105.8 (historic report), 49 CFR 1105.11 (transmittal letter), 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication) and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (notice to governmental agencies) have been met. As a condition to use of this exemption, any employee adversely affected by the abandonment shall be protected under Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen, 360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately protects affected employees, a petition for partial revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. Provided no formal expressions of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) have been received, this exemption will be effective on April 3, 1994, unless stayed pending reconsideration. Petitions to stay that do not involve environmental issues, 2 formal expressions of intent to file an OFA under 49 CFR 1152.27(c)(2), 3 and trail use/rail banking statements under 49 CFR 1152.29 4 must be filed by March 14, 1994. Petitions to reopen or requests for public use conditions under 49 CFR 1152.28 must be filed by March 24, 1994, with: Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. 2 A stay will be routinely issued by the Commission in those proceedings where an informed decision on environmental issues (whether raised by a party or by the Commission's Section of Environmental Analysis in its independent investigation) cannot be made prior to the effective date of the notice of exemption. See Exemption of Out-of-Service Rail Lines, 5 I.C.C.2d 377 (1989). Any entity seeking a stay involving environmental concerns is encouraged to file its request as soon as possible in order to permit the Commission to review and act on the request before the effective date of this exemption. 3 See Exempt. of Rail Abandonment_Offers of Finan. Assist., 4 I.C.C.2d 164 (1987). 4 The Commission will accept a late-filed trail use request as long as it retains jurisdiction to do so. A copy of any petition filed with the Commission should be sent to applicant's representative: Timothy G. Mulcahy, Esq., CP Legal Services, P.O. Box 8002, 200 Clifton Corporate Parkway, Clifton Park, NY 12065. If the notice of exemption contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio. D&H has filed an environmental report which addresses the abandonment's effect, if any, on the environment or historic resources. The Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) will issue an environmental assessment (EA) by March 9, 1994. Interested persons may obtain a copy of the EA from SEA by writing to SEA (Room 3219, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423) or by calling Elaine Kaiser, Chief of SEA, at (202) 927&hyph;6248. Comments on environmental and historic preservation matters must be filed within 15 days after the EA is available to the public. Environmental, historic preservation, public use, or trail use/rail banking conditions will be imposed, where appropriate, in a subsequent decision. Decided: February 24, 1994. By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings. Sidney L. Strickland, Jr., Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;4984 Filed 3&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7035&hyph;01&hyph;P
