The British Ambassador never looked particularly comfortable surrounded by young women brandishing microphones just centimetres from his nose but Sir Robin says he eventually became "very fond" of his interrogators. "I have a lot of admiration for them, it is not an easy job, spending all that time outside the embassy trying to get me to say something," Sir Robin said, in the relatively tranquil surroundings of the palatial home he will vacate at the end of next month after three turbulent years as Her Majesty's ambassador to the People's Republic of China. The sight of Sir Robin besieged by reporters will be perhaps one of the most lasting images of his tenure in Beijing, a time which saw Sino-British relations fall to their lowest point in decades and Sir Robin's health suffer noticeably as a result. After six months of fruitless negotiations on the political future of Hong Kong, he was forced to return to London for an operation on his back, which left him out of action for much of the winter. But despite all the tensions and frustrations of the last three years, Sir Robin says he has no regrets about taking up one of the most difficult jobs in the British Foreign Service. "I was aware that the last few years of British rule in Hong Kong were likely to be difficult but even if I knew the precise nature of the problem that would not have affected my decision to come here," he said. "It is a job I have always wanted to do. My first posting after learning Chinese was in Beijing [in 1960] and so it has been a natural aspiration for me to do the top job here." Sir Robin said that he hoped to return to China as a private citizen after his retirement from the Foreign Office, and was looking for employment in a business which could keep him "engaged" with the mainland and Hong Kong, where he served as political adviser to the Governor from 1981 to 1985. "I have a personal interest in the culture and the way of life," he said. "I also have a great interest and affection for Hong Kong." However, Sir Robin will not be offering his services to the British Government as an "elder statesman" or adviser on China policy. "We do not have the same system as in China and Japan, once you retire, you retire," he said. "I do not expect to offer advice or to be asked for advice. Yesterday's ambassador is the least qualified to give advice." Asked if this meant he thinks his outspoken predecessor, Sir Percy Cradock, should refrain from his very public criticism of the government's current policy on Hong Kong and China, Sir Robin said: "I am not going to make any public comment on Sir Percy, who is a good friend and respected colleague." The only advice Sir Robin said he would give his successor, Len Appleyard, would be to stress the need for "patience and persistence" and "to respect but not to be cowed by the Chinese". Advice, he says he has "tried" to live up to himself, although he declined to say if he thought he had actually succeeded. Sir Robin was rather more forthright in his comments on the Chinese Government and, in particular, the failure to reach an agreement on the arrangements for the 1994 and 1995 elections in Hong Kong. "There was insufficient willingness to compromise, especially on the Chinese side," he said. "They had determined that Governor (Chris) Patten's proposals violated the three principles (adherence to the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Basic Law, and the relevant agreements and understandings reached between the two sides) and they got caught up in their own rhetoric. "It would not have been possible to reach an agreement unless we had done what the Chinese wanted and abandoned our position, but we would have then had to measure the Chinese proposals against the need for open and fair elections in Hong Kong. Even if we had done that, the proposals would still have to have been passed by Legco [the Legislative Council], something the Chinese did not understand." Sir Robin said his biggest disappointment in the talks was his failure to convince the Chinese that Britain did not have any ulterior motive in pushing for greater democracy in Hong Kong and engaging in massive infrastructure projects, such as the new airport. "There was this suspicion and mistrust on the Chinese side that we wanted to run away with the money," he said. "That is not remotely true. Britain just wants the best for the people of Hong Kong." The ambassador was quick to point out however that he did not consider his chief interlocutor in the Sino-British talks, Vice- Foreign Minister Jian Enzhu, to be naturally hostile or suspicious towards Britain. Mr Jiang, he said, was a "skilled and highly sophisticated diplomat," as was the director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Lu Ping, but the older leaders, who determine Hong Kong policy, had their "thoughts conditioned by the civil war, the anti-Japanese war, and the Korean War and that obviously affected their view of Britain in Hong Kong". Nevertheless, Sir Robin expressed confidence that China would not attempt to mould Hong Kong in its own image after the handover in 1997; if anything, he said, the reverse would be true. While Hong Kong has dominated his three years as ambassador, Sir Robin was also required to implement that famous quote from Prime Minister John Major in Beijing three years ago that the British Government would apply "unrelenting and unremitting" pressure on China's human rights. Unrelenting and unremitting pressure has never really been Sir Robin's style and while he claims Britain has a "close and strong interest" in China's human rights, nobody could say the ambassador has been ramming the subject down the throats of Chinese Government officials. Imprisoned Ming Pao journalist, Xi Yang, was a case in point where Sir Robin raised the issue with the Chinese authorities but did not pursue the matter with quite the vigor that perhaps Mr Major's statement required of him. Sir Robin's hands were tied to a certain extent by the row over Hong Kong but, even in the best of circumstances, it is doubtful he would have taken a higher profile on human rights. Instead, Sir Robin emphasises the achievements of British trade and industry in moving into the China market over the last three years, pointing out that Britain's exports to China increased by 72 percent last year over 1992 but ignoring the fact that Britain still had a 587 million Pound (about HK$6.9 billion) trade deficit with the mainland at the end of 1993. In all, Sir Robin may not have a lot to shout about as he leaves Beijing but at least the storm over Hong Kong's political future has subsided for a while, giving the outgoing ambassador hope that when Britain finally relinquishes control of the territory on June 30, 1997, the handover will be done in "an atmosphere of cooperation and not recrimination".
