The executive branch has requested that tax exemptions be established on the basis of Bs750,000. However, the Special Powers Act cites exemptions for school, medical, and dental expenses, as well as for mortgage interest on principal residences, also to the tune of Bs5 million. Both Congress and the finance minister agree with the latter exemptions. [Begin Sosa recording] They have established tax exemptions of up to 5,000 tax units, which means Bs5 million on interest for principal residences. I agree with this. They have also established a tax exemption for house rentals that I believe is exaggerated as it amounts to Bs5 million. This will eventually have to be included in a law. But we will have to obey the terms of the Special Powers Act. I do believe that Congress could modify this in the future, preferably before the year ends, because a Bs5 million per annum tax exemption for house rentals seems exaggerated to me. [end recording] Minister Sosa added that he was at Miraflores to attend a meeting of the economic cabinet with President Rafael Caldera that would establish a schedule for implementing the Special Powers Act.
