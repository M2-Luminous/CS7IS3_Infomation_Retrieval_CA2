FR940513-1-00093 FR940513-1-00019 The General Counsel, Department of Commerce, certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration that this proposed rule, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The only impact will be on individual native Alaskan residents of the Pribilof Islands due to revision of the schedule for estimating fur seal harvest levels from an annual estimate to an estimate applicable to a 3-year period. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared.

This discussion will include an assessment of factors and conditions on St. Paul and St. George Islands that influence the need by Pribilof Aleuts to take seals for subsistence uses and an assessment of any changes to those conditions indicating that the number of seals that may be taken for subsistence each year should be made higher or lower.
