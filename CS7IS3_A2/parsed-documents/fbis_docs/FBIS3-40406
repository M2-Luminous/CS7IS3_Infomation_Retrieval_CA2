As a result, following the trend in the national and export markets, the French defense industry, which accounted for 330,000 direct and indirect jobs at the start of 1993, is expected to lose between 58,000 and 130,000 direct and indirect jobs by 1997. Faced with these new requirements, the report states that France will not be able to remain self-sufficient in equipment development and will have to enter into cooperation agreements with its European partners. In this respect, the report identifies 24 critical technologies which it divides into three categories: those that need to be totally independent at French or European level and whose proliferation would constitute a risk; those that have intermediate priority; and those technologies whose specifically dual-purpose nature (civil and military) makes them less sensitive. Creating a Budget for the Acquisition of Foreign Technologies Apart from nuclear technology, the first category includes "micro- and nanoelectronic components for equipment and subassemblies, navigation equipment, detection and signal processing equipment, signature-recognition expertise, and stealth-related technology, including knowhow in complex systems." The intermediate priority technologies group includes "modular electronic architecture, optical and optronic devices, telecommunications hardware and networks, advanced computer hardware, artificial intelligence and neural networks, software engineering, and advanced calculating codes." Finally, the less sensitive, dual-purpose technologies include production software and industrial production systems, and the technologies and hardware implemented in the security of equipment and weapons systems. The report specifically recommends that the amount of credits for basic defense research should be maintained at present levels or even increased, and suggests the additional creation of a budget earmarked for the evaluation and acquisition of foreign technologies.
