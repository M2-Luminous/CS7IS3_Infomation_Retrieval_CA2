The State Commission for Restructuring the Economy and the State Economic and Trade Commission immediately decided to select around 100 state-owned enterprises and designate them as experimental units for establishing a modern enterprise system. In the following two months or so, two kinds of situations arose in some enterprises: First, a small number of enterprises volunteered for the work, wanted to become targets of experiment, and tried every means to stand in the forefront of deep-going enterprise reform. Second, a considerable number of enterprises held that, since the establishment of a modern enterprise system was a huge and difficult project which dealt with a wide range of issues, they could not hastily "break a new path" without enough meditation and certainly of success. Therefore, they took no action in enterprise reform and wholeheartedly waited for popularization of experimental units' experience. Such a situation posed a question: What do most enterprises do when only a very small number of enterprises are operated as experimental units in the process of establishing a modern enterprise system? The Decision Pointed Out Clearly: Do Not Stand By Unconcerned The proposal of establishing a modern enterprise system marks a new stage of enterprise reform in our country and embodies improvement of the overall standard of enterprise reform. The establishment of a modern enterprise system is a social and economic systematic project which is very rich in content and interrelated. It is very difficult to achieve the desired results and accomplish the set goal if we, as in the past, make a breakthrough in a single area. The Decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Central CPC Committee explicitly pointed out: "To establish a modern enterprise system is an arduous and complicated undertaking. It requires the accumulation of experience and creation of the necessary conditions and should be conducted step by step. It is now necessary to continue to implement the Law Concerning Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People and Regulations on Changing the Management Mechanism of Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People, and to unreservedly extend to the enterprises the various rights and responsibilities pertaining to their own management. It is necessary to strengthen supervision and control over the state-owned assets possessed by enterprises and reach the aim of maintaining and increasing the value of state-owned assets. It is necessary to quicken the pace of change of the management mechanism and readjustment of the organizational structure of state-owned enterprises. Unwarranted pooling of funds, arbitrary requisitions of donations, and exaction of fees from enterprises must be resolutely stopped. It is necessary to reduce the financial burden the enterprises have to bear in supporting social undertakings. It is necessary to, step by step, make an inventory of and check the stockpiles and capital of enterprises, define the property rights, clarify debts receivable and debts payable, evaluate the assets to verify the amount possessed by the enterprise legal entities. It is necessary to create conditions in all respects for state-owned enterprises to shift steadily to the modern enterprise system." The content of this part of the decision explicitly told us: At a time when a small number of enterprises are operated as experimental units, most enterprises have no reason to stand by unconcerned, but should rather, as always, accomplish the work of enterprise reform in various respects. Of course, some demands of the Decision are set on government departments at all levels. For example, to make enterprises be truly responsible for their own management decisions, prevent the "three unreasonables," and lighten social burdens shouldered by state-owned enterprises, and all these should be mainly handled by them. However, the course of deepening enterprise reform should be, of course, mainly completed by enterprises themselves. Any kind of pause and break cannot shorten the course of reform, but rather expends precious time to no avail. As a matter of fact, as far as this reporter understands, many leading organs of provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions and some industrial departments of the state have a very clear response to the question of "what do most enterprises do when a small number of enterprises are operated as experimental units." For example, at the meeting of leading cadres of national railways held in mid-January, Minister of Railways Han Zhubin said when talking about the issue of establishing a modern enterprise system: At present, we must mainly pay attention to three things -- bringing into effect the Regulations and the Implementation Method for Changing the Management Mechanism of Railway Enterprises; laying a good foundation and mainly paying close attention to the work of making an inventory of and check of the stockpiles and capital, defining the property rights, clarifying debts receivable and debts payable, and evaluating the assets; and setting up some units to experiment with the corporate system, gaining experience, avoiding formalism, and never rushing headlong to mass action. In another example, at the national metallurgical work meeting held in early January, Minister of Metallurgical Industry Liu Qi pointed out when planning the work of deepening enterprise reform: "At present, we must vigorously make all kinds of preparations and create conditions for implementing a modern enterprise system." He said that it was necessary to continue to implement the Regulations, to make an inventory of and check of the stockpiles and capital of enterprises, and select a dozen large iron and steel enterprises to make experiments in supervising their state-owned assets. After that, he particularly stressed that we must learn from the experience of such enterprises as Baoshan Iron and Steel Works and Wuhan Iron and Steel Works, fully implement the reform of internal enterprise structure, sever links with units and personnel not related to iron and steel production, establish a modernized enterprise management system, and deepen the reform of the personnel, labor, and wage systems in enterprises.... The wishes to try as soon as possible to work according to the experience of experimental units are understandable, but it is incorrect if we fail to implement enterprise reform even when we can do so. Inspiration From the Experience of Wuhan Iron and Steel Works: Stepping on the Gangplank Before We Board a Ship As far as the establishment of a modern enterprise system is concerned, some cadres commended it but also commented: "Why did we do it if we had known it beforehand?" The implication was that: Every effort in enterprise reform in the last 15 years was a sheer waste, just like lighting a candle for a blind person! Such an understanding is incorrect because the practice of enterprise reform is a continuous process by stages. Over the past 15 years, enterprise reform underwent different stages, including the stage of delegating power to lower levels and letting them retain a portion of profits, substituting two-step taxation for the delivery of profits to the state, implementing the contracted management responsibility system, and changing the enterprise management system. Every step of reform not only offered experience but also laid the foundation for the next step of reform, and every new reform measure was proposed in light of the focal points and difficulties in the previous stage of reform. We can say that the basis for establishing a modern enterprise system does not exist without the success of reform in the last decade or so, and that we would not introduce the concept of establishing a modern enterprise system without the exploration of reform practice in the past. In addition, some comrades said: Since the Central Party Committee has set the establishment of a modern enterprise system as the reform orientation of state-own enterprises, why cannot we wait patiently for some time and achieve our goal in one move by simply following the experience of experimental units to be introduced? Is such an idea correct? Let us look at the reform practice of Wuhan Iron and Steel Works first. On 7 January 1994, Liu Benren, president of Wuhan Iron and Steel Works, addressed the national metallurgical work meeting and briefed attendants on their decision to spend two years to reform the enterprise management system: Originally, there were more than 120,000 staff and workers in Wuhan Iron and Steel Works but the annual output of iron and steel was only around 5 million metric tons and the per capita output was merely 40 metric tons, which was far lower than the advanced international standard. The main reason was to plunge all its strength into work irrespective of the size of production, thus leading to great waste of labor force, equipment, and technological resources. From August 1992 onwards, Wuhan Iron and Steel Works drew on the experience of Baoshan Iron and Steel Works and started reforming the management system with emphasis on strengthening the main body and severing links with departments not related to iron and steel production. Up to the end of last year, more than 70,000 staff and workers left the iron and steel profession and successively formed "four large corporations" and "four small companies" to march to the domestic and international markets. Last year, the output of Wuhan Iron and Steel Works was 5.05 million metric tons, registering an increase of 6.12 percent over that of the previous year. However, the per capita output of iron and steel increased from 40 to 93.4 metric tons, sales earnings and profits and taxes realized increased 30.67 percent and 34.45 percent compared with that of the previous year, and export exchange earnings exceeded $110 million, thus putting an end to the situation of stagnation for years. Afterwards, this reporter asked President Liu Benren about the relationship between reform of the enterprise management system and the establishment of a modern enterprise system. He presented a brilliant viewpoint after a little thought: "Clearly defined property rights, as well as the rights and responsibilities of enterprises, separation of government administration and enterprise management, and scientific management are characteristics of a modern enterprise system. If we say that the first three characteristics can only be realized by relying on the coordination of government departments, `scientific management' must be achieved in a practical manner by relying on enterprises themselves. In particular, under the situation which Hubei Province and the Ministry of Metallurgy consent to the joint-stock transformation of Wuhan Iron and Steel Works, we have decided to take the initiative to reform the enterprise management system, and the goal is precisely to come close to a modern enterprise system as soon as possible." Being positive and taking the initiative without relying on others and without delay, proceeding from the real conditions of one's own enterprise to select the breakthrough point for deepening reform, and trying by every possible means to come close to a modern enterprise system as soon as possible -- these are precisely what are inspired by the experience of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Works. If expressed in a more symbolic description, we must "step on the gangplank before we board a ship." Here, the "ship" refers to the modern enterprise system and the "gangplank" refers to the five aspects clearly pointed out by the Decision which we should accomplish. It is a gradual process to establish a modern enterprise system in China, during which we have to shoulder heavy responsibilities and can never achieve our goal in one step. We must, in the first place, work in a down-to-earth manner, be persistent and dauntless, and march forward courageously. The more down-to-earth and comprehensive we do our work at early stages, the less time we spend in going through such a historical course.
