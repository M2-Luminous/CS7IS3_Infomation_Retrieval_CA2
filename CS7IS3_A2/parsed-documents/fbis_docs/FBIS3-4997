In its schedule that was turned in late last month, the United States offered to cut overall duties on certain items rather than abolishing them as promised in the Uruguay Round negotiations, Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Kim Chol-su said Thursday. Seoul has acquired a copy of the U.S. schedule and will finish analyzing it in a day or two, he said. If certain revisions are deemed to affect Korean exports adversely, Seoul will act accordingly, the trade minister said, strongly hinting at changes in Korea's commitment to the UR pact. Korea may eliminate some items on which it had offered to abolish duties and hand in the revised version, or consult with the European Union, Japan and other countries before submitting its amended list, he said. Assistant Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Chang Suk-hwan pointed out that the United States made fewer tariff concessions than planned because Japan decided not to scrap tariffs on wood, leather and non-ferrous products. Therefore, he said, Washington and Tokyo may strike a deal before April, when the UR accord concluded in December is due to be signed and sealed. Korea will also wait and see how other countries respond to the U.S. schedule before making a decision, Chang said. The negotiations on the non-tariffication provision are just a small part of the UR tariffication sector and the agreement on under-33-percent tariff cuts on industrial goods is effective, he explained. Although there may be slight friction over the zero-tariff efforts, it is unlikely to impede the signing of the UR agreement on April 5, he said. He said the U.S. revisions are not all harmful to Korean exports, adding that for some items they may even be advantageous.
