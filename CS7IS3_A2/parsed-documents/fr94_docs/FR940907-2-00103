There are approximately 800 registered transfer agents subject to the rule's recordkeeping requirements. The average burden for each transfer agent is approximately 40 hours annually, for a total annual burden of 32,000 hours. Rule 17f&hyph;1(b) requires reporting institutions to register with the Commission or its designee to participate in the Lost and Stolen Securities Program. Approximately 600 respondents incur an average of one-half burden hour annually to comply with this rule, for a total annual burden of 300 hours. Rule 17f&hyph;1(c) and Form X&hyph;17F&hyph;1A require reporting institutions to report lost, stolen, missing, and counterfeit securities to a centralized database. Approximately 23,000 reporting institutions file approximately 667,000 Forms X&hyph;17F&hyph;1A. The Commission estimates that the average burden for each form is 5 minutes, resulting in a total annual burden of 55,583 hours. Rules 17h&hyph;1T and 17h&hyph;2T impose reporting and recordkeeping requirements on broker-dealers that are associated with other entities, other than natural persons. Approximately 250 broker-dealers are subject to the rules. It is estimated that the average burden for each firm is approximately 14 hours annually, or a cumulative burden of 3,500 hours.
