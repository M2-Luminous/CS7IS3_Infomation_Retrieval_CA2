FR941219-2-00143 FR941219-2-00078 6. OBRA amended the Code by, among other things, enacting Section 848 thereof. Section 848 changed how a life insurance company must compute its itemized deductions from gross income for federal income tax purposes. Section 848 requires an insurance company to capitalize and amortize, over a period of ten years, part of the company's general expenses for the current year. Under prior law, these general expenses were deductible in full from the current year's gross income. 7. The amount of deductions that must be capitalized and amortized over ten years, rather than deducted in the year incurred, is based on ``net premiums'' received in connection with certain types of insurance contracts. Section 848 of the Code defines ``net premium'' for a type of contract as gross premiums received by the insurance company on the contracts minus return premiums and premiums paid by the insurance company for reinsurance of its obligations under such contracts. Applicants state that the effect of Section 848 is to accelerate the realization of income from insurance contracts covered by that Section, and, accordingly, the payment of taxes on the income generated by those contracts. 8. The amount of general deductions that must be capitalized depends upon the type of contract to which the premiums received relate and varies according to a schedule set forth in Section 848. Applicants represent that the Contracts are ``specified insurance contracts'' that fall into the category of life insurance contracts, and, under Section 848, 7.7% of the year's net premiums received must be capitalized and amortized. 9. Applicants represent that the increased tax burden resulting from Section 848 may be quantified as follows. For each $10,000 of net premiums received under the Contracts in a given year, Section 848 requires FKLA to capitalize $770 (7.7% of $10,000) and $38.50 of this $770 may be deducted in the current year. This leaves $731.50 ($770 minus $38.50) subject to taxation at the corporate tax rate of 35% which results in FKLA owing $256.03 (.35 Ã— $731.50) more in taxes for the current year than would have been owed prior to OBRA. This current increase in federal income tax will be partially offset by deductions that will be allowed during the next ten years as a result of amortizing the remainder of the $770 ($77 in each of the following nine years and $38.50 in the tenth year). 10. In FKLA's business judgment, a discount rate of 8% is appropriate for use in calculating the present value of the increased future tax deductions resulting from the amortization described above. Applicants state that FKLA seeks an after tax rate of return on the investment of its capital in excess of 15%. To the extent that capital must be used by FKLA to meets its increased federal tax burden under Section 848 resulting from the receipt of premiums, such capital is not available to FKLA for investment. Thus, Applicants argue, the cost of capital used to satisfy FKLA's increased federal income tax burden under Section 848 is, in essence, FKLA's after tax rate of return on capital; and, accordingly, the rate of return on capital is appropriate for use in this present value calculation. To the extent that the 8% discount rate is lower than FKLA's actual targeted rate of return, Applicants submit that a measure of comfort is provided that the calculation of FKLA's increased tax burden attributable to the receipt of premiums will continue to be reasonable over time, even if the corporate tax rate applicable to FKLA is reduced, or its targeted rate of return is lowered. 11. In determining the after tax rate of return used in arriving at this discount rate, Applicants state that a number of factors were considered, including: market interest rates; FKLA's anticipated long term growth rate; the risk level for this type of business; inflation; and available information about the rates of return obtained by other life insurance companies. FKLA represents that such factors are appropriate factors to consider in determining FKLA's cost of capital. Applicants state that FKLA first projects its future growth rate based on the anticipated sales, the current interest rates, the inflation rate, acceptable risk levels, the amount of capital that FKLA can provide to support such growth, and industry practice. FKLA then uses the anticipated growth rate and the other factors enumerated above to set a rate of return on capital that equals or exceeds this rate of growth. Of these other factors, market interest rates, the acceptable risk levels and the inflation rate receive significantly more weight than information about the rates of return obtained by other companies.
