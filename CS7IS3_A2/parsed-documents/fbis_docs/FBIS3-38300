There will be "the most modern locations for industry some time in the future" in eastern Germany, Kohl said in a speech to the annual conference of the National Governors' Association in Washington, the text of which was released in Bonn. He said there will be "very interesting opportunities" there for the American states. Three years after German unification "the worst is behind" eastern Germany, the chancellor stressed. Even now investment per head of population is higher than in western Germany. This shows that a positive development has started despite the difficult catching up process. Kohl, who was the first foreign head of state to speak at the governors' conference, also stressed that Germany wants to further expand the transatlantic partnership with the United States. This is as vitally significant for Germany as European political union. Efforts for an independent European security policy and defense complement and strengthen NATO and will also lead to less of a burden being placed on the United States. The chancellor added that the "world's hopes and expectations" are directed toward the United States. Securing democracy and the market economy in the part of Europe which used to be communist is "the great task of the future" for America, Germany, and their partners. He also agreed with President Bill Clinton that it is a matter of helping Russia and the other states undergoing reform along the path to stable democracy "by combining our forces." Otherwise those states will have to pay too high a price themselves.
