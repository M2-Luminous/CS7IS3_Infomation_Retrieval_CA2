In statements made to MENA, the Lebanese defense minister said that the Lebanese Army has taken all the necessary measures to confront such Israeli attacks, which are expected at any time. In his statements, Dallul said that Israel always tends to exacerbate the situation in south Lebanon before every round of talks. Israel will try this time to steal the limelight from the U.S.-Syrian meeting, which is important in determining the future of the comprehensive and just peace in the region, Muhsin Dallul added. Dallul's statements come in response to remarks made by Uri Lubrani, coordinator of the Israeli Government's activities in south Lebanon. Lubrani expects the Lebanese resistance to increase its operations during the next few days. According to security reports from the south and western al-Biqa', the Islamic resistance forces have been placed on a state of maximum alert as a precaution against any Israeli attacks on its positions in the Lebanese towns and villages adjacent to the occupied border strip. In his statements to MENA, the Lebanese defense minister said that Lebanon believes that the Arab defense ministers should meet as soon as possible to reassess the military situation in light of recent developments. Dallul said that Lebanon will welcome an invitation by Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid to convene this meeting.
