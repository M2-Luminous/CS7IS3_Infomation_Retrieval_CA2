The current session has examined and adopted the work report made by Vice Chairman Lhamin Soinam Lhunzhub on behalf of the Standing Committee of the Tibet Regional CPPCC Committee. Members of the regional CPPCC committee have attended the second session of the sixth regional people's congress as observers, and heard the government work report by Chairman Gyaincain Norbu and other important reports. Through serious discussions, members of the regional CPPCC committee have further unified their thinking, raised their common understanding, heightened their spirit, and clearly understood various goals. In a highly responsible spirit, members have expressed many suitable opinions on reform, opening up, economic construction, and other important issues related to the vital interests of the broad masses of people. Their suggestions will certainly promote various tasks of this region in a positive manner. This year will be a crucial one for carrying out an all-around reform, achieving breakthroughs, and accelerating the establishment of a socialist market economic structure. In his government work report, Chairman Gyaincain Norbu has clearly explained the guiding principles for promoting the tasks of economic construction and deepening reform. We should see that the accomplishment of those tasks will have a very important bearing on fully implementing the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Fifth Enlarged Plenary Meeting of the Fourth Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee, promoting economic development and social progress in this region and maintaining political stability. We should also see that the tasks facing us are very arduous and there are still many problems and difficulties on our road of advance. Fellow members and comrades, the CPPCC is an important organization of our country in promoting multiparty cooperation and political consultation, and shoulders an important mission. The party's overall policy of seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability has fully embodied Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thinking for development and represents the fundamental interests of people of all nationalities in the whole country. The CPPCC organizations at various levels and all CPPCC members must seriously study and firmly implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC National Congress and the fifth Enlarged Plenary Meeting of the Fourth Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee, emancipate their minds, further eliminate the old ideology and concept formed under the system of the planned economy, change their ways of thinking, use a new concept and new way compatible to a socialist market economy to guide our work, and constantly enhance our understanding in promoting reform, development, and stability. In discussing major affairs in the autonomous region, CPPCC members must take the entire national and regional situation into consideration and see the local and actual problems, and also take both long-term fundamental interests and the current measures into consideration. We should promote reform and development and at the same time maintain stability. We should strive to take part in the building of the two civilizations, and study and put forward suggestions and opinions for solving new contradictions and problems emerging in the course of reform. We should use the fruitful work of the CPPCC to unite various mass organizations and people of various nationalities on various fronts. We should give full play to all positive factors, turn negative factors into positive one, and unswervingly support the government's measures to deepen reform. Fellow members, the realization of national progress and people's prosperity is the common wish of people of various nationalities in this region. We have already set major policies and understand our tasks. Now the key is to implement those policies and tasks. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line and under the leadership of the Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee, we should closely unite around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core; seriously implement the guidelines of the current session; heighten our spirit; work with concerted efforts; struggle hard; and make greater contributions to creating a new situation for promoting reform, development, and stability in this region and to raising our work of taking part in and providing consultative service for government affairs to a new level! I wish fellow members and all comrades good health and smooth progress in their work.
