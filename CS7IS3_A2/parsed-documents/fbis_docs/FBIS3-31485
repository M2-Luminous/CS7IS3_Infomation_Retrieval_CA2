The investigation in the case has been going on for 13 years now, with evidence on record already filling two rooms. Two years ago the Bulgarian investigating magistrates were allowed access to the archives and the information database of the National Intelligence Service, the Security Service, the Military Intelligence Service and the Military Counterintelligence Service, i.e. all the secret services which theoretically could have been involved in some way or another in the assassination attempt. "We have found no evidence whatsoever of some Bulgarian connection in the assassination attempt," Mr. Andreev said. According to him, the investigative proceedings have been suspended because Bulgaria requested the Italian and Turkish investigative authorities to give it access to the materials related to Oral Celik's extradition to Italy. Visiting Bulgaria in January this year, the director of Italy's Central Investigation Magistracy, Dr. Simone, was asked to hand over the records of the investigation reopened in Italy. The case can be closed only after the Bulgarian investigating magistrates are acquainted with those documents, the news conference was told.
