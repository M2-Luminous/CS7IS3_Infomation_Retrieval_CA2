Since North Korea has not established diplomatic relations with Germany, it has this mission, instead of an embassy, under the pretext of protecting its national interests. However, this, in fact, is a base of secret intelligence operations, according to a report. Correspondent Yi Myong-ku reports from Berlin. [Yi Myong-ku] The North Korean Office for the Protection of National Interests occupies part of the former North Korean Embassy in the former East Germany. The German intelligence agency assumes that this is a base of the North Korean secret intelligence agency, and that North Korean officials are using this place to procure North Korea's necessities of life and foreign currency, newspaper DER TAGESSPIEGEL recently reported. North Korea also obtains military technology through this interest mission and buys technologically complex machinery and equipment and sends them to North Korea via diplomatic pouch. At one time, they also purchased helicopter parts, automatic firearms, and ammunition, said DER TAGESSPIEGEL. For the transport of these goods, North Korea uses a Korean civil airliner which flies to Berlin, the only place the airliner flies in the West. An official from the German Customs says he often receives information that the North Korean airliner, with only 30 passengers occupying its 165 seats, is loaded with profit-making goods, including narcotics and hallucinogenic drugs.
