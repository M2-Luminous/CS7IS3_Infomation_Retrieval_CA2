In separate action that day, large-calibre artillery groups and heavily-armed bandits of the puppet army took firing positions in Cholwon County, South Korean Kangwon Province, Phaju and Ryonchon Counties, Kyonggi Province, and kicked up a war frenzy, firing over 60 105mm shells and 1,000 large-calibre machinegun bullets into spots near the Demilitarized Zone along the Military Demarcation Line. On the same day, the puppets deployed scores of large-calibre guns in Cholwon County, South Korean Kangwon Province, and brought some 500 armed bandits into areas near Rinje and Ryonchon Counties.
