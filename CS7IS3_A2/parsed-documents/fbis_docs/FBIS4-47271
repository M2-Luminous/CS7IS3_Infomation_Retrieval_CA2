In the present work additional parameters for this formula were derived for the activation energy of the chemosorption of (CH[.sub]3[/])[.sub]3[/]SiX silanes and siloxanes on silica surface. The activation energy of electrophilic substitution of a hydrogen atom from the silanol groups of the surface by these compounds decreases with lowering strength of the Si-X bond and increasing inductive constant of the substituent X, as well as with decreasing enthalpy of reaction.
