FR941202-0-00125 FR941202-0-00012 The states of New Jersey, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Utah were selected to participate in the program because they are representative of various geographic and population characteristics. During the course of the year-long study in each state, over 30,000 random drug tests were conducted. Minnesota and New Jersey combined probable cause testing with requests for voluntary urine samples. In some states, drivers could refuse to submit to the drug tests without sanction. The percent positive may also be understated because drivers could have avoided the testing site if they were aware of the testing through communications on CB radios or other informal information networks. The results were as follows: Random Drug Testing Results In Four Pilot Program States 1Drug Testing 1NE 1UT 1MN 1NJ 1Total Specimens Evaluated 7,496 10,131 5,729 7,556 30,912 Refusals 32 55 359 859 1,305 Percent Refused 0.43% 0.54% 5.9% 10.2% 4.1% Positive Specimens 271 410 269 460 1,410 Percent Positive 3.6% 4.0% 4.7% 6.1% 4.6% The study notes that positive rates for employer-based random drug testing programs that were inspected as a part of normal safety reviews were 2.5 percent for fiscal year 1992, and 3.11 percent for the first six months of fiscal year 1993.
