Developing the Information Industry, Establishing a National Economic Information Network, and Promoting Information Services for the Economy and Society Are Badly Needed for China's Modernization Drive and Are a Great Trend in the World's Economic and Technological Development The world's economic development is changing from industrialization to an information world. As the pillar for the information science, the electronics industry has become a strategic industry in the world today. Judging from developed countries' course of development over the past decades, the electronics industry has played a very crucial role in promoting technological progress, carrying out industrial reform, enhancing labor productivity, and speeding economic development, in the readjustment of the economic structure, and in the course of developing human civilizations and promoting social progress. The speedy development of electronic technology, especially software and information services, has formed the electronic information industry -- represented by microelectronics, and computer, communications, and software technology -- and continues to cause drastic changes in society, the economy, and people's lifestyles. The CPC Central Committee and the State Council attach great importance to the development of China's information services. Not long ago, the State Council officially set up the National Joint Conference on Economic Information to organize and plan the development of China's economic information services. With the direct concern of the top party and state leadership, it has been decided to implement the "Three Golden Projects" (Golden Bridge, Golden Pass, and Golden Card Projects), thus placing the quickening of China's economic information services high on the agenda. This is a major policy decision for China's modernization and is a strategic measure for achieving the second- and third-step goals of national economic development. Promoting information services and integrating them with industrialization will greatly enhance the quality of China's national economy and will help change the economy from an extensive one to an efficient one. China's current economy is still in a high-consumption, low-efficiency, and extensive pattern of development. Energy consumption and material consumption per unit of output value are three to five times that of developed countries, the energy utilization rate is 30 percent, and its total personnel labor productivity is merely some 5 percent that of developed countries. Fully developing and utilizing information resources and information technology, and putting economic development onto the track of relying on technological progress can greatly enhance the utilization rate of material resources and exceedingly enhance the added value of production and labor productivity, as well as bringing into full play the role of "science and technology as a primary productive force." Promoting information services is an immediate task for establishing and perfecting China's socialist market economy system and improving macroscopic regulation and control. The backwardness of China's information technology means makes it impossible to promptly, accurately, and completely collect, transmit, and comprehensively process various kinds of economic information, including information for banking, finance, revenue, foreign trade, domestic trade, and industrial and agricultural production. This seriously hinders the State Council and governments at all levels in promptly making macroscopic policy decisions and carrying out effective macroscopic regulation and control, and causes difficulties for China in its international economic exchanges. The major information system projects and the basic information facilities which leaders of the State Council are personally in charge of are intended to resolve this salient contradiction at an early date. Promoting information services and accelerating the development of the information industry will promote the modernization of China's industrial structure and of the entire national economy. Today, social and economic development increasingly depends on information resources, information technology, and the information industry. The information industry is a leading industry for the modern economy. Its importance is reflected not only by its daily increasing output value in the national economy, but all the more by its "invigorating," "arousing," and "doubling" effects on the entire national economy. It has become the driving force for the rapid growth of the modern national economy. Promoting information services will be conducive to the smooth linking of China's economy with that of the world. Information services are becoming a major means of international contact and trade exchanges. All big companies in developed countries have extensively adopted the use of electronic data exchange and electronic mail. Europe and the United States already have employed electronic means for international trade. If China does not accelerate the process of promoting information services, it will directly affect the depth and breadth of the opening up to the outside world and will weaken China's role in the world economy. II. Insist on the Integration of Production With Application and of Manufacturing Industries With the Information Service Industry, and Develop the Information Industry in an All-Round Way, Thus Offering Information Services for the National Economy The electronics industry shoulders a heavy historical task in the process of promoting information services. In China, the electronics industry already has become a new industry of some proportions, and is playing an increasingly important role in the modernization drive and in supplying information to society. In 1993, the total industrial output value of China's electronics industry came to 175 billion yuan, and electronic products exports reached $8.1 billion. In the past decade, the principle of "insisting on application and promoting development" has been coordinated closely with all sectors of the national economy, with the result that China has obtained remarkable achievements in the application of electronic information technology. Over the past year, for the several major information projects -- especially the "Three Golden Projects" -- we have made general plans, evaluated proposals, and designed their development, and we have made a gratifying step by putting some of them into practice. The general scale and technology of China's information industry, however, are far from meeting the demand for information services. China has very low expertise in the electronics industry and is particularly weak in the integrated circuit industry, which has become a factor restricting the development of the entire electronics industry. At present, there exists a certain degree of separation between the industry and the market, as well as a lack of coordination between technology imports and scientific research and development. This situation, coupled with the problems with the mechanism, makes it difficult to concentrate strength and capital or to set up large enterprise groups. At present, China's electronic information industry has entered a crucial historical period of development, and is faced with an unprecedentedly good opportunity and tough challenges. Leading comrades of the State Council have pointed out clearly: "In organizational reform, the State Council has decided to set up the Ministry of Electronics Industry. Although its name remains the same as previously, its tasks are greatly different from the past. The goal of setting up the Ministry of Electronics Industry this time is to strengthen the management of the electronics industry across the country under the new circumstances. The Ministry of Electronics Industry is the arm of the State Council that carries out macroscopic management of the electronics industry across the country." It also added: "We take the entire information industry as a pillar industry for the modernization of the national economy, and we have set higher demands and expectations. The tasks with which we have charged the Ministry of Electronics Industry are not only to produce and manufacture products, but also to attach great importance to hardware and the market and to promote applied electronic technology. We must seize the opportunity to accelerate development." The electronics industry must be aimed at providing services to the national economy and society, must continue adhering to the principle of integrating production and application, and must promote the all-round coordinated development of manufacturing industries, information systems, and information services. The focal point of development should be based on microelectronics, and we should take communications and computers as the mainstay, strengthen system integration and software-development capability, and offer better full sets of electronic system equipment and technological services for the development of the national economy and society. It is now necessary to concentrate energies on the development of electronic information system projects, the emphasis of which is on the "Three Golden Projects." The "Golden Bridge Project," which is the State's public economic information communication network project, is one of the basic facilities for providing economic and social information services. It is mutually linked and mutually connected with the communication lines of the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications and with the special communication networks of other ministries. The "Golden Bridge" network can transmit data, documents, sound, and diagrams. It will serve as a satellite information channel for various information service systems, including banking, customs, foreign trade, domestic trade, tourism, meteorology, communications, national security, and science and technology. It can offer a virtual subnetwork for all sectors that intend to set up satellite telecommunications networks, reduce duplicate projects, and save funds. The "Golden Pass Project" is a preliminary project of the "Golden Bridge Project." It will contribute to the service system networks of the customs, foreign trade, foreign exchange control, and taxation enterprises and departments; promote the electronic data exchange service and the electronic mail service; and achieve the automation of pass control and paperless trade. The "Golden Card Project," which is the electronic currency project, will serve banks and related sectors. It will use the "Golden Bridge" network to link and perfect the information systems of the banking service. It will promote the use of credit and cash cards for banks, and gradually will achieve electronic cash deposit and exchange, and electronic cash payment; reduce the amount of cash people carry with them; and offer them convenience. It also will make people lead a more convenient and more comfortable life, and gradually will promote various electronic value-added services to meet the needs of society, as well as offering a reliable communication network. In order to accelerate the implementation of the "Three Golden Projects," the Ministry of Electronics Industry should proceed from the demand of customers, serve customers, coordinate with the departments concerned, strengthen organization and leadership, improve overall planning, further formulate general technological plans for projects, and positively carry out experiments. When it has gained experience, it gradually should promote its experience, and then must formulate industrial policies, organize related enterprises and research academies to carry out scientific research and development and large-scale production, offer system equipment and services for the "Three Golden Projects," develop China's large enterprise groups, and enhance the national strength in the course of promoting information services. III. Under the Unified Leadership and Planning of the State Council and With the Close Coordination and Concerted Efforts of All Ministries, Commissions, and Localities, We Will Jointly Promote Economic and Social Information Services Strengthening the national will and bringing into play the government's functions of organization and of planning and coordination are an important guarantee for promoting information services. The national economic information service is a grand social project that cuts across departments, trades, and regions, and straddles the next century. It integrates a multitude of technologies and a multitude of trades and services. Only when we make unified plans, give unified commands, unify the pace, properly coordinate relationships among all quarters, bring into play the initiative of the center and localities and of related departments and enterprises, share a division of labor, and make concerted efforts under the strong leadership of the State Council can we successfully implement them. We must actively and energetically coordinate and harmonize with the departments concerned, and assist the State Council in offering good service. In promoting information services, we must begin by setting standards and standardizing policies, and must do good work in standardization and legislation. Promoting information services includes the development of basic facilities that serve as information channels, and the development of various applied information systems. Its huge efficiency lies in the fact that the various applied information systems are mutually linked and connected through the public information channel, thus fully exploiting and utilizing information resources and achieving the common use of resources. If we roughly compare basic communication facilities to an "expressway," then the various applied information systems are the cars running on the expressway. Therefore, we must set technological standards and agreements for the development of the state's public information network, special information networks, and the various applied information systems, including all types of equipment and software. The information systems to be set up by all trades and units must be open, while at the same time guaranteeing the confidentiality of secret information. Therefore, promoting information services not only requires the development and application of advanced electronic technology, but also requires reform of the patterns of operation and the management system accordingly, as well as standardized government, enterprise, and market behavior. Only by means of strong and effective policies and laws can we guarantee the orderly promotion of information services. When promoting information services, we must insist on opening up wider and on strengthening cooperation and exchanges with the outside world. Promoting information services is a common choice and great trend for the economic and social development of all countries around the world. The development of the state's basic economic information facilities must guarantee international links and adopt common standards. Developed countries already have gone a fairly long way in the development of information technology, the information industry, and in the promotion of information services. Now they are developing into high-degree information societies. We can use for reference and utilize the technology, experience, personnel, management, and capital from around the world, and accelerate the development of China's information industry and information services through cooperation and exchanges. In short, we should seize the opportunity to accelerate the development of the electronics industry, and should positively and actively improve service while accelerating economic development and promoting information services. This is both an unshirkable task of the electronics industry and a rare opportunity for the electronic industry as a leading and pillar industry to fully play its role. We must adhere to making demand our objective and service our aim, change functions, and change ways of thinking and work style. We should seize the opportunity to accelerate development and make great efforts to further upgrade the technological expertise and efficiency of the electronics industry.
