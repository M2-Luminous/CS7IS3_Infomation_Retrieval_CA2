FR941021-0-00018 FR941021-0-00001 (xiii) Fire resistance . (A) The test housing shall be installed in a manner typical of field installation. U.S. No. 1 wheat straw shall be placed on the ground around the housing base in an one meter (3 ft) radius at an approximate depth of 10 cm (4 in.). The straw shall be ignited and permitted to burn fully. After the housing has cooled, its contents shall be inspected for evidence of ignition, melting, burning, or structural damage. Damage sufficient to impair service constitutes failure. (B) Polymeric materials shall be tested in accordance with the Underwriters Laboratories Publication (UL) 94, dated June 18, 1991. Materials used in housing components shall have a rating of 94V&hyph;0 or 94V&hyph;1 and shall not sustain combustion when an open flame source is removed. (4) Mechanical requirements for housings_ (i) Impact resistance. The test housing shall be subjected to the following impacts according to its minimum volume or minimum width and depth as shown in the following table: ␣ 1Minimum volume cm 3 (in. 3 ) 1Minimum width or depth cm (in.) 1Impact force 2N-m 2(lb-ft) Less than 35,000 (2,100) Less than 13 (5) 68 (50) 35,000 (2,100) or greater 13 (5) or greater 136 (100) (A) The impact force shall be delivered to the front, back, and top surfaces. Circular housings shall be impacted on side surfaces 180 ○ apart and on the top. The device used to deliver the force shall be spherical and approximately 25 to 31 cm (10 to 12 in.) in diameter. A typical test procedure may include the use of a hard rubber bowling ball, weighing 6 to 7 kg (13 to 16 lb), enclosed in a mesh bag, attached to a rope with a metal ring. The load shall be dropped vertically on the top surface and applied to the sides with a pendulum motion using the appropriate height and extension arm to achieve the required impact force. The housing must be impacted at the approximate mid-point of the surface area. (B) Housings shall be conditioned for a minimum of eight hours at ^40 ○C (^40 ○F) in an environmental chamber prior to testing. If the chamber is insufficient in size to conduct tests within the chamber, the housing may be removed and shall be tested within 10 minutes after removal. (C) After impact testing, the housing shall not exhibit fractured or ruptured surfaces sufficient to allow the ingress of moisture or dust. The housing shall not exhibit mechanical damage that would impair the functioning of hinges, latches, locks, etc. (ii) Load deflection. Free standing buried plant housings shall be tested for load deflection in accordance with Figure 6. The assembled housing shall be rigidly held in place by a mechanical means to simulate a normal field installation. A length of wire or cable, or other suitable material, shall be placed around the top section of the housing and deadended. The wire or cable shall be initially tensioned to 23 kg (50 lb). A measurement shall then be taken of the deflection of the housing at the top as shown in Figure 6. The deflection shall be recorded at incremental loads of 23 kg (50 lb) until destruction of the housing occurs. The average load for the three directions shall not be less than 136 kg (300 lb) and the minimum load in any direction shall be 113 kg (250 lb). Failure is defined as housing component fracture or crazing of the housing's surface finish. Figure 6 is as follows: BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;15&hyph;P E:GRAPHICSER21OC94.005 BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;15&hyph;C
