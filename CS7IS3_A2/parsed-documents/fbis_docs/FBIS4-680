Mr Meyer said that as far as government was concerned the mediation could continue, but the problems surrounding the terms of reference "will cause this current effort not to continue". Asked whether the mediation, which was intended to resolve outstanding constitutional difficulties between the African National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party would be abandoned, Mr Meyer said: "On the basis of them accepting that there is no clarity on the terms of refence that is unfortunately the position". Mr Meyer said the divisive issue was not which particular terms of reference would be used by the mediators, but the issue of the election date. He said the ANC believed there was no linkage between the election date and mediation, while the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] argued that there was a linkage. He said government's position was that the elections should go ahead as scheduled. The mediators were due to address the media at 1PM on their plans. IFP negotiator Ben Ngubane said he was still hopeful that the mediation could go ahead. Another IFP negotiator said government was prepared to go back to the original terms of reference that did not mention the election date but that this still had to be cleared with the ANC. ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa was due to meet the mediators at Thursday lunchtime. However, Mr Meyer said the issue was not what document was used but how mediation would affect the election date. "The election date is fixed and we are proceeding on that basis," he said. He said it was "very unfortunate" that the mediators had come to South Africa when there was no agreement on the terms of reference. He said Dr Kissinger had taken the "correct position" in saying that the mediation did not include negotiations on the election date. He said the government was still prepared to involve itself in mediation and in other attempts to resolve problems with the IFP and with the Zulu king.
