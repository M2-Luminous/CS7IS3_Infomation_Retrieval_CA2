Robinson, the first Irish president to visit Poland, was greeted in front of the Belvedere presidential palace by Walesa, the Sejm and Senate speakers, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak and Foreign Affairs Minister Andrzej Olechowski. During his talks with the Irish president, Walesa presented problems faced by Poland in the course of economic and political transformations and pointed to the need to intensify the process of integration between central European states and the European Union. Walesa told Irish journalists after the meeting that he is impatient with a slow pace of Poland's integration with the European Union [EU]. He said Poland and other countries in eastern Europe have huge potentials, which have yet to be used. Mary Robinson pointed out that Ireland was the first country to have ratified the agreement on Poland's association with the EU. She contended that she is aware of Polish aspirations to become a member of the EU but stressed this will not be a fast process. After the wreath-laying ceremonies at the tomb of the unknown soldier and at the monument to the Warsaw uprising, Mary Robinson visited Warsaw's museum of literature. Later in the day, the Irish guest was awarded the John Field medal during a ceremony at the Frederic Chopin Society for her contribution to the development of Polish-Irish cultural contacts. The situation of the European Union, the question of Poland's coming closer to west European structures and bilateral Polish-Irish relations constituted the main topics of talks held by Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski and Irish Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs Dick Spring. Spring recognized Irish relations with Poland as a priority in the process of establishing ties between the European Union and central and east European countries. Olechowski presented to Spring Poland's position on its integration with the European Union before the EU summit to be held on the Greek island of Corfu June 24-25. He pointed to the necessity of an unequivocal decision on the part of the European union related to Poland's future membership of the EU.
