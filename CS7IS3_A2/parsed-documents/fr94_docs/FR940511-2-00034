FR940511-2-00034 FR940511-2-00023 Financial Assistance Award: F.H. Blake and Associates AGENCY: U.S. Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of intent to award an unsolicited application financial assistance award. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(2), it is making a discretionary financial assistance award based on acceptance of an unsolicited application meeting the criteria of 10 CFR 600.14(e)(1) under Grant Number DE-FG01&hyph;94CE15606 to F.H. Blake and Associates. The proposed grant will provide funding in the estimated amount of $99,760 by the Department of Energy for the purpose of saving energy through the development and construction of the invention, ``Fiber-Optic Anti-Cycling Device for Street Lamps'' to control high pressure sodium street lamps so that the lamps come on at dusk and go off at dawn. In addition, the device senses when the lamp fails to operate satisfactorily within a reasonable time and removes power from the lamp. The proposed technology has a strong possibility of adding to the Nation's Energy Resources by enabling the millions of street lamps in the United States to be more energy efficient and to lower their maintenance costs through more effective failure detection. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Please write the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Placement and Administration, ATTN: John Windish, HR&hyph;531.23, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Department of Energy has determined in accordance with 10 CFR 600.14(f) that the unsolicited application for financial assistance submitted by F.H. Blake and Associates, is meritorious based on the general evaluation required by 10 CFR 600.14(d) and that the proposed project represents a unique idea, that would not be eligible for financial assistance under a recent, current, or planned solicitation. Frederick H. Blake will be the principal investigator. He holds the patent on this technology and has spent twenty-five years in the field of energy management and photo-sensed lighting control. The Energy Related Inventions Program (ERIP) has been structured, since its beginning in 1975, to operate without competitive solicitations because the authorizing legislation directs ERIP to provide support for worthy ideas submitted by the public. The program has never issued and has no plans to issue a competitive solicitation. The anticipated term of the proposed grant is 18 months from the effective date of award. Issued in Washington, DC, on May 4, 1994. Scott Sheffield, Director, Headquarter, Operations Division B, Office of Placement and Administration.
