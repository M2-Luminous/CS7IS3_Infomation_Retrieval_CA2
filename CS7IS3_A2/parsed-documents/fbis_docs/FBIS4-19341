Dirty Journalism I have experienced the worst baiting from the media in the FRG. The yellow press has surpassed itself in inventing events in connection with me. Westdeutscher Rundfunk does not even shy away from a movie about my assassination by the CIA and the Federal Intelligence Service. As "justification" they cite, on the one hand, my expected victory at the Russian presidential elections and, on the other hand, the absolute lie that I am compiling death lists and give orders to death squads. Obviously, there is no lowest level for this kind of dirty journalism. Thus, I can understand that millions of Germans are uncertain and see me and my ideas as a danger to Germany. The readers of DEUTSCHE NATIONAL-ZEITUNG and DEUTSCHE WOCHEN-ZEITUNG, published by my friend Dr. Gerhard Frey, have a right to truthful reports, which I have the pleasure to fulfill here. What We Owe to Our Dead It is in the nature of things that I, as a Russian politician, advocate Russian rights and interests, but in my view of the world German and Russian rights and interests do not oppose each other, but run parallel. Whoever implies that I want to restrict the German people in their rights, is turning truth upside down. Rather, I am striving for a vital and healthy, strong and large, but also German, Germany, as a stable partner and lasting friend of Russia. What has proved its worth a thousand times over for centuries and has proved to be a blessing for both peoples, cannot be wrong. It was, however, wrong, even crazy, that we permitted ourselves to be thrown at each other in two murderous world wars. Russians and Germans had to make by far the greatest sacrifices. We owe it to our dead to learn lessons from that, and these lessons can only be: return to the traditional German-Russian friendship. Unprecedented Brainwashing A Russia, which, in whatever form, gets involved on the side of the German people's enemies or opponents, would contribute to tying Germany to the so-called Western community of values and to depriving it of its sovereignty. This is probably a key to the immense media baiting against me, which is considered to be anti-Russian even by those who are not voters of the Liberal Democratic party, and which is obviously aimed at giving rise to resentment both in the German and in the Russian peoples. With sincere rage I note that the Germans are expected to wander around repenting in sack cloth and ashes and to accept a both immoral and unethical collective responsibility and collective liability for things that happened long ago. The requirements of the present and the needs of the future are to be pushed away by a constant, extremely one-sided coming to terms with the past. I see the unprecedented brainwashing, to which the Germans have been subjected for almost half a century, as the effort to lastingly infect the people of poets and thinkers with the bacillus of national masochism. Is National Masochism Healthy? If, however, national masochism is already so good for school children and also so healthy for adult Germans, there arises the question why for any other people in the world the opposite standards apply and why, outside Central Europe, practically all political movements agree to remember the positive and proud parts of history and not to have the development of their own people presented by the media like a catalogue of criminals. The fact that foreign politicians make -- often inappropriate or excessive --suggestions or demands to the Germans, is already party of the "normalcy" of our time and is usually cheered enthusiastically by the FRG media. Logically, I, who strives for Germany's friendship and care for the welfare of the German people, am presented as a spawn of hell in the "German" opinion industry, even though any thinking person can calculate my prospects for becoming Russia's president. The Point of the Lies The systematic reports of horror stories about me are to sow discontent. This is tried to virtually poison the political climate between our peoples and states. The calculation of the instigators is probably also to gradually undermine my basic pro-German attitude through constant slander and bedeviling, and to slowly turn me into an enemy of the German people. However, I am perfectly able to distinguish between the German people and the FRG media, which are basically a work of the victors of World War II. All the more intense is my appeal to the German-thinking Germans to overcome the resentments of the past, to remember the wonderful common points of German-Russian history, and to follow with all possible determination a course of eternal friendship on the basis of full equal rights between our peoples and states. Our friendship is not directed against anyone and does not threaten anyone. However, it is the guarantee for a lasting peace in Europe and is, therefore, in the interest of all peoples on the continent and, basically, of all the world. Do not give those who preach hatred any chance and defend understanding among peoples and peace!
