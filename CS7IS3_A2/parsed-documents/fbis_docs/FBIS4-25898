"China in principle doesn't subscribe to the involvement of the Security Council in the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula or resorting to sanctions to solving it," foreign ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told journalists when asked for China's view of the draft. "China believes that the only way to a proper solution is direct dialogue held between the parties concerned," Shen told a weekly news briefing, urging all sides to make every effort to ensure a return to talks rather than resorting to action that could lead to confrontation. "We believe there is still room and the possiblity for a proper solution to this issue," Shen said. The United States presented UN Security Council members Wednesday with the draft of a resolution calling for phased sanctions against North Korea after it this week pulled out of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). China, which has veto power as a permanent member of the Security Council, has consistently opposed calls for the imposition of sanctions against its communist ally.
