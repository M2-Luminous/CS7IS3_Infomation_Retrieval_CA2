FBIS4-68496 "jpusr050___94032" FBIS-USR-94-050 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 27 April 1994 RUSSIA REGIONAL AFFAIRS First Session of Oblast Soviet Reviewed First Session of Oblast Soviet Reviewed 944F0644A Novosibirsk VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK in Russian 27 Apr 94 p 1 944F0644A Novosibirsk VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK Russian CSO [Article by Vladimir Kuzmenkin: "The Council--New, the Chairman--Previous"] [Text] Undoubtedly the central event of the first day of the first session of the Novosibirsk Oblast Soviet of Deputies was the election of its chairman. Some people saw this as a real theater with all the trimmings: the director, the actors, the intermission, and the buffet; some saw it as a political game; and some saw it as a real drama.... In the morning 34 people's deputies approved the agenda, excluding from it the point about considering the oblast's socioeconomic situation at the session. It was reasonable to exclude this since the oblast administration had decided to revise the figures taking into account the results of the recent scientific-practical conference in Novosibirsk. The deputies also formed seven committees and immediately demonstrated their attitude by refusing to allow the leader of the chancellery, a deputy of the Federation Council, Aleksey Manannikov, or Olga Lesnevskaya to attend the session. After a brief but stormy discussion with the participation of the oblast procurator they agreed that the decisions would be adopted by the soviet based on the number of elected deputies--34. (Let us recall that there should be a total of 49 deputies in the oblast Council.) After the recess the deputies elected the chairman and, in spite of expectations, (the people intended to go home by 1500), the elections dragged on. There were three people in the running: Anatoliy Sychev, Aleksandr Kiselnikov, and Pavel Isayev. The head of the former Soviet of People's Deputies noted that he could "consider himself a professional in this business" and discussed in detail the tasks of the new Soviet of Deputies (without the epithet "people's"). His major opponent was the well-known Novosibirsk economist-analyst A. Kiselnikov, who also discussed in detail his vision of the future work of the deputies. The third candidate, incidentally, a recent candidate to the State Duma, Pavel Isayev--a scholar from Akademgorodok--put himself in the running and defined his main task as to break down the image of Novosibirsk Oblast as "the most conservative and irreconcilable region." It was clear that the battle would be between the first two candidates. And that was the way it went: Sychev received 14 votes, Kiselnikov--six, and Isayev--three. But in order to become chairman it was necessary to gain the support of a minimum of 18 deputies. In the first round 11 deputies did not vote for anyone, and here is what is interesting: Among the deputies were 11 administration chiefs (Nikolay Krasnikov--the administration chief of Koltsov, representing Russia's Choice--was not counted).... Thus began the theater or game or call it what you will. The VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK correspondent learned from reliable sources that the scenario became known in the morning, and this was brilliantly confirmed during the day. During the second round A. Sychev garnered 17 votes and A. Kiselnikov--11, and, in keeping with the election regulations, a new nomination was started. Aleksandr Kiselnikov withdrew his candidacy and it was suggested in a cheerful voice from the microphone that they elect a "rural person." That is what Nikolay Baraulin, Toguchinskiy Rayon administration chief, was. In his extremely brief speech he stated that he had already been elected 24 times and if they trusted him, he was ready. Precisely who "should" was not stated aloud, but everyone understood that now the aforementioned 11 people would express their opinion. Many deputies were disturbed about the "games" and deputy Plyushkin, a physician by profession, suggested that they give a lot of thought to what was going on in the hall and express their opinion anyway because "abstention was dangerous to the health." As a result, the people's elect took the doctor's advice and in the meantime, breaking the opponent's game, started playing their own. Anatoliy Sychev gathered 19 votes, and his opponent--only 13. And so Anatoliy Pavlovich Sychev was elected chairman of the Novosibirsk Oblast Soviet of Deputies.
