The statement made by Slovenian Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle that "the normalization of relations between Belgrade and Ljubljana was of interest for Slovenia," was interpreted by observers of Yugoslav-Slovenian relations in Belgrade as an official offer of Ljubljana to the FRY. There have not yet been official reactions in the FRY to Ljubljana's offer, but the offer just as every other offer to normalize relations made by a former Yugoslav republic, would be carefully examined in Belgrade. The FRY is working for re-establishing disrupted links in the former Yugoslavia, ending the war in former Bosnia-Herzegovina and for a just solution to the crisis in former Yugoslavia. That is why it is exclusively the fault of Ljubljana that Belgrade's earlier offer for mutual recognition had been consigned to oblivion. One wonders why the Slovenian foreign minister has shown his cards and made his offer to normalize relations between Ljubljana and Belgarde at this particular time. It is well known that out of all the former Yugoslav republics Slovenia has up to now been the most out-spoken in its attacks on Belgraee in all international fora, from the U.N. to the CSCE. Demanding even that the mentioning of Yugoslavia be banned, Ljubljana has naively expected to improve its reputation in the world, to approach the european Union and other international factors. The Slovenians have shown by their offer to normalize relations with Belgrade that they did not wish to be late in the process of normalization of relations with the FRY. The interest to normalize relations with the FRY has undoubtedly been spurred by the beginning of the normalization of relations between Belgrade and Zagreb, since Slovenia is having some serious problems with Croatia. The possible normalization of relations with the FRY would counterbalance to a great extent the trouble Slovenians are having with Croats, it is assessed in Belgrade. The ball is now in Slovenia's court.
