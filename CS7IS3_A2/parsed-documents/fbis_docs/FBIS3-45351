Patten angered Beijing by submitting parts of his controversial reform package on electoral reform last month after 17 rounds of talks on the issue between Britain and China failed to reach any agreement. He told reporters before leaving for London that "we hope ... that talks can be resumed." "If we're not able to resume discussions as we would like then we will have to discharge our responsibilities without there having been an agreement," he said. However, Patten, who will give evidence to the House of Commons' foreign affairs select committee in London during his visit ending Monday, said: "I think it's unlikely that we would want to go ahead with the last stage of legislations while the present bill is in the Legislative Council." "I think ideally we'd want to see the Legislative Council deal with that bill first and then move on to next one but ... we need this bill in order to get on with drawing up the register of voters in the spring, in April," he said. The governor said he would be attending a meeting with other ministers to consider the progress of the legislation on political development in Hong Kong and the next steps to take if China refused any further resumption of talks, while in London. Hong Kong returns to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
