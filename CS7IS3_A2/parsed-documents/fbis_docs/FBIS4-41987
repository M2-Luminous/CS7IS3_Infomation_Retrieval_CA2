True, so far the sides chose not to specify the political aspects of this friendship. Joulwan's visit to Moscow was planned long ago and did not depend on Russia's signing the Partnership for Peace program. Now, as Andrey Kozyrev said at a meeting with the general, the visit can be seen as concrete manifestation of Partnership. The head of the Russian Foreign Ministry was, as usual, allegoric: He compared Russia's joining Partnership to the opening of a railway line and Joulwan's visit to the establishment of a specific timetable. According to Kozyrev, it is planned to include into this "timetable" five to six joint Russian-NATO games. In the course of talks between Joulwan and Pavel Grachev joint peacekeeping operations were described as a high priority in Russia's relations with NATO. Yet, the Russian minister believes, the interests of both sides should be reckoned with. Questioned how they will be considered in the process of consultations, Joulwan preferred not to answer: This is a matter for politicians, and he is a military man. Therefore he concentrated on practical problems: He reached agreement with Grachev on opening NATO's permanent mission with the Russian Defense Ministry and the Defense Ministry mission with the NATO Allied Command, and setting up an emergency hot line between the NATO Allied Command and the Russian Armed Forces General Staff. Russian Security Council Secretary Oleg Lobov drew Joulwan's attention to difficulties involved in implementing the Partnership program: In his opinion, not all politicians in the West understand what a new Russia is all about. Lobov sought to have his interlocutor believe that the problems of sharing out the Black Sea Fleet or Moscow's peacekeeping actions in the Transcaucasus and Central Asia do not point to a return to its imperial past. Suspicions that Russia continues to develop bacteriological weapons must also be cast aside. Partnership, according to Lobov, should help Russia cut its military spending and release funds for reform.
