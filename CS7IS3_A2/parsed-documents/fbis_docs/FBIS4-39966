That was the opinion voiced during an interview with your ITAR-TASS commentator by Sergey Filatov, head of the Russian President's Staff. Moreover, according to him, the problem does not boil down to ensuring the inviolability of state borders and defending the country against external threat. It is a question of creating a contemporary federal state in which both the regions and citizens of various nationalities enjoy extensive democratic rights. Sergey Filatov recalled that Boris Yeltsin issued an edict 4 June giving 12 June the status of a RF state holiday. Since this day currently falls on a Sunday, 13 June has been declared a nonworking day in accordance with Russian laws. In Sergey Filatov's opinion, the adoption of the new RF Constitution, the Federation Treaty, and the bilateral Treaty Between Russia and Tatarstan -- a document that was the prologue to the establishment of new relations between the center and Federation components -- were important milestones in the strengthening of the Russian Federation. "The Russian president's recent trip to Tatarstan demonstrated that the bilateral treaty has helped secure total political stabilization in a republic where separatist sentiments were strong quite recently," my interlocutor noted. On this basis it has become possible to formulate a program to strengthen the republic's economy by joint efforts on the part of the federal and republic authorities. Following the example of the bilateral treaty with Tatarstan, similar agreements will be signed in the near future with Kabardino-Balkaria, Bashkiria, and Kaliningrad Oblast. As far as strengthening the state is concerned, the head of the President's Staff attaches great importance to the Treaty on Social Accord, which has been signed in the past month by 854 statesmen, politicians, and public figures. Boris Yeltsin's edict on the transformation of the Public Chamber under the Russian president into a coordinating conciliation organ is expected shortly in order to put this treaty into effect. Tremendous work lies ahead in the sphere of regional policy, which has not so far been backed up with legislative acts -- constitutions for republics within the RF, kray and oblast charters, and a law on local self-government, which it is intended to adopt in June. According to Sergey Filatov, the RF president's State-Legal Administration and Administration for Work with the Territories, along with the Ministry for Nationalities' Affairs and Regional Policy, will direct their efforts to providing Federation components with their own legislation in the near future. Sergey Filatov said that the aim of state regional policy is to secure a "rich and uniform life for all Russia's citizens." However, attaining this objective is inconceivable without accord between the peoples inhabiting the RF. "Provided that there is accord we will secure economic and political stabilization as early as this year. If there is no accord you can postpone the dream of a normal life until the next century," Sergey Filatov concluded.
