ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking by cross-reference to temporary regulations and withdrawal of notices of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: In the rules and regulations section of this issue of the Federal Register , the IRS is issuing a temporary regulation that adds an anti-abuse rule to the final regulations relating to the tax treatment of debt instruments with original issue discount. The rule allows the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, in certain circumstances, to apply or depart from the final regulations in a manner that ensures a reasonable result in light of the purposes of the statutes governing original issue discount. The text of the temporary regulation also serves as the text of this proposed regulation. This document also withdraws the proposed regulations relating to the tax treatment of price level adjusted mortgages and the portion of the 1992 proposed regulations relating to the treatment of a debt instrument that provides for contingent payments. DATES: Written comments and requests for a public hearing must be received by April 4, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send submissions to: CC:DOM:CORP:T:R (FI&hyph;5&hyph;94), room 5228, Internal Revenue Service, P.O. Box 7604, Ben Franklin Station, Washington, DC 20044.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background A temporary regulation in the Rules and Regulations portion of this issue of the Federal Register amends the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) relating to section 1275 by adding ยง1.1275&hyph;2T. The text of that temporary regulation also serves as the text of this proposed regulation. The preamble to the temporary regulation explains the temporary regulation. This document also withdraws the portion of the 1992 proposed regulations relating to the treatment of a debt instrument under section 1274 of the Internal Revenue Code if the debt instrument provides for contingent payments. In addition, this document withdraws the proposed regulations relating to the tax treatment of price level adjusted mortgages. Special Analyses It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business. Comments and Public Hearing Before the proposed regulation relating to the anti-abuse rule is adopted as a final regulation, consideration will be given to any written comments that are submitted timely (preferably a signed original and eight copies) to the IRS. All comments will be available for public inspection and copying. A public hearing may be scheduled and held upon written request by any person who submits written comments on the proposed regulation. Notice of the time and place for the hearing will be published in the Federal Register . List of Subjects in 26 CFR Part 1 Income taxes, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
