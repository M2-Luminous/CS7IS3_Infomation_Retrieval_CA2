Sutherland, in Hong Kong two weeks after a visit to Beijing, said Washington's decision on MFN -- due by June 3 -- would "obviously have a relevance" to ongoing negotiations on China's GATT membership. "If China was to lose MFN status, it would have no direct bearing on the GATT negotiations," he told reporters. "But it would have an indirect bearing... because the MFN issue is one that is fundamental to GATT membership." MFN enables foreign goods to enter a GATT member nation or territory at preferential rates. The United States extends the status to nearly all its trading partners but President Bill Clinton has made renewal for China this year conditional on "overall significant progress" in human rights. Sutherland earlier told business leaders there was a very slim chance that China would be able to join GATT this year in time to be a founding member of the new World Trade Organization on January 1. "I'm not saying its impossible... but it is a very demanding schedule," he said. China was a founding member of GATT but withdrew from the arrangement in 1949 when the communists came to power.
