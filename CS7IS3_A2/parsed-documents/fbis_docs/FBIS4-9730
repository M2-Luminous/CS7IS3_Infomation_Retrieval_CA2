These services include radio frequency links, radio communications networks for ships at sea, and monitoring systems for mobile units. The agreement was signed on 24 March by Telecommunications of Mexico (Telecom) and TMI Communications, Inc., a Canadian telecommunications enterprise. Meanwhile, the trilateral transport meeting scheduled to be held by Emilio Gamboa, Federico Pena, and Doug Young, the transport secretaries for Mexico, United States, and Canada, respectively, was postponed yesterday. The meeting planned to study the possibility of facilitating the transit of cargo between the three countries. "In solidarity with the Mexican people's mourning, however, the ministers of Canada and United States asked the Mexican secretary to postpone the meeting," the Communications and Transport Secretariat has reported. The tests outlined in the agreement between Mexico and Canada will be conducted with the Solidaridad satellite and the Canadian enterprise's control center, and they will serve to check the operation of various types of L-band mobile telephones throughout national territory. This band permits mobile phone communications and the transmission of data for ground, air, and maritime units, as well as rural telephone communications to small and faraway communities. Meanwhile in Vancouver, Sheila Copps, Canadian deputy prime minister and minister for environment, and Carlos Rojas Gutierrez, Mexican secretary for social development, reached an agreement on the installation of the Environmental Commission of North America, which will be created in accordance with NAFTA's Parallel Agreement on Environment. The commission's initial duty will be to make proposals in the areas of ecosystems conservation and protection, to hold consultations related to NAFTA, to enforce regulations, to prevent pollution, to stimulate technological cooperation and institutional training, and to deal with border issues.
