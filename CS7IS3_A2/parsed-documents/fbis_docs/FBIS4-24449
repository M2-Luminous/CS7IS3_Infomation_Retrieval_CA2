Foreign investors will be encouraged to buy entire firms for technological renovation and expansion of production, hold some stakes, set up joint ventures transfer equipment and technologies, and even join in managing the firms. According to a government official who declined to be named 36 per cent of State enterprises in the city lost money last year. Together he said they lost about 3 billion yuan ($345 million). "To save these State enterprises, which in previous years were backbone businesses, we need to increase investment, import new technologies and advanced equipment and introduce new management systems," the official said. Some factories in the busy downtown areas will be allowed to move to the city's outskirts and develop service industries in co-operation with overseas partners. To attract foreign investors, Mayor Li Ziliu will lead a delegation to the United States early in June. On the delegation's list for foreign investment are new- and hi-technology projects and infrastructural works such as the second phase of the Metro subway, light railways, the second phase of the Zhujiang Power Plant and Pumped Water Storage Power Plant, and expressways. The delegation will also try to sell to foreign investors the property rights to most State enterprises for future development. The delegation will consist of more than 150 people, including government officials, company managers and directors, and will hold trade fairs in several cities during its tour from June 5 to 20. Municipal authorities are also planning a similar fair in Hong Kong in November. The government official expects Guangzhou's booming economy, political stability and improving investment climate to attract more overseas investors to join in the city's economy construction. To improve its investment environment Guangzhou has embarked on an infrastructural construction campaign that includes the Metro, the Ring Expressway, a 115,000-ton ethylene factory and the Zhujiang Power Plant. Meanwhile, the government intends to establish a solid framework for a market economy and encourage more companies to re-orient themselves toward a market economy. Within three years, all 20,000 enterprises in Guangzhou are to become corporations, preferably shareholding ones. All will be guided by the Company Law that takes effect July 1 and will be run by their directors according to free-market standards. "Government officials will no longer interfere in the enterprises' management as they did in previous years," the official said. Foreign investment and foreign trade in Guangzhou have grown steadily this year. In the first four months the city used more than $640 million foreign capital, up 84.6 percent over the same period last year. During this period Guangzhou exported nearly $1.1 billion worth of goods, an increase of 32 percent.
