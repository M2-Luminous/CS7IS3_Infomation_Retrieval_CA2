Together, they sold fewer than 300 aircraft and suffered some 400 cancellations. This gives a very real illustration of the scale of the crisis currently affecting the airlines industry. Overcapacity is continuing to wreak havoc, although there are signs that it has peaked. In 1993, regular international passenger traffic increased by 7 percent, and freight traffic by 8 percent, which is very encouraging. But the company tills are empty and it will be a long time before they are firmly back on their feet. Also, paradoxically, fuel is at present "too cheap." This means that the new generation of aircraft -- which are particularly fuel efficient -- have lost much of their appeal. The manufacturers are thus failing to obtain their just rewards. About a 1,000 airliners are presently grounded, waiting patiently for better days to come in impressive parking lots in the California desert. In fact, about 500 of them will never leave the ground again: apart from the fact that their owners have simply disappeared (Pan Am, Eastern, and others), they are technically and economically outdated. But there remain the other 500 more recent aircraft -- some virtually new -- which sooner or later are destined to find themselves back on the runways of major airports. This surplus represents 12 months of production for Boeing, McDonnel Douglas, and Airbus Industrie. Which means that these "big three" are going to have to wait an extra year following any real recovery before being able to benefit from increased contracts. In the meantime, the manufacturers are having to make the best of a bad situation. Boeing has sharply cut its production and is gradually shedding almost 28,000 jobs. McDonnel Douglas is taking a similar course of action but does have the benefit of the wealth and diversity of military orders. Airbus Industrie, on the other hand, is developing in a much more original context. The European consortium has, for the time being, succeeded in stabilizing production, despite a disastrous balance sheet at the end of 1993. With 38 new orders and 69 cancellations, the group ended the year with a seriously negative net deficit. But in 1994 it will nevertheless be delivering 134 aircraft, just two less [than in 1992.] Moreover, 138 deliveries are scheduled for 1995 and 154 for 1996. This favorable situation is linked to the fact that the range of European models has been widened, providing access to new markets. This is true of both the A330 and A340 jumbo jets and the A321, a 180-seater which is in direct competition with the Boeing 757. A Turning Point On 31 December, 667 planes were recorded in the Airbus Industrie order book. Since then, the A340 orders from Air Canada and the A319 orders from Air Inter have come in. This explains the confidence in the future. Nevertheless, many of the aircraft now on order will not be supplied until the end of the decade. And, in order to maintain the present rate of activity, Airbus Industrie must quickly win further orders. Seen in this way, 1994 looks to be a year fraught with problems. Either the recession will cause further cancellations or the net balance will return to positive figures. In the latter eventuality, may they rejoice in Toulouse. But in the former eventuality, there will be every reason for the greatest concern. The verdict will be out in 11 and one-half months.
