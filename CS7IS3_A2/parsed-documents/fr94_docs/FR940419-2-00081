SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing its approval of the application by Nissel, Ltd., Hertfordshire, England, for premarket approval, under section 515 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), of the S&hyph;38 TM Soft (polymacon) Contact Lens. The device is to be manufactured under an agreement with Allergan Optical, Irvine, CA, and OSI Corp., South San Francisco, CA, which have authorized Nissel, Ltd., to incorporate information contained in the approved premarket approval application and related supplements for the Hydron ® (polymacon) Hydrophilic Contact Lenses. FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) notified the applicant, by letter of November 26, 1993, of the approval of the application. DATES: Petitions for administrative review by May 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written requests for copies of the summary of safety and effectiveness data and petitions for administrative review to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James F. Saviola, Center for Devices and Radiological Health (HFZ&hyph;460), Food and Drug Administration, 1390 Piccard Dr., Rockville, MD 20850, 301&hyph;594&hyph;2080. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On July 16, 1992, Nissel, Ltd., Hertfordshire, England, submitted to CDRH an application for premarket approval of the S&hyph;38 TM Soft (polymacon) Contact Lens. The S&hyph;38 TM Soft (polymacon) Contact Lens is indicated for daily wear for the correction of visual acuity in aphakic and not-aphakic persons with nondiseased eyes that are myopic or hyperopic. The lens may be worn by persons who may exhibit astigmatism of 1.50 diopters or less that does not interfere with visual acuity. In addition, the lens is to be disinfected using either a heat or chemical lens care system. The application includes authorization from Allergan Optical, Irvine, CA 92713&hyph;9534, and OSI Corp., South San Francisco, CA 94080, to incorporate information contained in the approved premarket approval application and related supplements for Hydron ® (polymacon) Hydrophilic Contact Lenses. In accordance with the provisions of section 515 (c)(2) of the act as amended by the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990, this PMA was not referred to the Ophthalmic Devices Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee, an FDA advisory committee, for review and recommendation because the information in the PMA substantially duplicates information previously reviewed by this panel. On November 26, 1993, CDRH approved the application by a letter to the applicant from the Acting Director of the Office of Device Evaluation, CDRH. A summary of the safety and effectiveness data on which CDRH based its approval is on file in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) and is available from that office upon written request. Requests should be identified with the name of the device and the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. The labeling of the S&hyph;38 TM Soft (Polymacon) Contact Lens states that the lens is to be used only with certain solutions for disinfection and other purposes. The restrictive labeling informs new users that they must avoid using certain products, such as solutions intended for use with hard contact lenses only. Opportunity for Administrative Review Section 515(d)(3) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360e(d)(3)) authorizes any interested person to petition, under section 515(g) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360e(g)), for administrative review of CDRH's decision to approve this application. A petitioner may request either a formal hearing under part 12 (21 CFR part 12) of FDA's administrative practices and procedures regulations or a review of the application and CDRH's action by an independent advisory committee of experts. A petition is to be in the form of a petition for reconsideration under §10.33(b) (21 CFR 10.33(b)). A petitioner shall identify the form of review requested (hearing or independent advisory committee) and shall submit with the petition supporting data and information showing that there is a genuine and substantial issue of material fact for resolution through administrative review. After reviewing the petition, FDA will decide whether to grant or deny the petition and will publish a notice of its decision in the Federal Register . If FDA grants the petition, the notice will state the issue to be reviewed, the form of review to be used, the persons who may participate in the review, the time and place where the review will occur, and other details. Petitioners may, at any time on or before May 19, 1994, file with the Dockets Management Branch (address above) two copies of each petition and supporting data and information, identified with the name of the device and the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received petitions may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. This notice is issued under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (secs. 515(d), 520(h) (21 U.S.C. 360e(d), 360j(h))) and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (21 CFR 5.10) and redelegated to the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (21 CFR 5.53). Dated: April 5, 1994. Joseph A. Levitt, Deputy Director for Regulations Policy, Center for Devices and Radiological Health.
