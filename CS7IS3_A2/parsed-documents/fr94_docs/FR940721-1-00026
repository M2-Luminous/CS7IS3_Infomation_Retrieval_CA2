FR940721-1-00026 FR940721-1-00009 (B.) Demonstration of Maintenance_Projected Inventories. In order to demonstrate continued attainment, the State projected anthropogenic 1990 actual emissions of VOC and NO X emissions to the years 1993, 1996, 2000, and 2005. These emission estimates are presented in the tables below and demonstrate that the VOC and NO X emissions will remain below the attainment year emissions (1993). In fact, the emissions projections through the year 2005 show that emissions will be reduced from 1993 levels by 21 tons of VOC and 98 tons of NO X per day by 2005. These emission reductions are primarily the result of the implementation of FMVCP. It is noted that the emission projections are conservative since they do not account for emission reductions that will result from the anticipated implementation of other control measures and programs during this time period.
