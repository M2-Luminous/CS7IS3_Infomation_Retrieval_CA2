The mine of Kam, Tropoje district, is mostly suffering the consequences of the embargo. Its productive activity is almost suspended. Earlier, the mine exported chrome ore for the enriching factory of "Deva" of Gjakove in Kosova. Due to the application of the embargo for 1992-1993 alone, about 60,000 tons of mineral were not exported causing an economic damage of about 2.7 million dollars. Three productive sectors have been closed and about 250 workers are on assistance. Annual production has dropped about 17,000 tons from 60,000 tons it was earlier. So far, the respective structures of the United Nations Organisation have not done anything to compensate the damage caused by the implementation of the embargo on former Yugoslavia.
