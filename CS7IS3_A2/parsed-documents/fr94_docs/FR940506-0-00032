FR940506-0-00032 FR940506-0-00012 The Commission will clarify its position on pipeline responsibility. The Commission is accepting the code assignor approach put forward by the Working Group. While the Commission recognizes that other parties have been involved in developing the concept and will be signing the contract with PI-GRID, the pipelines are the only jurisdictional entity involved in the transaction. The pipelines can fulfill their obligation by either individually, or through their trade association INGAA, entering into the contract with PI-GRID as developed and presented by the Working Groups. The Commission understands that this contract will specify that the charges for obtaining the common code data base cannot exceed reasonable shipping and handling costs. The Commission, at this point, will leave the monitoring of these costs to the signatories to the contract. The Commission has required the pipelines to confirm their proprietary point information to PI-GRID, and the Commission expects no problems in pipeline cooperation with PI-GRID. However, to facilitate PI-GRID's development of the common code data base, each pipeline must designate a liaison to work with PI-GRID and must cooperate with the schedule set up by PI-GRID so that the data base will be available by the November 1, 1994 date. 2. Point Locator Information TGPL and INGAA seek rehearing of the Commission's requirement that pipelines provide PI-GRID with information sufficient to locate pipeline points in relation to other points. They argue the two comments to the NOPR requesting such information do not provide a sufficient basis for the Commission to reject the consensus agreement of Working Group 5 under which pipelines would provide this information only if they have it readily available. They maintain Working Group 5 treated this information as optional to avoid imposing additional burdens on pipelines that do not maintain this information in electronic form, while providing useful data when the information is readily available and accessible. The Commission denies the request to make point locator information optional. Shippers considering capacity release offers need information about point location to determine whether a particular offer fits their needs. Point locator information provides shippers with the ability to determine electronically whether the transportation path they desire is encapsuled within the transportation path of the posted release. For instance, without such information, the shipper cannot determine whether the delivery point it wants to use is upstream or downstream of the delivery point on the capacity release offer. Nevertheless, the Commission recognizes that some pipelines may have a large number of receipt points and may not maintain the geographic location of these points in an easily accessible form. The Commission also considers the geographic location of delivery points to be more important to evaluating capacity release offers than receipt point information, because the potential bidder generally needs only to determine whether the path of the capacity release offer extends to its desired delivery point. To ease the burden on those pipelines without easily accessible information, the Commission will require that they confirm to PI-GRID the geographic location of their delivery points and most important receipt points in time to meet the November 1, 1994 deadline. Those pipelines would then be responsible for completing the confirmation process for all their receipt points as soon as possible, but no later than May 1, 1995. Pipelines desiring to take advantage of this exception should file a request for an extension of time, explaining their system for maintaining geographic information and justifying their inability to make full compliance by November 1, 1994. Such extensions will be granted only upon good cause shown. 35 35 The Director of the Office of Pipeline Regulation can approve such requests pursuant to its delegated authority under section 375.307(d)(4) of the Commission's regulations. KGPC requests clarification that the Commission's reference to geographic coordinates referred to latitude and longitude. The Commission agrees. Natural states that its paper pooling and storage points used for nominations have no identifiable location on the pipeline and it presumes that for such points, it need only include an identifier showing the points have no geographical location. Pipelines should consult with PI-GRID to determine how to report points without identifiable geographic locations. The National Registry states that most pipelines appear to be cooperating with the requirement to provide point locator information in a form that will enable users to locate points in relation to each other. It requests clarification that the Commission's complaint process is the appropriate means of dealing with possible situations in which pipelines do not provide the point locator information in usable form. The Commission does not anticipate that any problems will develop, but, if they do, an attempt should be made to resolve the problem through the Working Group, and, if that fails, the Commission's complaint procedure or enforcement hotline would be appropriate vehicles for pursuing a problem.
