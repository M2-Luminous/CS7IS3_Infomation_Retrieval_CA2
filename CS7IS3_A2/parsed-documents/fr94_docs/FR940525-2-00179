FR940525-2-00179 FR940525-2-00100 Proposals to price high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes to allow their use by single-occupant vehicles (HOV Buy-In) have previously not been accepted for inclusion in the Pilot Program. The HOV Buy-In pricing concept was discussed extensively at a recent National Academy of Sciences (NAS) symposium on congestion pricing. The sense of those discussions was that in some circumstances this application of pricing should be considered on an experimental basis, and under limited circumstances. The thinking was that this kind of pricing would improve the use of available capacity and could be a way of introducing the notion of variable pricing for highways to the public. In response to these discussions, and in anticipation of a likely NAS recommendation for experimentation with this type of pricing in its forthcoming report on congestion pricing, the FHWA has decided to allow consideration of HOV Buy-In projects during this solicitation. Further, because substantial economic benefits are likely to result from expediting truck movements in congested urban corridors, the FHWA is also seeking a project proposal that would allow commercial freight vehicles to pay a price for the right to use an underutilized HOV lane, either along with an HOV Buy-In for passenger vehicles, or as a commercial freight vehicle Buy-In alone. Such proposals would have to ensure that the safety and operational efficiency of the HOV lanes are not compromised. Proposals should address such considerations as size and type of commercial freight vehicle in relation to the particular HOV lane design characteristics (e.g., HOV lanes must be barrier separated); likely enforcement problems; lane capacity and traffic flow; and effects on corridor travel patterns. In order to protect the integrity of HOV programs, the FHWA will give priority to those HOV Buy-In proposals where it is clear that an HOV lane is underutilized and where local officials can demonstrate that the experiment would not undermine a long-term regional strategy to increase ride-sharing. In addition, areas proposing HOV Buy-In projects are encouraged to use revenues from the project to promote improved transit service or other programs that will encourage transit use and ride-sharing. Priority will also be given to proposals which will result in early implementation of pricing activities. To gain acceptance as a pilot project, an HOV Buy-In project must incorporate the use of electronic pricing technologies, HOV time-savings must be maintained, and enforcement authorities should have input to any proposal. Proposals for funding of pre-project activities shall be submitted through the local Metropolitan Planning Organization and State Department of Transportation to the FHWA through the appropriate Federal Highway Division Administrator. Proposals will be reviewed by an Interagency Review Group comprised of representatives of FHWA, the Office of the Secretary of Transportation, Federal Transit Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, and Department of Energy. Based on this review, a limited number of applicants will be invited to enter into negotiations with FHWA to develop a cooperative agreement under which the pre-project activities will be carried out. Proposals for congestion pricing project implementation using one of the four remaining Pilot Program slots shall be submitted via the same route. The selection criteria contained in the FHWA's November 24, 1992, Federal Register notice will continue to be used for selection of new pilot projects for implementation.
