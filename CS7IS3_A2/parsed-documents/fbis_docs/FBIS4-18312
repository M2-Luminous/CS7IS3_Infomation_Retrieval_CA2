The new government, said the report, will have to face yet another financial "emergency," that of inaccurate estimates for regional health care needs and the subsequent overspending. The regions want the next executive to calculate needs according to "realistic" data but "without imposing balanced state finances as a pre-requisite." They want the government to identify the level of health care services that can be provided with existing resources and want regions to be given greater independence in levying and collecting health taxes. Among the proposals forwarded by the conference was to link regional per-capita income averages to spending standards and to have part of the national health care funds set aside for the poorer regions. Figures for 1992 and 1993 show deficits in regional health care finances of 2.632 and 6.093 trillion lire respectively, for a total 8.725 trillion lire (5.25 billion dollars). The shortfall for this year, according to the report, will be some two trillion lire higher last year's, or 8.290 trillion lire (4.99 billion dollars), because spending will amount to 90 trillion lire instead of the 81.71 trillion lire forecast by the government. The criteria used by the government to make its estimates, said the report, "are not totally realistic or acceptable," and will lead to a drop in health care standards.
