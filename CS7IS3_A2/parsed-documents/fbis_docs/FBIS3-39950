This time, however, I have the feeling that the maneuver will not succeed: ordinary people, pensioners, workers will have no difficulty in understanding the prize at stake." Fausto Bertinotti does not agree, and resolutely rejects the squall of criticism which is descending on him from almost the whole of the political world. A wall of noes greets his hint that the left will need, if it enters government, to review the taxation of interest on treasury bills, for anyone owning government securities in an amount exceeding 200 million lire [L]. However, he is not giving in, stating that he will be announcing tomorrow the details of a proposal for an inheritance tax, which is one of the key items -- together with reducing the workweek to 35 hours -- of Communist Renewal's program. But the "treasury bill war" has now been triggered, and everything leads us to believe that it will continue throughout the election campaign. The right --from the League to the National Alliance -- is attacking: denouncing the attempt to further squeeze those who save, and gleefully attributing the Communist Renewal secretary's intentions to the whole of the progressive ticket. For Forza Italia's Antonio Martin Bertinotti starts with "the right premise," but comes to the wrong conclusion. "It is true," the economist states, "that in absolute terms the fact of excluding interest on government securities from taxation leads to unfair results, with a person earning L100 million from working paying half this sum in taxes, while someone earning this amount from securities keeps the full amount. But this inequity is not so easy to resolve: Unless one accepts a huge rise in real interest rates and and a whole set of negative consequences on the budget and employment." At the center, Pact for Italy members and the PPI [Italian Popular Party] let it be known that Bertinotti's proposal "does not make sense," and, as PPI politician Roberto Pinza points out, an attack on savings "would end up increasing the hostility generated by the tax burden." Tax lawyer and Pact candidate Giulio Tremonti gives Renewal's leader credit for at least being ostensibly and completely consistent with the culture of the "financial left." From this perspective Bertinotti's views are more coherent and convincing -- Tremonti states in an open polemic with refutation of the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] program -- than those of certain groups whose internal rivalry we are currently witnessing. And the VOCE REPUBBLICANA speaks of a left which is in jeopardy, which goes "into battle with [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi by implying a tax on savings, while latter promises to abolish as much tax as possible. Let us therefore not be surprised then, if the right is already shouting victory based on opinion poll results." But quite a lot of Bertinotti's allies are also distancing themselves, and not hiding their irritation and embarrassment at a move which could boomerang. Or, in the words of Socialist Fabrizio Cicchitto, an "exercise which is good only for losing votes for the progressive front." After Mussi's "political" clarification, the PDS is letting the voices of its technicians be heard: "There is no need to intervene with new taxes on treasury bills," Vincenzo Visco, responsible for PDS tax policy, assures; interest rates are falling, and we are moving toward a stabilization of government debt. The deficit reduction is being obtained by another means, and for this reason interventions of this kind do not make sense." For Paolo Leon, any revision of the taxation of financial activities is not a question for the near future and , therefore, "should not be viewed as a threat but as an opportunity." But Filippo Cavazzuti is very decisive: "Treasury bill holders can be calm -- the vice chairman of the Senate Financial Committee explains -- the suggestion of a revision of the taxation of treasury bills is not shared by the majority of the progressive front. It is a position of the Renewal." Nor does Bertinotti hide that this is so, and waxes ironic on the fact that, in Italy "it falls to a Communist force to advance proposals of a frankly socialist flavor." For him, "no one has been able to explain in a convincing way why L50 million earned by an employee should be taxed at the source, and the same income, in the form of interest on treasury bills, should be totally exempt." The Renewal, Bertinotti assures us, has no intention of taxing the small saver, "the fruit of labor which has already been amply taxed. It is obvious that, as is the case a primary residence and any inheritance tax, one must provide an exemption threshold below which nothing is paid. I have mentioned the figure of L200 million." The question of taxing wealth, that is another matter, the Renewal's leader makes the distinction, "because this is what we are talking about: the raking up of treasury bills was how, during the eighties, large industrial profits, trillions, were transferred from production to financial investment. This has been the path of the `financialization' of Italian capitalism, which with one hand collected contributions from the state for restructuring, and on the other hand was investing in treasury bills instead of in plant and machinery. And therefore reviewing the taxation of securities -- with the qualification that if interest rates fall, taxes will also be reduced -- also means promoting the return of resources from financial investment to productive investment, to industrial capitalization." For his critics, and in particular those of the left, Bertinotti has a curt response: " What needs to be determined is whether or not the will exists to reform the tax system, whether it is possible to achieve equity while surrendering to unacceptable blackmail. I have the impression that many of these heated objections are specific to the election campaign. In the past, millions of workers went on strike, based on CGIL [Italian General Confederation of Labor], CISL [Italian Confederation of Trade Unions], and UIL [Italian Federation of Trade Unions] programs, which had this proposal at their center. And by the way," he concludes sarcastically, "I do not remember major objections being raised in those days."
