In line with the defense white paper, the law will give precedence to equipment currently being manufactured as opposed to research and development programs (development of prototypes). According to a senior defense official, "delaying large armament programs some more was quite a tempting option," but "we preferred to give priority to the deployment of modern equipment in the armed forces." Accordingly, no further delays are expected for programs relating to the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier, the Rafale fighter aircraft, the Triomphant-type missile-launching nuclear submarines (SNLE), and the Helios observation satellites. Orders for Leclerc tanks should keep coming in. Nevertheless, brand new programs will be postponed, including those concerning the NH-90 transport helicopter and the M5 ballistic nuclear missile, for which a consensus had to be found between the prime minister and the president of the Republic. The deployment of M5 missiles in SNLE submarines, a pet project of the president, will probably be postponed from 2005 to 2010. In exchange, the prime minister has reportedly agreed to commission the study of a land-based version of the M4/M45 missiles, which would replace the S3 ground- to-ground missiles installed in the Albion platform in 2005.
