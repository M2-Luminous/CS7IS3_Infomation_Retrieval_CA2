The mandate of such a commission -- were it established -- would be to determine why the six acted in direct contravention to the explicit understandings and agreements between Fatah and the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], in such a way as to endanger their own lives and those of passersby. Such a commission would also ascertain who in the Fatah leadership knew about their activity or approved it, and punish those responsible. Instead of doing this, however, the PLO leadership prefers -- as always -- to blame the IDF. And in the spirit of those who see a conspiracy behind every corner, there are people who disseminate in Israeli and foreign media that the undercover unit's attack on the six was initiated by a group of Israeli officers who want to foil the Oslo agreement. However, the facts -- which even Fatah people in the Gaza Strip do not deny -- all indicate that the tragic mistake should be entirely attributed to the Fatah members. On Monday afternoon the six activists -- after proper coordination with the IDF -- participated in a memorial service for a Fatah activist in the al- Shaykh Radwan neighborhood, which is located only several kilometers from the site of the incident. The six were armed and wore checkered uniforms (apparently with tacit IDF agreement). However, they did not settle for this. Following the ceremony -- and without any prior coordination -- they set up a roadblock on a main road of the Jabalyah refugee camp, stopped cars with drawn weapons (Kalashnikovs and pistols), and distributed leaflets. It was dark, the Fatah men were masked, and wore no signs to indicate their affiliation -- in clear contravention to the agreements between the Fatah leadership and the IDF in the Gaza Strip. The undercover soldiers who spotted them assumed -- and rightly so, from their point of view -- that the six were terrorists, and went on to attack them. It should be noted that a short time prior to that incident an attempt was made to attack the IDF outpost in Jabalyah, and that the IDF is still responsible for maintaining security in the Gaza Strip. Fatah is also aware of the fact that undercover units are operating in the Gaza Strip and should have foreseen what would happen. It is also inconceivable that 'Arafat's PLO would delay the negotiations on transferring responsibility for security to the PLO while at the same time its people on the ground are acting as though the negotiations have been completed and they no longer need to coordinate their moves with the IDF before departing on an armed mission. The IDF, however, should also draw the appropriate conclusions. The Jabalyah incident ought to serve as a warning sign as to what could happen after a Palestinian police force deploys in Hebron, the Gaza Strip, and Jericho. It should be feared that the security cooperation agreements of the kind the delegations are currently striving to attain would "invite" such incidents. The more complicated and intricate the security and coordination arrangements are, the greater the potential for fatal mistakes on both sides. And as is well known, mistakes cause escalation in violence and friction even between well-meaning Palestinians and Israelis. The only way to avoid this situation is to clearly demarcate the borders of the sectors in which the Palestinian police force on the one hand, and the IDF on the other, will operate. The joint patrols in the sectors slated to be jointly held will be an inexhaustible source for mistakes and misunderstandings -- and consequently must be avoided. It is inadvisable to rely on coordination, especially with an inexperienced force -- which is exactly what the Palestinian police force will be at first.
