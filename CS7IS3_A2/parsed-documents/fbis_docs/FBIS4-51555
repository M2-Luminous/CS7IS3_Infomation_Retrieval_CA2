Calling his government an administration to succeed reform effort, the Prime Minister in his policy speech plans to emphasize the stance that his administration will continue to promote political, economic, and administrative reforms, which the Hosokawa administration tried to realize. Regarding the tax system reform, which is a focal point of the reforms, he plans to explain that he will make a drastic change, centered around reduction of indirect taxes, on the basis of the coalition platform which the SDPJ and the ruling coalition parties agreed. Moreover, on ways to deal with North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development, Hata will announce that his government will act in line with the platform. He will explain a plan that in addition to cooperation with the United States and the ROK, his government will act in concert with China if necessary. On the issue of becoming a permanent member of the UN Security Council, Hata will indirectly express his desire by using expressions similar to the ones the Japanese Government used last July. The Japanese Government said last July that Japan was ready to fulfill all responsibilities it could possibly fulfill in the Security Council. It seems that Prime Minister Hata decided to explain the stance of not reflecting Shinseito's [Japan Renewal Party's] individuality in his policy speech because he aims to continuously ask the SDPJ to come back to the minority coalition government.
