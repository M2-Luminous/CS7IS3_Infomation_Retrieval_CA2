Greetings dear listeners. As you heard in the news bulletin, today, Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Fallahian, the honorable minister of intelligence, revealed new aspects of the treacherous plot to assassinate the well-loved president of the Iranian nation. Mr. Fallahian stressed that all those arrested have, during the preliminary interrogations, confessed to all their evil and counterrevolutionary aims and intentions. There is no doubt that the sworn enemies of the Islamic revolution are doing their utmost today to inflict blows on the glorious revolution of the Muslim nation of Iran. The assassination of well-loved prominent and pivotal personalities of the Islamic revolution has been the unchanging policy of the United States and its mercenary agents. The victory of the Islamic revolution inflicted a heavy and fundamental blow to the interests of the United States and international Zionism and it was natural that, from the very start, these sworn enemies of the revolution would make the pivotal personalities and dignitaries of the revolution the targets of their conspiracies. A review of the history of the Islamic revolution during the past 15 years reveals the personalities and dignitaries who were targeted by the enemy from the very beginning of the revolution. The assassination of the regime's dignitaries, whether in physical terms or in terms of propaganda, has been part and parcel of the general strategy of the enemies of the Islamic revolution to damage the Islamic republic. We can recall the years when the enemy first tried, by various means and by the dissemination of lies and rumors, to assassinate the character of the harmless martyr Beheshti, and, since it met with the decisive reaction of the Islamic nation and the imam of the Ummah [Khomeyni] and since its conspiracy was foiled, it embarked on the wretched 7th of Tir [28 June -- reference to bomb explosion at the Islamic Republic Party headquarters in 1981] incident and martyred that faithful friend of the imam, along with 72 of the best companions of the Islamic revolution. Today, too, the Islamic revolution is faced with those same old enemies and they have not let up for a moment their efforts to inflict blows on the Islamic republic. Just as the eminent leader of the Islamic revolution [Khamene'i] said in a gathering of religious scholars and clergymen, satanic powers are today also trying to physically eliminate the clergymen who are effective and important for the country and for Islam and Muslims, and their latest attempt was the recent incident of 1 February during which they intended to deprive the Islamic Ummah of a prominent and effective personality who is devoted to Islam, Muslims and the Islamic regime, that is, our well-loved president, who has given his life and his youth for this. But, thanks be to God, the satans' agents failed once again, just as they have in many of their previous plots and evil deeds. The enemy is unaware of the divine succor supporting the Islamic revolution and the unfailing determination of the nation to back the regime's officials. The Islamic Republic of Iran is marching forward with the assistance of the nation's support and God's blessings and ultimate defeat will, God willing, belong to the enemies of God and Islam.
