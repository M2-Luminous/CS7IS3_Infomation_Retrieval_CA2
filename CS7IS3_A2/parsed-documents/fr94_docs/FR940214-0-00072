FR940214-0-00072 FR940214-0-00008 NATIONAL ARCHIVES AND RECORDS ADMINISTRATION 36 CFR Part 1253 RIN 3095&hyph;AA56 National Archives at College Park, MD; Location of Records and Hours of Use AGENCY: National Archives and Records Administration. ACTION: Interim final rule. SUMMARY: The National Archives and Records Administration is updating its regulations on location of records and hours of use to add the National Archives at College Park (Archives II) facility which has opened in College Park, MD, and to delete the Pickett Street facility in Alexandria, VA, which is no longer open for research. The rule is being issued as an interim final rule so that the new facility hours will be established on the same date as the revised research room hours in the National Archives Building. This rule will affect the public. DATES: The effective date of this rule is March 16, 1994. Comments on the interim rule must be received by April 15, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments to Director, Policy and Program Analysis Division (NAA), National Archives at College Park, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740&hyph;6001. Comments may also be faxed to (301) 713&hyph;7270. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mary Ann Hadyka or Nancy Allard on (301) 713&hyph;6730. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The National Archives at College Park research complex opened to the public on January 3, 1994. Records will continue to be moved into the facility over the next two years as NARA completes a massive relocation of archival records from its facilities in the Washington, DC, area. Upon completion of the move, NARA will operate two archival research facilities in the Washington, DC, area: The National Archives Building and the National Archives at College Park, also known as Archives II. The Pickett Street facility in Alexandria, VA, which housed the Nixon Presidential materials and Cartographic research rooms, has closed; the Suitland Research Room will close for archival records research in 1996 when all archival records are relocated. NARA is adopting the National Archives Building Central Research Room and Microfilm Research Room hours at Archives II. Uniform hours at the two facilities will allow adequate coverage in the research rooms. We considered selecting different days for the Archives II complex to have extended hours; however, we concluded that such an action would complicate staffing the research rooms during extended hours without providing significant benefit to most researchers. With the allocation of records between the National Archives Building and Archives II based on grouping of related records in one facility, most researchers will use either the National Archives Building or Archives II, but not both. This rule is being issued as an interim final rule without prior notice of proposed rulemaking as permitted by the Administrative Procedures Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)) when the agency for good cause finds that notice and public procedure thereon are impractical, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. NARA finds that the public interest would be served by early establishment of extended research room hours at the new Archives II facility. Because NARA wishes to establish uniform hours for the Archives II research complex and the National Archives Building principal research rooms, NARA was unable to begin the rulemaking process for the Archives II facility until its rulemaking amending research room hours in the National Archives Building was completed. The final rule establishing hours for the National Archives Building is published elsewhere in today's Federal Register . NARA will issue a final rule confirming or amending the Archives II research complex hours at the close of the comment period for this interim rule. This rule is not a significant regulatory action for purposes of Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993 and has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, it is hereby certified that this rule will not have a significant impact on small entities. List of Subjects in 36 CFR 1253 Archives and records.
