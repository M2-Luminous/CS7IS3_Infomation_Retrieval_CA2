The Council of Ministers met for approximately 90 minutes under Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. In a statement after the meeting, Yildirim Aktuna, state minister and government spokesman, said that the Council discussed the terrorist incidents that took place over the past 10 years and the issue of extending the state of emergency in force in the 10 provinces for another four months. He pointed out that the extensive terrorist activities that began in 1984 increased greatly up until the end of 1991. As a result of the measures taken by the coalition government at the time, he said, terrorism began to decline in 1992. The number of terrorists who lost their lives between 1 January and 21 February 1992 and 1 January and 21 February 1993 amounted to 88, while 345 lost their lives in the first 52 days of this year, Aktuna said, adding: The statistics show an increase in the number of operations against terrorists and in the number of terrorists killed or captured. This is the result of the important decisions made by our government in fighting terrorism. Aktuna pointed out that within this framework, foreign support for the terrorist organization has been significantly reduced, mobile security forces have been trained, and conditions have been created for the antiterrorist struggle to be waged effectively under harsh winter conditions. Aktuna stated that the Council of Ministers, in its determination to safeguard security during the coming local elections and to end terrorism, decided to recommend to the TGNA to extend the state of emergency in force in the 10 provinces by another four months as of 19 March.
