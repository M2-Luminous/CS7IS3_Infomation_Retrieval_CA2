A set of market-opening measures recommended by the Office of Trade and Investmeent Ombudsman (OTO), an organ of the EPA, will form a major pillar of the government's comprehensive deregulation package to be released at the end of June, Hata was quoted as saying. Hata expressed his resolve for deregulation during a meeting with members of the Market Access Ombudsman Council, a unit of the OTO, the EPA official told a press conference. On May 13, the OTO presented a set of recommendations to Hata calling for the relaxing of excessive government control in 21 areas. Yoshio Okawara, Foreign Ministry adviser, who chairs the ombudsman council, said the OTO is designed to detect potential trade complaints and cope with them in a manner that would not cause friction with other countries, according to the EPA official. By fully carrying out the recommended measures, Japan can demonstrate to the rest of the world that the country is serious about promoting deregulation, Okawara was quoted as saying. The 21 irksome rules cited by the OTO range from extremely difficult driving license tests for large motorcycles and complex auto inspection and safety standards to strict labeling rules for textile products, excessive control on dairy, health and medical products, and rules on wheelchairs. The OTO will shortly hold a meeting so that steps to address these complaints will be worked out by the end of this month, Hata said. Okawara asked the government to reinforce the function of the OTO to help it cope with various complaints more effectively, including expanded manpower at its secretariat, the EPA official said. The OTO was upgraded to a ministerial level under the previous government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, which made deregulation a major policy goal.
