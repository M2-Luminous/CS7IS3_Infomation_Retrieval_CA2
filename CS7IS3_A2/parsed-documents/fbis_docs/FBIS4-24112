Chief Abiola was arrested at his Lagos home after addressing a rally in the business metropolis and taken early Thursday to the federal capital Abuja, his aides said. The Moslem millionaire had resurfaced just hours before after escaping house arrest and going into hiding 10 days earlier on the anniversary of the election cancelled by General Sani Abacha's military regime. A leader of the National Democratic Campaign (Nadeco) who asked not to be named told AFP the opposition was meeting urgently to decide a course of action and would "definitely" challenge the arrest. "Street demonstrations either Thursday or Friday in Lagos by supporters of Abiola...cannot be ruled out," the Nadeco leader said. The embassy of the United States, first foreign power to condemn the arrest, declared it raised "very serious questions with respect to the Nigerian government's commitment to restoring unhindered, civilian democracy and resolving the political crisis created by the annulment of the June 12, 1993, presidential election". "The United States denounces this action and believes that all parties to the political process should be allowed to speak freely on all issues," said a statement made available to AFP. In London, the Foreign Office said Britain was "very concerned" at the reports from here and hoped the developments would "not harm the search" for a way back toward "accountable civilian government." Abacha meanwhile pressed on with a tour of Nigeria's main military bases begun Wednesday to assure himself of the armed forces' loyalty, national radio reported. The tour came ahead of a Constitutional Conference scheduled for Monday in Abuja, which he has presented as the keystone of his program to give up power by stages but which the pro-democracy opposition grouped around Nadeco has dismissed as a farce. [passage omitted] He visited the Third Armoured Division stationed in Jos, capital of the central Plateau state, and the Second Mechanized Division stationed at Ibadan, 140 kilometers (80 miles) north of Lagos, the Nigerian press said. The heads of the army, navy and air force attended the meetings. Abacha also announced special end-of-service bonuses and deliveries of equipment and uniforms to the troops, the daily Guardian said. Abiola, who declared himself president and commander of the armed forces on June 11 in defiance to the Abacha regime, had pledged to some 2,000 cheering people on Wednesday that he would present a government. It was his first public appearance since he disappeared on June 11. [passage omitted] Other opposition leaders arrested during a month of growing resistance to Abacha's regime have been detained in Lagos and charged with treason in the federal high court.
