Trade in services, as an important topic, was brought into the negotiations for the first time. Its framework agreement, the General Agreement on Trade in Services, and addenda have been reached. On the basis of many rounds of bilateral negotiations, each country has submitted a list of preliminary agreements for reducing concessions. Since the start of the Uruguay Round, China began to participate in GATT negotiations and proposed its own preliminary list of promises to reduce concessions according to current Chinese laws and regulations which stipulate the degree of openness. The following are advantages of China's participation in GATT: Competition introduced appropriately promotes development of domestic service industries. We must introduce competition appropriately to accelerate the development of China's service industries. Since China implemented reform and open door policies, some Chinese service sectors have adopted different open measures which have played a definite role in spurring on the promotion of China's domestic service industry growth. Participation in GATT has solidified these efforts and continuously expanded the degree of openness of service sectors which will make China's domestic service industries develop rather quickly. Appropriate use of highly effective foreign services can improve domestic service industry levels to serve the creation of China's manufacturing growth and product exports. Increased transparency is advantageous to fully understanding foreign service market conditions. After GATT goes into effect, we could more clearly understand the restricted measures on service trades adopted by other countries via the preliminary list for agreement provided by signatories. This provided quite a lot of information to China's services and service providers to enter the service trade markets of other countries, which is beneficial to exporting China's services. Advantageous to enjoyment of equal treatment for China's service trade exports, GATT is the first multiple agreement for comprehensive management of global trade in services. Preferential treatment is an important principle of the general agreement. This principle will provide a rather equal competition environment for China's service exports and avoid discriminatory treatment via the exchange of reduced concessions to be able to compete with other countries on an equal basis. GATT is a new agreement regarding invisible trade. Its aims and purpose are the same as those of GATT; namely, to gradually remove all restrictive measures to entering the service industry market through rounds of negotiations, granting citizen treatment to foreign service providers, commonly using the principles of most favored nation treatment, and ultimately realizing full liberalization of trade in services. However, GATT does not require participants to attain the aforementioned demands while in the preliminary stage of implementation. What each country should do is undertake the obligations of its own promises to reduce concessions. The situation facing China at present is that various signatories will continuously demand that China liberalize the banking, insurance, telecommunications and posts, communications, sea transport, air transport, retail sales and specialized service (including law, consulting, accounting, etc) markets. In particular, China's high speed economic growth has been closely observed internationally, and pressure demanding we liberalize service industry markets will increase. Therefore, on the one hand we must determine the foreign openness of service industry based on domestic legislation and service industry development levels. On the other hand, it is imperative to accelerate service industry and service trade development. The main means are: One, a greater degree of reform, faster service industry externalization, and gradually realizing the transformation of the majority of service industry sectors toward operations away from welfare, public interest and undertakings according to the principles of separate government and enterprises and pushing enterprises toward markets in the direction of industrialization and socialization. Two, expand funding sources and channels for accumulating funds. Strive to increase service industry inputs and actively use foreign funds to develop the service industry. Three, further even out and liberalize service industry prices. Four, reform service industry planning, statistical systems and methods, overall planning, and develop statistical and assessment service industries. Since China wants to enter GATT, it must undertake scientific categorization and statistical methods of the domestic service industry according to common international practices. Then it will be comparable to service industries in other countries. Five, accelerate service industry legal system construction. China's service industry has preliminarily promised to open to the outside world. In line with further opening, China's service industries will have to face competition from foreign service providers. One prerequisite for further opening China's service industry is to enhance service industry legislation. At present China is stressing drafting basic economic laws and regulations such as "trade laws," "market laws," "corporate laws," "fair business practice laws," "antitrust laws," "communications laws," and "auditing laws."
