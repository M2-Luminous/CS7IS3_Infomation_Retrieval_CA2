The suggestion to hold the meeting to see whether the constitutional revision process takes off once and for all was made by the PMDB leader in the lower house, Deputy Tarcicio Delgado (MG [Minas Gerais]), who believes the work will not continue. "Either the constitutional revision is made, or it is not. We must make a decision in order not to act like clowns. Right now, attention is centered on the economic plan, the stripping of the political rights of congressmen, and the election race," Delgado said. The proposal of PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] leader Deputy Artur da Tavola (RJ [Rio de Janeiro]) to suspend the constitutional revision work after voting on subjects of consensus and to resume the work in 1995 is gaining force in Congress. Tavola believes he has found a formula to make the proposal legally feasible. He maintains that the power to amend the Constitution could be delegated to another congress by including an article in the chapter of temporary provisions of the Constitution. Deputy Miro Teixeira [PDT [Democratic Labor Party]-RJ) agrees with constitutional revision rapporteur Deputy Nelson Jobim (PMDB-RS [Rio Grande do Sul]) that any proposal to suspend the work is unconstitutional. He said the anticipated promulgation of the Social Emergency Fund (FSE) has frozen the deadline of the revision work in order to prevent questioning by the STF [Federal Supreme Court].
