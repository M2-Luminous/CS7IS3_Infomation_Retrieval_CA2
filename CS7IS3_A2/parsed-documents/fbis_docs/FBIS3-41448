In his words, the Defense Ministry refers to the fact that civil departments abroad have never supervised such kind of military activity. Shapovalenko pointed out that the Defense Minister should issue a decree to bring into force a provision on the State committee on atomic supervision in the ministry's structure because ``it is difficult to establish a single state system of supervision over radioactive security on Russia's territory without this.'' Shapovalenko declared that last December a working group of the Environment and Natural Resources Ministry prepared a report for the government to solve the problem with liquid radioactive wastes. In particular, it proposes to forward membrane devices to reprocess nuclear wastes, which have been designed by the association Radon, to the Pacific Fleet for test exploitation. In addition, he said, ``we have accepted Japan's proposal which will hand over a dual-bottom tanker to Russia to store 10,000 tons of liquid radioactive wastes. However, the government must consider the issue on the construction of facilities to reprocess liquid radioactive wastes on the Northern and Pacific Fleets and several regional burial places in order to entirely resolve this problem.'' A feasibility study for a burial place on the territory of the former nuclear test range on Novaya Zemlya has been already prepared and subjected to state ecological expertise. ``The same burial place should be created in the Far East, but if we start construction this year it will be concluded not earlier than 1997,'' said Shapovalenko. He reported that a facility capable of reprocessing 8,000 cubic meters of liquid radioactive wastes annually will be assembled on the Kola peninsula on the basis of the water purification station of the Murmansk sea steamship line. Shapovalenko said that the Murmansk steamship line is ready to accept wastes from military crafts assigned to the Northern Fleet on a commercial basis.
