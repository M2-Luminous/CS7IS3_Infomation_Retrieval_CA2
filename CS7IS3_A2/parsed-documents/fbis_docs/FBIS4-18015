However, major battles, as both Stepanakert and Baku claims, have come to a halt, which is explained by rain and fog in Karabakh . As INTERFAX has learned from the Karabakh army's press service, Azerbaijani troops after midnight struck Karabakh positions at Talish, a community in the north of the Mardakert region. Casualty figures are as yet unavailable. Armenian units, in turn, according to Azerbaijan's Defense Ministry, fired rockets into Terter and nearby villages, bordering with Karabakh. Villages in the Tauz region of Azerbaijan were also shelled from Armenia. The spokesman claimed that despite the Armenians provocative actions, the Azerbaijanis did not retaliate. Meanwhile, a spokesman for Azerbaijani President Gaydar Aliyev has dismissed as unfounded Stepanakert's demand that Aliyev address a formal truce offer to the Karabakh authorities. The Karabakh leadership has declared that only after such a request, can it respond to Grachev's proposal to cease fire. As a senior official has told INTERFAX, "there can be no more formal statements other than those made by Azerbaijan's head of state two days ago and the statement made by the Russian defense minister." In his words, "If the opposite side sincerely desires peace, such a statement by an Azerbaijani leader, reaffirmed by a top Russian mediator in the peace process would be taken as an overture of peace." He believes that by turning down the offer to cease fire, Armenia is rejecting yet another Russian peace initiative.
