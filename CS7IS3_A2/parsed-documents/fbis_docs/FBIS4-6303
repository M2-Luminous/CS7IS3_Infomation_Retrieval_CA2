Now that the ruling coalition parties have moved closer to reaching an agreement in which they will maintain the coalition government and choose Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hata as the successor to Prime Minister Hosokawa, the political turmoil has begun to show signs of subsiding. If things go smoothly, a new prime minister will be named and a new government inaugurated early next week. The prime minister's personal financial scandal triggered the collapse of the coalition government. However, in fact the Hosokawa government was on the verge of collapse after rapidly losing its centripetal force [kyushinryoku] following enactment of the Political Reform Law, which was high on the domestic agenda of the Hosokawa government. The ruling coalition parties were feuding over such major issues as reshuffling the cabinet and planning a national welfare tax; the cabinet lost its cohesiveness. The confrontation among the ruling coalition parties stemmed from their policy differences, their different policy-decision processes, their different political tactics, and their diverging perspective of the coalition government. Their confrontation abruptly surfaced in the wake of Hosokawa's announcement of his resignation. The confrontation could lead to a change in the coalition framework. There is significance in the Hosokawa government bringing about a change of government after ending one-party rule by the Liberal Democratic Party. The ruling coalition parties that were united by their consensus on the need to push for political reform formed the coalition government. Now that the Political Reform Law has been enacted, the Hosokawa cabinet has accomplished its primary mission. We hope all political parties will use Hosokawa's resignation as the best chance to rally political forces around a consensus of policies and political beliefs, transcending the framework of the LDP or non-LDP, in order to realign themselves. Even if the coalition partners formed another new coalition government to stay in power, their energy would be consumed coordinating the infighting, leaving key policy tasks unaccomplished. Politics would ultimately reach the point where politicians ratify policy decisions made by bureaucrats. While Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]; Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito; and former Deputy Prime Minister Watanabe of the LDP are making visible moves, Sakigake [Harbinger] has announced a party platform entitled "our party's basic attitude toward forming a new government." These moves are aimed at realigning the established political parties based on a consensus of policies and political beliefs. Under the present situation, where the Diet's deliberation of a draft budget for fiscal 1994 has yet to be held, it is necessary to form a new government as soon as possible and keep the current political turmoil from being protracted. In that sense, there is not enough time left to choose a candidate to succeed Hosokawa as prime minister and form a new government, all of which could lead to a full-fledged realignment of the political parties. If a new prime minister is chosen under the present coalition framework, the action may be accepted positively by the people as an emergency evacuation. The ruling coalition parties lost their common policy goals following enactment of the Political Reform Law. What are they going to do in a post-Hosokawa government? The ruling coalition parties widely differ from each other on how to reform the current tax system, how to handle North Korea's suspected nuclear development, how to shape an identical view on the state, and how to realign the established political parties. It would be lamentable if the adhesive that until now has held the ruling coalition parties together is also used as a mean to keep them in power--in other words, to keep the LDP from taking power. The political upheaval is beginning to subside because the ruling coalition parties have found it is in their interests to keep the coalition framework from collapsing, deciding to give priority to keeping themselves in power while shelving their differences over major policies and basic political beliefs. They have decided to do so based on the calculation they will face difficulty maneuvering for a majority of seats in the Diet, and do not want to abandon their savory positions as ruling parties. If the coalition government remains in power with its basic policy differences left uncoordinated, it will be a temporary government tasked with getting the 1994 budget passed in the Diet. Sooner or later, there will be full-fledged moves to realign the political parties.
