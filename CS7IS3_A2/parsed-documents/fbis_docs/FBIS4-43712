The 27 deputies from the PR [Republican Party] who, on the morning of Tuesday, 14 June, announced the creation of an independent parliamentary group and who had postponed the implementation of their decision after being "bawled out" by [Industry Minister] Gerard Longuet, stand by their intentions. Following the PR National Council meeting scheduled for 26 June, a good 60 could well split off. They would thus break up a group of 213 deputies laboriously set up just after the parliamentary elections. In this affair, individual interests, personal ambitions, animosity, lies, and threats form a framework in which it is sometimes difficult to see clearly...especially because the tactics and strategy are highly "microcosmic" and escape the understanding of the so-called grass-roots voter. While PR President Gerard Longuet, who is also one of Mr. Balladur's ministers, is urging his friends to stay in the existing single group, [Defense Minister] Francois Leotard, the same party's honorary president and a member of the same Balladur government, says he wants an independent PR group.
