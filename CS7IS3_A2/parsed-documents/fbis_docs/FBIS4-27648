The cancellation of the meeting defuses the diplomatic crisis to the satisfaction of Indonesia, which had in the first place sought to abort it as early as last November. It is a triumph of Indonesian blitz diplomacy. But the resolution of the conflict does not erase the fact that the crisis has left Philippine diplomacy in a shambles. The Philippines' handling of the crisis was an absolute disaster. The crisis inflicted on the Philippines its worst humiliation and degradation at the hands of another country since the Japanese occupation, and ironically the humiliation was administered by the Philippines' supposedly closest ally in ASEAN. Having observed closely the golden age of Philippine diplomacy during the 1950s to the 1970s, I have never seen a more inept handling of Philippine foreign relations than by the Ramos administration, and the diplomatic disaster should make us weep over the ignominy of the Republic. This essay seeks to establish responsibility for this disaster. From evidence, much of the blame rests on the usurpation of crisis management by the National Security Council (NSC) -- a function of the Department of Foreign Affairs, which has an experienced bureaucracy. When Indonesia applied the heat on us, President Ramos heeded the counsel of the NSC, headed by Gen. Jose Almonte, more than it listened to the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), which had its own recommendations to the president. Malacanang [Palace; presidential office] called, the shots on the responses to Indonesian pressure and the DFA merely echoed Palace directives. The NSC-inspired responses were characterized by panic, retreat and appeasement. The dispatch of a diplomatic mission to Jakarta headed by former Secretary of Foreign Affairs Raul Manglapus and Undersecretary Rodolfo Severino to explain the Philippine position that the conference cannot be canceled without breaching our constitutional principles of freedom of assembly and of speech failed to impress and appease authoritarian Indonesia. The mission left the impression that the Philippines acted like a tributary state to Indonesia Raya (Greater Indonesia), and the Indonesians, of course, arrogantly displayed their scorn for us. President Suharto refused to receive the delegation. According to Manglapus, Suharto was in Bogor, entertaining New Zealand Prime Minister James Bolger, who was on a state visit. Whatever the explanation, the fact is that Suharto disdainfully snubbed the mission. The government had absolutely no response, except appeasement, to the three-pronged pressure by Indonesia -- the threat of canceling the peace talks with Muslim separatist rebels hosted by Indonesia, the Indonesian boycott of the East Asian Business Conference in Davao on the East Asian economic triangle, and the detention and harassment of Filipino fishermen fishing in or near Indonesian waters. The NSC failed to consider that the threat of Indonesia's withdrawal of support for the peace talks with the separatist Muslims is partly bluff, as I shall discuss later. The economic triangle concept is at an embryonic stage, waiting for its time to come and has an economic dynamic of its own. The harassment of Filipino fishermen can be countered by diplomatic protests. The response of appeasement was premised on the assumption that relations with Indonesia must be saved at all costs because of the mistaken belief that Indonesia has been the most supportive Philippine ally in ASEAN, and therefore we owe a lot to it. This assumption flies in the face of evidence that Indonesia is as much in debt to us as we are to it because of the fact that our hosting of the U.S. military bases served as a security shield which permitted Indonesia and a host of other countries in East Asia to divert their resources to development away from costly defense expenditures. The failure to respond to the escalated Indonesian pressure and even to summon anger over Indonesia's bulldozing tactics revealed the NSC to be bankrupt in experience, imagination, and sophistication in responding to foreign relations crisis. The NSC has a de facto "think tank" composed of academics, consultants and arm-chair experts on geo-politics. Its head, Gen. Almonte, claims to have a strategic view of things and appears to have vast pretensions on geo-politics on regional and international scale, but these pretensions are not matched by NSC's performance during the crisis. Retreat and appeasement are the best proof of this bankruptcy. When the NSC's view of things collided with realpolitik, the views based on fanciful models, crumbled. I suspect that the NSC would like to believe that it is a center of strategic decision making, superior to the Department of Foreign Affairs, following the model of the U.S. National Security Council under Dr. Henry Kissinger. Under President Nixon, he depended on Kissinger for strategic decision more than he did on the State Department, but the State Department's resources were nonetheless deployed in policy and decision making, and besides, Dr. Kissinger is one of the most brilliant practitioners of realpolitik and had assembled a brilliant staff at the NSC. Almonte is no Kissinger. The undermining of the DFA began when President Ramos signed as one of his first executive orders a directive broadening the powers of the NSC to intervene in all aspects of national life. The directive said that with the end of the Cold War and with the shift in the character of conflict from armed confrontation to economic competition, the compass of national security should embrace also economic and foreign affairs. The usurpation of the functions of the DFA by the NSC was facilitated by the fact that the DFA has been depleted of senior leadership -- a vacuum which the NSC tried to fill. During the 1950s up until the 1970s, the DFA had been gifted with strong foreign ministers and a deep bench of experienced diplomats. It was led by a constellation of brilliant diplomats such as Carlos P. Romulo, S.P. Lopez, Jose Inglis, Narciso Reyes, Narciso Ramos, et al, and second line back up from people like Raul Manglapus and Leon Ma. Guerrero. These diplomats were authoritative and presidents listened to them and respected them. Moreover, foreign relations received a boost from presidents like Elpidio Quirino and Diosdado Macapagal, who had an international outlook. Foreign relations was their strong suit. By contrast, President Ramos is a man with a provincial and parochial outlook. He is a plodding leader who has no fire in his belly. He remains cool even under humiliation of the national honor. His appreciation of foreign relations is supplied mainly, by the NSC, whose depth, experience and sophistication have been found to be nil by the crisis. Moreover, there have been attempts to undermine the leadership of the DFA under Secretary Roberto Romulo. Last summer there were moves, which didn't go unnoticed by the CIA, to inquire into the medical records of Romulo in the United States, in an apparent attempt to embarrass him and to oust him from the DFA. The threat by Indonesia to withdraw support of the peace talks with Muslim separatists is partly bluff. It later on decided to allow the talks to be held in Jakarta, and this is not an act of charity. The settlement of the Muslim rebellion leading to the ending of separatism serves the interests of Indonesia as it does the Philippines. Separatism in the Philippines inspires separatism by the outer islands of Indonesia. If the separatist movement in Mindanao succeeded in dismembering the Philippines, latent separatist rebellions in Indonesia could flare up to detach themselves from the Java-centered rule in Indonesia. But in panic, the NSC forgot all about this. Because of its panic, it is extremely important to reassess the role of the shell-shocked NSC in foreign relations whose credibility crumbled during the crisis.
