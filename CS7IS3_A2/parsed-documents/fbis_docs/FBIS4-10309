Before he gave his deposition, which began at 1730 on 5 April and ended in the morning of 6 April, Aburto watched five videocassettes on the Tijuana events on 23 March, when he killed Luis Colosio. [video shows footage of Colosio walking at the Tijuana campaign rally at which the presidential candidate was shot] Images similar to this one -- sometimes in slow motion and sometimes frame by frame -- depict Aburto's part in the crime, as well as other people's contribution. A Television Azteca Network camera filmed this event on 23 March. After Aburto assassinated Colosio, many people beat and virtually crushed him. In this other shot, we can see Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela, Sr., wearing a white leather jacket. [video shows Mayoral walking behind Colosio at Tijuana campaign rally] It seems he was also beaten after initially being mistaken for the murderer because of the blood stains on him. His son, Rodolfo Mayoral Esquer, later appeared on the scene and attempted to rescue his father. It seems he was able to rescue his father, because little by little, father and son are left behind by the group that was violently apprehending Mario Aburto Martinez. Despite all depositions in the hands of judicial authorities who are trying to clarify Colosio's murder, Aburto denied in his preliminary deposition that Colosio's murder was premeditated. He also denied he knows the four people presumed to be his accomplices. He said those who appear in these videotapes and are alleged to be his accomplices are innocent. He insisted he worked alone. In addition to Aburto, Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela, Rodolfo Mayoral Esquer, Rodolfo Riva Palacio, and Tranquilino Sanchez also gave preliminary depositions. Television Azteca Network is in the position to confirm the identity of Mario Aburto Martinez. This follows claims that the person apprehended on 23 March and the one who was taken to the Almoloya de Juarez prison two days later were not the same individual. Television Azteca Network was able to film these shots when Mario Aburto, after being arrested in Lomas Taurinas, Tijuana, enters the quarters of the Attorney General's Office. This is Mario Aburto Martinez after he was cleaned up. [video shows clean-shaven Aburto behind glass, being presented to media] There are no doubts whatsoever that he is indeed the same person who murdered Colosio.
