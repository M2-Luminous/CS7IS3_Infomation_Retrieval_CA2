The following are reports from some localities: News from Sichuan today says, from January to May this year, the Sichuan provincial police cracked more than 500 drug trafficking cases, captured more than 700 drug traffickers, and seized nearly 50 kg of heroin, 13 kg of opium, and some other drugs. The province recently openly burned the seized drugs and severely punished a number of drug traffickers, of whom 14 criminals have been executed. It has been learned that, over the last few years, because the anti-drug efforts have been stepped up in Yunnan, Guangzhou, and other localities, blocking the original drug trafficking channels, some drug traffickers have turned to Sichuan, making Sichuan a new transfer point and distribution center for transit drugs.

Sentences were handed down on 29 criminals, of whom 10 -- whose death sentences had been approved by the Supreme People's Court -- were executed after their death sentences were announced.
