Charging that the United States of America is getting overheated in further arming South Korea, while increasing international pressure on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, he reaffirmed the opinion that a reasonable solution in face of the explosive situation of the Korean peninsula is not a military option but negotiation. He, on behalf of the Cuban Government and people, expressed the belief that the strain will surely be eased and the most reasonable way be opened for the DPRK Government and people in the solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula.
