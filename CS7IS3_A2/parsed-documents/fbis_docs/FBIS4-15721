The decision to publish it on the basis of OBSHCHAYA GAZETA was made by the Council of Heads of Government of the 12 states at the meeting held in Ashkhabad [Ashgabat] 23 December last year. The economic weekly's start-up money comes from equal contributions paid in by the copublisher-states. The total sum for the current year is 950 million rubles and $200,000 (the foreign currency is for equipment). From next year the newspaper is to be a self-financing operation. The editorial office of OBSHCHIY RYNOK, which finds itself in straitened circumstances (three desks and one phone for four people, which are shared with the magazine KOLOBOK), nevertheless decided not to postpone publishing a proper version but to make the pilot issue as close to the real thing as possible. It carries articles from all 12 states and devotes pages to policy statements. The new publication's journalists think that they will be able to start regular publication in the very near future.
