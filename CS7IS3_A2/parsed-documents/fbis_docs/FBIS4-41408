This was done at the presentation of a weighty report which is due tomorrow to land on the desks of the president, the prime minister, ministers, deputies, heads of administrations, bankers, and CIS leaders. In the view of the report's authors, the government's actions in the privatization sphere have been justified in the formal sense but, given the lack of an overall strategy for development, the haphazard nature of the measures and the fact that they are even divorced from reality, and given the general loss of control in the socio-economic sphere, Chubays-style headlong privatization is having quite the opposite results. Criminal economic structures are emerging instead of a layer of private owners. There are no major enterprises which could boast of success. Investment in industry is falling. There is no link between economic market processes and federative relations. The economists demand that the Russian authorities clarify the objectives of privatization and national priorities.
