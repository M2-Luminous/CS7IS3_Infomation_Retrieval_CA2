FR940511-1-00078 FR940511-1-00013 Bromide-bearing brine from the Smackover Formation is pumped to the surface and routed to the bromine plant, where it is acidified, and chlorinated to convert the bromide to bromine. The reaction generates a sodium chloride by-product which remains in the brine. The bromine then is volatilized with steam and condensed, dried, and used on site as a feedstock. Most organobromine chemicals are produced by simple one- or two-step reactions of bromine with an organic feedstock. Many of these reactions liberate hydrogen bromide gas, which is normally scrubbed in sodium hydroxide solution, forming a sodium bromide stream that often is recycled to the bromine plant. Alternatively, the gas is scrubbed with a lime suspension to produce calcium bromide, a saleable by-product. Concentrated sulfuric acid is used as a drying agent for elemental bromine. The spent acid is sold back to the sulfuric acid producer, who uses it to produce virgin sulfuric acid. At major production sites, process wastewaters containing recoverable amounts of bromine are recycled to the bromine plant for bromine recovery. The volume of these wastewater streams exceeds that of all other waste streams combined. Additionally, over 200,000 metric tons per year of unrecycled process wastewaters are generated at the two major sites from production of the five organobromine chemicals listed in the consent decree. An additional 450,000 tons of wastewaters are generated from tribromophenol manufacture. Less than 800 tons of process wastes solids are generated. These include spent filters, floor sweepings and chemical product that does not meet commercial specifications for quality_so-called ``off-spec'' product. By comparison, the amount of waste generated by the minor producers is cumulatively less than 100 tons and is divided among several dozen processes, most of which are operated only a few days per year. Due to the very low volumes and periodic generation of these wastes by the minor producers, the analysis for this listing determination focused only on the major production plants. The minor producers do not manufacture any of the products listed in the EDF consent decree. Table I summarizes the wastes and their constituents of potential concern generated from production of organobromine products studied.
