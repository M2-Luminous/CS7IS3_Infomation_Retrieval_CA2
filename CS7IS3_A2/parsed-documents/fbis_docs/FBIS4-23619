UNITA Information Secretary Jorge Valentim: [Begin Valentim recording] We have received two documents from the mediators. The mediator gave us one document which is his own, dealing with four ministerial posts. We have accepted it. We have also accepted the following: seven deputy ministry posts, six ambassadorial posts, 30 district administrator posts, 35 deputy district administrator posts, and 75 communal administrator posts. With regard to provincial governments, the mediators proposed three provincial governors for us. We accepted that. We are only adding one more province, namely the province of Huambo. With regard to UNITA's participation in district and communal administration, the government presented its stand. At the level of administrators, there is a lacuna of 10 administrators. The government left blank 10 district administrator posts. We intend to fill the posts in the interest of peace in Angola. The government also left blank 10 deputy district administrator posts and 30 communal administrator posts that we have decided to fill. Taking into account our flexibility toward the documents presented by the mediators and the government, we think that we have found a common denominator to resolve the serious problem facing our country. It is our hope that the two parties's good will continues and that the supreme leaders of the two organizations will accede to the imperatives of history so that there can be peace and national reconciliation in our country.
