However, this only shows the mood at the moment, which might be different in a few days. This is the result of a flash poll that was carried out by the OGM on Wednesday evening (500 telephone contacts that are representative of the whole of Austria): Extrapolating from these results, 42 percent of the population would vote for Austria's entry into the EU in the June referendum, 25 percent against, and 32 percent undecided.
