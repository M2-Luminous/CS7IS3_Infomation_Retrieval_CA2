FR940930-1-00048 FR940930-1-00015 A decision that modifying a line section is not feasible might be based on the nature and costs of the modification. For example, if (other than the replacement) the only modification on the line section needed to accommodate smart pigs is to replace a reduced port valve, and that modification will allow internal inspection of the entire line section, then the operator might reasonably conclude that the modification is feasible. However, if modification of the line section would require the acquisition of costly new right-of-way to straighten bends, the operator might reasonably conclude that modification is not feasible. In reconsidering the benefits and costs of modifying line sections in these less populated areas, we have considered that we expect to promulgate, in the near future, a final rule in Docket No. PS&hyph;101, Excavation Damage Prevention Programs for Gas and Hazardous Liquid and Carbon Dioxide Pipelines. The notice for this rulemaking (53 FR 24747; June 30, 1988) proposed to require gas pipeline operators to expand their damage prevention programs to cover rural areas. Any such requirement that is in the resulting final rule would increase the safety of gas pipelines in Class 1 and 2 locations from failures caused by dig-ins. Finally, with respect to existing offshore gas transmission lines, RSPA proposes to allow operators who (1) use cleaning pigs to remove condensate in offshore transmission lines and (2) inspect platform risers for corrosion to avoid modification of the complete line section when a replacement is made. The regular removal of condensates reduces the likelihood of internal corrosion and of the negative environmental impact of a large sheen in the event of a significant leak. The regular inspection of risers for corrosion by any of the effective methods available provides the necessary assurance of safety for personnel working on the platform. Requests for Information From Commenters The purpose of the questions posed below is to gather new or updated information relating to the issues in this rulemaking. Much of the data which RSPA has available were gathered in order to meet the requirement for a congressionally-mandated study on the feasibility of requiring the use of smart pigs. To obtain information for this study, RSPA solicited information from interested parties through a Federal Register notice titled ``Instrumented Internal Inspection Devices'' (54 FR 20948; May 15, 1989). The data were summarized in Table 1 of the study titled ``Instrumented Internal Inspection Devices (A Study Mandated By P.L. 100&hyph;561),'' published November 1992. Table 1 indicated that 136,359 miles of gas transmission lines and 16,275 miles of hazardous liquid pipelines would not accommodate instrumented pigs for reasons not relating to the absence of launchers or receivers. Since this rulemaking only responds to petitions for reconsideration received from the two gas pipeline trade associations, updating of the mileage figures for hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines is not relevant. RSPA invites interested persons to forward comments to the docket as directed under ADDRESSES ) that include up-to-date information on the following: (1) What is the mileage, current to December 31, 1993, of the gas transmission lines that would not accommodate smart pigs for reasons other than lack of launchers and receivers? (a) Indicate the mileage of onshore gas transmission lines affected by the final rule. (b) Indicate the mileage of offshore gas transmission lines affected by the final rule. (2) During the five calendar years, 1989 through 1993, what was the total length of replacements (actual length of replaced pipe, valves, fittings, or other line components), installed for reasons other than to accommodate smart pigs? (a) Indicate the mileage of such replacements in onshore gas transmission lines affected by the final rule. (b) Indicate the mileage of such replacements in offshore gas transmission lines affected by the final rule. (3) When replacements are made in a gas transmission line affected by the final rule, are there alternatives to making the line section accommodate smart pigs that would ensure the entire transmission line would accommodate smart pigs in a reasonable number of years? Commenters are requested to support their alternatives with appropriate data.
