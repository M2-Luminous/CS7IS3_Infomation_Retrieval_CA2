Mr Tom Hartley, national chairman of Sinn Fein, told a news conference at Westminster that links began in October 1990 with a meeting between Mr Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein deputy president, and an unnamed representative from the Government The press conference, sponsored by Left-wing Labour MPs Mr Tony Benn and Mr Jeremy Corbyn, was condemned by Tory MPs as an "abuse of privilege" and a "publicity stunt". The decision to publish Sinn Fein's version of the contacts and to lodge them in the Commons library did little to dispel the view that the "peace process" launched at Downing Street last month had become bogged down. The language used by Mr Hartley, who accused ministers of "Iying" and issuing "bogus" accounts of the communications, confirmed there had been no progress in the intervening four weeks. Sinn Fein has written to Mr Major asking for clarification of the Downing Street declaration, something the Prime Minister resolutely refuses to provide. Mr Hartley said a decision by the IRA on whether to continue with the process would not be made until there had been a response from the Government though the absence of clarification would not necessarily end the initiative. The documents, many of which have been seen before were published by Sinn Fein to back up its claim that it was justified in asking for clarification. "Throughout this record of exchanges, there are examples of clarification sought by Sinn Fein and given by the British Government," said Mr Hartley. "All this begs the question about the seriousness of the Government's approach to a peaceful settlement in Ireland." A line of communication has existed between Sinn Fein and the Government for more than 20 years and was used at the time of the Maze prison hunger strikes in 1981. According to the documents published in November by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland Secretary, the channel was reopened last February after a message from Mr McGuinness stating that "the conflict is over". Sinn Fein denies this message was ever sent and traces the communications to October 1990, followed by 18 messages between then and February 1993, when the contacts started in earnest. They included advance notification to Sinn Fein of speeches to be made by ministers and a position paper setting out the progress of inter-party talks then going on in Northern Ireland. Which side instigated last year's contacts continues to be disputed, but it is clear that events moved swiftly from last February, with discussions even at this stage about the withdrawal of troops to barracks and the removal of checkpoints. A report of a meeting on Feb 24 last year--which was not included in the British record of contacts--said: "The IRA needs to provide the space to turn the possibility of meetings into a reality. A suspension is all that is being required of them. The British believed that two or three weeks was a sufficient period to convince republicans." A later document claims that Britain was suggesting venues for talks, including Scotland, the Isle of Man, Denmark and Norway. Sinn Fein also denies having sent a message to the Government on Nov 2 last year which prompted a definitive policy statement three days later. Four documents were withheld by Sinn Fein on grounds of "sensitivity". Mr Hartley said they "have a relevance to the on-going efforts to build on the process." Lady Olga Maitland, Tory MP for Sutton and Cheam who attended the press conference accused Sinn Fein of "cynical hypocrisy". Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann said there was nothing new in the documents."That makes it absolutely outrageous that Tony Benn and Jeremy Corbyn should abuse their privileges as MPs to give a platform to a squalid terrorist gang," he said on BBC radio. "I believe that they have taken the decision to reject the declaration."
