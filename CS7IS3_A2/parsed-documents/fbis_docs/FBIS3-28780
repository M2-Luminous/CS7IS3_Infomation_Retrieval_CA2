"We are not in a situation to do so," the top government spokesman said at a news conference. Touching on the stalled talks between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) over Pyongyang's suspected nuclear arms development program, Takemura said Tokyo will continue its diplomatic efforts to help the negotiations go smoothly. Takemura's remarks came in response to a report in the major daily YOMIURI SHIMBUN that Japan, the United States and South Korea have agreed that United Nations economic sanctions will be inevitable if Pyongyang continues to block international inspections of its nuclear facilities. The YOMIURI reported that the three countries reached the accord in early February at a trilateral working-level meeting in New York. It also said Tokyo will start preparing for sanctions, such as limiting trade with Pyongyang and halting currency remittances there by North Korean residents of Japan. Talks between North Korea and the IAEA, the Vienna-based international nuclear watchdog, have been stalemated over Pyongyang's rejection of the ieae special inspections. The IAEA is expected to refer the matter to the U.N. Security Council later this month. Japan's exports to North Korea amounted to some 28.2 billion yen in 1992 and imports from that country totaled 32.6 billion yen, according to Japanese Government figures.
