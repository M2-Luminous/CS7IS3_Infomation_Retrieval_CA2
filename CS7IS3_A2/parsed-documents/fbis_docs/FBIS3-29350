Rumors have run wild since Kim Chong-il failed to appear at any events marking his 52th birthday on Wednesday, with one saying his succession was being threatened by a cut-off of foreign fund channels and another claiming he was seriously injured in a mysterious accident. "There are some foreign media speculating something bad has happened to Kim Chong-il after he made no public appearances on his birthday," a senior official at the Joint Chiefs of Staff headquarters said. "But we have found no signs of any problem related to Kim," he said. He recalled that foreign media had engaged in similar speculation when Kim did not appear publicly for periods in the past, adding that defense officials were nevertheless keeping a close watch on North Korea and all affairs related to the younger Kim. Meanwhile, Yi Ki-taek, chairman of the opposition Democratic Party, said he had been told of the rumors concerning Kim Chong-il by "a person in the U.S. Government" four days ago. Speaking to local and foreign journalists who swarmed his office to query him about remarks made earlier in the day that Kim seemed to have been seriously injured, Yi apparently stepped back from the rumor, saying, "He is a reliable source but he said his information had yet to be confirmed independently."
