He summed up in the interview the results of the second all-European conference on the ministerial level on cooperation in the struggle against drug addiction, which came to a close here. The conference was attended by representatives of 32 member states of the Council of Europe, as well as those which have the status of specially invited at that organisation. "We regard the invitation of Russia to this forum as one more step on the way towards Russia's integration in the united Europe and the joining of the Council of Europe. This is why we are attaching special importance to it," Yerin stressed. "In my opinion, the conference provided a good basis for the development of cooperation in the struggle against drug addiction as a social phenomenon and against drug trafficking, which is closer to the tasks facing law-enforcement agencies," he continued. According to his estimate, the Strasbourg conference was unanimous in the general political, social and professional assessment of that phenomenon. It outlined the main directions of work, which open up broad prospects for the development of cooperation both on the European level and within the framework of bilateral contacts, specifically, in the expansion of preventive work and joint actions in the spheres, which are within the competence of law-enforcement agencies. "Such conferences are not only of major political importance, but also of much practical interest, because they make it possible for every country to advance, using the experience of other countries. We shall use international experience as much as we can, specifically, when coming up with legislative initiatives and submitting them to parliament through the government and the president," Yerin said.
