FR940930-0-00116 FR940930-0-00021 The wording of proposed §67.36, as well as other proposed amendments described in the notice of proposed rulemaking, are unchanged in this final rule. Regulatory Evaluation This rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. As discussed earlier in this preamble, this rulemaking clarifies the citizenship requirements of a trust as a vessel-owning entity, corrects certain errors and omissions made in the 1993 final rule which revised 46 CFR part 67, clarifies a cross-reference with regard to calculation of fees for copies of instruments and documents, and addresses the statutorily required endorsements for vessels employed in towing and dredging. These matters are administrative in nature and do not have any economic impacts on the regulated public. Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ), the Coast Guard must consider whether this rulemaking will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' may include (1) small businesses and not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields and (2) governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000. The Coast Guard expects the impact of this proposal to be minimal because it only clarifies the structure of a trust as a vessel-owning entity, corrects certain errors and omissions made in the 1993 final rule which revised 46 CFR part 67, clarifies a cross-reference with regard to calculation of fees for copies of instruments and documents, and addresses the statutorily required endorsements for vessels employed in towing or dredging. This proposal would bring the regulations into conformity with current policy and practice. These matters are administrative in nature and do not have any economic impacts on the regulated public. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This proposal contains no collection-of-information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this rulemaking under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that it does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rulemaking and concluded that under section 2.B.2. of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. This rule has been determined to be categorically excluded because the changes are administrative in nature and clearly have no environmental impact. A ``Categorical Exclusion Determination'' is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under ADDRESSES.
