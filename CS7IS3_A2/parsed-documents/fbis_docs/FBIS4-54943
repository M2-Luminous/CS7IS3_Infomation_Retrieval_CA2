You spoke about 100,000 people and that the pronation parties, political groupings, and people ought to demonstrate that they did not want a left-wing victory. [Csurka] This is the third time I have been asked a question like this this evening, as if there were a secret service here wanting to know what I am planning, and whether I am taking the Hungarian people to the streets. That is not my intention. I know what we must do. We must organize anew the Hungarian Way and the Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP] on a professional basis. We have not had the money or financial resources for this so far. It will become clear now upon whom we can count. Do not expect me to tell the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], which has really come to power, what I plan. What I will say is that this victory is not the victory of the Hungarian Socialist Party, but the victory of the SZDSZ, because this government will be directed by the SZDSZ and it will function in accordance with the interests stipulated by the foreign supporters of the SZDSZ.
