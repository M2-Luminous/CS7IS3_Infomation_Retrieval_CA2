FBIS4-31280 "dreeu110_p_94011" FBIS-EEU-94-110 Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 POLAND _O_Reaction to Amoco Withdrawal From Agreement _O_Reaction to Amoco Withdrawal From Agreement 94P20852A 94P20852A CSO [Editorial Report] In a move that could forecast similar actions by other foreign oil companies investing in Poland, Amoco was reported in the 26 April RZECZPOSPOLITA, based on "unofficial sources," to be planning to withdraw from its agreement with the Polish Republic signed 2 October 1992 ``to explore and exploit'' oil and gas deposits following initial borings that located only ``small amounts of gas.'' The Warsaw daily further reported that Amoco had purchased land parcels south of Lodz and also in the southeast of Poland near the border with Ukraine for $8 million. Amoco also planned, according to the report, to invest a further $22 million, a fact that was unofficially confirmed by Polish Oil and Gas Engineering (PGNiG). That information was seemingly contradicted by Eryk Mistewicz's article in the 15 May WPROST, entitled ``Poland for the Poles,'' which reported that Amoco was ``suspending'' a much larger sum, ``several hundreds of millions of dollars'' worth of investments. A second contract, allowing Amoco to search for methane in the hard-oal deposits of Upper Silesia, was, until recently, praised as the Ministry of Environmental Protection's ``greatest accomplishment.'' WPROST noted that the company ``retains the right to withdraw'' from the second contract, although it is not clear if it indeed intends to do so. WPROST asserts that Amoco ``had planned'' to extract 5 billion cubic meters of methane annually, ``with reserves estimated at 1.2 trillion cubic meters''--which would mean an investment of $2-3 million ``in each of the 400-square kilometers of surface awarded in the concession,'' according to head geologist Michal Wilczynski. Sejm Deputy Radoslaw Gawlik of UW (Freedom Union) complains that, if Amoco withdraws from the contract, ``the losses would be obvious,'' forcing Poland to continue reliance on Russian imports, amounting to ``almost 7 billion cubic meters'' annually. The Upper Silesian area would also get none of the ``ecological relief'' promised by Amoco production. The Tax Exemption Issue ``Officially,'' Amoco representatives say one reason for their withdrawal is the issue of the ``all too-short'' tax exemption, RZECZPOSPOLITA reports, based on ``well-informed sources.'' The current law, dated December 1988, allows companies with foreign capital up to three years tax exempt status. The world standard for oil companies, however, is to allow a period of seven to 10 years before expecting a profit. Nor was Amoco pleased that it was not exempt from the VAT [value-added tax] during the exploration period. While a June 1991 amendment to the law allowed companies formed under the 1988 law--including Amoco--to retain their tax exempt status as originally granted, a new condition was added at the beginning of this year, forfeiting the tax exempt status of any company formed under the 1988 law that had not yet begun economic activity nor had, by 31 March 1994, conducted its first commercial transaction. Forfeiture could be avoided if the company met at least two conditions: The contribution of the foreign party to the statutory capital had to exceed the equivalent of 2 million ECU's, and the company had to either a) undertake its activity in regions of high unemployment, b) ensure implementation of new technology, or c) sell at least 20 percent of its goods and services for export. In accordance with the 1991 law, the tax relief cannot be higher than the value of the acquisition or the assumption of shares by the foreign entity. Thus, the exemption from income tax cannot be higher than the amount committed by the foreign entity to purchase the company's capital. RZECZPOSPOLITA notes that, on the basis of its information, there was no deviation from that principle. The entities now benefiting from tax exemptions either received them on the basis of the earlier 1988 law or have not exceeded in tax benefits the amount of their capital involvement. Blaming the Government The 15 May WPROST article viewed the Amoco situation less from an economic situation than from a political one, attributing it to a ``three-part'' ping-pong game between Amoco, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Environmental Protection. While the ministers of finance in each of the governments since the agreement was signed acknowledged that demands for tax exempt status were valid and assured Amoco that ``necessary decisions'' were forthcoming, Amoco ``continued to wait.'' WPROST further placed some of the blame for Amoco's departure on the resignation of Finance Minister Marek Borowski (a member of the Democratic Left Alliance), quoting the Amoco director in Poland, Karl F. Arleth, as saying the day after Borowski's resignation that ``we no longer felt welcome'' in Poland. According to WPROST, Amoco ``understood'' that ``all previously enacted settlements would no longer be respected'' and quoted Arleth that the company never expected special tax consideration but only ``to be treated in accordance with the rules of the oil business throughout the world.'' Indeed, WPROST reports that, while Amoco expected to ``wait a while'' for results, it later ``warned'' the Ministry of Environmental Protection that it had no intention of negotiating the conditions for the already signed contract ``for eternity.'' WPROST asserted that ``directors of other companies have also expressed their disillusionment'' and elsewhere notes that ``today, British Gas, Exxon, and Shell have the same problems in Poland and are not advancing in their work.'' An unnamed ``head of one of the oil comapnies represented in Poland'' is quoted as saying that, in both Poland and Russia, ``not much'' has happened, ``despite many contracts having been signed.'' ``Everyone always wants more time,'' he said, but added that ``after all, Poland simply does not have the number of deposits that Russia has.'' RZECZPOSPOLITA, in turn, notes that British Gas is currently drilling in the Lodz area and that ``Exxon Shell'' intends to drill in the area east of Poznan. A General Downturn In addition to the small deposits located in Poland thus far, RZECZPOSPOLITA offered a less politically involved reason for Amoco's departure: Last year, international oil suffered a ``serious drop'' in profits as a result of lower prices for crude oil. Citing FORTUNE magazine, it noted that oil companies around the world have dropped in the Fortune 500 list of major corporations, including Exxon, Elf Aquitaine, and the Spanish Repsol, which, RZECZPOSPOLITA noted, had also considered investing in Poland but decided against it. With Amoco dropping from 12th to 13th place in the list of leading oil companies, ``it is very likely that, because there was little chance of making a big profit, Poland was simply crossed off the list.''
