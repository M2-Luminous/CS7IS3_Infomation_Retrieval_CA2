ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action amends the Class E airspace at the Portland International Airport, Portland, OR. Establishment of a new instrument approach procedure requires additional controlled airspace for the procedure. The Class E airspace will be depicted on aeronautical charts for pilot reference when the new approach procedures become effective. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 UTC, June 23, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ted Melland, ANM&hyph;536, Federal Aviation Administration, Docket No. 93&hyph;ANM&hyph;42, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056, Telephone: (206) 227&hyph;2536. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On February 23, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend the Class E airspace for the Portland International Airport, Portland, OR (59 FR 8568). Except for a typographical omission of one line in the description, and reconsideration and deletion of another line in the description, this rule is the same. No additional airspace, except that required for the new procedure, is required to compensate for those omissions and deletions. Interested parties were invited to participate in the rulemaking process by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they desired. No comments were received. Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued use of the terms ``control zone extension'' and ``transition area,'' replacing them with the designation ``Class E airspace.'' Class E airspace designations for airspace areas extending upward from the surface of the earth, and Class E airspace designations for airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet above ground level, are published in Paragraphs 6003 and 6005 respectively, of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 as of September 16, 1993 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designations listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The coordinates in this final rule are in North American Datum 83. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations amends Class E airspace at Portland, Oregon. It will provide controlled airspace for a new instrument approach procedure at the Portland International Airport. Amendment of the Class E airspace will result in greater safety and efficiency at, and in the vicinity of, the airport. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
