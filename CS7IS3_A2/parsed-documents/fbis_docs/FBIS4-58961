Some interpreted the fact that Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah yesterday contacted Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid as perhaps an indication of a new understanding of the difficulty of settling the Yemeni crisis by military means, or a desire to "avoid Arab isolation" and to avoid charges of "arrogance of power" being made against the leadership in Sanaa. [passage omitted] On the military front, the fighting has continued between the two sides. Sanaa sources said that north Yemeni forces have occupied al-'Anad airbase and opened al-Dali' road to Aden, which they expected to fall soon. The northern command was so confident yesterday that it transported a number of correspondents, including an AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT correspondent, to a point the sources said was "nearest to Aden." Probably in the area of al-'Alam or Dar Sa'd, but there has been no confirmation of that. Commenting on that, a highly placed Socialist Party [YSP] source said that that was part of the media campaign aimed at weaking the morale of the southern forces. He wondered why Sanaa neglected to mention the battles against al-'Amaliqah units in the Abyan Governorate, where access to Aden is much easier than access through al-Dali' road in the Lahij Governorate. The YSP source stressed that it would be impossible for the northern forces to reach Aden. He also denied that the al-'Anad airbase (in the Lahij Governorate) had fallen to these forces. He said the southern forces had secured the al-Dali' road after wiping out a northern battalion that was moving from Mukayris (in the north of the Abyan Governorate) to Lawdar (in the center) to reinforce al-'Amaliqah forces. He added that another battalion was destroyed as it tried to escape to al-Rahah area near al-Kabsi camp where remnants of the northern 2nd Armored Brigade are situated. Another source said that southern forces deployed in the area between Karish and Mukayris captured a number of tanks and an entire infantry battalion and were advancing towards Ta'izz, and also that the artillery brigade in Yarim joined the Basuhayb Brigade and in doing so completely blocked the al-Dali' road in the face of the northern forces trying to advance on Aden. The source added that the situation in Aden was calm today and that employees have returned to their offices. As far as fighting in the Abyan Governorate against al-'Amaliqah forces is concerned, southern sources said they expected the battles there to be decided today, now that the town of Zinjibar was under control with the northern units retreating towards al-'Urqub. [passage omitted] The sources said that the delay in settling the situation in Abyan was due to the fact that the northern forces used Iraqi fighting expertise and used tactics unknown to the southern forces, such as withdrawing from an area after mining it and then storming it heavily after the entry of southern light forces (infantry and militia), and also due to the fact that low-flying aircraft were mistaken by the southerners for their own until they suddenly started to bomb them, which hampered the liquidation of al-'Amaliqah pockets there. [passage omitted] Eyewitnesses in Aden yesterday saw 30 southern aircraft taking off in the direction of the positions of al-'Amaliqah in the Abyan Governorate. Western diplomats said that was going to be the "decisive battle to expel the northern forces from the south." Southern sources say that an Eritrean pilot, an Iraqi pilot, and an Egyptian pilot from the extremist groups were being interrogated and will be shown to the Arab League delegation. Aden television showed a family of 11, five of them killed by indiscriminate northern shelling of al-Sharj. [passage omitted]
