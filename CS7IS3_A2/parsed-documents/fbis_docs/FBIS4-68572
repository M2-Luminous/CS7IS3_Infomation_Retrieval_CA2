In my opinion, there are enough clear ideas about the place, role and weight of a democratic opposition because this resource is exploited in global, strategic issues such as national state-building. Unfortunately, recent events have not helped to embody these ideas in practice so they have remained more on the theoretical level. In Azerbaijan the basic political contradictions that still remain in the nature of relations between the opposition and those in power consist of reasons which characterize the standoff between empire and national liberation. Other reasons often seem to be of secondary importance. In general, because the movement we have described as a national liberation struggle is democratic in nature, we evaluate it as a democratic movement. It is only natural that if our movement is connected with leading democratic processes in the world, another reason is that it is based in the national characteristics of Azerbaijani society itself. The basic political goal of democratic opposition forces in Azerbaijan is to achieve representation through the realization of the basic goals of their program in the government. It is completely natural that this issue is distorted in official propaganda channels so that in the public mind it appears as an ugly, immoral concept. Through television and the press, it is interpreted to mean that coming into the government is in the interests of certain individuals or groups, but this is not a step forward for the people, etc. It is clear that official information policy is directed at disarmament and away from national democratic values. Independent polls confirm that the influence of the government among the population continues to fall. The reasons for this are published frequently in the opposition newspapers. It suffices to say that it is difficult to speak of future directions in any sector. Coming to the consistently stressed issue of the unique role of the government in safeguarding stability within the society, this is exaggerated, and the value of the intelligent, calm comportment of the democratic opposition is reduced to nothing under wartime conditions. As for all kinds of problems, blaming them on the conflict with Armenia and justifying the slowdown in needed reforms seems meaningless. Incompetence, bribery and corruption have led to a national catastrophe which has reached to the level of a national tragedy. Superficially, it appears that the opposition which has changed to more passive activity, should dwell more on internal organizational questions so that when the present powerholders who, under the new conditions, lack administrative ability and the democratic habits brought about by this are defeated, they can come into the government without difficulty. We have to mention that among some opposition forces the habit of lying in ambush exists. I want to mention two dangerous aspects of this. The first demands the creation of extreme conditions and is connected to the hope that the question of a change in government will be resolved through external influences, and that the passiveness of the society and the population will help. For example, the period of the events of last summer were like this. The population was not on the side of the rebels, it was occupied with their traveling to Baku, etc. It is clear that extreme conditions are not in the interest of the nation. The second dangerous aspect is that public opinion is created counter to the national interest as the result of a policy of waiting. For democrats engaged in political activity, this is unforgivable. One is in the position that there can be a sudden social explosion of a people whose way of life is becoming gradually worse. Under such conditions, saboteur circles managed from Moscow will fertilize the field, and the probability of a catastrophe increases. All this gives opposition forces cause to think. We do not claim to teach intelligence to the powers that be. But they have to understand that their level of responsibility for any kind of national catastrophe is all the greater. Very serious, troublesome work which requires courage stands before us. This is essentially connected to the war. The hopes of the government and the democratic opposition, who have sacrificed thousands from its ranks for the Fatherland since the Armenia-Azerbaijan war began, are the same. And generally, the war which drew the democratic opposition into relative passivity is also a factor. It is natural that such passivity is spiritually justifiable. But there is a question put forward by the national interest that the democratic opposition must think about carefully in their work. Their political habits should not be such that stability is violated in the name of covering up their lack of capability in their work style which would give those in government the needed excuses to undermine the democratic opposition. Since a change in government is an historical and natural process (the discussion is on a legal change of government), they have to discuss strategic questions and they must make their move to come into the government in an only partially known environment. It is also necessary to consider every kind of environment which could be created. The primary duty of the democratic opposition is to organize, and this work occurs at various levels. This question means purifying and strengthening their ranks, and a change in quality. There are not a few individuals in whom representatives of democratic forces have lost confidence who served at various levels of the former government, and who have been forgotten by the people; it is not desirable that they return to political activity in the ranks of the democratic opposition. They could be obstacles in the struggle for public opinion. It is clear that this is a psychological question and democratic organizations must cross this psychological barrier without falling into internal fragmentation! Many articles in the opposition press have been devoted to analysis of the democrats' fall from government last June. While most of these were both objective and subjective, basically, the objective reasons were more discussed. Only one must not forget the subjective because the speculations on the mechanism by which the ranking oppositionists were overthrown are narrow. There is basis to think that the subjective anatomy of the government change which took place following the July events have not been revealed. In my opinion, leaders of the democratic opposition, including the renewed leadership of the APF [Azerbaijan People's Front], must pay attention to this question. They were damaged because of the shrinking social basis of the democrats. The most difficult and troublesome work will be to revive this basis; this includes the activity on the direction of building a correct idea among the population about national-democratic values which have been exposed to a certain amount of deformation. Propaganda should not be conducted in the framework of traditional government-opposition contradictions, but in the sector of explaining the nature of the freedoms and values we have mentioned. In other words, not propaganda creating a sense of primitive confrontation, and imbued with a sense of psychological superiority. The question of the transition to a market economy still conveys a declarative character. It appears that those in the government do not have too much interest in this. The stalling of reforms and the widespread bribery and corruption has impeded business structures which had just begun to be formed by businessmen, and a natural flow of capital in the republic abroad is taking place. The democratic opposition must be turned into the spokesman of the representatives of free economic striving. Those leading the way in this expression will be found. But if we wish to make the transition to a market economy, if we wish to understand the advantage of this to the state, create the economic grounds for social guarantees for the poor, and the importance of economic freedom in society, we must not stint on every kind of political-spiritual and intellectual aid for the development of free business. And the reasons impeding this development must be explained clearly to the people. If every opposition organization were to prepare concrete programs of economic reform and turn these over for discussion among business circles, then it would be an excellent proof of the seriousness of an opposing force. There is much talk about shortcomings in the constitution. If a constitutional commission were to be organized by the opposition to discuss alternatives (despite the presence of opposition representatives on the state commission), and if they were to prepare an alternate draft, it would not be bad. One could hold a campaign of constitutional discussions by the opposition. The democratic opposition must reach conclusions and actively publicize clear directions of needed reforms connected with the question of building the country. Because this question has been moribund, state institutions are not operating. The democrats must clarify for themselves how they want to view an independent state at the upper, middle and lower echelons, and conduct reforms for the sake of the nation's interests. The last government stalled on this issue and was compelled to work in structures inherited from the empire. A more important question consists of the democratic opposition's bringing dynamism into foreign policy. Concepts in public opinion about foreign contacts guaranteeing that they will not cease to back our independence are weak. Some steps taken by the present government in foreign policy and the policy followed during the democrats' government are manifestations of this. In other words, the present government understands that only pro-Russian contacts increase the possibility of Moscow's breaking up our independent state and, as a consequence, would drive them from the government. The idea has been widely spread that processes in Russia influence the real situation in Azerbaijan. Setting aside the correctness of this idea, the channels of such influence have still not been clarified. Efforts by Moscow to tie Azerbaijan to itself through militarily siding with Armenia and to preserve its geopolitical influences in the Caucasus region raise the obvious question as to whether this is the Russian strategy and a visible side of its policy. The ways to fight against this are also clear. The invisible side is no less dangerous; it serves to shake our national security from within and serves the obstructions in building the state. There is a need for more clarification here. In higher and middle-level state structures, Moscow's seen and unseen cadres are in action. The leadership, by keeping the former in their positions, demonstrates that it is following a competent policy with regard to Moscow. As for Moscow, it uses them to put pressure on the leadership and to implement concrete sabotage scenarios if they do not bow to this. This is a mechanism which preserves the republic under Moscow's control while at the same time preventing the development of healthy political relations within the republic. We have to say that this mechanism also functioned in the time of the preceding government. In March, April and May of last year the future of this mechanism came into question through the activity of Western diplomacy. From this standpoint, the clarification of the subjective anatomy of the June events is rather important. One question that cannot be forgotten is that the West can increase its own activism in Caucasian politics after the restoration of democratic laws in Azerbaijan. Realization of this would coincide with the neutralization of imperial influences in the region. One can say that ideological differences between organizations of the democratic opposition are slight. There is objective room for cooperation. The question of interorganizational liaison must, in general, be turned into norms of political behavior, and, from the spiritual standpoint, this is also useful for public opinion. It is natural that no individual or organization can take responsibility for pulling Azerbaijan out of the crisis alone. A coalition must be built among the opposition organizations. Perhaps the former power of the APF was a coalition by its nature. This was justified by the times. The content of the APF is changing according to conditions and, having broken up its organization, we are now preserving an internal sense of definition which knows its limits.
