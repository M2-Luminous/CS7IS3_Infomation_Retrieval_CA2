FR941007-0-00087 FR941007-0-00024 Two comments discussed the application of Regulation 26 to unmanned vessels. One comment recommended that unmanned vessels be exempted from the requirement to have a shipboard oil pollution emergency plan aboard. The comment pointed out that there will be no one aboard to use the plan and no place to store it. The other comment questioned whether U.S. flag manned or unmanned tank barges will be required to carry approved plans. The Coast Guard recognizes the need to specifically address the requirements for manned and unmanned vessels. Accordingly, §151.27(a) has been revised. All manned vessels subject to the regulation must carry on board a shipboard oil pollution emergency plan approved by the Coast Guard. For unmanned vessels subject to the regulation, the notification list required in §151.25(b)(3) must be carried on board in the documentation container. The remaining sections of the plan must be maintained at the vessel's home office. One comment suggested that language exempting vessels ``constructed or operated in such a manner that no oil can be discharged from any portion thereof, intentionally or unintentionally *␣*␣*'' be deleted because there is no guarantee that oil will not be spilled. The Coast Guard agrees with this suggestion and has revised §151.09(d)(2) to state more clearly which vessels are exempted. One comment requested clarification on the tonnage to be used in determining the applicability to offshore marine service vessels. The Coast Guard maintains that tonnage requirements are clearly defined and does not agree that further clarification is necessary. Another comment pointed out that dedicated oil spill response vessels (OSRVs), including dedicated tank barges, should be specifically exempted when not carrying cargo in bulk or when operating in spill response areas as designated by the Federal On-scene Coordinator (FOSC). The Coast Guard does not agree with this comment because the requirements of Regulation 26 apply to all ships that carry oil. 3. Ships of Countries not Party to MARPOL One comment expressed concern that non-party states may be afforded more favorable treatment than party states. The Coast Guard does not agree with this comment. As discussed in §151.29, ships operating under the authority of a country that is not a party to MARPOL, must comply with §151.21 of this rule while in the navigable waters of the United States. However, the Coast Guard has amended the definition of ``shipboard oil pollution emergency plan'' to clarify the requirements for non-party states. 4. Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plans Plan format. Two comments addressed the format of the plan. One contended that the format and the language of the plan was too inflexible. The comment further stated that owners should be permitted to deviate from form as long as the content of the plan satisfied the requirements. The other comment stressed that the plan would be more useful in an emergency if it were a uniform, fleetwide plan. To further international consistency and in recognition of such plans, the Coast Guard has adopted the framework of the plan as set out in the IMO guidelines. The Coast Guard has determined that the plan allows for sufficient flexibility. However, the material within the required sections can be developed with some flexibility by owners and operators so they can be designed around their own ship's operations. Furthermore, requiring owners and operators to create their own plans is preferable to having a uniform plan. The Coast Guard has determined that it helps them become familiar with their own procedures, making them better prepared for an emergency. Two comments suggested that the format proposed in the NPRM should be in accordance with Resolution MEPC.54(32). One of these comments also suggested that the Coast Guard accept and approve plans formatted in five sections in accordance with Resolution MEPC.54(32), as well as those formatted in seven sections as specified in the NPRM. The Coast Guard will continue to require that seven sections be included in the plan. These seven sections contain the same information as the five sections in the Resolution MEPC.54(32). The Coast Guard has only reorganized the numbering to include the required ``Introduction'' and ``Appendices'' as additional sections. This organizational change was made to prevent misinterpretation of the requirements and help ensure that all requirements are incorporated into the plan. The Coast Guard has added a sample index in Table 151.26(b)(8) of the rule to help the owner or operator properly prepare the plan.
