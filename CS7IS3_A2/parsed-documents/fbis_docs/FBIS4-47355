Only seven were developed in 1990, and at present, more than 70 percent of proved oil reserves are now being developed. In 1992, the Russian Federation recovered 385 million tonnes of oil and gas condensate, which accounted for about 85 percent of all oil recovered in the CIS. Of all the oil recovered in the Russian Federation, 67.0 came from Western Siberia. An analysis of current and projected development of 11 oil deposits managed by the associations of the Glavtyumenneftegaz revealed that by the year 2000, oil recovery will increase at 6 of them. These six deposits are relatively small, however, and the increased oil recovery from them will not offset the decreases in oil recovery activity projected at the deposits of the Nizhnevartovsk, Megion, and Langepis associations. The association Nizhnevartovsk (the largest of the 11 associations) accounted for 19.8 percent of all oil recovered in 1993 and is projected to remain the leader in oil recovery through 1995 (accounting for 17.8 percent of the oil recovered. By 2000, however, it is projected to drop to third place behind the associations Yugansk and Surgut. The percentage of ``rejuvenation'' of the oil recovered by the associations Pur, Urengoy, Megion, and Krasnoleninsk has been calculated at about 40 percent, and a figure of 22 percent has been calculated for the region as a whole. The All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Petroleum Refining has studied virtually all new deposits in Western Siberia. The following have been deemed the most interesting: Priobskaya (heavy with high sulfur and paraffin contents and a 45 percent maximum yield of light fractions, a valuable raw material for jet fuel, and interesting as a source for high-viscosity base oils and vacuum distillate for catalytic or hydrocracking; Kharampurskaya (heavy with a low sulfur content, high paraffin content, and 64 percent maximum yield of light fractions and promising as a source of gasoline with an octane number of 59, jet fuel, winter diesel fuel, and low-viscosity boiler fuel); Severno-Komsomolskaya (heavy with a high sulfur content, virtually free of gasoline fractions, and a source of components of jet and diesel fuels and low pour-point oils not requiring dewaxing); and Sugmutskaya (a high-sulfur, low-paraffin, high-potential oil that may with deep refining yield virtually all types of low-sulfur fuels and good-quality base oils). By the year 2000, the amount of high-sulfur oil produced by the Glavtyumenneftegas will increase from 52.5 to 55.2 percent; however, the mean-weighted content of sulfur in both high- and low-sulfur oils will decrease somewhat. The oil recovery situation is not nearly as serious in other areas of Russia as in Western Siberia. The most promising oils in the European part of Russia are the following recently discovered oils of the Timanovo-Pechorsk region and the shelves of the Baltic, White, Barents, and Okhotsk seas: Kharyaginskaya (a paraffin content of 21 percent, a possible source of jet fuel, and potential 19.4 percent content of base oils with a viscosity index of 98), Peschanoozerskaya (low-sulfur, 84 percent content of light fractions to 350ï¿½C, and source of TS-1 jet fuel and summer and winter diesel fuels with a viscosity index of 99), Kaliningradskaya, and Sakhalinskaya.
