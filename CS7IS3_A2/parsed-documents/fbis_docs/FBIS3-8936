The Russian politician attended the congress as a guest. Bryczkowski said that a strong Russia was the guarantor of the existing European borders. "No one should think that Polish borders can be guaranteed by NATO," Bryczkowski added. Zhirinovsky, whom Bryczkowski described as "a great friend of Poland," told the congress that Russia had no territorial pretentions and its army would never move on the West. He also added that Russia would not allow Western armies to come through Poland to the east. The Russian guest stressed the need for pan-Slavic solidarity in which Russia and Poland had great roles to play. At a press conference held before the congress debates, Zhirinovsky claimed that Russia was already changing its policies in tune with his party's programme. He explained that President Yeltsin had to come to respect the outcome of the parliamentary elections in which the Liberal Democrats won 25 percent of the vote. Zhirinovsky admitted he hoped for the removal of Andrey Kozyrev and Sergey Shahrai from the Russian Government by next June. Asked about his earlier pronouncements which questioned the existing Polish borders, the Russian politician said that the best possible border between Poland, Russia and Germany is the sea border on the Baltic.
