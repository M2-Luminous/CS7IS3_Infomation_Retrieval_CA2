Dolgopyatova: "I Will Ask My Neighbor Who To Vote For"] [Text] One week before the elections to the City Assembly, do the voters know at least something about the candidates and the coalitions they represent? Do Petersburg residents intend to vote at all? To get an answer to these questions I positioned myself, tape recorder in hand, during rush hour, when people are on their way home from work, in front of the building at 17 Bolshaya Monetnaya Street, which houses two Petrogradskiy Rayon district electoral commissions--No. 40 and No. 41. Here are some typical answers. Kapitolina Alekseyevna Kholopova, pensioner: "I will vote. I am not yet familiar with the candidates, so I plan to stop at the electoral commission right now. You see, the candidate for whom we had collected signatures in our microrayon later removed himself from the race. I recently attended a meeting with another candidate, but I have forgotten his name. I will ask my neighbor." A young woman who refused to give her name: "I am not going anywhere. I am up to my ears in work and family; I have no time for elections." Next passerby--two young men: "No, we are not going anywhere; actually, we have no idea where to go and who to vote for. No one has enlightened us." Valentina Petrovna, pensioner: "I do not know the candidates. In my opinion, the preparations for the elections have been handled very poorly this time. I think that a serious mistake has been made on the part of the election organizers. City residents have practically no information. We now do not even see candidates for deputy on television, where one could at least somehow form an opinion and learn about the candidates' programs." A young man, first-time voter: "We had the leaflets of some candidate plastered on the wall in our apartment building entrance, but I do not really know even his name. Since elections are being held, I have to vote, although I do not see any difference in principle whether a City Assembly gets elected or not. After all, we live without one now..." Yelena Shevchenko answers, holding two toddlers by the hand: "I am not going to vote because I do not trust or believe any candidate." An elderly woman: "I have not heard anything on the radio--who we are supposed to vote for; we are waiting for information." [Dolgopyatova] Do you not know that this time there will be no such detailed information on each candidate either on the radio or on television? Perhaps it would be better to stop by the district electoral commission and ask about the candidates' programs? [Woman] And where is our electoral commission? [Dolgopyatova] Right here, where we are standing now--at 17 Bolshaya Monetnaya. [Woman] I did not know. And how many candidates do we have? There are 15 candidates registered at Electoral District No. 40, and 16 in district No. 41. So Petrogradskiy Rayon residents will have to make a rather difficult choice--provided it takes place at all. Igor Yuryevich Zabrodin, chairman of the No. 40 commission, also has doubts that the elections will be successful: "Even if the voters turn out for the first round of elections, I have great doubts that they will show up for the second. Spring is on the way; everybody tries to get to their private plots on weekends," says Zabrodin. "Actually, we should take it in stride. In all countries only 40-50 percent of the population take an active civic stance. The others simply are not interested. It is another matter, however, that no other country has such "uncultured" elections. I mean the inability and lack of desire on the part of electoral blocs to unite. Many programs differ little from each other and practically proclaim truisms, which everybody knows by heart. But if you all advocate the same thing, why not field three or five candidates in the district instead of 15? I believe that in Petrogradskiy Rayon, instead of each three candidates, one could by agreement represent several coalitions." ...Well, all we have to do is wait and see what the voters will say and what they will do; in any event, theirs is the last word.
