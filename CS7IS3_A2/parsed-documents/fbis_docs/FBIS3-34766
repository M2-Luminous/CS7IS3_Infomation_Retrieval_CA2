At the conclusion of meetings held resulting in a "joint program" between them, Fatah and the PPP decided to form "field coordination committees to pursue joint cooperation and act as joint authorities working for the development of relations, cooperation, and settlement of any problems which might arise." The first such committee will be in Jerusalem, the second in Gaza, and the third in Tunis. The latest edition of the Fatah bulletin issued by Fatah's Central Committee in Tunis said that the cooperation program with the PPP is in the context of the "dialogue with the vital and effective forces to consolidate national unity, contain attempts to impose division and fragmentation, and close the door in the face of the advocates of sedition and infighting." It likened it to the agreement concluded "between the cadres of Fatah and the Hamas fighters" which had a good effect in preventing sedition and in providing more scope for dialogue and democracy which respects the right to disagree. The 11-point cooperation program, the text of which it published, stressed that the Declaration of Principles "is an instrument of struggle to which we respond to the degree it helps in the implementation of all parts and provisions of Security Council Resolution 242 in a manner that would ensure full withdrawal from all the occupied Palestinian territories." Fatah and the PPP emphasized that the Palestinian National Authority approved by the Palestine Central Council in its session last October should be considered as the authority "responsible for all aspects of the Palestinian people's life in the areas from which the occupation forces withdraw...and its powers should be extended to include the rest of the West Bank including Jerusalem." The two sides said that the criteria of the economic negotiating plan should be based "on economic independence, self-reliance, and Arab integration, and that progress in these negotiations should be made conditional on progress in the political negotiations." Fatah and the PPP underscored the "democratic nature of the Palestinian National Authority and its respect for human rights, plurality, and the principle of free democratic elections as the basis of legislative and executive authority resulting from political and legislative general elections."
