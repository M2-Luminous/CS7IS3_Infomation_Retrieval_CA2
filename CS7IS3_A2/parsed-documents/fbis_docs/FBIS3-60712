We consider it necessary to strengthen control over nuclear materials, and a new draft of the control system has been worked out exactly for this purpose,'' the academician noted. According to Aleksandr Rumyantsev, one of the main think tanks of the draft system, at present control over nuclear materials is based on data from the institute's accounts department. In the future the emphasis will be made on the results of physical measurements of materials which will allow to know a specific situation practically every week. At the same time the administration of the scientific center intends to take stock of nuclear products on a regular basis. The draft of a new control system has been prepared together with specialists from the American Technical Institute (U.S.A.). Researchers from the ``Kurchatov Institute'' find it rather important that for the first time the Russian state scientific center has been closely cooperating with the U.S. private scientific establishment.
