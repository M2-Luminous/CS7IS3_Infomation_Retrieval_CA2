"Jordan is doing all it can to achieve Arab reconciliation and is ready to do anything for the sake of the Arab Nation," Dr. al-Majali said in an interview published in the United Arab Emirate's (UAE) AL-ITTIHAD newspaper. "A reconciliation should cover all types of cooperation, including political, economic, cultural and social." His Majesty King Husayn's visit to the United States, the prime minisiter said, aims to give impetus to the peace process which is now facing some difficulties. The King is also seeking to bolster the Jordanian Armed Forces and will conduct a comprehensive review of Jordanian-U.S. relations, he said. In reply to a question, Dr. al-Majali said Jordan appreciated and supported UAE President Shaykh Zayid Bin Sultan Al Nahayan's initiative to restore Arab solidarity. The prime minister described Jordanian-UAR relations as brotherly ties and noted that Jordanians working in the UAE have always been treated on equal footing with the UAE people. On Jordan's mediation to end the dispute among the leaders of Yemen, Dr. al-Majali said His Majesty King Husayn had delegated Royal Court chief Sharif Zayd Bin Shakir to act as mediator carrying royal messages to the Yemeni leaders. "Jordan considers any sucess of any Arab unity as success for Jordan, which seeks a greater Arab unity," he said. "It is up to the Yemeni brothers to resolve their problems amicably and Jordan would spare no effort to help them do that." Nothing that is was the Yemeni leaders who had requested the King's mediation, Dr. al-Majali said that the unity in Yemen concerns the whole Arab world and not Jordan and Yemen alone. Commenting on coordination between Arab states involved in the peace process, Dr. al-Majali said Jordan is committed to that coordination, and it hopes that the Arab parties will succeed in exchanging land for peace in implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. "A just durable peace in Jordan's view entails the return of the usurped land and water rights and the end of suffering of the people in the region," he said. Commenting on the Oslo accord between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), he said that the deal was meant as a declaration of principles and Jordan has no alternative but to support the Palestinians in their drive to regain their rights. "Any gains achieved by the Palestinians would reflect positively on us because we are brothers and together form one nation," Dr. al-Majali said. On the future Palestinian-Jordanian relationship, he said that the people on the two sides of the River Jordan would have to decide on it and determine the nature of union between them when the time is right. Dr. al-Majali urged Arab states to join Western creditors in rescheduling its debts to revive the economy, rocked by foreign debt and a sharp decline in aid. Dr. al-Majali said the domestic economy had started to improve since Jordan launched reforms. "We have overcome the most difficult stages and Jordan hopes sisterly countries (Arabs) will show understanding as was done by friendly countries, which have rescheduled our debts," he said. Dr. al-Majali did not name the Arab creditors nor give figures. According to official Arab figures, Jordan received around $2.1 billion of $19.5 billion extended by Gulf states in loans, and grants in the five years before the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. It has also received more than 10 per cent of the total Arab aid of nearly $100 billion provided between 1970 and 1992.
