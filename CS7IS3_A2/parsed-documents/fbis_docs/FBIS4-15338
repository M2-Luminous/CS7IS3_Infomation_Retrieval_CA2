The process of establishing bilateral diplomatic relations has thus officially been completed. Following the embassies of the Russian Federation, Ukraine, and Armenia, the embassy of the Caspian state becomes the latest full-scale diplomatic mission of the CIS countries on the banks of the Thames. Baku is now linked by a weekly direct flight by the Azerbaijan Airways company with London's Gatwick Airport. This helps to activate bilateral business relations within whose framework mutually advantageous agreements and contacts have recently been signed between Transcaucasus enterprises, associations, and firms, and well known companies like "Kayzer [name as transliterated] Engineers," "Morrison Construction," "British Telecom," "Datacom," and "GPT." Talks are continuing on the forthcoming conclusion of a "deal of the century" aimed at the participation of a consortium of Western oil giants in the development and export of the Caspian's fuel and energy resources.
