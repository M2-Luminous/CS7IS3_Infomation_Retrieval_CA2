At its meetings with Bosnian Serb and Muslim leaders in Bosnia-Herzegovina, issues of the possibility of halting combat operations in that region were discussed, and steps to put into practice the UN Security Council's resolution on a political settlement to the Yugoslav crisis, as well as questions of guaranteeing the safety of the peacekeeping forces' contingents that were taking part in UN operations to secure peace, were examined. Ukraine is concerned about the UN decision to deploy the Ukrainian peacekeeping forces battalion in the area of the town of Gorazde where lately there has been intensive fighting. It was emphasized at the meeting between Mr. Ozadovskyy and the command of the UN forces in Yugoslavia that decisions on the Ukrainian contingent further participating in UN peacekeeping operations should be made with the safety of our military personnel taken into consideration. That is why it is only after combat operations in the Gorazde area are halted that the Ukrainian peacekeepers can be deployed there.
