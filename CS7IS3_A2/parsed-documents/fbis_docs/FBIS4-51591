FBIS4-51591 "dreas084_c_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-084 Daily Report 2 May 1994 North Korea Japanese Officials' Nuclear Issue Remarks Noted Japanese Officials' Nuclear Issue Remarks Noted SK0205061694 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0505 GMT 2 May 94 SK0205061694 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, May 2 (KCNA) -- The new director general of the Japan Defence Agency recently told a press conference upon his assumption of office that, depending on the tensions growing on the Korean peninsula, they should "cope with it even by altering an interpretation of the Constitution". Earlier, the new Japanese Prime Minister, Hata, raved that "a constitutional debate should be made in the direction of recognizing Japan's exercise of the right to collective self-defence in case of `emergency' so as to provide against the nuclear issue of North Korea". A NODONG SINMUN analyst today says this shows that the Japanese reactionaries are scheming to justify their moves toward a military power and nuclear armament on the pretext of the DPRK's "nuclear issue" and, at the same time, to use it as an excuse for military reinvasion of Korea. The news analyst goes on: The Japanese reactionary ruling quarters' talk about "constitutional debate" and "legislative measures" to cope with "emergency" on the Korean peninsula is intended to lay a legal foundation for military aggression on Korea on the pretext of the DPRK's "nuclear issue". In other words, they are intending to malrevise the present constitution and the "self-defence forces act" on the pretext of "coping with" the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK and thus to stage a comeback to Korea militarily without any restrictions and give a semblance of legitimacy to it. Noteworthy is that the Japanese reactionaries openly revealed their scheme to stage a comeback to Korea at a time when the United States has become all the more undisguised in its anti-DPRK campaign. The Japanese reactionaries are further strengthening their collusion and tieup with the United States and the South Korean puppets, unusually becoming undisguised in their anti-DPRK moves. It is not fortuitous that confabs were held recently between the military brasshats of the United States and Japan and between those of Japan and the South Korean puppet army to "cope with North Korea's nuclear issue" and agreements were reached between them on strengthening military cooperation. All this proves that the Japanese reactionaries' scheme for military reinvasion of Korea is being promoted at a dangerous phase. The Japanese reactionaries, however, will get nothing from their policy hostile to the DPRK and moves for military re-aggression. They must ponder over grave consequences to be entailed by their policy hostile to the DPRK and stop running recklessly.
