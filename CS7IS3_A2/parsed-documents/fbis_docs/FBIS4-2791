The Nankai District Government and Anxin Group (Hong Kong) Corporation held a ceremony on the evening to 26 March to sign the contract on jointly rebuilding the old city proper of Nankai District. Attending the ceremony were municipal leaders Luo Yuanpeng, Liu Wenfan, and Wang Dehui; veteran comrades Mao Changwu, Bai Hualing, and Hu Xiaohuai; and Xie Guoxiang, deputy director of the Tianjin Chinese Culture Promotion Association. Wang Shukai, head of Nankai District, and Chen Xiaoqi, president of the Anxin Group (Hong Kong) Corporation, signed the contracts respectively. Tianjin was formerly called "Laochengli." With a total area of 1.5 square kilometers and a total population of 110,000, and with east, south, west, and north roads around its borders, Laochengli is an area embracing relatively more dangerous and crude houses. After sensing the tremendous potentials and prospects of this area through survey and analysis, Anxin Group has decided to make investment in rebuilding this old city proper into a new area influential in north China and even in the whole country. The pare-phase investment of Anxin Group is subject to unified designing and planning and is devoted to developing 25 percent of the construction area covering 3.6 million square meters. Upon the completion of this project, 30 bank buildings will be set up in the northeast part (formally named Guanyinhao) to form a banking area. The northwest part of this area will be built into a commercial and trade zone, where the Tianjin Municipal World Trade Center will be included. The southwest part will be built into a hotel, commercial, and residential zone, including a five-star hotel, a large shopping center, and an indoor garden, the largest of its kind in China, filled with fresh flowers in all seasons under a glass ceiling, and furnished with a children's playground. The southeast part will be into a residential zone embracing high-, middle-, and low-class residences. In addition, an artificial lake and some sports installations will be built. At the crossroads of the old city proper, a drum-tower with the ancient Chinese architectural style will be restored and rebuilt, and a three-km-long internal ring road, with the old crossroads as its center, will be built. The former crossroads will be changed to the streets only for pedestrians, and along the streets, there will be Chinese local and special products shops, typical local dishes restaurants, theaters, shopping centers, and tourist service centers. Mr. Chen Xiaoqi, president of Anxin Group (Hong Kong) Corporation, said: The rebuilding of this old city proper can be likened to a bone, which our corporation is gnawing on. That is, we will use our own mode to rebuild and build it, and the success in this project will create a new path for the rebuilding of Tianjin's old city proper and even the whole country. It is learned that it will take five to seven years to complete the reconstruction.
