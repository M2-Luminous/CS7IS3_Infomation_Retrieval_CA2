Speaking in Bonn on Wednesday [26 January] at the conclusion of a three-day conference involving 21 German ambassadors from countries from the region, Kinkel referred to a 10-point catalogue on German-Asia policy. This stresses that, in view of low budget funds, there had to be more efficient use of the available personnel and organizational resources in German missions abroad when it came to relations with Asia. The conference was devoted to the implementation of the Asia plan adopted by the Federal cabinet in December.
