The National Narcotics Control Commission has instructed departments in charge to adopt measures to strengthen caffeine control. The circular says: Since last year, some localities have begun producing natural caffeine in the pretext of pooling funds with others or exporting it. Some have not made declarations in accordance with the law. Some even have illegally produced, sold, and advertised their products without the approval of public health, medicine, and drug control departments. These acts have interfered with social order and harmed the health of the people. Some have constituted crimes. The circular calls on all localities to ban the illegal and criminal acts of producing and dealing in natural caffeine without approval. It says that those violating the law will be held accountable for their criminal acts by judicial organs in accordance with the law, and that the act of illegally producing, selling, importing, or exporting natural caffeine will be punished as the crime of smuggling, selling, transporting, or manufacturing drugs in accordance with the provisions of the NPC Standing Committee's "Decision on Narcotics Control."
