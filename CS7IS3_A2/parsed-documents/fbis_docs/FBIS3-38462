The left abandoned by the PRI [Italian Republican Party] is a left betrayed throughout the country. It is very irresponsible, serious political error. And we do not accept it." The senator displayed his old mettle, calm but resolute -- the quality that caused him to be both appreciated and feared during his long and difficult years as chairman of the parliamentary violations committee. At his home in Cesena, Libero Gualtieri, the PRI's senate floor leader, was waiting "to see what is going on in Rome, what is being decided. Everything is still in flux," he said, "and I do not want to exacerbate the situation." However, his ideas are quite clear: "We will remain within the Democratic Alliance [AD] as a federated force, with all that this may entail." [passage omitted] [Marozzi] Does staying in the AD mean taking part in the progressive alignment's negotiations, discussing policies and candidates? [Gualtieri] We are staying in the arena. The majority of the PRI in Emilia-Romagna are siding with the progressive front. We do not want to be thrown out; we do not want to split the PRI, or to leave. But neither do we want to relinquish the policy in which we believe. [Marozzi] But [PRI Secretary] La Malfa has threatened expulsion: "Whoever stands as a candidate with the left, with the AD, will be out of the party," he said. [Gualtieri] Whom will they expel? Half the party? Its command? Visentini, its 14 deputies, and the floor leaders of the lower house and the Senate, who reject the center? The UIL [Italian Federation of Trade Unions], the cooperatives of the Republican area that are remaining within the AD? All this is important. [Marozzi] Among the progressive forces, your own candidacy seemed to be a certainty, one of the few capable of enjoying everyone's approval. What will you do now? Will you be running again? [Gualtieri] I do not know. It depends on how things turn out. Either there is a policy that can help the country, or.... [Marozzi] Will you remain with the progressive forces, come what may? [Gualtieri] Why should someone like me join the center? [Marozzi] That is what La Malfa wants. [Gualtieri] We shall see what happens to the entire party structure. Everything is still in flux. A hard trial of strength is under way. Certainly, we represent the PRI in Romagna and Emilia. We command a majority, and are thus able to decide with whom to align. We are the ones who are taking part in consultations, who will forge agreements. [Marozzi] Do you not consider it paradoxical that Republicans could be running on opposite lists? [Gualtieri] It is not we who changed our policy. In any case, I said long ago that the new electoral system would impose a substantial regionalization of politics, that the Republicans would have to come to terms with some very different situations, that it was impossible to expect consistent conduct between North and South, or a single system of alliances. Be that as it may, La Malfa does not seem to me to have realized what has happened in Italy over the past three or four weeks. [Marozzi] What? [Gualtieri] There has been a large-scale restructuring of the right, on all sides. The Northern League allying with [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi, the Democratic Christian Center, the MSI [Italian Social Movement] threatening to conquer the south. One must also consider the Catania provincial elections, not to mention what is happening in Puglia, Calabria. We are witnessing a phenomenon that seemed impossible until two months ago, when a victory by the progressive forces was too confidently forecast as a certainty. It seems to me a terrible mistake to abandon the left now, to withdraw a democratic linchpin such as the PRI. [Marozzi] What is the danger? [Gualtieri] Being overwhelmed. Whatever lay behind the interests defeated by Bribe City is now emerging. The old system is being reestablished in an even more extreme form. It is necessary to make a choice, even if it means paying for the mistakes over the electoral law. [Marozzi] But to many Republicans it seems unnatural to form a common front with [Communist Renewal Chairman] Cossutta. [Gualtieri] True, there is some internal differentiation within the left. True, we do not agree at all with some stances. But the elections cannot be won by running outside a progressive front which nevertheless represents the change in the left over the years, its essence a part of the country's heritage. The PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] is certainly no longer the PCI [Italian Communist Party], and Ugo La Malfa always taught us that the PRI represents the other focus of the left. Certainly not of the center or of the right.
