Mr. Bartlett explained that mineral rights in the country had always belonged to the state or the private sector, and that recent legislation had brought no change in terms of ownership. He said that with the implementation of the Minerals Act of 1991 the state's provisos concerning certain mineral rights had lapsed in order to give recognition to the lawful owners of the mineral rights involved in terms of common law. He stressed that there had not been any change of ownership.
