[Moricz] After his visit in Budapest, the Russian prime minister received the Hungarian journalist in Moscow and spoke with great appreciation of his talks with the Hungarian Government. How did you receive this evaluation at home? [Surjan] On behalf of both the government and myself, I can say that the visit of the Russian premier in Hungary was extremely important indeed. We highly appreciate the firm Russian readiness to settle the outstanding Russian debt to Hungary. Hungarian participation in the Russian privatization process opens up possibilities for both settling the debt issue and vitally broadening our foreign trade that dropped considerably after the collapse of the Soviet market. [Moricz] What effect could the domestic political echoes of this visit have on the ratification of the basic agreement? [Surjan] This cannot affect the ratification of the basic treaty. At the same time, caution and consideration are needed in the course of election speeches, and I also include myself in this requirement, because emotional elements can greatly affect the public mood and the relations between individual parties. [Moricz] In your opinion, how will Hungary fare in the period until the May 8 elections? [Surjan] It is a positive development that, according to opinion polls, the percentage of people willing to participate in the elections is increasing. I am convinced that a bad decision will not emerge if a sufficient number of people go to vote. In the current difficult economic situation, it is in the public interest to enable the new government to lead the country in calm and stable circumstances.
