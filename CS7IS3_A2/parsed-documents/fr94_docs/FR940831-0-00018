FR940831-0-00018 FR940831-0-00008 This is considered to be interim action. The manufacturer has advised that it is currently developing a modification program for the engine strut that will positively address the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. Once this modification program is developed, approved, and available, the FAA may consider additional rulemaking. There are approximately 380 Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 140 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 22 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $169,400, or $1,210 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety. Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: 94&hyph;17&hyph;17 Boeing: Amendment 39&hyph;9012. Docket 94&hyph;NM&hyph;05&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model 747 series airplanes equipped with Pratt & Whitney JT9D&hyph;3 or JT9D&hyph;7 series engines, excluding JT9D&hyph;70 series engines; line numbers 001 through 510 inclusive; certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent separation of the strut from the wing of the airplane due to fatigue cracking, accomplish the following: (a) Perform a detailed visual inspection of the inboard and outboard strut forward lower spar chords, stiffeners, and web to detect cracks and loose fasteners, in accordance with the procedures described in Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54&hyph;2160, dated September 9, 1993, at the time specified in paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this AD, as applicable. Repeat this inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 2,000 landings or 8,000 hours time-in-service, whichever occurs first. (1) For airplanes that have accumulated less than 6,000 total landings as of the effective date of this AD: Perform the initial inspection at the later of the times specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) of this AD. (i) Prior to the accumulation of 6,000 total landings on the strut. Or (ii) Within 12 months after the effective date of this AD. (2) For airplanes that have accumulated 6,000 or more total landings, but less than 15,000 total landings, as of the effective date of this AD: Perform the initial inspection within 9 months after the effective date of this AD. (3) For airplanes that have accumulated 15,000 or more total landings as of the effective date of this AD: Perform the initial inspection within 6 months after the effective date of this AD. (b) If any crack is found during any inspection required by paragraph (a) of this AD, prior to further flight, repair in accordance with procedures specified in Chapter 54&hyph;10&hyph;03 of the 747 Structural Repair Manual. (c) If any loose fastener is found during any inspection required by paragraph (a) of this AD, prior to further flight, replace the fastener in accordance with procedures specified in Chapter 51&hyph;30&hyph;02 of the 747 Structural Repair Manual. (d) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Seattle ACO. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Seattle ACO. (e) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. (f) The inspection shall be done in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54&hyph;2160, dated September 9, 1993. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies may be obtained from Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, P.O. Box 3707, Seattle, Washington 98124&hyph;2207.

(g) This amendment becomes effective on September 30, 1994. Issued in Renton, Washington, on August 17, 1994. Darrell M. Pederson, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;20594 Filed 8&hyph;30&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;13&hyph;U
