Here are some facts: 19 villages have been burned down so far [words indistinct]. There are many dead and wounded. The exact figure cannot be established. We have tried to establish an approximate figure regarding the shelling and the victims, especially those of last night's chemical attack. It has not been possible to do so until now. We can only say that the number of victims is very large. I would like to draw your attention to one thing: Gorazde is in this situation first of all because of the general situation caused by the arms embargo against Bosnia-Herzegovina. We are now facing the situation in which the entire Podrinje area, where Muslims constituted a majority, has been reduced to three enclaves. Gorazde is just one of them. The international community's arms embargo has deprived us of the capacity to defend ourselves. Let's take a look at the specific actions of UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR]. With its reports over the past 10 days in which it persistently repeated that nothing spectacular was happening there, the UNPROFOR has in a way lulled the international public and given false information to those people who are expected to decide what should happen next. It practically deceived [word indistinct]. When I mention the specific situation in Gorazde I am referring to a peculiar mode of behavior by UNPROFOR, who have -- in the last 10 days or so, since the attack began -- been concealing the facts and giving incomplete information to the public and [words indistinct]. You must have noticed total discrepancy between what we have said about the situation in Gorazde, between our warnings that the Serbs were launching all-out, well-prepared attacks for which weaponry -- a large number of tanks -- and a large number of people were being made available, and UNPROFOR's reports -- and we will see who is responsible for this -- to the world public saying that nothing special was happening there, that it was only a case of sporadic shelling, there were no new movements of troops, and no large numbers of casualties. Of course, the right decisions could not be made in the centers of decision-making on the basis of such incorrect reports. And, before I conclude, let me just say that General Rose reiterated yesterday that there were no new movements by the chetnik units, and this at the time when they were in fact advancing toward the Drina. Let me just add that last night we sent an (?alarming) letter to the Security Council, demanding (?adequate measures). [Moderator] Before this news conference Prime Minister Silajdzic was in contact with some people from Gorazde. I would like him to tell us about the situation there at the moment. [Silajdzic] The radio contacts we had and this telegram which we received 20 minutes ago say more or less the same thing. The situation in Gorazde is extremely dramatic, according to the telegram. The shelling of the town center has been the heaviest since the beginning of the war. Between 15,000 and 20,000 people have had to leave their homes. This is what the telegram says. I would like to add another point to what President Izetbegovic has already said. I think that we have been told by General Rose that he would call for air strikes if the aggressor's forces were to advance toward the town. That is all. [Moderator] Since we have heard reports of chemical weapons being used in the attacks, I would like to ask General Delic to tell us what he knows about this. [Delic] Chemical weapons have been used several times during the aggressor's offensive on Gorazde. I am speaking of the use of chemical gases fired from artillery weapons. These are mainly gases which cause short-term effects, gases such as irritants. The valley of the Drina has just the right terrain for the use of chemical gases. I would like to remind you that international conventions ban the use of chemical gases. Chemical gases have been used indiscriminately, both against the units of Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and against populated areas, in particular the village of Vitkovici. Yesterday alone 45 projectiles containing chemical gases were used. We have heard reports that they were used this morning as well. According to some unconfirmed reports chemical gases which cause long-term effects have also been used, such as blister-causing gases. We do not know the number of casualties, either among the civilians or among the soldiers, since this number is large [as received]. All indications are that the aggressor has used all prohibited means at his disposal in order to destroy people in the area. [Journalist] [passage indistinct] [Izetbegovic] As you could hear from Silajdzic's statement, General Rose promised this yesterday. He said that if the Serbs continued advancing, he would use force to stop them. As you know, he has not done it yet. [Journalist] I would like to ask President Izetbegovic why UNPROFOR is deliberately playing down the attacks on the protected zone of Gorazde. My second question is what the state of Bosnia- Herzegovina is doing internally and on the international scene to stop the Serb aggressor's attacks on Gorazde. My third question is for the prime minister. You said that the aggressor is again using the tactics of negotiating and attacking at the same time. What is the aggressor's aim now? [Izetbegovic] Let me answer the first question (words indistinct]. I cannot say what UNPROFOR's aim in doing that is,. whether it is the worst option, to hand over Gorazde, or whether they are simply shirking from their duty. I believe that this is an attempt to avoid the use of force regardless of the price our people will pay. I would like to stress now that UNPROFOR had the mandate to use force, that is, to ask for (?air strikes). There is a clear provision in the resolution [words indistinct]. I would like you to ask General Rose the same thing as soon as you see him. As for your second question, I can tell you that the government of Bosnia-Herzegovina has done everything in its powers to help Gorazde, including the army, of course. You know what we have done in the political field. Last night we sent an urgent letter to the Security Council. That was one of our latest actions. In the military field, we have taken resolute measures to ease the situation on the Gorazde front. After seven days of walking through snow and (?blizzard) the first group of people, doctors and people carrying aid for Gorazde arrived there last night. We are also taking military measures, but I cannot disclose the details here. [passage indistinct] [Siljadzic] The aggressor aims to force the international community and us into having this situation, as it is, frozen for some period of time. This also includes taking the right bank of the Drina in order to secure a better negotiating position. At the same time the aggressor is testing the international community's resolve [passage indistinct]. In other words, instead of one massive attack lasting for several days which could possibly provoke a reaction on the part of the international community, the aggressor has decided to negotiate and attack at the same time so as to lull the international community into believing that peace will be achieved through negotiations. I have to say that at the very beginning we cautioned General Rose about this tactics and we hope [passage indistinct]. [Journalist] [passage indistinct] [Delic] At this moment it is difficult to say, it is difficult to collect reports -- from the inferno which Gorazde is experiencing -- in order to analyze what chemical weapons were used. I stressed that [words indistinct] in one round of fire yesterday 45 shells filled with chemical agents were fired from artillery weapons. [passage indistinct] Speaking about Serb paramilitary formations, the basic problem is that they can at any time bring in reinforcements. So if I say that 3,000 to 4,000 people are fighting, you can take as [word indistinct]. This is only an example. However, the problem is that they can replace and bring in fresh forces. That is how they manage to have fresh forces all the time. They can also bring in new equipment. On the other hand, the defenders cannot do that. The same people have held defense positions for 15 days. That is a difference in quality, rather than the number of people fighting on the opposing sides. [passage indistinct] [Izetbegovic] In conclusion I would like to stress what Delic has just said. We believe that the international community -- with the Security Council as its head -- has the obligation to take immediate measures to save the town. It should have done that before. Tomorrow it could be too late. I would like to stress one thing because we are often asked this: We base this obligation on the fact that they have deprived us of arms for self-defense. By imposing the arms embargo, you practically tied our hands when we were attacked. This is why they have no right to use any kind of pretext not to protect Gorazde now, and Srebrenica in the future and so on. If we had had weapons, we would not ask them to help us.
