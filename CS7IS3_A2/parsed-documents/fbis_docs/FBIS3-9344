Chairman of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] Lajos Fur said the parliamentary elections scheduled for May will be vital to the future of the Hungarian nation. Following the creation of the system of political institutions, the switch to a social market economy must be implemented in the next four years, he said. Viktor Orban, chairman of the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], stressed that the opposition parties are also committed to Hungary's membership in the European Union. During his meeting with the Belgian prime minister, Chairman of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] Ivan Peto, stressed the importance of the May parliamentary elections in terms of the young Hungarian democracy. He noted that both society and politicians are only now learning of the consequences that can accompany a possible change in government within a democratic system. Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], told Dehaene that the MSZP supports NATO's peace-partnership conception. Perhaps the only objection would be that, in cases of conflict, the consultation opportunities seem weak. Dehaene was seen off at Budapest's Ferihegy Airport by Chairman of the Christian Democratic People's Party Laszlo Surjan. In the course of their brief discussions, the Belgian prime minister stressed high appreciation for the political stability experienced, which is unique in the region.
