His statements are summarized below. 1. Accession is certain and must be prepared. "During these meetings, I tried to clarify the European Union's [EU] position and its confirmed political will to open its doors to other countries, beginning with Poland, and especially to see how entry can be best prepared. This was the meaning of my visit. The inevitable preliminary is an institutional reform of the EU. We have the same institutions as those handed down to us by the Fathers of Europe, institutions which have no equivalent anywhere in the world. As Twelve, their working has become cumbersome; as Sixteen, it will be even more difficult. These institutions must therefore be adapted to a European Union of greater dimensions. This is not a pretext for not welcoming Poland. It is inevitable. How will powers be determined in a Union of 25 or 30? How can we reconcile the interests of a country with 55 to 80 million inhabitants and another with 200,000 to 500,000 inhabitants? These are tremendous problems. How can a country that will join the family not have a say in a debate of such importance, which could condition for the next century the future of Europe and its influence in the world? This is why I have proposed that the Poles make their contribution in this area, not to leave today's architects alone while tomorrow the Poles will have to live in the house. Meanwhile, Poland must continue adjusting to new conditions. There is no need for new institutions to do so. We have all the procedures we need to work together." Mentioning the Baldwin Report -- which estimates Poland's entry as some 20 years away -- Mr. Delors commented: "My general impression is more optimistic than the conclusion reached in this report." 2. Preparatory work, the case of agriculture. Mr. Delors commented: "Now that the Europe Agreement has been set in place, it must be made the principal means by which Poland is prepared economically, financially and socially for joining the European Union. This of course implies efforts on the Polish side, but also adaptation on the part of the EU, notably the PHARE [Program for the Economic Reconstruction of Poland and Hungary] programme. An economic strategy for accession must be agreed together. The Europe Agreement offers every possibility for development of a strategy to prepare the Polish economy for entry into the EC and for close political consultation. We now must simply continue our work, develop it seriously and help facilitate Poland's task. Of course, in the meantime, events can change. There are factors of agitation in Europe, there are attempts to extend European security, the CSCE, the Partnership for Peace, the Pact for Stability in Europe. I told my dialogue partners that I was very concerned about giving priority to security problems, given the dangers of destabilization existing in Europe, the most tragic of which is Bosnia." Asked about the particular case of agriculture, Mr. Delors replied: "It is incumbent upon Polish authorities to determine, as part of their general concept of economic and social development, what they wish to make of their agriculture. For our part, and with a view to Poland's joining the EU, we are prepared to help them with our experience and know-how. We have already worked discreetly with experts to examine how agriculture as it exists in Poland or Hungary could be adapted to the modern world and today's conditions for the practice of agricultural activity." The President of the European Commission noted that there can be no united Europe without the presence of Poland, now that "we have returned to the geographic, historic and spiritual origins of Europe." He added that Poland also serves as a bridge between Europe and the Slav world, which can help prevent a split between Europe on the one hand and Ukraine, Belarus and Russia on the other. For his part, Polish Prime Minister Mr. Pawlak declared that Mr. Delors' visit had lent "dynamism" to work following on from his country's request for admission and noted that the problems of agriculture "will necessitate seeking joint prospects." Mr. Pawlak also insisted on the importance he attaches to the European Union's decision to develop major infrastructure networks and an information society.
