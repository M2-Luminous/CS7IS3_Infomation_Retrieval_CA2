He said that the year 1993 had seen numerous significant events such as withdrawal of Russian troops, introduction of a permanent national currency, state of the law and order reform and improved international prestige of the Lithuanian state. The head of state said, however, that numerous problems would have to be faced in the economy, agriculture, manufacturing industries and other areas. The Lithuanian president expressed the hope that they would be surmounted if the Seimas [parliament], the government and other power and management agencies worked responsibly for freedoms and rights, well-being and a better future of Lithuania's residents, if the new year saw less suspicion and hatred.
