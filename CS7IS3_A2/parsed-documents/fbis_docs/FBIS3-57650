The document also includes prognoses on the developments in the country's economy in 1994. According to Fedorov, the principal conclusions are: 1. In 1993, the ministry on the whole stuck to the anti-inflation orientation of Russia's financial policy and make a considerable step forward. The most ingenuous analysis shows that there was no "shock therapy" at all. 2. Nearly all principal decisions have already been made, the only thing left is to calmly and consistently pursue this policy, develop a set of instruments and build market institutions and mechanisms. 3. A market economy already exists in Russia, and it is possible to regulate it by market means, e.g. by monetary measures. There is no real alternative to the policy that is being pursued, and there could not be one. 4. The results would have been more substantial, had the government and the Central Bank supported and pursued the monetary and credit policies they proclaimed. The Finance Ministry alone cannot restructure the whole country's economy. 5. The turn away from reforms which began to take shape in the beginning of 1994 (shift to mythical non-monetary methods, raising the industrial output at the expense of additional emission, neglect of elementary financial discipline) is doomed to failure. The situation in the economy will inevitably worsen. A market economy cannot be regulated by the same methods that Gosplan (the State Planning Committee) used. 6. Any waiver of this policy must be short-term and politically motivated. It is already impossible to reverse the course of the development of Russia' economy by peaceful means. However, it is the people who will pay out of their own pockets for the waiver. "Red businessmen" are throwing the country into an abyss of limp decay and non-competence again. The review also suggests three versions of the financial and economic policies for 1994: THE FIRST VERSION implies "refusing the wide-spread idea that problems of structural reconstruction might be solved at the expense of monetary emission, especially when the conditions for the effective use of financial resources in the real sector are not yet created." According to the first version, it would be more expedient to gradually reduce the Central Bank's emission by about three times compared to 1993 and keep it down to 5% of GDP in the fourth quarter of this year. In this case, inflation would amount to 5-6% a month by this summer. The ruble would trade against the US dollar at 2,000-2,500 in the second half of the year. By the end of the year, GDP would shrink by another 8-10% compared to last December. After a sharp fall in the first quarter of 1994, people's real incomes would grow by another 10% by the end of the year, e.g. by about the same as in 1993. THE SECOND VERSION envisions that the government will continue to support industries by emitting more money and granting credits, but very discreetly. According to this version, the Central Bank's emission would reach 9-10% of GDP in the first half of the year and decrease by 1.5 times by the end of the year. This would allow preservation of the average monthly inflation rate of 11-12% obtained by the end of 1993 and a positive re-financing interest rate. On the whole, GDP would be shrinking by about 7-9% by December 1994. People's real incomes would remain the same as in 1993. The ruble's rate would grow slower than the inflation rate and would total 4,500-5,000 rubles per US dollar by the end of the year. Like the previous one, this version would make possible constructive cooperation with international financial institutions, real financial aid and agreement in restructuring Russia's foreign debt. THE THIRD VERSION "reflects the situation taking a feasible shape in late January 1994: A reverse from the moderately strict credit and monetary policies pursued in 1993." According to this variant, the government will boost monetary emission to cover the budget deficit, as the Central Bank will grant more credits. There will be re-introduced the institution of privileged credits, delays of payments and writing off the agro-industrial complex's debts. The review points out that in its assessment of the quantitative parameters of this version, the ministry took into account the presidential decree setting the maximum deficit of the federal budget financed at the expense of the Central Bank's credit at 7.5 Tn rubles. This is why the credit emission was more likely to expand at the expanse of the Central Bank's credits to the industries (seasonal works in agriculture, delivery of goods to the northern regions, aid to the fuel and energy complex, etc.) and channelling its incomes to the budget. In addition, decisions to pay out a number of "production" debts to defense enterprises, agriculture, and for purchase of grain from the budget of 1993 are being prepared. Taking into account the expected tax earnings in the first quarter of 1994 and the maximum deficit limit set by the president, payment of the "production" debts is possible only if the announced indexing of salaries of employees of state bodies is cancelled. Therefore, the inflation mechanism will function in the following way: the Central Bank's credits to the industries and the "production" re-orientation of budget spending will result in a swift aggravation of the situation in the budget sphere. This will indeed require indexing the salaries of budget-supported enterprises' employees in the second quarter. To support the industries balancing on the brink of the budget's survival, the credit emission will have to increase up to 25-30% of GDP by mid-summer. This is a moderately realistic assessment of the activities of "red businessmen" (the Ukrainian government granted credits totalling half of GDP in 1993). So, Russia may face a "Ukrainization" of its economy in the third quarter of 1994. Negative processes in finance will be further aggravated by an outflow of capital and a sharp drop of the ruble. The authors of the review point out that "the attempt to replace monetary methods for control of inflation with non-monetary ones such as restricted prices, compulsory sale of all hard currency earnings, fixed rate of the ruble, obligatory deliveries , etc., will finally mean gradually curbing not only economic, but also political reforms, and the course for democratization of society."
