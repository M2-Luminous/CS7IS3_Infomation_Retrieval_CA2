I. The Anlung Veng battlefield command and the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] General Command wish to announce that the first major military campaign launched by the Vietnamese communist puppets and two-headed government on Anlung Veng Battlefield was attacked and smashed to pieces at 1330 on 24 February 1994, repeat, at 1330 on 24 February 1994. II. The attack and destruction of the offensive constitutes destruction of the first major military campaign conducted by the Vietnamese communist puppets and two-headed government. III. It is worth recalling that the campaign aimed at destroying the liberated area of Anlung Veng was launched in September 1993 while the two-headed government leaders went to the UN Headquarters in New York. After a battle of over one month, the troops of the Vietnamese communist puppets and two-headed government were routed completely. Many of them were killed or wounded, but they all were privates because their commanders were staying away in Siem Reap or on Route 68 in Samraong. This first major military campaign considered by the Vietnamese communist puppets and two-headed government to be a final battle was planned for November 1993, but it was repeatedly postponed because there were not enough troops. It was only at the end of December 1993 that a second major dry-season offensive on the Anlung Veng battlefield began. After six or seven days of fighting, the so-called second major offensive was completely defeated. IV. Since then, especially in January 1994, a final major military campaign was planned to destroy the Anlung Veng area from all directions; that is, two directions from Route 68 [words indistinct], one direction from Sre Noy, one direction from Rum Chek, and one direction from Kulen. The plan was repeatedly revised by the Vietnamese communists, Vietnamese communist puppets, the alliance, and the two-headed government. They were busy purchasing ammunition; mustering troops from all provinces and districts; gathering all available armaments, tanks, armored carriers, trucks, multiple rocket launchers, and cannons [words indistinct], mobilizing their troops, and so on. The plan was to destroy or force Democratic Kampuchea to surrender and accept their three conditions by ignoring the five points of the king; it constituted the most serious crime and was aimed at doing away with the Cambodian nation and people in accordance with the strategy of swallowing Cambodia via the Vietnamese communists' military and human war. The plan can be summarized as follows: 1. 70 or 80 percent of important troops nationwide were mobilized; 2. 70 or 80 percent of assorted light and heavy armaments nationwide were deployed; 3. 90 percent of commanders -- most of them are generals -- nationwide were gathered on the battlefield [words indistinct]; 4. The alliance exerted its all-out effort in maneuvering according to its ability and the situation. 5. The alleged major campaign of the Vietnamese communist puppets, two-headed government, and the alliance began at the beginning of January 1994. After nearly 30 days of fighting, it was, however, destroyed for the third time. On 9 February, they marshaled all their troops to launch a fourth assault. The battle was hardfought, and it was only on 18 February that the invaders were surrounded by the NADK and people near Anlung Veng. Their troops have remained in the death square as the nearly 400,000 troops of Marshal [name indistinct] were routed [words indistinct] in a manner recalling Stalingrad in World War II and the fate of the more than 80,000 French troops of Gen. [Ducas] destroyed at Dien Bien Phu. After six and a half days of fighting, the invaders were destroyed. 6. This is the greatest defeat of the Vietnamese communists, the Vietnamese communist puppets, the two-headed government, and the alliance, which continue the strategy of destroying Democratic Kampuchea [DK] and national reconciliation, opposing the king, and promoting war with the aim of swallowing Cambodia once and for all. It constitutes a defeat for the clique and a victory for our entire nation and people and the peace-loving countries of the world. It also represents a success for the five-point national reconciliation force of the king. 7. Nevertheless, our nation and people's enemies have never renounced their strategy. Therefore, we should heighten and reinforce our vigilance to decimate their criminal stratagy for the sake of our nation's reconciliation and genuine peace.
