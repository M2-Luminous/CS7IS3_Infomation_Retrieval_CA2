Hungary's agreement to participate in this important chemicals safety cooperative effort puts it on an equal footing with OECD member countries and brings advantages to both Hungary and OECD member countries. For instance, members of the 24-nation Western club will be able to establish and maintain the appropriate formal contacts and information exchange procedures with the Hungarian laboratory practice monitoring authorities. This, says the OECD Secretariat, will "underpin confidence in the Hungarian compliance monitoring programme necessary to assure OECD member countries of the quality of data generated in Hungarian laboratories." As a consequence, much-needed further testing capacity will be opened for use by OECD member countries and their industries, which can be confident that data generated in Hungary will be accepted in OECD member countries. Since June 1991, Hungary has been participating in the OECD's Partners in Transition Programmes, one section of which involves taking part as an observer in numerous committees and other subsidiary bodies.
