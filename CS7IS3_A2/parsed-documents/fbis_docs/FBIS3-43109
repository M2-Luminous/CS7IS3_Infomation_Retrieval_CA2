Lavrov; UDC 621.592.3] [Abstract] The promising properties of LaNi[.sup]5[/]-H[.sub]x[/] hydrides which can be ground into 5-7 ï¿½m powder with a bulk density of 3,240 kg/m[.sup]3[/] and a 0.55 W/m[.sup].[/]K effective thermal conductivity, e.g., for use in hydride compressors for space-based hydrogen refrigerators where heat is supplied by the sun and removed by radiators, prompted attempts to optimize the mass characteristics of such refrigerators for subsequent use in spacecraft. Adsorption isotherms of the LaNi[.sup]5[/]-H[.sub]x[/] system, i.e., the dependence of the equilibrium hydrogen pressure on its specific mass content at various temperatures, the relationship between the heat delivery and extraction temperatures of the hydride compressor radiators, the hydrogen refrigerator T-S-curve, and the dependence of the total radiator area on the precooling temperature at various pressures are plotted. The total radiator area has a clearly marked precooling temperature minimum which also depends on the refrigerator's remaining parameters. Figures 5; references 7: 5 Russian, 2 Western.
