The report, set to spell out the terms of how to "significantly increase" foreign access and sales to key Japanese markets, is due to be completed by the February 11 summit between President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. "We are still in the midst of negotiations," said a Japanese official who briefed reporters on the day's plenary session between Japanese and U.S. principals in charge of the framework negotiations. The Japanese spokesman said the two sides agreed not to discuss matters of substance before the current round of trade talks is over, possibly by Wednesday. "Each side presented a status report, and we exchanged views," the official said. There were, however, indications that there was no significant breakthrough. "We still have a lot of work to do," Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Roger Altman told after emerging from the day's session at the White House conference center. A U.S. official who gave a separate briefing to Japanese reporters said the day's talks focused on the issue of "objective criteria," the heart of contention between Tokyo and Washington. "There is still a big gap between us here," said the official, who made a point of conducting the briefing in Japanese. The United States, which runs a 50 billion dollar trade deficit with Japan, has insisted that Japan accept the import levels of other industrial countries as the norm that it must emulate. Japanese officials have rejected the U.S. demand, arguing that setting import targets is anathema to free trade. U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown said Monday the U.S. will insist on taking "a targeted, results-oriented approach" in seeking trade concessions from Tokyo. "I think that is going to make a real difference" in U.S. trade ties with Japan, Brown said at a news conference. The meeting between the high-powered U.S. delegation and Japanese negotiators came a day after U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen warned Tokyo that Washington may reexamine the basis of trade relations with Japan if no breakthrough is made in the framework trade talks. Laura Tyson, head of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, was also at the negotiation table Monday. Tyson told reporters after the meeting that she was taking part in the trade talks as an observer. "This is an area I have given a lot of thought about," said Tyson, who has written a book on trade conflicts in high-technology industries between Japan and the U.S. The U.S. negotiating team also included Ezra Vogel, a leading Japan expert and a senior official of the Central Intelligence Agency's National Intelligence Council. The Japanese negotiating team, headed by Deputy Foreign Minister Koichiro Matsuura, included officials from the Foreign Ministry, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, and the Finance Ministry.
