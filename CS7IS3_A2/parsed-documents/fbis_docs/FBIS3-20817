In the face of increasing "unification" of the activities of the chairman of the HZDS and his most faithful followers, the disintegration of this movement continues, and many politicians from the opposition parties have long since counted on it. Some of them connect their ambitions regarding the taking over of political power with this disintegration; some of them promise themselves primarily the augmentation and the strengthening of their ranks by defectors from V. Meciar, who are part of the stream having similar political orientations. Of course, they also connect this with the subsequent increase in support on the part of those citizens who, as they figure, will also shift over to the camp of their supporters. Such ambitions, for example, are not being concealed by the AD SR [Alliance of Slovak Democrats], the Zalovo wing of the SDSS [Social Democratic Party in Slovakia], and other political entities. I believe that, even if such an "inclination" among possible defectors from the HZDS were to come about, this would not necessarily automatically result in a gain for these parties or an improvement in their standings. It is not even clear whether these renegades might not represent almost a burden for them. It should be remembered, for example, that the press was very critical of the politicians of the AD SR for having several times changed their party shirts and for exerting harsh criticism today of their former allies and friends, but mostly it should be recalled that the attitude of the majority of our citizenry with respect to such politicians is similarly critical and even repudiative. And even the Slovak citizenry, much like some of the Slovak politicians, is clearly and gradually maturing politically. A look at our most recent history, in which citizens gradually, on a massive scale and very definitively, rejected several political teams that failed to fulfill their expectations, can be instructive. Currently, the citizenry is beginning to ever more reject the government of the HZDS (and part of the SNS [Slovak National Party]) and all that which is somehow connected with it. Political stigmatization, which was fanned and utilized by all of our post-November governments, has become a firm part of our sociopolitical reality and has, as always, first acted to benefit the holders of power and, subsequently, worked to their disadvantage. For example, much like some time ago, the political labeling of opponents acted to the benefit of the HZDS (ranging from those favoring the VPN [Public Against Violence] to being called members of the StB [secret police], and ranging through being labeled as followers of "clerical powers"); today, the majority of our citizens react negatively to the label "Meciar follower" or "former Meciar follower." Clearly, all of our politicians are well aware of this "stigmatization effect," but not all of them take it into account equally. Some long ago closed the gates of their parties against stigmatized politicians (stigmatized as a result of political excesses and political collaboration) and some, especially those who have no other choice, are willing to continue accepting them. But it seems that those political parties that are attempting to profile themselves as being definitive or even choosy are experiencing a long-term rise. This year will clearly show whether this is part of the developmental trend moving from the image of a political scene determined by "broad-spectrum movements," "broad streams," etc., toward a scene that is replete with clearly defined and rankable political parties on the basis of European criteria. Slovakia would truly deserve such.
