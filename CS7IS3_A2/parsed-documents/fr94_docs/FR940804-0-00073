FR940804-0-00073 FR940804-0-00022 Finally, a new final sentence has been added to the section. The sentence provides that for clocks started by rulemaking actions (i.e., disapprovals and findings of failure to implement), the date of the finding starting the clock is the ``effective date'' of the action, not necessarily the date it is signed or the date it is published in the Federal Register . Since the disapproval or finding of failure to implement is not effective until the ``effective date'' of the final action, the sanctions clock should not start until such action is effective. Upon further reflection, EPA determined that the clarification should be included in the rule in order to ensure that the public is adequately apprised of when the sanctions clock has started for particular areas based on a rulemaking action. The EPA has revised the final rule to add new sections §§52.31(d)(2), (d)(3), and (d)(4). In response to comments, these sections incorporate a revision made to the rule concerning how and when sanctions, not yet applied, may be deferred and sanctions, already applied, may be stayed. A complete discussion of the revisions is set forth in section II.B.3. above. These corrections concern the circumstance where EPA has disapproved a required submittal or where EPA has found that a State has failed to implement an approved SIP. Sections 52.31(d)(2) and 52.31(d)(3) set forth language concerning disapproved SIP's and §52.31(d)(4) sets forth the language regarding cases where EPA has made a final finding of failure to implement. For purposes of an initial disapproval or an initial finding of failure to implement for which EPA subsequently proposes a positive finding and issues an interim final rule finding that the State has corrected the deficiency, any sanctions resulting from a clock that expires will be deferred and any sanctions that have been applied will be stayed. (A final conditional approval would continue any stay or deferral that resulted from a proposed conditional approval.) This change providing for a stay or deferral of sanctions does not change the rule's requirement that sanctions and sanctions clocks are not permanently stopped until EPA issues a final full approval or determination that a State is implementing its SIP. A new §52.31(d)(5) has been added which reaffirms what EPA actions are necessary for the mandatory sanctions process to permanently cease. Specifically, it provides that any sanction clock will be permanently stopped and sanctions applied, stayed or deferred will be permanently lifted upon a final EPA finding that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected. For a sanctions clock and applied sanctions based on a finding of failure to submit or incompleteness, a finding that the deficiency has been corrected will occur by letter from EPA to the governor. For a sanctions clock or applied, stayed or deferred sanctions based on a SIP disapproval, a finding that the deficiency has been corrected will occur through a final notice in the Federal Register fully approving the revised SIP. For a sanctions clock or applied, stayed or deferred sanctions based on a finding of nonimplementation, a finding that the deficiency has been corrected will occur through a final notice in the Federal Register finding that the State is implementing the approved SIP. Section 52.31(d)(6) is essentially unchanged from §52.31(d)(2) of the proposed rule. This section makes clear that EPA may take rulemaking action in any specific circumstance to reverse the order in which sanctions will be applied under section 179(a). In other words, EPA can take rulemaking action so that the highway sanction would apply after 18 months and the offset sanction 6 months thereafter. Two minor, nonsubstantive, changes were made. First, EPA replaced the phrase ``the EPA'' with ``the Administrator.'' Second, EPA changed the term ``should'' to ``shall'' to more firmly reflect the mandatory nature of the sanctions. 5. Section 52.31(e)_Available Sanctions and Methods for Implementation Section 52.31(e) sets forth the two sanctions that are applied by section 179(a). This rule, as did the proposed rule, interprets in greater detail the offset sanction provided under section 179(b)(2). Regarding §52.31(e)(1), applicability of the offset sanction, there have been several changes that are intended to more clearly capture the concepts in the proposed rule and the preamble to the proposed rule. The EPA has clarified the applicability of the offset sanction to PM&hyph;10 precursors, modified the rule for PM&hyph;10 and ozone precursors, and clarified the language in the rule regarding the pollutant applicability of the offset sanction when the SIP deficiency in question is not specific to a pollutant or pollutants. A discussion of these changes in the context of the specific sections follows.
