The Provisionals claimed their warnings of attacks were deliberately ignored. In a statement, the terrorists said: "The luck of the British authorities who are deliberately taking these calculated and cynical gambles with peoples' lives will inevitably run out. Our coded warnings should be heeded." The IRA claimed the authorities failed to "act appropriately" when they were given what it described as accurate advance warning of the attack on the north runway on Wednesday [9 March]. The Provisionals accused Metropolitan Police Commissioner Paul Conlon and anti-terrorist squad head David Tucker of "arrogant boasting" and claimed a six-hour warning of the attack at terminal four had been totally ignored.
