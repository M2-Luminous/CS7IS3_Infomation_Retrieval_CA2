This structure was set up very recently in accordance with the Russian president's decree of 30 December 1993. It is headed by Colonel General Andrey Nikolayev, commander of the border troops. At a recent briefing he summed up the results of the work of the border troops in 1993, and also defined future tasks. In particular, it was stressed that the Russian border troops will continue to defend the external borders of a number of CIS states. This is what Colonel General Andrey Nikolayev said on this subject: [Begin Nikolayev recording] In 1994 the units and subunits of the border troops will continue to defend -- on a contractual basis, worked out on an inter-governmental and interstate level -- the state borders in Armenia, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, and to participate in the defense of state borders in Turkmenia. The documents on the joint defense of the borders have been signed, and now they must be put into practice. In this connection it is important to stress that, first, the defense of the external borders of the commonwealth states is being carried out, first and foremost, for us Russians, in the interest of Russia itself. Second, this involves the guarantee of its national interests in the most important geo-political regions, where Russia's strategic interests exist, existed, and, hopefully, will continue to exist. I agree that cooperation in defending the border, when sovereign independent states cooperate in defending the border, is a completely new thing. There is no such precedent in history. But history also has seen no such thing as a state breaking up into 15 states in the twinkling of an eye. You understand, two years have gone by, and we finally realized that it is very important to have not only rights in the CIS, but probably obligations as well. [end recording]
