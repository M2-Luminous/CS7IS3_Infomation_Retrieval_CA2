The statement the Security Council issued to announce that the blockade on Iraq will continue has caused outrage inside and outside Iraq. Political observers believe the consultations the Security Council held over the last three days resulted in a clear division among the Security Council's permanent member states. They were divided into two groups. The first is France, Russia, and the PRC, which all insist on recognizing positive developments in relations between Iraq and the United Nations, as well as Iraq's compliance with all the commitments imposed on it in accordance with Resolution No. 687. The second group is the United States and Britain, which want to keep matters as they are and continue the blockade on Iraq's people -- a blockade without justification that has become a subject of protest and denunciation by world public opinion. The Iraqi position, which leader President Saddam Husayn declared during his recent meeting with ministers, as well as his call on the Security Council to meet its obligations toward Iraq in accordance with its resolutions, drew sharp reactions, most of which were in favor of Iraq's rights. This is especially true since the unjust blockade began its fourth year without any legal, constitutional, or humanitarian justification that the Security Council and the head of the Special Commission, Ekeus, can use to delay presenting their recommendations to the Security Council to begin its weapons monitoring program and implement clause C of Resolution No. 687. The rift the Iraqi position created among the Security Council's permanent member states proves the legitimacy of Iraq's proposals, as well as any other step Iraq deems correct to open the door of hope for its people to get rid of this unjust blockade still imposed because of the insistence of well-known and influential sides in the UN Security Council to serve purely conspiratorial and political goals that have nothing to do with the contents of the obviously unjust UN resolutions. Following the cease-fire that began in February 1990, as stated in Bush's announcement, Iraq tried to confront the UN Security Council with its true responsibilities to honor its resolutions and implement its obligations in order to save Iraq's people from further injustice and persecution in terms of the most important human aspects pertaining to food and medicine. But well-known sides in the Security Council, led by the United States, have been distorting the Iraqi position, reversing realities, and belittling Iraq's full cooperation with the United Nations in order to continue the blockade and the crimes committed against Iraq's people, its independence, its national sovereignty, and its free national decision making. The general climate prevailing in UN corridors, and even inside the United States itself, is full of questions about the usefulness of and the reasons for the continued blockade of Iraq. This fact frightens the delegates of the United States, Britain, the Zionist entity, and some other regimes that are trying, through their humiliated positions and their subservience to Washington and Tel Aviv, to support these aggressive positions with money and oil. World and official public opinions stress Iraq's right to prod the Security Council to serve its legitimate right and its people's right to lift the blockade and to reject the use of the blockade for political and diplomatic purposes governed by international sides known for their flagrant hostility to the Iraqi people. It is obvious that the issue of lifting or maintaining the blockade has become a matter of life and death for the Iraqi people. Therefore, the Iraqi people have the right to use every way their enlightened political leadership believes to be right to confront the mysteries of the political conspiracy against them in order to lift the blockade, to reassess all the positions that have led to the continued blockade, and to create the right opportunity and take the right position and step to save Iraq's people from the injustice it is facing as a result of the damned blockade.
