"Experience shows that although Hungary does get help from the West, we have to adapt mainly on our own," Jeszenszky said. Jeszenszky said Hungary fosters excellent relations with four of its neighbors: Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, and Ukraine. With good political relations, the rights of minorities are also regulated by exemplary contracts. Links with three other states -- Slovakia, Romania, and Serbia -- are not satisfactory. In this context, Jeszenszky said Hungarian diplomacy encourages democratic rights for the Hungarian national minorities living in those countries, in line with European principles.
