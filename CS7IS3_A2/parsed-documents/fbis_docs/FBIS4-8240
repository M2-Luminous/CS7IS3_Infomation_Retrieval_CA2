Minister Zhulali said that Albania favours close cooperation with NATO and an active participation in the Partnership For Peace. Mr. Zhulali expressed Albania's readiness to open its airport facilities to missions of the Alliance to preserve peace and stability in the region and beyond. He voiced Albania's commitment to participate in all the NATO structures. Joint military training, Mr. Zhulali said, will help the Albanian Army to keep up with the standards of NATO's member countries. The Albanian Army, he added, is preparing a company, which, after qualification, can take part in the peacekeeping forces of the United Nations. He said that they are making arrangements for the Albanian forces to participate in rescue operations and to deliver humanitarian aid to the fighting areas. Mr. Zhulali said that Albania has asked for greater material assistance and training of Albanian personnel in NATO's member country academies. He received positive replies to both these requests. Minister Zhulali said that they also discussed the possibility of the extension of the conflict to Kosova and further south as well as the threat posed by Serbian repression of the Albanian population in Kosova. General Joulwan described the aim of his visit, which he related to Albania's support for the CSCE resolutions and NATO initiatives, its very strategic position in the region and Europe. "I appreciate your national commitment to freedom and democracy," General Joulwan said. "They are values for all the NATO countries with which we share these ideals. The general appreciated the commitment to strengthen democratic institutions, and the development of structures within the army. We will be looking forward to your document of presentation in the context of Partnership For Peace, which will present Albania's goals and objectives. NATO will do its utmost to create and build up mutual confidence between NATO and Albania. "I say you are on the right path," General Joulwan said. To the question whether the Albanian Army can be furnished with new weaponry, General Joulwan said that "we are in the process of reviewing the request in order to examine the strategic role of Albania, but we shall do our best to help you." Asked about NATO's attitude in case the conflict spreads in Kosova and beyond, General Joulwan replied that NATO, the United Nations, and other international organizations are deeply concerned over this matter. The UN forces, the Nordic and American battalions in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia show that the situation in this zone has been under serious consideration, General Joulwan said.
