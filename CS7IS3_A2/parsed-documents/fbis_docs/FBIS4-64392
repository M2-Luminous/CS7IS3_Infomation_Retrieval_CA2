A group of SPD politicians, including Bundestag members Peter Glotz and Otto Schily, criticized in Munich today, above all, the planned use of highly enriched uranium that can also be used for the construction of nuclear weapons. This is in contradiction with worldwide efforts to curb the proliferation of this substance, the critics stressed before tomorrow's start of the procedure. For the operation of the new research reactor, a fuel rod requirement of 40 kg highly enriched uranium per year is expected. In fact, the operation of the reactor with fuel rods from uranium silicide does not pose any direct risk of proliferation, the SPD declared. However, there is a danger that the resulting demand might contribute to a worldwide trade in highly enriched uranium. The new reactor is to replace the old research reactor of the Munich Technical University -- the "nuclear egg of Garching." After 36 years of operation, the old reactor no longer meets the requirements of modern research for a neutron source.
