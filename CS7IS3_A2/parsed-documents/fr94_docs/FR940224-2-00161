FR940224-2-00161 FR940224-2-00095 _Provide the participants both a general and a specific overview of journalism education and the practice of journalism in the United States, beginning with an historic perspective and a survey of the evolution of the public media in the context of a socially diverse and politically democratic country; _Conduct for the participants short, intensive, lecture-seminary-discussion courses in journalism education, focussing primarily on curriculum development, the structuring of apprenticeships or internships as an integral component of the journalist's training, and the development of student publications as essential to journalism education. _And arrange one-week, intensive, participant/observer placements for the journalism educators as a group in the journalism departments of three universities, preferably reflecting diversity of size, orientation, and geographic location. These placements should include, in each case, classroom observation, first-hand experience in producing a student publication, visits to at least one medium-to-large newspaper which features both national and international reporting, and, if possible, observation of high-school level student journalism classes and publications. Pursuant to the legislation authorizing the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, programs must maintain a nonpolitical character and should be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social and cultural life. Beyond the immediate goals of this exchange, USIA is also interested in supporting programs which will lay the groundwork for new and continuing links between American and Middle Eastern, North African, and South Asian educational institutions and professional organizations and which will encourage the further growth and development of democratic institutions. The grantee organization will be responsible for most arrangements associated with this program. These include organizing a coherent progression of activities, providing international and domestic travel arrangements for all participants, making lodging and local transportation arrangements for visitors, orienting and debriefing participants, preparing any necessary support material, and working with host institutions and individuals to achieve maximum program effectiveness. To prepare foreign journalism educators for this project prior to their arrival in the United States, E/P encourages the grantee organization to develop material that would be sent to USIS offices overseas for distribution to participants. This material might include a tentative project outline with suggested goals and objectives, relevant background information, and information about American institutions and individuals involved in the exchange. At the beginning of the program, the grantee organization should conduct an orientation session for the visiting participants which addresses administrative details of the program and provides general information about American society and culture which will facilitate the participants' understanding of and adjustment to daily life in the United States. At the conclusion of the program, the group should meet in a one-day evaluation and planning session to review what has been presented to and experienced by the participants and to consider how that which has been learned can most effectively be applied upon the participants' return to their home countries. Additional Guidelines Program monitoring and oversight will be provided by appropriate USIA elements. The U.S. grantee institution should try to maximize cost-sharing in all facets of the program and to stimulate U.S. private sector (foundation and corporate) support. Proposals incorporating participant/observer site visits will be more competitive if letters committing prospective host institutions to support these efforts are provided. Funding Competition for USIA funding support is keen. The final selection of a grantee institution will depend on assessment of proposals according to a the review criteria delineated below.
