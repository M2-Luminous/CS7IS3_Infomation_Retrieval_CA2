The national parliaments of the EU countries also have to approve Sweden as a new member, and in several countries over six months are needed to get through the formal procedures. Having EU candidates Sweden, Finland, Norway, and Austria approved in the EU countries' national parliaments is not likely to cause political problems, and all twelve are likely to say "yes." However, one complication could be that a country or countries could want first to see a "yes" from the referendums in the new countries before reaching a decision on the matter. "For some countries the issue is a sensitive one. In 1972 governments asked their parliaments to approve Norway as a new member and then the Norwegian people voted `no.' Not everyone has the inclination to expose themselves to that embarrassment again, but wants to see the referendum result first," an EU diplomat in Brussels said. If the Bildt government launches Operation Persuasion in the EU capitals, this risk could perhaps be eliminated and the twelve governments could ask their parliaments to begin consideration of the matter before the referendums in order to be able to complete the process quickly for those countries where the people vote "yes." On the other hand no one can start work until the EU's own parliament has said "yes." This could happen in May this year at the earliest, but it is uncertain whether the European Parliament is able or willing to keep to this timetable. A subsequent problem could be the fact that parliamentary procedure in certain countries is relatively detailed. In the Netherlands and Britain, for example, a bill passes from the lower chamber to the upper chamber and is then passed back to the lower chamber again. In Spain procedures normally take six months and the government has to request speedy treatment if things are to move more quickly. "The quickest the countries have ever ratified an EU agreement is seven months," EU Commissioner Henning Christophersen said when the EEA [European Economic Area] agreement was under discussion. The EEA agreement, which has been approved by all the governments involved, did indeed take the EU countries seven months to ratify. Despite its popularity, the Maastricht Treaty took seven months to ratify in Belgium. In Italy, another country which welcomed the treaty, it took eight months. The Netherlands -- also pro-Maastricht -- needed six months.
