Hata told a press conference after the year's first cabinet meeting that the government intends to set the price at levels which can meet consumers' demand for less expensive rice. The price of domestic rice "will be the yardstick" for that of foreign rice, he said. Hata added a ministry panel, the Rice Price Council, will be called soon to give its views. Japan plans to import a total of 1.9 million tons of rice by the end of March. The imports, the first in a decade, were forced by poor harvests last year -- the worst of the postwar period -- due to the unusually wet and cool summer.
