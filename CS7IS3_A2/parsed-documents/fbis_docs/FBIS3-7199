The total export growth of non-oil/non-gas commodities last year reached 21.89 percent, but exports of textiles and textile products only increased by 2.8 percent. Hartarto, coordinating minister for industrial and trade affairs, said this to reporters on Tuesday (8 March) after meeting President Suharto at the Bina Graha Presidential Office in Jakarta. He said that as a result, the government is going to handle the matter more seriously and will review existing policies by holding a coordinated meeting with the Department of Industry, Department of Trade, the Office of the Coordinating Minister for Economy and Finance, and the Bank of Indonesia. According to Hartarto, efforts to look for new ways to make Indonesian textiles and textile products more competitive in the global market will be discussed at the coordinated meeting. The coordinating minister of industry and trade and other concerned ministers have already gathered all the facts relating to the textiles issue, and they will find concrete measures to solve the problem of slow export growth comprehensively. We can understand why the government is very concerned about the decelerated export growth of textiles and textile products. This is because they have always been the prime export commodities from the non-oil/non-gas sector. The fact that state receipts from the export of textiles and textile products earn the biggest foreign exchange earnings among exports outside of the non-oil/non-gas sector means that last year's slow export growth was acutely felt. It is worrisome to see that the export of textiles and textile products rose by only 2.8 percent in 1993 compared to the growth of 35.59 percent in the export of processed wood. The export of processed wood is currently the second biggest contributor to foreign exchange earnings after textiles and textile products. The decelerated export growth of textiles and textile products will probably disrupt the smooth flow of foreign exchange earnings into the country. The impact will be more serious this year with the price of oil in the international market falling to about $13 per barrel, largely due to oversupply and OPEC's indecision over what to do with the glut. The fluctuating world oil price is expected to create a deficit in the 1994-1995 state budget. Finance Minister Mari'ie Mohammad says the government will be forced to draw on its 3.5 trillion rupiah development fund reserves in order to offset the possible shortfall in revenue. The development fund reserves would not need to be drawn upon, however, if the export of non-oil/non-gas commodities could be accelerated to a level that would balance the declining exports of oil and gas. In any event, the export trend of non-oil/non-gas commodities depends on the export growth of textiles and textile products, which earn the biggest foreign exchanges. The government was right when it decided to take serious measures to overcome every obstacle that is causing the slow export growth of textiles and textile products. There is no doubt that it will not be easy to solve the export problem, especially when it concerns textiles and textile products. On one side, the producers and exporters of textiles and textile products have been urged to boost the export of their commodities to increase exports from the non-oil/non-gas sector and balance the budget deficit caused by the decrease in state receipts from oil and gas taxes. On the other side, the producers and exporters of textiles and textile products are bogged down by all kinds of impediments that hinder them in producing market quality products that can face stiff competition in the global market. We often hear the exporters of non-oil/non-gas commodities complaining about the decelerated growth of their exports. They say that the high interest rate of bank loans, complicated export procedures, difficulties faced in importing raw materials, and the payment of other unnecessary costs that are not stated in the trade regulations have contributed to the slow export growth. It looks as if the time has come for the government to seek a comprehensive settlement on the issue of export procedures. Likewise, we used to ask the National Export Development Agency (BPEN) to look into ways to overcome problems faced by the Indonesian exporters. Do we need another institution, besides BPEN, to help exporters overcome their problems? It is hoped that the inter-departmental coordinated meeting proposed by Hartarto will comprehensively discuss the factors that are causing the slow growth of commodity exports, especially textiles and textile products. We should take concrete measures to seek an effective solution to the problem in order to expedite and boost the export of non-oil/non-gas commodities.
