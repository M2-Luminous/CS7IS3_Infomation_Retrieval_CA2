FR941206-1-00042 FR941206-1-00007 Another section of the amended Act that affects wood furniture manufacturers is section 183 of Title I. Section 183(a) requires the EPA to issue control techniques guidelines (CTG's) for 11 categories of stationary sources of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. The EPA is developing a CTG for the wood furniture manufacturing industry as part of the requirements of section 183(a). The intent of the CTG is to provide guidance to States for regulating VOC emissions from wood furniture finishing, cleaning, and washoff operations at wood furniture manufacturing facilities located in areas of ozone nonattainment. The CTG identifies reasonably available control technology (RACT), which is generally the minimum stringency that States apply to such sources. The Agency began developing the CTG in the Fall 1989, prior to initiating the NESHAP. The status of the CTG and the basis for selecting the regulatory alternatives were presented to the National Air Pollution Control Techniques Advisory Committee (NAPCTAC) in November 1991 at a public meeting attended by industry and regulatory agency representatives. The CTG and the proposed NESHAP are concerned with two different situations. The CTG provides guidance on regulating emissions of VOC from wood furniture finishing, cleaning, and washoff operations and will likely affect only facilities located in ozone nonattainment areas only, while the proposed NESHAP will regulate emissions of HAP from all wood furniture (surface coating) operations nationwide. Although the two situations are different, a source may well be affected by both. For example, if a wood furniture manufacturer is: (1) Located in an ozone nonattainment area; (2) uses VOC's that are on the HAP list; and (3) is a major source of HAP emissions and the source's VOC emissions are greater than the applicability level for the CTG, the source would be subject to both the standards proposed herein and to the RACT requirements for VOC's imposed by the State regulatory agency. Due to the potential overlap of this rule and the RACT requirements for VOC's, the EPA developed them concurrently so that the requirements of the two would be consistent. After the bulk of the information gathering phase of the CTG and the NESHAP was complete, both the proposed rule and the CTG were developed within the framework of a regulatory negotiation, described below. Today's rulemaking proposes the NESHAP and identifies the rationale the regulatory negotiation Committee followed in developing it. The EPA plans to subsequently publish the CTG, including the recommended RACT, in a guidance document that will be available to all interested parties. B. Regulatory Negotiation Approach The EPA recognizes that there are many issues and challenges in developing, proposing, and promulgating a NESHAP for this source category. During the winter of 1992/1993, the EPA met with representatives of the industry (including small and large manufacturers), trade associations, finishing material suppliers, resin suppliers, States, and environmental groups at public meetings to discuss issues, share information, and assess whether a regulatory negotiation would be appropriate for this industry. Two exploratory meetings were held for these purposes. After the exploratory meetings, three public meetings were held in spring and early summer of 1993 to continue to discuss issues associated with regulatory development. After publishing in the Federal Register on June 23, 1993, a notice of establishment of the regulatory negotiation committee (58 FR 34011), the first official regulatory negotiation meeting was held in July 1993. Formal meetings and informal workshops were held over the next several months to identify and resolve the many issues associated with the regulation of HAP emissions from wood furniture manufacturing operations. The Committee members are listed in Table 1.
