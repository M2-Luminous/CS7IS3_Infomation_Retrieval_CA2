He underscored the holding of this meeting days after the conclusion of Cuba '94, the 15th International Tourism Convention, at the Varadero Beach Resort. Cuba wants to boost the so-called smokeless industry and plans to attract 1 million visitors in 1995. The names of new Cuban tourism businesses were presented only a week ago at Varadero. These businesses include three hotel chains, namely the Gran Caribe, Horizonte Hotels, and Islazul, and also the Marina Puertosol. The meeting of the tourism ministry council involved managers and presidents of the main tourism institutions and companies that are preparing to assume the challenge of competing in a world market, in which Cuba has a strong appeal, in the opinion of the meeting participants.
