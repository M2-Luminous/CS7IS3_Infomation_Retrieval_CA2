The electronic body scanners and luggage security checks in the main customs posts in Guangzhou, Kowloon and Jiangmen have given way to two new passages, known as the "red passage" and the "green passage". Under the new rules, customs formalities for travelers going through the "red passage" take a maximum of three minutes, while passengers having nothing to declare can go through the "green passage" without examination. According to the bureau, the new rules stipulate that random luggage examination will replace universal examinations. Officials said that the measures, first tried out in the Luohu and Zhongshan customs of the province, have brought China closer to the established international practices in the field. Starting January 20, the simplified customs formalities will be officially implemented in the province's customs posts at Guangzhou, Kowloon, Gongbei, Shantou, Wangpu, Jiangmen and Zhanjiang. Statistics show that the daily number of travellers going through the province's customs has increased from less than 20,000 in the early 1980s to the current 200,000, some 80 percent of the country's total.
