FR941102-2-00057 FR941102-2-00043 FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION Concerning Issuance of Powers of Attorney AGENCY: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. ACTION: Public notice. SUMMARY: In order to facilitate the discharge of its responsibilities as a conservator and liquidator of insured depository institutions, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) publishes the following notice. The publication of this notice is intended to comply with Title 16, Section 20 of the Oklahoma Statutes (16 O.S. 20) which, in part, declares Federal agencies that publish notices in the Federal Register concerning their promulgation of powers of attorney, to be exempt from the statutory requirement of having to record such powers of attorney in every county in which the agencies wish to effect the conveyance or release of interests in land. Notice Purusant to Section 11 of the Federal Deposit Insurance (FDI) Act (12 U.S.C. 1821), as amended by Section 212 of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), the FDIC is empowered to act as conservator or receiver of any state or federally chartered depository institution which it insures. Furthermore, under Section 11A of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1821a), as enacted under Section 215 of FIRREA, the FDIC is also appointed to manage the FSLIC Resolution Fund. Upon appointment as a conservator or receiver, the FDIC by operation of law becomes successor in title to the assets of the depository institutions on behalf of which it is appointed. As a Manager of the FSLIC Resolution Fund, the FDIC became successor in title to both the corporate assets formerly owned by the now defunct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), as well as to the assets of the depository institutions for which the FSLIC was appointed receiver prior to January 1, 1989. In addition, pursuant to Section 13(c) of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1823(c)), the FDIC also acquires legal title in its corporate capacity to assets acquired in furtherance of providing monetary assistance to prevent the closing of insured depository institutions or to expedite the acquisition by assuming depository institutions of assets and liabilities from closed depository institutions of which the FDIC is receiver. In order to facilitate the conservation and liquidation of assets held by the FDIC in its aforementioned capacities, the FDIC has provided powers of attorney to selected employees of its Southwest Service Center Office. These employees include: Jeffrey C. Conwell, Lawrence O. Greer, John Sears, Tommy K. Sears and John Vernon. Each employee to whom a power of attorney has been issued is authorized and empowered to: Sign, seal and deliver as the act and deed of the FDIC any instrument in writing, and to do every other thing necessary and proper for the collection and recovery of any and all monies and properties of every kind and nature whatsoever for and on behalf of the FDIC and to give proper receipts and acquittances therefor in the name and on behalf of the FDIC; release, discharge or assign any and all judgments, mortgages on real estate or personal property (including the release and discharge of the same of record in the office of any Prothonotary or Register of Deeds wherever located where payments on account of the same in redemption or otherwise may have been made by the debtor(s)), and to endorse receipt of such payment upon the records in any appropriate public office; receipt, collect and give all proper acquittances for any other sums of money owing to the FDIC for any acquired asset which the attorney-in-fact may sell or dispose of; execute any and all transfers and assignments as may be necessary to assign any securities or other choses in action; sign, seal, acknowledge and deliver any and all agreements as shall be deemed necessary or proper by the attorney-in-fact in the care and management of acquired assets; sign, seal, acknowledge and delivery indemnity agreements and surety bonds in the name of and on behalf of the FDIC; sign receipts for the payment of all rents and profits due or to become due on acquired assets; execute, acknowledge and deliver deeds of real property in the name of the FDIC; extend, postpone, release and satisfy or take such other action regarding any mortgage lien held in the name of the FDIC; execute, acknowledge and deliver in the name of the FDIC a power or attorney wherever necessary or required by law to any attorney employed by the FDIC; foreclosed any mortgage or other lien on either real or personal property, wherever located; do and perform every act necessary for the use, liquidation or collection of acquired assets held in the name of the FDIC; and sign, seal, acknowledge and deliver any and all documents as may be necessary to settle any action(s) or claim(s) asserted against the FDIC, either in its Receivership or Corporate capacity, or as Manager of the FSLIC Resolution Fund.
