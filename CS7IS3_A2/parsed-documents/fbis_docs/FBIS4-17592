The fleet representative reported that, in particular, one of the Ukrainian naval groups, stationed on Cape Khersones, held military exercises in which a Russian regiment was considered as the "potential enemy". After the end of Russian-Ukrainian negotiations in Sevastopol on dividing the Black Sea Fleet, Ukrainian military leaders have increased their pressure on Russian personnel under their command to take an oath of loyalty to Ukraine, the representative said. They are using not only blackmail and threats, but lures of promotions in the Ukrainian Navy and a respectable increase in pay. The Russian Black Sea Fleet press centre thinks that the Ukrainian naval officers are acting against the official position of the Ukrainian Government, which has often repeated its commitment to a civilized settlement of the Black Sea Fleet problem.
