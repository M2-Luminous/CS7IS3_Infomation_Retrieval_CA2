The statement says: "Ukrainian servicemen have committed yet another illegal act in relation to the Black Sea Fleet. From 2100 to 2300 on 10th April, the anniversary of the city's liberation from the German fascist aggressors, around 120 members of Ukraine's armed forces, acting in the best traditions of the SS divisions, attacked a division of mothball ships of the Black Sea Fleet in Odessa. "The Ukrainian raiders handcuffed the division's commander, Captain 1st Rank Oleg Feoktistov, the division's chief of staff, Captain 2nd Rank Aleksandr Zelenko, and the commander of the base support unit, Captain 2nd Rank Dmitriiy Starikov. The other officers and warrant officers, with their families, are on the unit's territory, under the guard of Ukrainian special-purpose troops. Windows were broken in offices, and people were wounded, some of them children. The unit's civilian staff were beaten up and removed to the village of Chabanka, near Odessa. It is also important to observe that the Commander of the Ukrainian Navy, Vice Admiral Vladimir Beskorovaynyy was then in the port of Odessa, on board the "Slavutich" ship belonging to the Ukrainian Navy administration. The Black Sea Fleet command is voicing its resolute protest to the Ukrainian military department in connection with the capture of the fleet division, and regards actions such as this to be a bandit attack which has gone beyond the control of military formations. Besides, two vehicles with commandos are reported to have been sent to Odessa to the location of hydrographic units of the Black Sea Fleet. These units are also being blockaded by up to 40 commandos".
