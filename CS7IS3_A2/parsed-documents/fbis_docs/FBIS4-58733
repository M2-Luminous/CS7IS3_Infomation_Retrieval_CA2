Resolution of this crisis is not predictable owing to British leaders' lack of political independence. [passage omitted] From the viewpoint of domestic and foreign experts the critical situation prevalent in Britain is closely linked with London's fresh charge against the Islamic Republic of Iran. It is also construed as a preplanned political and propaganda offensive in order to divert the attention of the people of Britain from the failures suffered by its Conservative government in its domestic and foreign policies. [passage omitted] Albert Reynolds, the president of the Irish Republic, too, in implicitly dismissing the British Government claim on alleged cooperation between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the IRA, has pointed out that so far no firm documents or evidence have been presented to him concerning such cooperation. This statement of the Irish president, and also a clear-cut assertion by the Irish Foreign Ministry spokesman to the effect that Ireland is continuing its efforts to boost economic ties and also a current trend on understanding and exchange between Tehran and Dublin and that Ireland is not inclined at all to undermine this reciprocal understanding, all point to just one thing. They show the reality that British statesmen have failed in a new round of their efforts to pressure Iran. Hence they must, once again, face the undesirable result of their counselling with the U.S. policies against the Islamic revolution. In a reference to the U.S. Administration's reaction to Britain's baseless claim on Iran's alleged cooperation with the IRA would clearly show the collusion between Washington and London. [sentence as heard] Last week, or few days before the start of this fresh clamor by the government of John Major, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher paid a visit to London, and when this political and propaganda offensive was initiated by Britain against Iran the head of the U.S. diplomacy was in Cairo. While in the Egyptian capital, Christopher, just moments after the assertion of this British claim against Iran, and even quicker than the procedure prevalent in diplomatic norms, said the issue shows that Iran must remain isolated and not get any share of economic aid from the West. This posturing was very controversial in the opinion of many analysts and experts in political affairs. It added to the notion that Christopher, prior to the start of this abortive offensive, had been briefed on the matter in the course of his British visit and had already made the necessary coordinations with the British leaders. [passage omitted] At any rate, in respect of the fact that the recent British claim against Iran points to London's political defeat in Northern Ireland, it also brings to memory yet another reality. Britain under the U.S. pressure has repeatedly acted against the Islamic Republic of Iran, and on each occasion has experienced the unfavorable outcome of this conflict more than any other country. Undoubtedly, this time too, it will gain nothing. Early last autumn Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, prior to meeting with Iran's foreign minister, Dr. 'Ali Akbar Velayati, on the sidelines of the 48th UN General Assembly session had said: The agenda of my talks with Dr. Velayati will be difficult. Now, apparently, Mr. Hurd should respond to this question as to why the agenda of talks between Tehran and other political representatives of European capitals has never been that difficult. The response is quite evident. In the event, British statesmen, while disregarding the U.S. pressures, reassess their stands concerning bilateral ties and view the existing issues realistically. They will not find any major obstacle on the way of the expansion of Tehran-London relations. If this does not happen, then the vicious circle will continue indefinitely.
