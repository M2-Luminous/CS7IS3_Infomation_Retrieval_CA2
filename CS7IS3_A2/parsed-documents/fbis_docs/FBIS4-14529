Meanwhile some 3,000 supporters of the late Georgian president Zviad Gamsakhurdia marched down the main avenue of Tbilisi in a demonstration marking what would have been the former leader's 55th birthday. Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze was in the building during the occupation and convinced General David Zaikidze, the chief of Tbilisi police who led the occupation, to withdraw his men from the parliament, officials said. Zaikidze is a political ally of Shevardnadze and officials here declined to speculate on his motivation for the protest, which took everyone inside the building, including an AFP correspondent, by surprise. Deputies subsequently confirmed Shevardnadze's nomination of Shota Kviraya as interior minister and strongly condemned Zaikidze's action, Marina Mamaladze, a presidential spokeswoman, told AFP. ITAR-TASS news agency quoted one of the policemen who stormed the building as saying that Kviraya was an "unworthy and incompetent man suspected of corruption and mafia links," but gave no further details. Kviraya was nominated to the post by Shevardnadze earlier this year and the Georgian leader had on several occasions called on deputies to approve the appointment. The protest initially sparked fears of an attempted coup d'etat, but afterwards more closely resembled one of the many personality clashes fueled by confrontation between armed groups that have plagued the Georgian capital for nearly three years. The tension was defused after Shevardnadze explained to Zaikidze that his behavior was "incorrect" and persuaded him to lead his men out of the building. The parliament was later sealed off. Marina Mamaladze told AFP that a special parliamentary commission would be convened to study Thursday's events. Meanwhile, the pro-Gamsakhurdia protesters, angered by a sharp fall in living standards and at Shevardnadze's moves toward closer ties with Russia, shouted calls for "independent and free Georgia." There were several tense scuffles during the protest march and security forces were absent from the streets but the demonstration went off largely peacefully and later dispersed. Armed groups loyal to Gamsakhurdia launched an offensive against Georgian government troops in the west of the country last autumn following the defeat of Georgian forces in the separatist republic of Abkhazia. The pro-Gamsakhurdia rebellion was crushed only after Shevardnadze appealed for and received military backing from Russia. Gamsakhurdia subsequently committed suicide, according to his wife.
