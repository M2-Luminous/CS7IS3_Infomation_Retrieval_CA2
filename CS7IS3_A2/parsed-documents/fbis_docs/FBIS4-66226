Inner circles of the Kuomintang (KMT) have already begun their intense publicity campaign. Issues to be discussed, following scholarly opinions sought by KMT elders, are taking form--direct election of the president by popular vote, the countersigning power of the premier as head of the Executive Yuan, term limits for legislators, and a standing role for the National Assembly. These issues will form the mainstay of discussions by the National Assembly at its meeting from April to August. By comparison, the second stage of constitutional reform saw politics drawn into the constitutional reform process because of distinct differences between factions within the KMT. For the third stage of constitutional reform, the inner structure of the KMT seems to be simpler, and dissension during meetings seems to have lessened. On the contrary, the focus has been on theoretical differences and the system. This point alone shows how much progress has been made in the KMT. According to higher political circles, direct election of the president by popular vote was already the focus of controversy at the third plenary session of the 13th party congress. This time, weightier elements who object to direct election of the president by popular vote are not quite as adamant. Similarly, some members of the mainstream faction that surfaced after the 14th Party Congress had evoked the great disapproval of the non-mainstream faction because they had repeatedly released trial balloons for "moving forward the date for popular election of the president." The non-mainstreamers had intended to attack and oppose this stand vehemently. But after mediation by some neutral parties, the mainstream faction abandoned their stand of "advancing the date of presidential election," thereby making it possible for the controversy to dissipate. According to inner circles at the presidential office, some people, before the 14th Party Congress, had suggested to Li Teng-hui to move forward the date for popular election of the president to avoid the "Yeltsin effect" which would follow the popular election for governor. At the time, Li did not show any clear indication one way or another, but said that this suggestion was worth consideration. However, the clamor for moving forward the date of the presidential election by popular vote became greater after the 14th Party Congress. This clamor actually posed a great threat to the non-mainstream group, for this equated Li's quest for another presidential term with advancing the date for presidential election by popular vote. Proponents for advancing the date of direct presidential election by popular vote have even made tentative plans to change the date, much like an arrow set against the bow and ready to shoot. However, faced with reaction from KMT insiders and the fact that there was not enough time to revise related legalities, and the task to make necessary constitutional revisions was too big, this clamor subsided after a while. It was pointed out that the idea of advancing the date of presidential election by popular vote appeared first around the time of the 3rd Plenary Session of the 13th Congress. Some scholars pinpoint the controversy as originating during the second stage of constitutional reform when the source and basis of presidential power were questioned. For during the time that the whole Hao P'ei-ts'un (6787 2672 2625) cabinet resigned, the source of presidential power had again been challenged. For the sake of political stability, the idea of advancing the date for presidential election by direct popular vote gradually took form. But after the 14th Party Congress, the calls for direct popular election of the president came too late. Whether such an election could take place the end of this year or early next year, there was no way to coordinate the necessary measures. Conducting it toward the end of 1995 had no practical meaning with respect to political stability. On the contrary, outsiders might think personal factors were involved in advancing the election, adding to the puzzle. Furthermore, if Li Teng-hui intend to succeed himself, why should he carry this unnecessary baggage of suspicion, by advancing the election date by three months? As a result, in this atmosphere of everything being in place, there was no way for the mainstreamers and non-mainstreamers to further ignite sparks over this controversy. It is understood that the attitude of Hao P'ei-ts'un, retired premier turned scholar studying the presidential office, has changed substantially over a year's time toward the way the president and vice-presidential positions are created. After many sessions with specialists who analyzed and enlightened him on the subject, Hao no longer insists on "selection by appointment," but is receptive to "direct election by popular vote" for the positions of president and vice-president. Because of this change in Hao, it is possible to eliminate the greatest unknown factor in this issue of "presidential election by direct popular vote," which is part of the mainstay discussion during the third stage of the constitution reform process conducted by the KMT. According to high political circles, after Hao had resigned his premier post as head of the Executive Yuan, he regularly invited different scholars in for discussions on constitutional government. After listening to analyses by many neutral parties, he has been less adamant in his opposition to the issue of "direct presidential election by popular vote," as long as the structure of constitutional government remains unchanged. However way the positions for president and vice-president are created, Ho can accept. This change in his stand has been transmitted via available channels to Li Teng-hui, and has allowed dissension on this issue, which was created by interpersonal factors, to be eliminated completely for the third stage of constitutional reform. Moreover, the controversy between the "direct election faction" and the "election by appointment faction" in the KMT that surfaced during the second stage of constitutional reform is settled, at least for the time being. However, it is possible that another topic--the countersigning power of the premier as head of the Executive Yuan--may be replacing it for discussion. As Hao P'ei-ts'un has had practical experience with this subject, he has a deeper understanding of the countersigning power of the premier as head of the Executive Yuan. Moreover, some scholars also emphasize that the countersigning power is proof that China's constitution tilts toward a cabinet system. It is understood that Hao favors retaining the original constitutional provision giving the countersigning power to the premier, or eliminating this power only for his resigned position as head of the Executive Yuan, but leaving it for the rest of the cabinet members, as it is under the present setup. Based on the larger controversy posed by the issue of "the countersigning power of the premier as head of the Executive Yuan," and the heated discussion generated during meeting of the advisory unit supporting the Tactical Planning Group on Constitutional Reform, a "unit studying special cases" was established. It would provide further understanding of this issue by making a complete analysis of the problem dealing with the premier's countersigning power. Members of this study group from the National Assembly include Chu Hsin-min [4281 2450 3046], Lin Ming-te [2651 6900 1795], Wang Fu-mou [3769 1381 5399], and Lin Hung-ch'ih [2651 7703 3069]; from the Legislative Committee, Wei Yung [7614 6978], and Huang Chu-wen [7806 0031 2429]; and from the group of scholars, Hu Fu [5170 1765] and Tung Hsiang [5516 5046 7378]. Composition of such a group reflects the importance the KMT's core attaches to this topic and the divergence of opinion inside the party. Among those opposed to slashing the countersigning power of the premier was the deputy minister of the Executive Yuan Hsu Li-te [1776 4539 1795] who notes this power in action on the inside. He feels the premier, as head of the Executive Yuan, must be answerable to the National Assembly. The budget for the five yuans and even the budget for the president's office are all subject to questioning of the premier by the National Assembly. To meet the rule that power and responsibility should be one, the premier should keep his countersigning power, especially if this power is one of form only, and he has to shoulder real responsibility in front of the National Assembly. Therefore, the countersigning power of the premier should not be pared down to any great extent. Those in support of a logical revision of the countersigning power of the premier base their views on the principle of the five yuans being coequals, and the premier should not countersign on personnel and legal matters for the other four, for countersigning amounts to interference in the administration affairs of the other yuans. As to powers directly exercised by the president, the premier should not countersign either, for it is easy for such mutual interference of executive powers to create political instability. As an example of constitutional government, ever since the constitution has been observed, the president has had real power. Constitutional reform this time is reform on a small scale. That is, based on examples from the past, the constitution grants the president the inherent power to meet present conditions. Under this premise, only some logical revision needs to be made regarding the countersigning power of the premier, limiting such power to personnel and legal matters within the Executive Yuan. The countersigning power within the other yuans should be assumed by their respective ministers, thereby making the five yuans as coequals. Among the views of these two factions, the most extreme are those held by Taiwan University professor Hu Fu and Huang Chu-wen, director of the KMT's central policy organization. Hu Fu advocates the view that China's constitution is the framework for the cabinet system, and the countersigning power of the premier, as head of the Executive Yuan, should not be changed, or it would be against the spirit and intent of the constitution. But Huang Chu-wen advocates, without reservation, that direct election of the president is the mainstay of constitutional reform which means tilting in the direction of a presidential system. It is only a small scale constitutional reform of little consequence in a larger scale constitutional reform. Therefore, under the premise of a presidential system, the countersigning power of the premier, as head of the Executive Yuan, should be discarded. It is very possible that this issue on the countersigning power of the head of the Executive Yuan, which lacks common understanding within the KMT, may evolve into a factional struggle. Two agenda items on "A Standing Role for the National Assembly" and "Term Limits for the Legislators" may present two conflicting problems dealing with the system for the National Assembly. From the standpoint of the KMT's central committee, the National Assembly only has an "existence-abrogation" problem and not what is called a "standing role" problem. However, judging from the National Assembly's attitude, it wants to have a regular standing role that allows it to oversee the operations of the Legislative Yuan. Such thinking which is counter to democratic government is the bad aftermath of factional struggles that occurred during the first and second stages of constitutional reform. From the standpoint of democratic government, the National Assembly represents the will of the people overseeing operations of executive departments. But there are problems involving control and supervision between the two. This situation cannot be allowed to surface between two national bodies representing the will of the people, whether it is the National Assembly overseeing the Legislative Yuan, or it is the Legislative Yuan reining in operations of the National Assembly. Such action goes completely against the conduct of democratic government. Deficiencies in design of such a system occurred during the first and second stages of constitutional reform. When political strife was introduced, that made problems which could be resolved even more muddled. Particularly when the National Assembly called for a role as an organ structure with regular standing, that made the conflict more acute between two political parties purporting to represent the will of the people. While the struggle between the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan is limited to their roles, and different from the power struggle between political factions, if this problem is not resolved during the third stage of constitutional reform, the problem of power struggle within the system will continue forever, and become an incurable cancer on constitutional government. Among the four basic Issues to be covered during the third stage of constitutional reform--direct election of the president by popular vote, the countersigning power of the premier as head of the Executive Yuan, a standing role for the National Assembly, and term limits on legislators--resistance to direct popular election of the president has been basically removed. The countersigning power of the premier may be a problem and lead to factional struggle within the KMT. Term limits for legislators and a standing role for the National Assembly may become a controversy about the system. The problem of the countersigning power will be the immediate cause for lively dissension during the third stage of constitution reform, but the problem with a standing role for the National Assembly and term limits for legislators will be the main reason for unending strife in the future.
