The latest incident occurred on 18 February, when the MIEP's petition for a referendum was confiscated in the underpass at the Nyugati railroad station, MIEP Cochairman Lajos Horvath announced at the party's news conference on 23 February. He said that a MIEP member who tried to clear up the matter immediately after this police action was ejected from the police station, being told "walkies outside, why should we deal with such a matter, you will not win the elections anyway!" In the MIEP's view, it is not impossible that police patrols had been given orders to act against the collection of signatures. A letter has been sent to National Police Chief Sandor Pinter asking him to investigate the responsibility for this politically motivated act. In connection with the elections, it was said at the news conference that the Budapest list is complete and the number of their individual candidates exceeds 140. They are delaying the publication of the list of names because running in MIEP colors involves the threat of losing one's job in a number of cases. They are willingly to support Laszlo Csucs, deputy chairman of Hungarian Radio, if he runs as an independent candidate in Mohacs [southern Hungary]. Similarly, they would also be happy to support Gabor Nahlik, deputy chairman of Hungarian Television, either as a MIEP or as an independent candidate. Answering NEPSZABADSAG's question in connection with the Hungarian Democratic Forum's [MDF] National Convention last weekend, [MIEP Co-Chairman Istvan] Csurka stated: "The MDF's ship is already nose down in the sea. We are lucky that we had been removed from this Titanic before it started to sink. The current three captains will not be able to repair the hole that was caused by the previous captain Jozsef Antall when the ship collided with the iceberg of the pact."
