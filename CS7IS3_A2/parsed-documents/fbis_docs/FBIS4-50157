However, because of the instigation for dissension by splittist forces and the ineffectiveness of our media and educational work, some problems and tendencies which must not be overlooked have emerged. Under such circumstances, properly evaluating and selecting advanced units and individuals in this region to attend the second national meeting on commending advanced units and individuals for promoting the unity of various nationalities; vigorously commending a number of advanced typical examples in promoting national unity, and using eloquent facts to demonstrate national unity and harmony in this region and the new situation of promoting prosperity by people of various nationalities will be of particular importance to further promoting the cause of making progress through national unity.

The top party and government leaders of various prefectures and Lhasa city and of various regional departments and bureaus as well as leading comrades assigned to the work must personally check the work, make arrangements, and ensure the success of the work. Various prefectures and Lhasa city should all set up leading groups to take charge of evaluating, selecting, and examining advanced units and individuals in promoting national unity, and they must publicize the work. Those leading groups should properly guide various units to carry out related activities on promoting progress through national unity. Deputy Secretary Danzim emphatically pointed out: If political problems occur because leading cadres do not assume full responsibility and if there are bad social consequences because of the selection of unqualified units and people, the related organizations and their leading cadres must be investigated for their responsibility. Deputy Secretary Danzim called on party and government organizations at various levels to extensively publicize the significance of this work and qualifications in evaluating and selecting advanced units and individuals, to hold various types of mobilization meetings, and to encourage the masses to give full play to democracy and to recommend [for commendation] advanced units and individuals for promoting national unity. Various organizations should consider the current activities of evaluating and selecting advanced units and individuals as an opportunity to create a situation in which everyone will advocate national unity, do good and actual things to promote national unity, and vie with one another to become advanced models in promoting national unity. The whole society should protect and enhance the good atmosphere of national unity so as to promote economic development and all-round social progress in this region.
