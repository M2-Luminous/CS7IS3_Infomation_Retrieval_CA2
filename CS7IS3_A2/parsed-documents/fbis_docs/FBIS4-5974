Chuan was scheduled to pay a six-day official visit to Japan from April 22 to discuss emergency rice imports and bilateral economic cooperation. Following Hosokawa's surprise announcement on April 8 that he will resign, Egyptian President Husni Mubarak postponed a trip to Japan slated for April 18 to 21 apparently because of the anticipated government change.
