Those calling for a dissolution or Mr Chuan's resignation cited the Government's poor performance and erosion of public faith. "I have always said this Government was elected and comes from the people," said Mr Chuan. "This Government is lawful because it is elected by the people. This Government has a majority elected by the people. This Government works according to its policy declared to Parliament. It has never done anything that is not in line with its policy. Therefore, this Government has righteousness to continue its work." Mr Chuan was brushing aside strong criticisms of him by political academic and critic M.R. [Royal title] Sukhumphan Boriphat and Social Action Party [SAP] leader Montri Phongphanit who claimed the Government had failed in its administration and the people had grown tired of it due to its lack of achievements. The Prime Minister said any party or individual had the right to criticise a government under democratic rule but the government also has the right to clarify those points which are not true. "They should not get angry when we make our points in response. It should not be like that," he said. Mr Chuan said democratic rule gave the people many alternatives to protest the national administration. First, they can revile it without fear of any danger. Second, the people have the chance to make up for mistakes by not voting for a bad government again. Mr Chuan appeared to pay no heed to Mr Montri's claims that the public had grown tired of his administration as reflected in the low voter turnout for the Bangkok city and district council elections on Sunday. He said there was nothing new in Mr Montri's comments. "No matter whether there is an election or not, he always says the same thing. He said this both before and after the elections." The Phalang Tham Party, which controlled a majority of 49 of the 57 seats in the City Council after the last election in 1990, saw the number of its city councillors shrink to 23 of the new 55-seat City Council. Mr Chuan's Democrat Party captured seven seats, six more than previously. The Opposition, however, can boast the results of the elections were a big victory for it since the Prachakhon Thai Party managed to win 19 seats, 13 more than in 1990, while the SAP took five seats, which Mr Montri said was beyond his expectations. The SAP leader, delighted by the increase in popularity for his party, challenged the Prime Minister to resign. But Mr Chuan chose to ignore Mr Montri's comments about public dissatisfaction with his government. "I have heard that comment but would rather not say anything in return." he said. The Prime Minister was also attacked recently by M.R. Sukhumphan who said he was disappointed with Mr Chuan and had lost all hope for his government. M.R. Sukhumphan claimed Mr Chuan who always played an outstanding role in keeping alive democratic thoughts before becoming prime minister, had already changed and "kept his ideologies in the drawer". The academic said the Premier did nothing except make sure the government could "survive" day by day. He also charged Mr Chuan with lacking the courage to solve national problems and of possessing pessimistic attitudes and fears about obstacles in everything he has to do. M.R. Sukhumphan said the best exit for the current political situation was for Mr Chuan to dissolve Parliament and call a general election. Meanwhile, Phalang Tham Party spokesman Sutham Saengprathum also hit out at Mr Chuan yesterday, charging him with allowing himself to be come a tool of the bureaucrats and foregoing the chance to take the lead in amending the Constitution. "The present Government is no different from the Chatchai Chunhawan Government because it just plays around with principles and figures to create false hopes for the people," claimed the Nakhon Si Thammarat MP. He said public confidence in the present administration was eroding quickly even though it had many prominent politicians who were seen as capable of solving the people's problems. It is a pity that these politicians, after assuming office, have worked on bureaucrats' directives and become their tool, he said. Mr Sutham said the people were losing hope in the Government even though they wanted very much to give it more time.
