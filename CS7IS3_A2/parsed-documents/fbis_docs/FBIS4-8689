They were in Yugoslavia and the German journalist had a special reporter's visa. Three persons who arrived from the center interrogated the journalists and set them free at midnight, even though Mrs. Timer is at an advance stage of pregnancy. The Serbian police sequestered all the tapes with interviews of Albanian personalities in Kosova and Montenegro, books, even personal cards and money. One of the policemen told the reporters: I would have sent you to prison if those from the center had not released you. The Albanian Journalists League protests this act of banditry of the Serbian police forces and appeals to international organizations to increase the pressure against the Belgrade regime to stop the maltreatment of journalists.
