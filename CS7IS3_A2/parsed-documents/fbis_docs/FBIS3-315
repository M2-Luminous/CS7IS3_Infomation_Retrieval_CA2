The poll released today found that even supporters of the king believed he was wrong to be so politically involved with the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]. Asked to rate leaders on a scale of 1-10, the king came first with an average of 6.64. The second most popular leader is Mr. Nelson Mandela with 5.8, followed closely by Chief Buthelezi with 5.37, and State President F.W. de Klerk with 5.04. The ANC's [African National Congress] candidate for premier in Natal, Mr. Jacob Zuma, received a negative rating from nearly half the sample.
