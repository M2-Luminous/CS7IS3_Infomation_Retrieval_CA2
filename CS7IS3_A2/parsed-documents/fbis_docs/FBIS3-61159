Vasilyev: "Agricultural Fields Under Threat of Depletion"] [Text] One of the main objectives of conducting land reform in Russia is to stop the processes of land degradation. However, today these processes have even become accelerated. This is convincingly corroborated by data prepared by a Roskomzem [Russian Committee on Land] state (national) report concerning the condition and use of land in the Russian Federation. It will be recalled that there are 222.3 million hectares of agricultural fields in Russia, including 132 million hectares of arable land, 62.5 million hectares of pastures, and 26.8 million hectares of hayfields. A substantial part is subject to various types of erosion, and tens of thousands of hectares are being destroyed by gullies. Almost all of the plowed land of the North Caucasus and the Volga region are eroded or threatened with erosion. This same situation has developed in the Chernozem area in Ukraine. Every fourth hectare of arable land in Western Siberia is eroded. Because of water erosion alone about one-tenth of arable land has lost 30-60 percent of its fertility, and about one-fourth of the arable land--from 10 to 30 percent. Meanwhile, the volume of antierosion measures in 1991 compared with 1988 fell by a third. In 1992, 11,000 hectares of windbreaks were established on arable land, in 1985, 24,000 hectares. The volume of work on laying antierosion plantings in narrow gorges, gullies, sands, and other land unsuitable for cultivation decreased by one-third. Annual humus losses on each hectare of arable land throughout Russia amounts to an average of 0.62 tonnes. They are especially high in regions situated in the steppe zone. Thus, in Samara, Chelyabinsk, and Orenburg Oblasts, Bashkortostan, and the Kabardino-Balkar Republic these losses amount to 0.8-1 tonne. It is calculated that to create a positive balance of humus in arable land it is necessary to introduce 1-1.2 billion tonnes of organic fertilizer annually. At the present time, only one-third of this amount is covered. A reduction in work on soil liming also has a negative effect on soil fertility. While in 1986 42 million tonnes of lime was applied, only 26 million tonnes were applied in 1991. More than one-fourth of the hayfields and 9 percent of the pastures are in a waterlogged condition. Also in this state are 5.7 million hectares of arable land. There has been a noticeable deterioration in recent years in the state of affairs in land reclamation. Operational repair work on functioning water management systems is far from being fully carried out. And this has a negative effect on their technical level and the output of improved sectors. More than half of the irrigated lands (about 3,500 hectares) need additional work on improving their qualitative condition. There is a need to redesign the drainage network over an area of more than 240,000 hectares. The figures cited in the state report once again indicate that major capital investments on the part of the state are necessary to make up for the diminishing fertility of the land. Agricultural enterprises and peasant farms are not now able to cope with this difficult task under conditions of inflation and acute shortage of resources. Only substantial state support in combination with improvements in land and economic relations in the village will help them to increase crop harvests and strengthen the fodder base for livestock raising.
