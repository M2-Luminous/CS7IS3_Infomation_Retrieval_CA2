ACTION: Notice of request for OMB extension of approval. SUMMARY: The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has requested that the Office of Management and Budget approve an extension of the expiration date of a currently approved information collection (1212&hyph;0026) without any change in the substance or in the method of collection. Current approval expires on October 31, 1994. The information collection is contained in the IRS/DOL/PBGC Form 5500 series. These forms are used by pension plan administrators to fulfill the requirements under section 4065 of ERISA and 29 CFR Part 2611 that an annual report be filed with the PBGC. The effect of this notice is to advise the public of the PBGC's request for OMB approval of this extension. ADDRESSES: All written comments (at least three copies) should be addressed to: Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (1212&hyph;0026), Washington, DC 20503. The request for extension will be available for public inspection at the PBGC Communications and Public Affairs Department, Suite 240, 1200 K Street NW., Washington, DC 20005&hyph;4026 between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Harold J. Ashner, Assistant General Counsel, Office of the General Counsel, Suite 240, 1200 K Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005&hyph;4026, 202&hyph;326&hyph;4024 (202&hyph;326&hyph;4179 for TTY and TDD). (These are not toll-free numbers.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35) establishes policies and procedures for controlling the paperwork burdens imposed by Federal agencies on the public. The Act vests the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) with regulatory responsibility over these burdens, and OMB has promulgated rules on the clearance of collections of information by Federal agencies (5 CFR Part 1320). Section 4065 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) (29 U.S.C. 1365) and 29 CFR Part 2611 require the administrator of a defined benefit pension plan to file an annual report with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) in order that PBGC may monitor the plan's yearly operations insofar as they relate to the termination insurance program under Title IV of ERISA. Other provisions in ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code (29 U.S.C. 1021(b) (4) and 26 U.S.C. 6058) require that annual reports be filed by administrators of employee benefit plans (including defined benefit pension plans) with the Department of Labor (DOL) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for similar monitoring with respect to the ERISA requirements within their respective jurisdictions. DOL, IRS, and PBGC have established joint forms (the Form 5500 series) to be used for those annual reports. When the appropriate form in the 5500 series is filed with the IRS, the filing requirement for each of the three agencies is satisfied; each agency utilizes the information applicable to it. In addition to general identifying information, the PBGC uses the coverage information reported on Form 5500 or Form 5500&hyph;C/R, and the actuarial information on Schedule B attached to the form, to fulfill its monitoring role. OMB has previously approved the PBGC's collection of information contained in the Form 5500 series; PBGC is requesting an extension of that approval without any change in the substance or method of collection. The PBGC estimates that it will receive 106,407 reports annually, that the response to the portion of the forms allocated to the PBGC will take an average of .21 hours, and that the annual burden imposed by this information collection is 25,379 hours. Issued at Washington, DC, this 26th day of August, 1994. Martin Slate, Executive Director, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.
