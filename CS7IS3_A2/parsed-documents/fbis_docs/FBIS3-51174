The meeting was held to review the security situation in the interior of our country. Alfonsin said he believes it is right for the government to be interested in this issue, but pointed out that he would like "this issue to be tackled from a social and economic viewpoint, without apparent preparation for repression." The main opposition party leader pointed out that he was very surprised at "the presence of the military leaders who, according to Interior Security regulations, should not become involved in this issue until the final phase is reached, via a decision that does not seem to have been made." Alfonsin said the UCR is studying the regional economies. He said: "In February, we will have a panorama for discussion with the government because we want to change the direction of these talks -- instead of waiting for an invitation to join any commission, we will present our own proposals." In remarks to Radio del Plata, Alfonsin said: "I have been talking about the deterioration of social peace for more than a year. I have traveled the entire country. Every time I return to Buenos Aires, I repeat that measures must be taken because all the regional economies are experiencing crises, some of which seem to be terminal." Alfonsin emphasized that "it is absolutely impossible" to pursue the current adjustment program, which "might be possible if the private sector were hiring personnel fired." The former president ruled out the possibility of guerrilla pockets cropping up in the provinces. He said: "Petitions may be tabled by people who are living beyond conceivable limits." Alfonsin again endorsed the agreement he signed with President Carlos Menem on constitutional reform. He said: "From a democratic viewpoint, we managed to overcome a tremendous crisis, which I have described as disastrous." Alfonsin noted that before this agreement "we were on a collision course," which "would have forced the UCR to refuse to elect constituent assembly members and to refuse to accept the new Constitution."
