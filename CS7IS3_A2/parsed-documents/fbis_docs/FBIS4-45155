"This event provokes deep Russian regret, the more so China did it at a time of the Geneva multilateral negotiations on comprehensive ban on nuclear tests, which has been supported by all nuclear powers," says the statement received by ITAR-TASS. "We are also alarmed with the fact further Chinese nuclear tests may endanger the observation of the nuclear tests moratorium by other nuclear powers." "We would like to hope that the Chinese side will understand its genuine national interests, comply with the appeals of the international community and together with other nations help to achieve complete termination of underground nuclear tests and fulfilment of the Chinese-declared intention to conclude a treaty on comprehensive ban on nuclear tests," says the document.
