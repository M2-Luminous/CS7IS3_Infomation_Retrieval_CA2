At the worst it might destabilise the Anglo-Irish strategy for managing the conflict in Northern Ireland. I say "managing the conflict" rather than "peace initiative" because it is prudent to keep the small print pessimistic. The overall strategy remains in place. It was worked out last year by Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds. The declaration by the British and Irish prime ministers, published shortly before Christmas, gives Irish nationalists an opportunity to win by peaceful persuasion the unity for their island that 25 years of bloodshed have shown cannot be achieved by violence. The terrorists among them are, reasonably enough, asked to cease hostilities before they can take part in negotiations. The strength of the joint declaration lies in the fact that it puts the two governments on the same side. They have not yet wavered on its central tenets. So far so good. Enter Mr Clinton. This is a relatively small matter for him. He has no dead to count, only votes. He is, however, an intelligent man. So on Saturday [29 January] morning the U.S. position was the same as that of Mr Major and Mr Reynolds: Mr Adams must renounce violence and accept the joint declaration before a visa is granted. The latter, a master of blarney, let his words travel far enough in the required direction without his meaning moving an inch. That enabled the president of the U.S. to cast aside his brain, redeem a campaign promise and appease a powerful Irish lobby. Mr Clinton capitulated on Saturday evening. The dispute clearly dived the Irish-American community. The visa was stamped in the US embassy in Dublin. The ambassador there is Jean Kennedy Smith, sister of Senator Edward Kennedy. This was victory for both Teddy and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan over a third formidable Irish-American, Mr Tom Foley. The speaker of the lower house was armed with arguments provided by the British ambassador to Washington, Sir Robin Renwick. For once the Renwick magic was insufficient. Perhaps it never had a chance. The case against dealing in the open with Mr Adams has been harder to make to Americans since Messrs Reynolds and Major promised that, after a ceasefire, they would do just that. After being barred for 20 years, the leader of Sinn Fein set off for New York. Mr Clinton presumably felt that the senators, who face re-election this year, had greater need of his assistance than the speaker. The U.S. is clearly not constitutionally equipped to play the game in the stonewall manner implied by the Reynolds-Major statement. Its centres of political influence are too diffuse. You cannot always say who will come out on top in a particular argument. This is a pity. A unified stance by the British, Irish and U.S. administrations might have led even the IRA to reflect that it was hopelessly isolated. The question that the prime minister now has to ask himself is which is the odd country out? Mr Reynolds is still on board as his recent scholarly exposition of the democratic nature of peaceful self-determination confirms, but his government did unilaterally remove the ban on radio and TV appearances by Mr Adams and his ilk. It might have done better to wait for a joint relaxation of media rules by both London and Dublin. The Irish also appear to have taken quiet satisfaction in the granting of a visa to the Sinn Fein leader. Is it Britain that needs to make a course correction? The answer depends in the first instance upon how you perceive Mr Adams. The president of Sinn Fein is customarily depicted as a front-man for the IRA. His party is usually described as the bombers' political wing. The British view is that he is too steeped in blood to be qualified to take part in the democratic process until there is an IRA ceasefire and he renounces the "armed struggle." The Irish and American view appears to be a softer version of this, namely that Sinn Fein has to be drawn into the peace process, since both it and the IRA are split. The more exposure that can be given to supposed doves like Mr Adams, the more likely it is that they will prevail. It would be easier to accept this proposition if there was any evidence in support of it. There is none. We are invited to take the word of Mr John Hume, the Social Democratic and Labour party member of Parliament whose work for a peaceful settlement has been admired by all. Mr Hume is an honourable man, devoted and brave in his pursuit of an end to the killing. We do not know what Mr Adams says behind closed doors, but to judge by his public statements he has not condemned IRA violence, let alone pressed for a ceasefire. Mr Hume has begged the IRA to suspend the slaughter while they and Sinn Fein debate the Reynolds-Major declaration. He may have been encouraged to so by his private conversations with Mr Adams but the latter has yet to be seen deploying even the most basic argument for peace such as that unity can only be gained through the ballot box minus bullets. Perhaps Senators Kennedy and Moynihan will prevail upon him to do so while he is in New York. The British view is that the Major-Reynolds declaration will slowly achieve its desired end, which is a cessation of violence. The Northern Ireland secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew has avoided negotiation with Mr Adams while doing his best to maintain the moral and rational high ground. Sir Patrick will not "clarify" in the sense of altering the original meaning of the declaration but he will make its intent ciear. This war of words may continue for some time. Britain might as well lift the ban on the broadcasting of the voices of Mr Adams and his colleagues, since their words, spoken by actors, are not challengeable by live interviewers. The principal response to the granting of a U.S. visa to Mr Adams should be a review of British public relations. This is an area in which London's expertise is at least matched by Sinn Fein, in Belfast, Dublin and New York. Mr Adams plainly cannot be silenced. Attempts to muzzle him have increasingly become counterproductive. There is no call from Dublin or Washington to negotiate with Sinn Fein, at least not until it calls for a ceasefire. The Major- Reynolds strategy for managing the violence therefore dictates itself. Mr Adams must be out-argued.
