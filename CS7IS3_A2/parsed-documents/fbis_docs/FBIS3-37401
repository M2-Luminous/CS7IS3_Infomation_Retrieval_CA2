According to governmental sources, a department for coordination of administrative bodies' activities was established instead of the former state secretariat. The newly established department is led by Belarussian People's Deputy, former First Deputy State Secretary Valeriy Pavlov. At the same time, Kebich introduced a new post in the Cabinet of Ministers -- the State Secretary for National Security, the rank of who in the official hierarchy is close to an envoy. Former State Secretary, Gennadiy Danilov, (who is considered by observers in Minsk as one of the most influential people in the circles close to the premier) was appointed to this post. Among the new secretary's duties there is coordination of activities carried out by all law enforcement structures and by the army and aimed at combating the crime. According to governmental sources, Kebich demanded that Danilov urgently work out "a national program on very strict measures for struggle with this evil." According to the results of the recently held public opinion poll published by the government's press service on Wednesday, as many as 32.7 percent of respondents believe that the crisis in the republic could be overcome through strengthening of the struggle with mafia and corruption. Answering to the question who could withdraw the country from the crisis, a total of 10.3 percent of respondents called Kebich; 6.8 percent Head of the temporary parliamentary commission on struggle with corruption, Aleksandr Lukashenko; 4.2 percent Mechyslaw Hryb; 3.4 percent Leader of the Belarusian People's Front, Zyanon Paznyak and 0.8 percent of respondents put their confidence in the parliament's former Speaker, Stanislav Shushkevich. The rest of the respondents said there was no such leader in the republic or found it hard to give a definite answer.
