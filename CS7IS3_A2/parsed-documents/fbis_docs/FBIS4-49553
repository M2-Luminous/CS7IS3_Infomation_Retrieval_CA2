In a recent symposium on the wide use of information in the national economy and China's information superhighway, Wu Jichuan, minister of posts and telecommunications, said China will watch closely the world's latest development of the information superhighway construction and carry out its own in a planned and step-by-step manner. He said China will expand the application of computers in digital exchanges and accelerate the construction of optical fibers and build an internet by developing a network telecommunications platform based on the country's public telecommunications network. The symposium, attended by China's senior officials and information experts, exchanged information on the world's current trend of information superhighway construction, its definition and its social economic significance. China's demands for such a highway and its potentials were widely discussed in the symposium, the first of its kind in China. As part of the effort to cope with the world's new information revolution, China is busy building 22 national-level optical fiber trunk lines to connect all the provincial capitals, 20 digital microwave trunk lines, and large and medium-sized satellite telecommunications ground stations. According to government sources, the large capacity digital transmission network connecting the country's major provincial capital cities will be completed early next year. First phase construction of a nationwide digital exchange network was completed last September. At present, the network extends to 267 of China's major cities and has started to exchange information with 37 centers in 20 countries and regions. Meanwhile, the first phase project of the high speed digital trunk line connecting 21 provinces and municipalities will be put into operation this July. A cellular phone network has covered the coastal provinces in the southeast and some central provinces. Viewing the current level of information modernization, experts said that the 700,000 mobile telephones will be linked by a nationwide network soon. China's seven million radio pagers have made the country one of the world's largest paging markets. Computers have been widely used in banking, customs clearance, railway transportation and civil aviation and weather forecasting. These, in all, will contribute to China's information modernization, experts commented. As another major step in the construction of the information superhighway, China plans to accelerate hi-tech research concerned with information modernization, especially advanced remote sensing, surveying, computers, automation facilities and modern telecommunications technologies. The construction of the information superhighway is a systematic project which will involve different fields of work, said Wu Jichuan, minister of posts and telecommunications. He called on the joint efforts of participating departments to work toward erecting the modern information network.
