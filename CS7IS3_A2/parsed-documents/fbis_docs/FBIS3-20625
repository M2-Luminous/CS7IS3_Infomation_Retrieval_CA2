The Ningbo Yinghua power plant is the first large-scale electric power project to be built by joint venture between China and Singapore. It will be a coal-fired power plant with an installed capacity of 2,400MW. The first phase of construction will include two 600MW units and transformer facilities for an estimated investment of 5.5 billion yuan. This large-scale power plant will be built near Xiangshan Wan at Xianyang in Yin County by the Zhejiang Province Electric Power Bureau (Zhejiang Province Electric Power Development Corporation) and the Singapore Group's subsidiary (Shengbaowang) Engineering Development (Private) Corporation, who will be working together in a construction, ownership, operation, and transfer type of arrangement. Both sides invested 50 percent, forming the Sino-Foreign Cooperative Ninglong Power Corporation, which will build and run the power plant. After 20 years of operation, it will be turned over to the Zhejiang Electric Power Bureau. The feasibility study for the Yinghua Power Plant Project has been completed, and the project proposal document has been delivered to the national authorities. The authorities say that if development goes smoothly the first phase of this project can be formally up and running in 1999.
