To make hasty accusations against one Arab party or another after the assassination of the Jordanian diplomat in Beirut is to ignore the risks involved at this particular juncture. One cannot but understand the Jordanian position maintaining that the aim of the assassination of the diplomat was to strike at any bid for rapprochement between Amman and Damascus. Is any Arab party opposed to such rapprochement? The realistic answer is no. Actually, it should be stressed that the incident which occurred in Beirut, the first of its kind in three years, was a severe blow to Lebanon and all of its government's attempts to prove to Arabs and foreigners that security prevails in Beirut and that they can return there. In terms of the aim it was meant to achieve, the incident is only comparable to the blowing up of the Phalangist headquarters on New Year's Eve. That was meant to be a clear message to whom it may concern that Beirut would not return to normal, that all the attempts to rebuild it would fail, and that it would remain hostage particularly to those who are thought to have allocated millions for its destruction and for making it what it is, a den of blackmail, as it was in the eighties. It is clear, however, that just as the Phalangist headquarters explosion did not stop the reconstruction process, there is nothing to indicate that the assassination of the Jordanian diplomat, serious as it is, will stop the government's march. Even more important, the assassination appears to be aimed primarily at Syria which has, in recent weeks, taken a number of important steps culminating in the summit meeting between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton in Geneva on 16 January. At that summit President al-Asad emphasized that peace is Syria's "strategic choice," and the United States confirmed its willingness to improve relations with Syria, which would pave the way for the elimination of its name from the list of states sponsoring terrorism. There can be no doubt that Syria's conduct in Lebanon will be one of the matters to be taken into consideration in the assessment of bilateral relations in accordance with a certain mechanism agreed by the foreign ministries of the two countries. That being the case, is it conceivable that the aim of the assassination was anything but to embarrass Syria and portray it as incapable of holding all the cards in the Lebanese game, and to show that the Lebanese question should also be discussed with other non-Syrian parties and outside the framework of the Lebanese Government? It seems, therefore, that in the coming few days Syria will have to confirm that it has made its choice and that its decision is final. Helping the Lebanese Government identify the party which perpetrated that ugly crime would be the best confirmation of this, because Syria would not tolerate those who pursue a strategy different from its own, those whose strategy is in harmony with Israeli interests, especially the Israeli interest in keeping Beirut out of bounds for Arabs and foreigners.
