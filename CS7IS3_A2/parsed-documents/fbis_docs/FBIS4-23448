Yesterday, he had two separate meetings with his own supporters to give them a ticking off and with the opposition to float some radical ideas. The opposition has been giving the government a hard time since last year's controversial elections. There was a virtual civil war in Brazzaville between government and opposition militias for many months. On what President Lissouba had to say, Antoine Mouyambala telexed this report from Brazzaville. President Lissouba proposed that some form of power sharing agreement could be made based on the example of South Africa. He said: If blacks and whites can share power in South Africa, we too should be able to surmount our ethnic differences. President Lissouba has recently suggested that Congo could follow the example of South Africa by giving the main opposition leader the post of vice president. Lissouba said he thought the Congolese Constitution, which is based on the French one, was unsuitable. He said this constitution, which gives everything to the winner of elections and nothing to the loser, runs against the Congolese spirit of negotiation and dialogue. The president asked his supporters in parliament to speed up the process of administrative decentralization, which would allow for some degree of power sharing with the opposition. Lissouba criticized his supporters, saying they were wasting time with administrative details. He said they should just get on with decentralization. Both opposition leaders and the president's supporters have responded favorably to his ideas on power sharing. Opposition leader Bernard Kolelas said Lissouba's proposals were extremely interesting.
