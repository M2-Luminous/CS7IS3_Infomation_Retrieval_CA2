He asked the tax commission to draw up "appropriate guidelines" for tax reform "based on the pillar of lessening personal income taxes and fulfilling taxation on consumption." Hata was speaking at the start of an afternoon meeting of the commission, an advisory panel to the prime minister that is to present tax options next month for politicians to choose from. He asked the panel members to "treat the earlier request of former Prime Minister Hosokawa as my request," saying he plans to push the same package that includes "permanent income tax cuts." Hata pledged "utmost efforts" to keep Hosokawa's vow of submitting the government's tax legislation by the end of next month and getting it through parliament this year, with "the cooperation and understanding of the various parties." Opposition to a consumption tax hike by the Social Democratic Party was a key problem for the Hosokawa government. The socialists quit the coalition, leaving Hata to form the first minority government in nearly four decades. In addition to the shifting the tax burden away from direct levies such as income tax toward indirect levies like the consumption tax, Hosokawa also said as prime minister that Japan's net tax burden must grow to meet the coming needs of the nation's graying society.
