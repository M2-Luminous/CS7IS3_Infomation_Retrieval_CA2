FBIS4-7573 "dreeu063__a94023" FBIS-EEU-94-063-A Daily Report 20 Mar 1994 ANNEX Romania Foreign Ministry on DPRK Inspection Issue Foreign Ministry on DPRK Inspection Issue AU3103071094 Bucharest ROMPRES in English 1752 GMT 20 Mar 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU3103071094 Bucharest ROMPRES English BFN [Excerpt] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 30/3/1994 -- [passage omitted] Romania's stance on the North Korean nuclear file was presented at today's news conference of the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs by Simona Miculescu, deputy to the ministry's spokesman. The statement shows that Romania's attitude to this issue derives from its position as party to the treaty of non-proliferation of nuclear arms, and that by joining this treaty the People's Democratic Republic of Korea voluntarily assumed to strictly, unconditionally abide by the international commitments to this end. "We find it in the interest of security and peace in the Korean peninsula that the DPRK complies with the regulations of the guarantee agreement concluded with the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], including inspections of the North-Korean nuclear plants. At the same time, it is obvious that to reach this target the direct negotiations between United States and the DPRK have to be resumed, as well as the dialogue between the North and South of Korea, a prime component of which should be the issue of denuclearising the Korean peninsula. "The Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs pronounces for steps apt to favor such processes, which would contribute to defusing tension in the Korean peninsula, and for a negotiated settlement of the issues raised by the North Korean nuclear file," the Romanian Foreign Ministry's statement says.
