Today we may expect a very important development in the position of the New Alliance for Democracy [NSD] on approving the cabinet changes, assuming of course the demands of the parties making up the NSD are satisfied, Tomov told our reporter Antoaneta Puncheva. One should not permit any single political force to dominate the cabinet, Tomov said, because in such a situation it is certain that the cabinet will fall. Aleksandur Tomov stated at a news conference held earlier that the GOR will issue a statement on the government changes and a statement on the government's intentions at the plenary session of parliament as soon as they are finally drafted.
