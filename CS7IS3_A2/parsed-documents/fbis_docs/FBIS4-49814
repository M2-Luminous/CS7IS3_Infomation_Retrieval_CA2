The goal was forwarded in a recent plan of the provincial government, corresponding to a similar plan newly made public by the central government. According to the plan, the province will inject nine million yuan every year into poverty-relief projects in the six poorest counties in addition to funds from the central government for the 28 poorest counties in the province. Though painstaking efforts over the past eight years have reduced the province's impoverished population from 13 million to 7.6 million, the figure still accounts for one tenth of the national total, the officials admitted. By the end of 1993 the province still had 4,800 villages whose per-capita incomes were under 300 yuan a year, the official-set poverty line. The officials said most of the impoverished people live in places where the natural conditions are harsh, either too mountainous or often hit by floods or drought, or where endemic diseases are rampant. The province still has over one million people and 400,000 head of domestic animals afflicted by water shortages, 2,300 villages inaccessible to motor traffic and 1,600 villages without electricity, the officials said. Large enterprises will also be encouraged to help poor areas develop their own industries, as they have the technicians, technologies and market information that poor areas often lack. In addition, cities may be paired, the ones with relatively better developed economies helping the poorer ones in technology, marketing and training of technicians, the officials said.
