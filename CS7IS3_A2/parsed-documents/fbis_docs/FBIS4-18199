According to Mr. Major, the compromise guarantees countries opposed to a decision "a considerable reprieve" and is "legally binding." Mr. Major threatened: "Any dispute can be settled by the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, taking whatever time is needed." On Wednesday, the European Commission (EC) presented to a meeting of European Union (EU) country representatives its vision of the Ioannina compromise. In its opinion, it is merely a "political declaration of goodwill" which is "not legally binding and cannot therefore serve as the basis of any recourse to the European Court of Justice." The EC added that the Ioannina compromise did not affect the current internal rules of the European Council of Ministers. The regulations state that "a vote can be taken whenever a Member State or the EC so requests, and a simple majority (seven states out of 12) are agreed." The EC stressed on Wednesday: "The EC will not hesitate to use this right. The European Parliament will without doubt ensure this." The European executive body was again keen to point out that the Ioannina compromise is in no way an omen for the 1996 intergovernmental conference, which is to prepare the EU for a future enlargement toward Central and East Europe.
