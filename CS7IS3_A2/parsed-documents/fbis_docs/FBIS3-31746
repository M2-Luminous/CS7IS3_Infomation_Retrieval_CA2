Tomory said that the merger was announced in January, shortly after the National Assembly passed the new defense law by a vast majority, because the government wanted to "strike while the iron is hot" and take full advantage of the stipulation in the new law that gives the defense minister the authority "to develop the high command of the army." Although the law does not specifically call for the merger, the government's view, Tomory said, was that the "six-party consensus" on the law--forged during two years of difficult interparty negotiations--provides a broad-based mandate for the reorganization. The move is the latest "in a series of successes," Tomory said, for the political leadership of the Defense Ministry, which took an active part in negotiating the defense law and managed to "reach a consensus with the military policy experts of the parliamentary parties without having to give in" on key points relating to the authority of the Defense Ministry. The government's plan, according to statements made to HVG by Rudolf Joo, administrative state secretary in the Defense Ministry, calls for two major divisions within the Defense Ministry: a "civil service-state administration department, which is headed by the administrative state secretary," and a separate "department consisting of the officers of the ex-army command." The latter, according to Joo, will be headed by the highest-ranking officer, who will have the rank of state secretary and will be subordinate to the defense minister. Thus, Tomory commented, "two parallel hierarchies seem to be developing within the Defense Ministry, which will have a civilian character by virtue of the fact that the minister of defense holds the two halves together." The article reports that in some quarters the plan has been received with considerable skepticism. The government's goal of "ending parallel commands" and "strengthening civilian control over the military" could be "self-defeating," critics claim, because it creates the "danger" that "the ministry will be militarized." In fact, Tomory reported, according to some military "experts" who "do not wish to be named," it is not even clear "which organization is being incorporated into the other one." Moreover, in the opinion of these critics, the plan to have two separate organizational departments within the Defense Ministry will be difficult to work out in practice. "At the moment, it is not even possible to know what kind of subordinate and supervisory relations might develop between the civil-service civilian employees and those transferred from the military command." It appears that "one-half to two-thirds of the employees of the new Ministry of Defense (presently 320 employees work in the Ministry of Defense while 800 work at Army Headquarters) would stick out of the usual ministerial hierarchy." While the restructuring details are unclear, it is certain that the merger enables the government to get rid of high-level holdovers from the communist-era military command. The government has already announced, Tomory reported, that the present commander of the army, Colonel-General Kalman Lorincz, will be retired as soon as he reaches the minimum retirement age of 55 this month--thus ending the controversy that erupted two years ago over whether or not the government has the right to fire him. According to State Secretary Joo, Tomory reported, one proof of the "correctness" of the merger is that it facilitates the personnel changes that the former communists want to avoid. The Hungarian Socialist Party--which is a successor of the formerly ruling communist party and which has a chance of winning the May election--is the one party that wants military leadership changes to take place "only after the next election," Joo asserted.
