An omen for what comes afterwards? The pessimists, whose opinion has so far been confirmed by statistics in the Middle East, can easily draw conclusions from that as to a dark future: Distrust and hatred are rooted too deeply for the peoples to free themselves from the prison of violence. Therefore, they say, the noble beginning of Washington (on 13 September, when Yitzhaq Rabin and Yasir 'Arafat shook hands) will end in a war of attrition about details and the enemies of peace will still get the upper hand. The optimists may conclude the opposite from the interrupted ceremony. Winston Churchill once said: "It is better to jaw-jaw than to war-war." Thus, one might understand the tug-of-war and the haggling, which did not stop even in front of the gathered dignitaries from all over the world, as a reassuring omen -- because, first, 'Arafat has never missed an opportunity to put himself into the limelight and, second, he once again had to prove to his enemies in his own camp how tough he is in reality; and, finally, only someone who basically accepted the deal a long time ago tries to get an additional advantage at the last moment. Nevertheless, Israeli Prime Minister Rabin was right when he noted with slight irony: "We watched only the tip of the iceberg of those problems that we still have to overcome." Where it is not only land, but also mutually exclusive rights that are involved, any detail becomes the symbol of the entire conflict, which can be called a 100-year war (as Rabin did) without any exaggeration. Whether Gaza gets its own telephone prefix (no longer the 972 for Israel) or has its own stamps is not a postal but a highly political problem. Whose judiciary is responsible for the settlers in the West Bank cannot be solved pragmatically but only on principle, and behind this there is the most tortuous question of all: How much sovereignty for the Palestinians -- and how quickly? It is quite clear that a question like that cannot be answered at the negotiating table, but only in everyday coexistence. And therefore the enemies of peace keep their bloody power of veto: Any terrorist attack is a deep gouge in the shaky scaffolding of peace. The Israelis can keep the extremists in check with their tested state machinery; the PLO still has to demonstrate whether it really has the monopoly on power, which is the foundation of any state. The brief interruption on the stage in Cairo demonstrated theatre, but not tragedy. Whether the latter will indeed come to pass will be demonstrated on a completely different stage -- there where Israelis and Palestinians will have to practice peace as of now: in Gaza and in Jericho.
