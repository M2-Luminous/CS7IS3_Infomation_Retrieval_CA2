However, these raids are useful for changing the balance of power and, indirectly, promoting agreements -- Colonel Robert Pick, adjutant, state secretary, and head of the president's military office, told us. Robert Pick spoke about the Yugoslav crisis and Hungary's security policy, and also said that the arms reduction talks in Vienna are no longer timely. They Failed to Avoid Conflicts [Vereckei] In your opinion, the aim of the UN intervention was to shift the balance in favor of the Bosnians. [Pick] No, the actions carried out by the NATO aircraft were hardly big enough to have any serious effect on the balance of forces in Bosnia. However, the possibility is theoretically open; it is true, however, that there are many unforeseeable difficulties hindering a larger action of this kind. [Vereckei] Many people claim that a timely and more firm position on the part of the West could have prevented the escalation of this crisis. [Pick] I am convinced that the conflict would not have developed thus far if the United Nations had taken the necessary steps at the appropriate time. As is well known, the United Nations also has the task of avoiding conflicts, keeping peace, and creating peace. However, they failed to prevent the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and I find this to be a basic mistake and, although there is no peace, there are peace-keeping forces present. What is needed in the region is the establishment of peace, but this requires more troops. In my opinion, the establishment of peace with the help of armed forces is theoretically unclear as well: It is difficult to speak of the establishment of peace in a place where the United Nations appears as a third party in the conflict. It is unclear on whose side it can do that and with what means. [Vereckei] While both the United Nations and the United States are trying to show determination in continuing the armed intervention, Russia is opposing this for many reasons. Under these circumstances, how determined can the United Nations really be? [Pick] Precisely to the extent shown by the events of recent years and the UN security decisions. I do not think that a new Security Council resolution can go beyond the current tasks, all the more so because the Russian side would probably veto every such initiative. [Vereckei] The AWACS debate in Hungary repeatedly flared up along with the air raids. It was still possible to explain the role of the AWACS aircraft flying in Hungarian airspace at the time of the downing of the Galebs, because the AWACS were only carrying out their task of supervising the flying ban. However, in the course of their latest actions, the NATO combat aircraft attacked ground targets in Bosnia while the reconnaissance aircraft were flying in Hungarian airspace. In this context, how can we evaluate Prime Minister Peter Boross' request that the AWACS aircraft leave Hungary's airspace during combat actions? [Pick] I would remind the readers that earlier, at the first instance involving AWACS aircraft, Jozsef Antall wrote a letter to NATO in which he asked the following: If a change takes place in the activity of the AWACS aircraft, a change that exceeds the framework allowed by the Hungarian Parliament, NATO officials should take into consideration the fact that the Hungarian Parliament has to discuss this issue again. I think that the latest event is only the continuation of previous events. Avoiding Air Raids in Peace Time [Vereckei] Obviously, Hungary's security policy situation is affected not only by the Yugoslav crisis, but also by every change taking place in our region. The recent elections in Ukraine ended with the victory of the pro-Russian leftist forces, and the voices of Russian extremists dreaming of an empire are becoming increasingly loud in Russia. Could all this represent any threat to Hungary in the foreseeable future? [Pick] I am convinced that, at the moment, Hungary does not face any military danger. Yeltsin and the Russian Government have repeatedly pointed out that Russia has no aggressive intentions toward other countries. Therefore, the extremists do not represent official policy; besides, such political groups can also be found in other countries. At the same time, one can clearly see that Russia wants to continue to be a big power factor, and it reacts sensitively to any attempt to belittle this role. [Vereckei] Contrary to the Vienna armed forces reduction agreement, Russia does not want to disarm its troops withdrawn from Europe; instead, Russia would send them to the Caucasus. Would this mean the end of the Vienna quotas? [Pick] An agreement lasts as long as the balance of forces remains as it was at the time of the signature. This balance of forces has changed considerably since then: The Soviet Union has disintegrated and the CSFR has separated into two countries. If it wishes, Russia can exceed the agreements and no one can stop it. [Vereckei] It seems increasingly certain that, in exchange for the outstanding Russian debt, Hungary will receive the S-300 missiles. Although these missiles are clearly defensive weapons, even the MiG-29 aircraft caused concern in our region. Can you envisage an arms race in this region started by Hungary? [Pick] If someone wants to arm himself, he will always find a proper excuse. Naturally, a race needs several players. However, no one should forget that Hungary was the only country to suffer an air-raid in peacetime. It is the task of the MiG-29 aircraft and the S-300 missiles to avoid the repetition of such an event. Military Service Could Be Reduced [Vereckei] Parliamentary elections will be held in Hungary in a few weeks. In your opinion, could the basic elements of Hungary's security policy and its Army organization change considerably in the case of a change in government? [Pick] I do not think that any essential change could take place. The political parties represented in parliament have repeatedly expressed a unity of views on major security policy issues. As for the Army structure, this is a scientific issue. The army has so far been organized within certain perimeters and such conditions that determine the army's organization will continue to exist in the future. [Vereckei] One of the key issues in the debate on the Army was whether the parties want a professional army or one based on compulsory conscription. What is your position on this? [Pick] The Hungarian Army cannot be reorganized into a professional army in the near future. Theoretically, a professional army always serves interventionist goals, but defense is a matter for the entire nation. From a military viewpoint, it is absolutely clear that a professional army cannot train the number of reserves needed to fulfill the requirements of adequate defense, enable the restoration of the original situation, and make the aggressor give up the desire for further attacks. At the same time, because of the shortened period of service and the complex military equipment, the number of professional soldiers needs to be increased. I would particularly mention the officers corps here, where the shortening of military service led to serious consequences. Disciplinary and court proceedings prove what it means when there is not enough time to train officers: They do not learn how to treat people. However, I can envisage a further decrease in the military service time, but this should be accompanied by a modernization of the training and mobilization system. [Vereckei] Looking at the past four years, what was it like to work with the Defense Ministry and the army? [Pick] Essentially, we can almost call these relations cloudless. [Vereckei] Did you also see the taxi drivers' blockade in these terms? At that time, the possibility of using the Army also arose. [Pick] No, the taxi drivers' blockade was a political issue and, therefore, it could not cause a conflict between the ministry and the president's military office. [Vereckei] Other problems? [Pick] Occasional professional differences of view, but these differences are natural within a good working relationship.
