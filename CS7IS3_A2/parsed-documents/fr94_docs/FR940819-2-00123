The American Folklife Center was created by the U.S. Congress with passage of Public Law 94&hyph;201, the American Folklife Preservation Act, in 1976. The Center is directed to ``preserve and present American folklife'' through programs of research, documentation, archival preservation, live presentation, exhibition, publications, dissemination, training, and other activities involving the many folk cultural traditions of the United States. The Center is under the general guidance of a Board of Trustees composed of members from Federal agencies and private life widely recognized for their interest in American folk traditions and arts. The Center is structured with a small core group of versatile professionals who both carry out programs themselves and oversee projects done by contract by others. In the brief period of the Center's operation it has energetically carried out its mandate with programs that provide coordination, assistance, and model projects for the field of American folklife. Alan Jabbour, Director, American Folklife Center. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;20390 Filed 8&hyph;18&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 1410&hyph;01&hyph;M
