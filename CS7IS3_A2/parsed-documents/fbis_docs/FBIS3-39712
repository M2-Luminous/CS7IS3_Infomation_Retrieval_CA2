"Our mission is not over," Admiral Jeremy Boorda said. "Any weapons found that are not under control will be subject to air strike. Any shelling of Sarajevo will be cause for a strike recommendation against the party doing the shelling," he also said. Meanwhile verification by UN forces on the ground and NATO reconnaissance aircraft continued Monday, the admiral said. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation said all heavy weapons had to be withdrawn 20 kilometres (12.5 mile) from the center of Sarajevo or placed under UN control.
