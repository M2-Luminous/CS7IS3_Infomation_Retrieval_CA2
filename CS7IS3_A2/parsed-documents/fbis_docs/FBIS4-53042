It will convert the glass furnace at Takatsuki Works (Takatsuki-cho, Shiga Prefecture) which is producing glass for picture tubes to liquid crystal use during 1995. Increased production of over 500,000 sheets per month is possible by this and combined with existing lines, production of over 1 million sheets per month will be possible. Since the demand for liquid crystal panels for personal computers and word processors is increasing, they are hastening provision of a supply system. Currently, Nippon Electric Glass is producing from 150,000 to 200,000 sheets of LCD thin sheet glass per month. Since the production capability of the glass furnace will be about 500,000 sheets converted to thin sheet glass, up to now they had aimed at boosting the supply quantity in the form of augmenting precision processing equipment. Since the increase in demand is continuing, however, they have decided this time to convert to LCD use the melting furnace for picture tube glass at the Takatsuki Works, which has become a surplus facility along with the Malaysia move plan. It is estimated that a surplus supply of 500,000 to 700,000 sheets per month will be generated by this. There also is a policy at the company to continue aggressive facilities investment of several billion yen a year in the LCD thin sheet glass business in the future, and the idea is to devise an aggressive production increase system matching market expansion.
