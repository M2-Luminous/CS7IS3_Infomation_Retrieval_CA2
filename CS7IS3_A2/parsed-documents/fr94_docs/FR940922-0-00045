FR940922-0-00045 FR940922-0-00017 Regulatory Flexibility Act The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)) has reviewed and approved this rule, and in so doing certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule will not affect the ability of small entities, relative to larger entities, to bid for and acquire HUD-held mortgages that HUD decides to sell. Justification for Final Rulemaking In general, the Department publishes a rule for public comment before issuing a rule for effect, in accordance with its own regulations on rulemaking, 24 CFR part 10. However, part 10 does provide for exceptions from that general rule where the agency finds good cause to omit advance notice and public participation. The good cause requirement is satisfied when prior public procedure is ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' (24 CFR 10.1) The Department finds that good cause exists to publish section 207.270 of this rule for effect without first soliciting public comment, in that prior public procedure is unnecessary because the Department is merely codifying an existing earlier policy. Regulatory Agenda This final rule was listed as sequence number 1579 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on April 25, 1994 (59 FR 20424, 20446) in accordance with Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
