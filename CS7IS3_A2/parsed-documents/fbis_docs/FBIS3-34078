Sources close to the Rafsanjani wing have said that the Iranian president was hoping that the amnesty -- coupled with new measures to ease the restrictions imposed on cultural activities -- would help Iran to improve its image with regard to its human right records. But its seems that Khamene'i took the advice of hard-line factions opposed to any "sign of weakness." Rafsanjani suffered another setback yesterday when the Majles Financial Committee announced its disapproval of the government's proposal to increase petrol prices from 250 riyals to 600 riyals -- an increase of 22 cents.
