And 94 percent of the victims of repression by the Stalinist regime during the period of 1933-1938 were individuals of Azeri nationality, although only 70 percent of the residents of the republic at that time were Azeris. Practically none of the Armenians, who made up 11 percent of the population of Azerbaijan at the time, suffered, not counting several families of "transgressing" Chekists: because 80 percent of the workers of the republic's penal organs were Armenians.
