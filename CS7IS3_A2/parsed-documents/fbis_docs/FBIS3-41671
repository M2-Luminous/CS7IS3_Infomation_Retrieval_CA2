There are still no cases of plague. The situation regarding cholera is more complicated. It is generally brought in from abroad: In 1990, 49 patients came in from Syria, and in 1992, 5 patients came in from India. And this year, 17 patients and carriers of the virus have already been registered in Makhachkala, Nizhniy Novgorod, Krasnodar, and Naberezhnyye Chelny. And 2 cases of cholera disease from local sources have been noted in Dagestan and Moscow. The possibility of outbreaks of acute infectious diseases remains because there are no real boundaries between Russia and the former republics of the USSR and penetration of patients from them is possible. The Russian Federation's law regarding protecting its territories from the import and spread of especially dangerous infectious diseases of people, animals, and plants and the plan for such a federal program are still in the development stage. Overall, the situation regarding morbidity due to acute intestinal infections in Russia remains complicated. Up to 1 million cases of disease due to acute intestinal infections are registered each year because the public is not adequately supplied with good-quality drinking water and foodstuffs. The situation is especially serious in Russia's southern oblasts. As the Rostov Oblast Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight told us, four cases of hemorrhagic fever have been discovered in the area, and two patients have died. In half a year, 93 diptheria patient were hospitalized in the Rostov Oblast (3 died), there have already been several outbreaks of diptheria, and the number of brucellosis patients has increased by a factor of 5. Everyone has long known how to guard against infectious diseases. Wash your hands before eating, do not drink untreated water, do not eat unwashed fruits...
