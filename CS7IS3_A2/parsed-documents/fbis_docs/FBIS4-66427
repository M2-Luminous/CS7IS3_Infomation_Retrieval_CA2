NEDO will use experimental facilities that produce a phenomenon in which a micro-gravity environment, like that in outer space, is obtained when objects fall naturally, and will elucidate the basic mechanisms of combustion to design the high-performance industrial furnace and boiler. NEDO will receive grants from MITI and plans to invest Â¥5 billion in a seven-year effort starting this fiscal year. The goals are to improve upon the thermal efficiency of present-day industrial furnaces and boilers by 30% and 5%, respectively. Heating furnaces, heat-processing furnaces, aluminum-melting furnaces, and other such industrial furnaces used today account for about 15% of the total energy consumption in Japan. Reducing that energy consumption is also viewed as important from the standpoint of preventing global warming. On the other hand, there has come to be brisk research into the details of combustion in micro-gravity environments, where buoyancy and convection effects are not felt. Consequently, NEDO decided to build upon these new research results and develop methods for increasing combustion efficiency and reducing harmful exhaust gases by controlling the state of the flame within the furnace. The Japan Space Utilization Promotion Center will be commissioned to conduct basic experiments on combustion phenomena and to develop the control technology. In addition to the Hokkaido Kami-sunagawa-machi drop-test facility operated by the third-sector Underground Zero-Gravity Experimental Center (Sapporo City), NEDO will use Bremen University's drop tower in Germany, and France's system that uses airplanes for zero-gravity environment experiments. NEDO will also exchange information on research results. The Japan Industrial Furnace Society and the Japan Society of Industrial Machinery Manufacturers will be commissioned to develop a test furnace and evaluate its performance. If the industrial furnace becomes practical and goes into widespread use, a rough calculation shows that it will bring about a 5% reduction in Japan's total energy consumption.
