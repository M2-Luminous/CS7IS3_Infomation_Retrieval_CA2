Zhu Rongji's instructions indicate the recurrence of willful fund raising. Zhu Rongji pointed out that the policy for monetary work this year will basically exercise macrocregulation and control. He stressed: The "rules and regulations" set by the national monetary work meeting in July last year should continue to be implemented; financial institutions are not allowed to violate these regulations to raise funds, to build development zones without authorization, or to speculate in stock or real estate businesses. As learned, capital construction in China was planned to reach 800 billion yuan, but turned out to be 1,100 billion yuan, far exceeding the plan. According to an estimate by a mainland official, 40 percent of the investment in capital construction was spent on cement, steel, other building materials, and equipment; some was used for workers' wages. As a result, 40 yuan out of each 100 yuan invested became consumption funds, which constitutes purchasing power in the market and has caused successive price hikes. As reported, China's scale of capital construction investment this year will be bigger than last year, reaching more than 1,500 billion yuan. According to Zhu Rongji's plan for monetary work, the key to controlling the scale of capital construction is to control bank loans and plug channels for willful fund raising. With these aspects under control, the issuance of money can also be controlled and inflation reduced. The authorities plan to control inflation to below 10 percent this year and reduce inflation next year to about 6 percent, Zhu Rongji pointed out. As was learned, two-thirds of China's investment in capital construction last year was in local construction projects, while one-third was used under central plans. Now, provinces and cities throughout China, out of consideration for their own interests, are carrying out their own capital construction projects, including airports, highways, power stations, and ports. All of these are proceeding in excess of the state annual plan and are dispersing state financial and material resources. However, reports say that the Chinese authorities have postponed reforms to the central bank, the policy banks, and the commercial banks from the beginning of this year to the second half of this year.
