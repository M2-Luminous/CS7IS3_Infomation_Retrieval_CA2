Shortly before his departure for a meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton and the highest representatives of the Visegrad Four, we asked Michal Kovac for his comment on the coming summit. [Begin recording] [Kovac] We expect that President Clinton will inform us about the conclusions and offer, and we are ready to accept the offer within the framework of Partnership for Peace. We pledge ourselves that we will take immediate action so that we can conclude the relevant agreements. Naturally, this is also an opportunity for us to inform the United States about our endeavors here at home in the Slovak Republic to continue in the process of strengthening the plurality system of democracy, transformation, and economic reforms. As you know, at the same time this will also provide an opportunity for bilateral talks with representatives of the Visegrad Group.
