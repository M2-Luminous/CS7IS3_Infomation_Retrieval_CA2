"We hope that the Estonian side thought over the results of the 17th round and came to the conclusion that we have to find ways to compromise to solve some of the deadlocks," he said. On Thursday, Estonian Decolonization Initiative Centre will hold a picket in front of the building of Estonian Foreign Ministry to support and encourage Estonian delegation before the 18th round. "Estonian delegation should not choose the Latvian way on the issue of the retired Russian military, but has to lift up its chin," Juri Estam from the Center told ETA.
