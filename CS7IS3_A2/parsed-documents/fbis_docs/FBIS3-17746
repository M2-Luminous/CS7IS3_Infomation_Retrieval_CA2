The elections held last Sunday have been found valid in all the 450 one-seat districts, although in the run-up to the elections, many politicians, including President Kravchuk, have not been sure of sufficient voter turnout. Some 75 per cent of voters on an everage have cast their ballots, according to preliminary returns. Voter turnout in Kiev was considerably less, approximately 56 per cent of the eligible voters. There was the highest voter turnout in Western regions, where, as expected, candidates from nationalist forces won. There is a different picture in eastern Ukraine. In the Donetsk and the Lugansk regions, out of the 14 deputies who won in the first round, eleven will represent the Communist Party of Ukraine in the Supreme Soviet. First secretary of the Centarl Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine Petr Simonenko was also elected deputy of the Supreme Soviet. Only a small part of the future deputies corps, some 70 people have been elected to the Supreme Soviet on the first round, according to preliminary results. The date for the second round has not yet been fixed. Informed sources say, however, that it will be held not later than 10 April. Most of those who have been elected to parliament in the first round are prominent politicians. Former premier Leonid Kutchma who favours stronger ties with Russia earned the biggest number of votes. Ninety-one per cent of voters in the district where he ran cast their ballots for him. The voter turnout in the Novgorod- Severskiy district where he ran was 96 per cent. Among those who have been elected to parlaiment are the present parliamentary speaker Ivan Plyushch, former deputy prime minister Viktor Pizenik, leader of extreme nationalists Stepan Khmara and other politicians prominent in Ukraine. Foreign observers who monitored the election believe there have been no serious violations of democratic procedure.
