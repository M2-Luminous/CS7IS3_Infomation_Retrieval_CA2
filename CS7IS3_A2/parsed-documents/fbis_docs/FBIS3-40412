Aerospatiale has just landed a third customer for its Eryx missile, thus bringing the value of all its firm orders to 1.2 billion francs. Norway, following Canada--which by coincidence is another "cold country"--has just purchased Eryx, "the only short-range antitank missile for use by infantry units." Lightweight and compact, the French missile is also the first missile capable not only of being launched in close quarters but also of damaging a heavy tank at close range (600 m). According to the firm, the three Eryx orders received this year [1993] cover a total of 14,400 missiles and 1,049 launchers. France has ordered 2,700 missiles and 200 launchers to be supplied from the first two phases of production. Canada signed up for 4,500 missiles and 425 launchers this past summer at a total price, according to Aerospatiale, "on the order of 400 million francs." Norway has just ordered 7,200 missiles and 424 launchers for an announced figure of about 650 million francs (with an option worth 300 million francs to be picked up before the end of 1996). ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Over 14,000 Eryx Missiles Ordered | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Description |France |Canada |Norway | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Missiles |2,700 |4,500 |7,200 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Launchers |200 |425 |424 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Contract* |200 |400 |650 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |% offset |0 |100 |100 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |* In millions of francs. | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- That is the largest Eryx order received to date by the French firm, and it is the second to be received from a NATO country. According to Aerospatiale, it is also "the largest defense contract ever signed between France and Norway." Oslo is thus becoming a good customer for French weapons and for French missiles in particular, considering that Norway also ordered a sizable batch of Mistral very-short-range surface-to-air missiles from Matra Defense back in 1990. The Eryx order was signed at Aerospatiale's head office in Paris on 23 November by Odd I. Nielsen, director of the Logistics Command of the Norwegian Army, and Jean-Louis Fache, director of Aerospatiale-Missiles, in the presence of Norwegian Minister of Defense Jorgen Kosmo and Norwegian Ambassador Arne Langeland. On that occasion, the Norwegian minister emphasized that Eryx is "another example of successful cooperation" between the two countries in the field of armament. Louis Gallois, president and CEO of Aerospatiale, described the contract as representing a "real partnership combined with technology transfers." The offset agreement was signed at the same time by J.-L. Fache and Oivind Baekken, general director of armament. Aerospatiale points out that those "high-technology" offsets involve cooperation in research and development (risk analysis software and image processing software engineering) and the co-production of Eryx subsystems in Norway (the explosive charge by Raufoss in cooperation with Dyno and the missile wing unit by the NFT). Those components are being subcontracted for the entire Eryx program, not just for the missiles intended for Norway, as was the case previously with the Eryx tripods and sight units for Canada. But Aerospatiale will maintain a unit for production of the missile's wings, and Giat Industries will do the same with respect to the explosive charge (of SERAT design). The French Army has already taken possession of its first mass-produced Eryx missiles, several dozen of which have been fired this year [1993] in winter conditions, both in Canada and in Norway. The Eryx has therefore qualified as a "cold-weather" weapon but also as a "hot-weather" weapon thanks to firings in Djibouti, says Aerospatiale. In all, according to the firm, the number of missiles fired for evaluation and testing comes to nearly 300. Canada will take delivery of its first Eryx missiles at the end of November [1993], and Norway will receive its missiles early in 1995. According to Aerospatiale, these three orders will keep the Bourges plant busy producing about 500 missiles per month. The current monthly production rate is only 150. But the firm says that the monthly rate is going to increase: to 300 in the first half of 1994 and 800 the year after that, after which it will top out at 1,000 missiles per month by the end of 1995 or the start of 1996. Aerospatiale expects to sell 50,000 Eryx missiles between now and the end of 1988.
