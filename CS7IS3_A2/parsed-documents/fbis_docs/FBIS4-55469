Kovac, who will be visiting Austria next week, declined to answer the question of whether he would ask an election winner Meciar to form a government: "I have not yet made a decision," he pointed out. The relevant Slovak parties--the Party of the Democratic Left (SDL), the Democratic Union (DEUS), the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), and the Social Democrats--have already ruled out a coalition with Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS). The parties that might support Meciar are not likely to receive 5 percent of the vote. Also, the popularity of the HZDS leader has declined, Kovac believes. "Up to 93 percent of the population used to support him, but now the percentage has dropped to 20-30 percent." The Slovaks have gotten used to the coalition government and have started appreciating its stabilizing effect and its contribution to calming down the political climate. There are only a few left who are concerned about the sovereignty of the young state. At 4.2 percent, the economy has shrunk to a lesser extent than expected. Inflation is "not that high" at 25.1 percent. Asked about the Slovak nuclear power plants near the Austrian border, Kovac showed understanding for Austria's concerns, stating that his country would also welcome a Central Europe free of nuclear power plants. Nuclear energy is not the only energy source in Slovakia, but "numerous things do not depend only on Slovakia. Bohunice will be closed down in the year 2002. Yet Mohovce will continue to operate." Referring to the delicate issue of the Hungarian minority, Kovac mentioned the agreements that have been concluded with the Hungarian representatives on place-name signs in two languages and on the right to bear a name. They do not apply to towns and villages that date back to the Magyarization phase between 1876 and 1918 and to the period between 1939 and 1944. To eliminate "insinuations" between Hungary and Slovakia, a treaty on the inviolability of the borders is required. Slovakia expects positive impulses from Austria's planned entry into the European Union. "We hope we will become a neighboring country of the European Union." Austria will certainly gather "valuable experience" and pass it on to Slovakia, Kovac stressed.
