The report says that the prosecutor-general's office has not investigated up to the end "circumstances connected with moral damage which should be reimbursed at the expense of the guilty parties according to operating legislation. "it is also necessary to complete investigation against people who, employing the situation in Moscow which developed between September 21 and October 4, 1993, committed robberies, violence, acts of aggravated hooliganism and other law-breaking activities". The prosecutor-general's office set up a commission to organise investigation into the case of October disorders. Results of its work will be reported later. The prosecutor-general's office states at the same time that if pardoned people will again commit law violations, the office will use all its powers against law-breakers.
