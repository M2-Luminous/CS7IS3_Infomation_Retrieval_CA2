The Serbian president's office has announced that they discussed the current situation in former Bosnia-Herzegovina, especially the crisis concerning Sarajevo, which is obstructing the peace process. They decided that steps should be taken to discourage the supporters of the war option and encourage the forces of peace in solving the crisis. The calming of war tensions in the Sarajevo area is undoubtedly of great importance for ending the conflict. President Milosevic asked Vitaly Churkin to convey his greetings to Russian President Boris Yeltsin, whom he thanks for the assistance given in overcoming the greatest crisis so far in the peace process and in reducing the danger of the war escalating.
