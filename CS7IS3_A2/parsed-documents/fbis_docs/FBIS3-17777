The statement points out gross violations of the law in Crimea during the course of the election campaign and during the election itself. These include campaigning on the eve of election, the issue of several ballot papers to one person, the issue of ballot papers to people without identification, and pressure on the electoral commissions and voters exerted by representatives of the Rossiya bloc. The worst violation, the statement says, was the propaganda speech by president of Crimea, Yuriy Meshkov, on local television last Friday. The authors of the statement are convinced that the situation in Crimea will continue to deteriorate if Yuriy Meshkov, his administration and the newly elected Supreme Council fail to work constructively to preserve peace and stability on the peninsula. Proceeding from this, the statement says, cooperation between Ukrainian and Crimean-Tatar organizations has acquired special significance. The Ukrainian organizations will be even more uncompromising in defending the interests of the Crimean Tatars through their central offices in Kiev and their deputies in Ukraine's Supreme Council. The Crimean-Tatar National Movement Organization will support Ukrainian organizations on the issues of preserving Ukraine's territorial integrity and consolidating Ukrainian statehood on the territory of Crimea.
