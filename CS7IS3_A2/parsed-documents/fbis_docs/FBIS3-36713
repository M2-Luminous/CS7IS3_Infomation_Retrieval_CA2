In the opinion of 23 signatories to the document, the unification of monetary systems and its consequences will result in Belarusians' work for alien masters and the alien state. The republic will become a free corridor for tax-free transit of russian gas, oil and raw materials to the west. The statement claims unilateral orientation at the east has inflicted on Belarus enormous losses in clearing goods exchange. For instance, Belarus pays 128 U.S. dollars for a ton of Russian oil, which costs 91 U.S. dollars at the Rotterdam Exchange. The opposition deputies called for an all-Belarusian political rally to demand resignation of the government, dissolution of the parliament and democratic elections.
