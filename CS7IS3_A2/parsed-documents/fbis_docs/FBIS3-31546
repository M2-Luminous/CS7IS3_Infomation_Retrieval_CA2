For this reason, we have phoned Mario Nobilo, our ambassador to the United Nations. Good evening, Mr. Nobilo. Please tell us whether the debate in the Security Council is still going on. [Nobilo] In fact, there will be no debate today after my conversation with the chairman of the Security Council. The debate will probably be put off until next week. There is no urgency in the Security Council's moves, and I managed to explain to the Security Council chairman at today's meeting that Butrus-Ghali's report itself--unfavorable for Croatia at first glance--warns about UNPROFOR's limited resources in verifying the withdrawal, which I had noted in my letter to Butrus-Ghali yesterday. However, what is important in the earlier Security Council demand is the insistence that progress be made. We are primarily linking the progress to the guarantees we are demanding of the Security Council for the security of the Croat enclaves in central Bosnia. It also depends on the progress achieved in the promising negotiations between the Croat and Muslim sides in Bosnia- Herzegovina. And, of course--there is a new element here--the withdrawal of enormous quantities of heavy weapons and the new military situation around Sarajevo create a new military balance in the region. That could be used against the Croat side; we would like the Security Council to prevent the regrouping of Muslim forces against the Croats. I do not believe that will happen, but the Security Council is aware of the new circumstances. I believe, therefore, that this whole report is a form of pressure on Croatia--not only on Croatia, but on all sides in former Yugoslavia--to reach a peaceful settlement. This particularly serves the West and the international community in their endeavors to have the remaining disputed issues between the Croat and Muslim sides resolved and to see the defining of the future good and dynamic relations between the two peoples and states--which is why I think this pressure should be viewed in the context of such a process. This is primarily a process. What is important, however, is that finally we have an active consensus of the great powers on the European level and that people are finally talking in resolute tones. Croatia will certainly--in this sense, as it has hitherto--be the most cooperative party so that there is no direct danger if this process--which began with the president's Bonn initiative--were to continue to develop favorably, despite international factors being as active as they are now. [Correspondent] In the secretary general's report--at least according to the text that we have received--quite a few things are unclear. Mr. Butrus-Ghali says the blue helmets were not able to supervise the withdrawal throughout the area, but there was a withdrawal. It is stated that not a single command center of the Croatian Army nor activity by any brigade was identified, and it speculates that the formations of the Croatian Army are probably significantly more careful. Dr. Nobilo, what can transpire from such a report for Croatia? [Nobilo] Nothing directly. But I repeat: It will always be a way of exerting pressure on Croatia if things deteriorate, and things will resolve themselves if things improve so that there are no immediate effects. Butrus-Ghali's report itself distances itself from all this by saying that they think, and they believe, and they do not have sufficient proof, and they do not have sufficient people and mechanisms to carry out the inspections. This is indicative of the possible relations in this military area, but it is also certainly to be seen in the context of the situation in central Bosnia and the talks on the latest developments around Sarajevo. It should always be seen in a broad context. We should try not to do ourselves harm here, but on the contrary, to benefit from it.
