You will recall that after the concept of the constitution was adopted, I first made a speech when the constitution was submitted for nationwide discussion for the first time and then the second speech was made by Ivan Stepanovich Plyushch. Thus, according to the constitution, three speeches were made: one on the concept, and two on the draft of the constitution itself. Thus, we may say that the Supreme Council and the commission on elaborating the new constitution which it created worked actively for two years. A large number of proposals were received. Some of them were taken into account and more than 2,000 proposals were received after it was published. If one were to give a short description of them, they relate to the problems of organizing power and most of them relate to the problem of the territorial organization of power and local self-government. The main aim of preparing the adoption of documents which we are now discussing lies in the urgency of improving and stabilizing the system of organizing power that is naturally an indivisible condition for further political and economic reforms in Ukraine: the creation of a stable legal basis for the activity of the Supreme Council of the new convocation and other bodies of power, and the speeding up of the constitutional process and finalizing work on the new constitution of Ukraine. The form of the adoption of this document by means of a referendum establishes firm legal foundations for the legitimate and evolutionary process of organizing power structures, holding it with the agreement of the highest bearer of power: the people of Ukraine. Without doubt this will become an important condition of accord, social peace, and partnership in our society. Other ways of resolving constitutional issues were examined at an extended session of the constitutional commission. In particular the talk was about the possibility of working out a mechanism for elaborating the draft new constitution of Ukraine and submitting it as a whole to a referendum. The talk was about the possibility of the Supreme Council again directly adopting a constitution and about a Ukraine-wide referendum adopting a prepared draft law on the organization of authority in Ukraine. Documents were submitted, I repeat, on all of these aspects, and were discussed. But it was agreed that the most legitimate and productive path is for the Supreme Council to approve the basis for constitutional principles and for it to be submitted to a referendum. And now briefly about the content of the document submitted: It is based on principles determined by the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine and on the corresponding principles of the new draft constitution of Ukraine, which, as has already been said here, have been frequently examined in this hall. The fundamental constitutional clauses contain guiding principles and powers and mechanisms of restraint and counterbalance, which make it possible to create an efficient system of organizing state authority and local self-government. It is also important that they provide answers to questions, which people's deputies and representatives of local bodies of authority are proposing and have proposed be put to the referendum in a separate bloc. That is, questions on constitutional order, on the form of state government, and on the territorial organization of power and local self-government. That is, this document, in our opinion, resolves the fundamental issue as a whole. It does not tear them away from the general political and state context and does not create an atmosphere of social tension in society. The substance of the fundamental constitutional clauses gives grounds for determining a democratic, lawful, and social nature of the state and social order, where universal values are determined without any "-isms"; the priority of human rights and freedoms are also determined this way, as are political, economic, and ideological variety and equal protection for all forms of ownership in a socially oriented market economy. The fundamental clauses establish elements of the form of government that are the most acceptable under current conditions by determining the authority of the branches of power, and these clauses determine the territorial system and territorial organization of power, specifically unitary decentralized power. As you see, the document is composed of seven chapters, the first of which deals with the general basis of the organization of state power and local self-government, proceeding in particular from the principles of democracy, the supremacy of law, and the division of state power into its legislative, executive, and judicial branches. These principles are further developed and enforcibly realized in the draft's further chapters. The second, third, fourth, and fifth chapters contain the main provisions on the status, plenary powers, functional mutual relations, and organization of central branches and establishments of state legislative, executive, and judicial power, as well as the plenary powers of the Ukrainian president. The second chapter emphasizes that the people exercise legislative power by way of an all-Ukrainian referendum and that the only body of legislative power, that functions permanently, is the Supreme Council of the Ukrainian parliament. Also determined here are the main legislative, institutional supervisory functions, and plenary powers of the Supreme Council, its capabilities in respect of the operation of budgetary and taxation policies, appointment, and election of the president, and his impeachment, formation of the government, etc. The draft's third chapter establishes the status of the Ukrainian president as the head of state, who is removed from the system of executive power and placed with various branches of power, acting in relation to all of them as a guarantor to ensure that the Constitution of Ukraine is abided by, human and civic rights and freedoms are complied with and state unity, sovereignty, and the national security and territorial integrity of Ukraine are preserved. It is in connection with this that the relevant functions and plenary powers are also vested in the president. The fourth chapter defines the system of executive power in Ukraine and the status of the supreme organ of state executive power, the Cabinet of Ministers, that is accountable and responsible to the Supreme Council and is under the Ukrainian president's control. The preparation of this chapter was based on the need to raise the level of the government's independence and strengthen executive power and discipline at every level in all. The fifth chapter, as you see, is on the subject of an authoritative system of judicial power. A separate provision in the draft's sixth chapter is on the territorial reorganization of power and local self-government. It is about this, as has already been said, that discussions were particularly acute. This chapter's agreed version proceeds from the direction of the territorial organization of power and local self-government toward uniting state, regional, and local interests under the unitary decentralized construction of a single system of Ukraine's territorial structure. This is particularly pressing because of the situation which today surrounds the Crimean issue. It is completely understandable that it cannot be further left undefined. That is why section six outlines the status of the Crimean Republic on the principles of autonomy, of Kiev as the capital of Ukraine, and Sevastopol as a city that has a general state significance, bodies of state power of the Crimean Republic, and bodies of local self-government. Local interests will be represented by heads of oblast, rayon, and town and village councils that will be directly elected by the population and will be headed officially by the executive bodies of the appropriate councils. In order to avoid centrifugal and separatist tendencies and also with the aim of strengthening executive discipline on issues of powers delegated by the state, they will be answerable to the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. In the event of a blatant violation of Ukraine's constitution or legislative acts they may be removed from their posts. Cases are envisaged when the powers of the Supreme Council of the Crimean Republic and also of respective local councils may be terminated ahead of time by Ukraine's Supreme Council. This relates to the adoption of decisions directed at violating the territorial integrity of Ukraine, an arbitrary change in its state territorial system, the blatant violation of Ukraine's Constitution and laws, and not bringing their own decisions in line with them. The draft's final seventh chapter points out that this document lays the foundation of the completion of work on Ukraine's new constitution and that the organs of state power and local self-government across the whole territory of Ukraine are formed after the fundamental constitutional provisions are brought into effect, which is quite essential in order to understand and overcome the differences between the current constitution and this document which will be implemented as relevant laws are worked out and Ukraine's new constitution is adopted. As for the possibility of the issues of state symbols, citizenship, linguistic policy, and so on being included in the fundamental constitutional provisions, this was the subject of every session. All of them are undoubtedly very important and of consequence and cannot be ignored. We all very well know, however, that there is no uniform perception of them today in various regions of Ukraine. Including them in the fundamental provisions and putting them up for a referendum -- on top of all this at the time of holding the elections -- can lead to exacerbating the political struggle and further increasing enmity in society. That is why raising these issues now is inexpedient. They could well be settled either in a new constitution or constitutional legislation which will be dealt with by a newly-composed Supreme Council. Since the fundamental constitutional provisions on the reorganization of state power and local self-government in Ukraine have also been appropriately approved, endorsed, and recommended for a decision to be taken on them, with approval given by the conference of councils at all levels, and are based on the provisions of the draft new constitution of Ukraine, it is proposed that a discussion should be held about them, that changes and amendments, if any of course, should be introduced and that then the decision drafted should be taken. In view of this, we have every ground to propose this document and include it in a referendum at the time of the elections on 27 March 1994. Esteemed People's Deputies: Here in this hall, fateful and some of the most responsible decisions were made. I hope that, its historical mission taken into consideration, the Supreme Council today will, on the basis of its experience, open a new page in the development of nation-building in Ukraine, of new prospects, treating their electorate with great respect and enabling them to make their conclusive pronouncement on the organization of power in Ukraine. Thank you for attention.
