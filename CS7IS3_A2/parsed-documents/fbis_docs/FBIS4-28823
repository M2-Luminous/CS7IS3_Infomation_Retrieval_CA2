The system would be capable of two-way high-quality moving image and voice transmission, said the 1994 white paper on communications released by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. The report also predicted that three-dimensional image communications would be possible also by about 2030. In the industry and business fields, the ministry forecast that producers and consumers would be linked directly through an information network, making the distribution process unnecessary. The report also predicted that electronic newspapers would make their debuts, diversifying the means of acquiring information and revolutionizing the mass media. The ministry also said "tele-educational" and "tele-medical" systems would spread, bringing about a major change in the field of education, medical treatment and administration. The ministry also prepared a CD-ROM (compact disk-read only memory) version of the white paper, the first of its kind in Japan. The CD-ROM version will be offered for rent by anyone up to a month without charge, starting in July.
