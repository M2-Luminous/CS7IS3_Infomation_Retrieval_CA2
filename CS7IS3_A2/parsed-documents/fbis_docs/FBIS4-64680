The debates of recent months have left their mark within the Twelve. It is now for the advocates of a stronger Europe to resume the initiative. By imposing expansion on their partners, disregarding serious guarantees for the EU's future, the Germans have seriously endangered the unity of the club, and its very existence. For Bonn, the membership of Scandinavia and Austria is merely an episode determining the future expansion to the East European countries, the only expansion which matters. However, the survival of a federal Europe will only be assured if a radical reform of its functioning is rapidly implemented. Choosing urgency, under the impetus of a Germany which is a prey to a kind of obsessional delirium, the Twelve have postponed this discussion until later, at a time when the unanimity of the Sixteen will be even more difficult to achieve. This is a point in favor of those who reject a supranational Europe. With his term as European presidency starting on 1 July, Helmut Kohl has a golden opportunity to be forgiven for his dangerous leap in the dark. After crushing any resistance, and vigorously, he must lift his former adversaries up again, the advocates of a more integrated Europe and the EP. The latter, which is weak, has been humiliated by the governments. It only had one choice: To bow and repudiate its beliefs or jeopardize expansion. Faced with the states, the EP is a progressive protagonist. It must be given the opportunity to influence the EU future which will be drawn up at the future "intergovernmental conference" in 1996. To the European federalists, Germany must guarantee that a 16-member Europe can still make progress. It must do so even if the future is gloomy, because the forces of stagnation already seem to have so much control without it seeming to be possible to oust them. In this trial of strength, France has a role to play. Divided between the Elysee [president's office] and the Hotel Matignon [prime minister's office], too content to see Parliament receive a snub, affected by the anti-European sentiments of a section of its majority, the French Government has backed down completely in face of its German partner. Henceforth, the duo holds the Union's future in its hands. It must adjust its aim. The Germans, forced to do so out of a guilty conscience, are thinking of this. Paris must support them. The German and French presidencies will follow each other: This is a year for saving the Union. The third big absentee from the debate was Belgium. A traditional rampart against the EU going off-course, it was not able to make Germany see reason. Did it really try to do so? Why did Belgium agree to open the negotiations on expansion without having obtained minimal assurances on the Union's future? How were the Belgians able to accept that the 1996 intergovernmental conference should take place in such inauspicious circumstances? The desire to defend the position of the small countries does not explain everything. It is a rearguard battle: Sooner or later the balance between big and small countries will have to be reviewed at the latter's expense. Fearing that it would lose out, Belgium did not insist on reform. A strategic error. Of course the pragmatism of Dehaene and Claes did wonders in establishing the seats of the European institutions, concluding the GATT negotiations, and so forth. But in the debate on expansion, a more decisive presence was needed. Belgium failed. It must express its ideas!
