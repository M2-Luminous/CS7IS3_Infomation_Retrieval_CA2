FR940505-1-00385 FR940505-1-00012 Leak means any point where the concentration of total organic compounds measured as methane exceeds 1000 ppm by volume except non-repeatable momentary readings. Leak free means the absence of the evidence of ``leaks.'' Municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill means an entire disposal facility in a contiguous geographical space where household waste is placed in or on land. An MSW landfill may also receive commercial waste, sludges, and industrial solid waste. Portions of an MSW landfill may be separated by access roads. An MSW landfill may be publicly or privately owned. Non-decomposable inert solid waste means materials which do not degrade biologically to form landfill gas. Examples include, but are not limited to: earth, rock, concrete, clay products, inert tailings, plaster board, glass, inert slag, asbestos, and demolition materials containing less than 10% by volume wood and metals. Non-methane organic compounds (NMOC) means any compound in a gaseous state at standard temperature and pressure which contains at least one atom of carbon except: methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, metallic carbides, carbonates, and carbonic acid, as measured according to paragraph (g)(6) of this section. Non-repeatable, momentary readings means indications of the presence of organic gases using a detector meeting the apparatus requirements of EPA Method 21 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) which persist for less than 5 seconds and do not recur when the sampling probe is placed in the same location for at least twice the response time of the instrument. Owner means the fee owner of a solid waste disposal site and the person who through lease, or other arrangement with the fee owner is responsible for complying with all applicable federal, state and local requirements for landfill gas emissions, provided that upon the expiration of such person's responsibility for landfill gas emissions under such lease or other arrangement the fee owner shall be deemed the owner. Where specific requirements of this section apply to equipment at the MSW landfill that is owned or operated by a second party other than the fee owner, the second party shall be deemed the owner for the purpose of such section requirements as they relate to such equipment. Perimeter means the outer boundary of the MSW landfill property. Quarter means the months that define a ``quarter.'' These are: January, February and March (1st quarter ends on March 31); April, May and June (2nd quarter ends on June 30); July, August and September (3rd quarter ends on September 30); and October, November and December (4th quarter ends on December 31). Sludge means any solid, semi-solid, or liquid waste generated from a municipal, commercial, or industrial wastewater treatment plant, water supply treatment plant, or air pollution control facility exclusive of the treated effluent from a wastewater treatment plant. Solid waste means any garbage, refuse, sludge from a waste treatment plant, water supply treatment plant, or air pollution control facility and other discarded material, including solid, liquid, semi-solid, or contained gaseous material resulting from industrial, commercial, mining, and agricultural operations, and from community activities, but does not include solid or dissolved materials in domestic sewage, or solid or dissolved materials in irrigation return flows or industrial discharges that are point sources subject to permit requirements under 33 U.S.C. 1342, or sources of special nuclear, or by-product material as defined by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq. ) (3) Standards. (i) Gas collection system. (A) The owner shall install and operate a gas collection system which prevents overdraw that can cause fires or damage to the collection system while collecting, in each quarter, at least 90% of the target volume established for that quarter. (B) The owner shall use the procedures in paragraph (g)(6)(i) of this section to establish baseline conditions. The owner may re-establish baseline conditions using the procedures in paragraph (g)(6)(i) of this section at any time. Each time that baseline conditions are achieved, the owner shall measure and record: (1 ) The baseline gas collection flowrate, in standard cubic feet per minute (SCFM) for the entire landfill; and ( 2 ) The baseline oxygen concentration in the collected landfill gas stream at the inlet to the control device before adding combustion air. The owner shall notify EPA at least five days prior to each establishment of baseline conditions so that EPA personnel may be on site to confirm that baseline conditions exist. (C) The owner shall measure and record the oxygen concentration at the inlet to the control device on at least four days each week. Each sampling run shall last at least twice the response time of the analyzer. Each sampling run shall establish the oxygen concentration for all preceding hours retroactive to the hour of the previous measurement.
