According to information that we have received, Beijing has already established a special office to oversee the organization and coordination of importing overseas funds and technology to develop gold resources. As of this moment, more than 10 companies from the countries and regions such as the United States, Canada, South Africa, and Australia have expressed interest. In recent years, along with the improvement in the people's living standard, more and more people have begun to pay attention to fashion and appearance, so gold jewelry has become popular in various areas on the mainland. Shanghai has many gold jewelry shops and has become an important gold market; like Guangzhou and Shenzhen, it has already proposed the establishment of a standardized gold exchange. In the 1930's, Shanghai was the largest gold trading center in the Far East, and its transaction volume ranked it third in the world, just behind London and New York. After the 1950's, for various reasons, Shanghai's gold market ceased operating, but since 1982, when the mainland restored internal sales of gold jewelry, the number of gold jewelry shops in Shanghai rose to over 250. In 1992, Shanghai sold 15 tonnes of gold jewelry, and the money involved was about 1.7 billion yuan, a 50 percent increase over 1991; in the first half of 1993, it sold 14.5 tonnes of gold jewelry (the volume of sales in the whole country was 250 tonnes), and the money involved was 1.87 billion yuan, ranking Shanghai first in the country in terms of sales volume and making it the largest gold market in China. For the past four decades, however, gold production activities and operations in China has always been under centralized state control, and the People's Bank of China has set the buying and selling prices of gold and has monopolized purchase activities and operations. Judging from the year of the lowest purchase price of gold on the mainland in the past decade, the price was less than 50 percent of the gold price in the international community, but the bank's selling price was 30-40 percent higher than the international gold price. The distorted gold price on the mainland has led to an increase in the industrial production cost of gold, as well as a decrease in returns; thus, gold mines and factories have lost money year after year and the problems of gold smuggling and the drain on gold resources have become quite serious. Because the black market price of gold is 120-140 yuan per gram, the amount of gold smuggled in accounts for two-thirds of the nongovernmental output of gold in the whole country, whereas the gold purchased by the state accounts for less than one-third of the output in the nongovernmental sector. For example, in the first half of 1993, due to the state's low purchasing price for gold as well as the effect of black market gold transactions, the state's purchased volume of gold dropped sharply, representing a 57 percent decrease from the same period in 1992. In order to revitalize the gold market on the mainland, last August the People's Bank of China once again announced an adjustment of the purchase price for gold, basing it on the price of gold in London. Customers may use yuan, which is calculated according to the exchange rate at the foreign exchange swap center at any specific moment, to pay for gold jewelry. At the same time, the purchase price of gold was increased from 54 yuan per gram to 96 yuan per gram; the corresponding dealer price of gold was increased to 107.68 yuan per gram, and it was made clear that the price would be flexibly adjusted in the future according to changes in the international price of gold and the exchange rate of the yuan. As a result, the gold output volume in the second half of the year rebounded, and annual output increased 7.5 percent over that of 1992. China has not officially announced its gold output, which has only been revealed by newspapers and magazines. Over the past 14 years, output has increased five times, among which the gold excavation volume in the nongovernmental sector was 400,000 liang [one liang equals 50 grams] last year. People believe that the output of state-run gold mines should exceed this number. At present, the government's gold reserve is 400 tonnes, and the gold volume in the nongovernmental sector also comes close to 400 tonnes; thus, it suffices to form a gold market with some scale. According to information we have received, in recent years, the southern parts of Shandong Peninsula have discovered 26 gold mines, which have commercial exploration potential. If advanced technology can be brought in from the United States, Canada, and South Africa, gold production on the mainland has great prospects. Guangzhou and Shanghai are fighting for the establishment of gold exchanges, to carry out gold futures trading, and this will promote convergence of the mainland's gold market with the international gold market, so that gradually the gold price will be commercialized, and the market will be internationalized.
