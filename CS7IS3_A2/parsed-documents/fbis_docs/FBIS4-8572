Herman was evaluating the situation that has come about in the wake of the Serbian attack on Gorazde. The Foreign Ministry is following the situation with particular attention. Its situational analysis starts out from the fact that the NATO action was carried out based on UN Security Council resolutions, and that the implementation of these is an obligation of the member-states. In answer to another question, Herman welcomed the Polish government's submission of its official European Union [EU] membership request to the current presidency of the European Union on April 8, parallel to the Hungarian move. Herman noted with satisfaction that these historical steps were prepared in close concert between the Hungarian and the Polish governments.
