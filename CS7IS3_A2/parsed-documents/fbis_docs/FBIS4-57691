In an interview granted to PRENSA LATINA, prior to departing for England on an official visit, the president of the ANPP harshly criticized what he called the fiction by the so-called representative democracies. Alarcon said such representation is limited to the electoral act, and that from that moment on, there is no relationship between the citizen who voted and the politician. National sovereignty is therefore limited to one day every few years. Alarcon also referred to the experience gained by Cuba during the recent process, prior to the adoption of diverse measures to restructure the economy and the battle against illegal profit, preceded by celebration by more than 80,000 assemblies at work centers. In discussing future participation of the ANPP in the application of the accorded measures, Alarcon said the ANPP is responsible for control of the practical application of those measures in a way never achieved by similar bodies in other political systems. Alarcon went on to say: We will control and oversee application of the national budget through the direct work of each entity or province in coordination with administrative authorities exchanging ideas for the reduction of subsidies and the increase of state income.
