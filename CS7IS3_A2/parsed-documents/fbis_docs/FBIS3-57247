I think the hot issue of the week was the internal clashes in Afghanistan. [Mumim] That is right. However, analysis of the Afghan internal disagreements is the job of the Afghan brothers themselves, but here I would like to point out one issue which is causing concern to us Tajiks and to the world community. This issue is the bombing of Tajik refugee camps in Afghanistan by unknown aircraft. Several points need to be clarified here. First, those who have resorted to this act, by taking advantage of internal conflict in Afghanistan, are trying to fulfill their ugly political aims. [Nekvarz] Who do you have in mind and to whom do these aircraft belong? [Mumim] In my opinion the bombing of the Tajik refugee camps was planned outside the territory of Afghanistan. In no way could this action have been organized by the opposing formations or ethnic groups of Afghanistan. Because from the first days the charitable Afghan brothers have welcomed Tajik refugees as their true brothers and sisters and have provided all-round assistance to them. Although the Afghan opposing sides have disagreements among themselves, they all have a good opinion of the Tajik refugees and we hope, God willing, that this will continue. In my view, these aircraft either belonged to Uzbekistan or to Russia and they carried out these attacks by order of the communist regime of Rakhmanov -- a regime which is used to attacking its own people with foreign forces. [Nekvarz] I would like to point out that this incident was reported by the world's influential media such as REUTER, the BBC, Radio Liberty, and others. [Mumim] That is absolutely correct. Analysis of events shows that the communist government of Tajikistan had a hand in these conspiracies. The bombing raids against the refugee camps were carried out two weeks ago following the appeal by Imamali Rakhmanov to his so-called compatriots abroad. [passage omitted]
