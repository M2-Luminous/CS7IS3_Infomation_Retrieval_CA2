I am happy to receive you in Albania, President Berisha told Willy Claes. I am sure that your visit marks an important event in strengthening bilateral relations. I would like to mention here the fruitful meetings I held in Brussels with His Majesty King Albert I and Belgian Prime Minister Dehaene, and the understanding I found in them regarding the problems of bilateral relations and those of our region. President Berisha made a broad presentation of the application and course of the reforms in the political, institutional, and economic fields, as well as the latest achievements in this direction. We are grateful to the European Union [EU] and Belgium for the assistance they rendered to Albania. However, Albania still needs assistance and increased cooperation with Belgium and European Union. He asked Belgian Foreign Minister Claes for the Belgian Kingdom to support the processes of Albania's integration into the European Union. Regarding the situation in the region, Berisha stressed once again that, with its actions and attitudes, Albania is seriously working to achieve stability in the region. He said, however, that lifting or facilitating sanctions against Serbia not only does not stop the war but moves it toward the south, where it threatens to turn into a Balkan conflict. In this framework, it comes out clearly that the problem of Kosova remains a regional problem, the solution of which is a condition for regional peace and stability. That is why this question must be placed on the agenda. The European Union should consider the efforts of Albanians for a democratic solution. Regarding Kosova as a Serb problem means ignoring 2 million Albanians and increasing the chances of conflict. We ask that it is necessary to be understood that Greater Serbia is a factor of war and instability in the region. I am of the opinion that the situation in Kosova is continuously becoming worse. By closing the last institutions of culture in conformity with the memorandum of the Serbian Academy, Milosevic is escalating the terror there. Berisha continued by saying that, in the same way, Albania is interested in stability in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. However, there are others who try to destabilize the situation in this Republic and find and create destabilizing factors there where they do not exist. But of course, it supports and defends the human and national rights of the Albanians in this Republic because this is the only way to achieve stability there. Claes said that we feel it is our duty to help and support you in the difficult road of reforms. We appraise your achievements and guarantee you that Belgium will support Albania's efforts to be integrated into the European Union, the West European Union, and all European structures. He also expressed complete understanding for the problems in the region and assessed Albania's stance as a factor and stability. He assured President Berisha that Belgium will give a concrete contribution in the resolution of the question of Kosova.
