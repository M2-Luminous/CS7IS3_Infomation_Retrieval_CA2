The experts' conclusions have not been officially formulated yet, while Vice Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov, head of the Ukrainian delegation, told journalists that Sevastopol will definitely remain a base of the Russian Federation Navy following a corresponding legal procedure. The location where Kiev will receive ships after the division of the Black Sea Fleet is yet unknown, although Donuzlav is being named as the most probable port. In the meantime it has become known that a joint working group of Ukrainian and Russian parliamentarians is supposed to submit proposals before 15 June on harmonizing the constitutions and legislation of both sides. The Ukrainian delegation and the working group of the Crimean Supreme Soviet have appealed to President Kravchuk and Ukraine's parliament to introduce no sanctions before this date for not acting on the decree calling for bringing Crimea's laws into line with those of Ukraine. The sides urged the presidents and parliamentarians of Ukraine and Crimea "not to take unlawful, uncoordinated actions in regard of the power structures responsible for the maintenance of law and order in Crimea." On 6 June the presidium of Crimea's Supreme Soviet appointed Vladimir Karpov, adviser to the president of Crimea, head of the joint working group that will draft and submit proposals on bringing the republic's laws into line with those of Ukraine. His candidacy is supposed to be up for confirmation at today's session of the Supreme Soviet of Crimea when the deputies hear a report on the results of the talks with the Ukrainian delegation.
