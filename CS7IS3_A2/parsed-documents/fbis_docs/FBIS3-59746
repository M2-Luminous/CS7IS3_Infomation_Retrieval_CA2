Overview Backed by technological innovation that continues to evolve rapidly, the society and economy of Japan are starting to undergo major developments in urbanization, informationalization, globalization, and the advance into a more aged society as the 21st century nears. To maintain housing and social capital in such a setting, the government must cope with the changes in social trends, the needs and perceptions of the citizens, as well as the changes surrounding construction affairs. Given such a situation, on 13 May 1992 the Minister for Construction submitted to the Construction Technology Development Council a report entitled "The Vision of Construction Technology Development with Prospects for the 21st Century." That report clarified the future directions of construction technology development and listed priority research topics, promotion policies, and the roles of industry, government, and universities. 1. Basic Policies on Construction Technology R&D As indicated in the Basic Public Investment Plan, the years remaining in this century are an important time for forming good social capital and stock. In the maintenance of housing and social capital from now on, we must tackle improvements in productivity and operational safety, and, with consideration always given to future increases in the costs of maintaining and renovating buildings, the maintenance of housing and social capital must be harmonious with the environment, including the global environment. As the directions in which to proceed with the maintenance of housing and social capital, it is important 1) that the facilities are easy-to-use, beautiful, and strong, 2) that consideration is given to the environment, and 3) and that construction is carried out efficiently and safely. The report sets forth the following as the concrete R&D objectives and the priority R&D themes to correspond with those directions in the maintenance of housing and social capital. 1) Automated and man-power-saving technology at construction sites to cope with a smaller labor force; 2) Maintenance-free technology to cope with the inevitable increases in the costs of maintaining and renovating facilities; 3) Energy-conservation technology for coping with global environmental problems. The following shows the concrete development goals for those themes. (1) Automation and Man-Power-Saving Technology The goal is to develop technology that will achieve an overall two-thirds saving in manpower by automation and conservation of manpower in all aspects of construction. (2) Maintenance-Free Technology The goals are to make new and renovated facilities maintenance-free and to develop technology that will keep maintenance and management costs at their current levels. By extending the number of years that new and renovated facilities will last, the aim is to develop technology for reducing by two-thirds the renovation investments needed with the current number of years that facilities can be used. (3) Energy-Saving Technology The goal is to develop technology for reducing by up to two-thirds the overall energy consumption per unit production in order to keep the amount of CO<inf> 2</inf> emissions at their current level, as based on the October 1990 Cabinet decision. 2. R&D Promotion Measures The MOC will set up project teams consisting of people from the ministry, regional construction groups, laboratories, etc.; clearly set forth the development objectives; and effectivate prioritized R&D. Then, to develop and distribute the technology, the MOC will use a system of general technology development projects, joint research involving the government and the private sector, a construction technology evaluation system, and technology inspection and demonstration for construction technology developed by the private sector. The following diagram illustrates the process, from implementing the technology development to the application and distribution of the technology. B. Overview of the R&D The budget for construction technology R&D, as shown in the following table, amounts to ¥6.386 billion, which is 1.3 times that of the previous year. New general technology projects that will begin in FY93 are "the development of technology for creating beautiful scenery" and "the development of technology for evaluating fire-prevention and fire-resistant performance."

Development of Technology for the Maintenance of Easy-To-Use, Beautiful, Durable, and Easy-To-Maintain Housing and Social Capital (1) Development of Technology for Functional Improvements in Maintenance and Renovation of Housing and Social Capital (general technology development project, FY91-95) Important issues from now on are appropriately maintaining, managing, and preserving the functions of the housing and social capital that has been developed thus far, and making improvements by modifying those functions that are not in tune with the times. This effort involves 1) developing ways to use infrared beams, ultrasound waves, etc., to quickly and non-destructively survey and diagnose public works structures; 2) developing machinery that works underwater for surveying and repairing underwater structures; 3) technology for strengthening and improving the durability of concrete floor plates for elevated roadways, etc.; and 4) developing a housing and social capital management system that uses computers to diagnose and evaluate deterioration. (2) Development of Technology for Creating Beautiful Scenery (New) (general technology development project, FY93-97) The maintenance of high-quality housing and social capital that is in harmony with the environment and beautiful scenery that brings out the most of a region's uniqueness are desired. That entails the needs to develop technology for maintaining scenic areas in which public works structures and buildings become one with the surrounding environment, and to form attractive public spaces. This effort involves the design, construction, and development of high-quality materials for improving scenery, with awareness of that which mars the scenery. Furthermore, this effort will involve R&D and the establishment of methods with respect to planning, design, and construction for creating scenic areas with consideration given to ecosystems. And, in order to more accurately and easily assess various designs, the MOC will develop a support system that uses computer graphics. 2. Developing Technology for Environmentally Harmonious Housing and Social Capital Maintenance (1) Development of Resource-, Energy-Conserving Construction Technology (general technology development project, FY91-FY95) Tackling global environmental problems has also become an important issue in the field of construction. In that, construction technology development is important in finding solutions to the problems of excess energy consumption and CO<inf> 2</inf> emissions due to the use of fossil fuels, which lead to global warming. In this effort the MOC will try to determine the amounts of energy consumption and CO<inf> 2</inf> emissions in the field of construction, and study the choices of construction methods that will contribute toward reducing energy consumption and the load on the environment. In addition, the MOC will develop methods to determine for individual land-use districts the amounts of energy consumed and the amount of CO<inf> 2</inf> emitted as a result of social and economic activities, and will use that as data for future land-use decisions. (2) Development of Technology for Re-Using and Suppressing the Generation of Construction Byproducts (general technology development project, FY92-FY96) Considering the scarcity of final disposal sites, developing technology for re-using and suppressing the generation of construction byproducts (leftover soil, construction waste materials) is an urgent issue. This effort involves the development of new technology for on-site re-use of construction wastes, and technology for processing and recycling sidewalk blocks and other such wastes into construction materials. Furthermore, the MOC will develop efficient processing machinery for recycling concrete aggregate from waste concrete, and technology for recycling the powders generated as by-products of that processing. In addition, in joint government-private research, the MOC will carry out the development of basic technology for creating green spaces, and will evaluate the following two themes: the development of efficient direct cleaning systems in rivers and other such public waterways, and the development of high-noise-reduction soundproofing. 3. Development of Technology for Maintaining Housing and Social Capital Efficiently and Safely (1) Development of New Construction Technology (general technology development project, FY90-FY94) Continually dealing with the problems of more older construction workers and a shortage of skilled laborers, construction businesses must findways to promote more efficiency, raise the level of quality and safety, and improve the work environment. This effort involves the development of automated construction technology for mechanizing jobs in dangerous environments to eliminate the need for humans to do that work. The MOC will also develop pre-fab technology based on the factory production of reinforced concrete structures, and will maintain standards compatible with new technologies for automating and rationalizing construction work so that the new technologies quickly become more widespread. In addition, the MOC will engage in the following technology development for the purposes of more safety in construction work, and to prevent large objects from crashing down on workers and workers from coming in contact with construction machinery, which cause more than half of all accidents: 1) temporary scaffolding in units so that assembly and disassembly high above the ground are not necessary; 2) various kinds of sensors and control technology for preventing workers from coming in contact with construction machinery; 3) database construction based on the gathering and analysis of data on accident causes and countermeasures. Furthermore, in joint research with the private sector, the MOC will be involved in the following four themes: - the development of an automatic map-information recognition system, - the development of new ground probing technology, - the development of a construction information system based on IC cards, and - the development of high-performance, functional concrete (new). The MOC will also evaluate the development of construction methods for rationalizing the construction of pillars and beams in reinforced concrete structures. 4. Technology Development Involving Basic Topics The MOC's technology development efforts involving disaster prevention, new materials, and other themes outside of the priority R&D topics are: - the development of technology for preventing earthquake disasters in large cities (general technology development project, FY92-FY96), - the development of systems for preventing landslide disasters (FY92- FY96), - the development of technology for evaluating fire-prevention and fire-resistant performance (new, FY93-FY97), - the development of an exterior tile and stone setting system that uses organic adhesives (joint government-private research, FY93-FY95), and - the development of suction prevention sheets for river dikes (construction technology evaluation system). C. Technology Development Incentives To promote technology development in the private sector, especially, the developed technologies should be put into use. To that end the MOC is working to provide incentives for private-sector technology development by utilizing the new technologies through efforts such as technology application pilot projects and the test field system. 1. Technology Application Pilot Projects Since FY87 the MOC has been implementing technology application pilot projects, which apply newly developed technologies at construction sites. During FY92 the MOC formulated technology application themes based on government needs, the objective of which was to give further impetus to the private sector's technology development strength, and then broadly invited the private sector's proposals along the lines of those themes. During FY93 the MOC plans to implement as "specific technology application pilot projects" those of the proposed new private-sector technologies that it investigated and certified. 2. Test Field System Targeting the technologies for which future government needs will be high and for which there is a need to raise the degree of perfection through on-site verification, the MOC will provide test fields in actual construction sites, and in FY93 will institute the "Test Field System." Through that system the MOC will construct actual-scale structures and conduct various types of tests. 3. Improving the Bidding and Contracting System In order to facilitate the private sector's technology development and actively use those results, "a bidding system that emphasizes technological strength," "a bidding system that makes full use of private-sector technology development," and "a bidding system that includes the contents of technology proposals in the decision-making process" were proposed in the Central Construction Industry Council's November 1992 report entitled "The Basic Model of a Bidding and Contracting System," which was in response to the (first) report "How the Construction Industry Should Be To Cope With New Social and Economic Factors." 4. Tax System Facilitating Technology Development In order to actively facilitate technology development in the private sector, the period of applicability of a special tax deduction system for cases where test research expenses increased and other such cases was extended two years (until 31 March 1995). New tax deduction systems for test research expenses disbursed for joint research with national laboratories and for recycling-related test research will also be established to support technology development in the private sector. D. Conclusion Based on the future vision for construction technology development that has prospects for the 21st century, the MOC will actively promote government-private joint technology development, centering on that which is aimed at the development objectives relating to the highest-priority research themes.
