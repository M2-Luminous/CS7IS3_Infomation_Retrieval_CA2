(Catex) submitted for filing a rate schedule under which Catex will engage in wholesale electric power and energy transactions as a marketer. Catex also requested waiver of various Commission regulations. In particular, Catex requested that the Commission grant blanket approval under 18 CFR part 34 of all future issuances of securities and assumptions of liability by Catex. On January 14, 1994, pursuant to delegated authority, the Director, Division of Applications, Office of Electric Power Regulation, granted requests for blanket approval under 18 CFR part 34, subject to the following: Within thirty days of the date of this order, any person desiring to be heard or to protest the blanket approval of issuances of securities or assumptions of liability by Catex should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214). Absent a request for hearing within this period, Catex is authorized to issue securities and assume obligations or liabilities as a guarantor, indorser, surety, or otherwise in respect of any security of another person; provided that such issuance or assumption is for some lawful object within the corporate purposes of the applicant, and compatible with the public interest, and is reasonably necessary or appropriate for such purposes. The Commission reserves the right to require a further showing that neither public or private interests will be adversely affected by continued approval of Catex's issuances of securities or assumptions of liability. Notice is hereby given that the deadline for filing motions to intervene or protests, as set forth above, is February 14, 1994. Copies of the full text of the order are available from the Commission's Public Reference Branch, room 3308, 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
