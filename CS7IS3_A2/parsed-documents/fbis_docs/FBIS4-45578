FBIS4-45578 "jptdd028__l94078" JPRS-TDD-94-028-L JPRS Narcotics 1 June 1994 EAST ASIA THAILAND Economic Impact of Marijuana in Northeast Assessed Economic Impact of Marijuana in Northeast Assessed 94WD0433A Bangkok BANGKOK POST in English 1 Jun 94 p 6 94WD0433A Bangkok BANGKOK POST English CSO [Excerpts] This settlement of some 400 families stands out from the rest of the villages in Tambon Phon or other tambons in Phon Sawan District--thanks to the wealth brought to the village by ganja (marijuana) cultivation. Marijuana plants used to grow here in every household. They were the only cash crop which brought wealth and prosperity to the village. And although marijuana cultivation was virtually abandoned some 10 years ago due to increased suppression, the legacy left behind by the lucrative narcotics trade can still be seen. Television antennas pop up from the rooftop of most houses. Electrical appliances that offer the comfort and convenience of urban life such as refrigerators, television sets, record players, video recorders and portable radio cassette players can be seen in almost every household. The modern wooden houses of Ban Taai are in direct contrast to the dilapidated shacks which typify poverty-stricken villages in the Northeast where farners try to scratch out a humble living by growing legal agricultural products in drought-plagued fields. But nothing speaks so eloquently of the easy money to be made from ganja than the villagers themselves. "Previously there were more than 100 pick-up trucks in our village. But now less than 20 are left," said Prasob Tarranavadee, assistant headman of Ban Taai. Obviously, most of the cars were sold by their owners to supplement their meagre earnings after their source of income from marijuana cultivation dried up. Others might have had their trucks reclaimed by the dealers because they could not afford the instalment payments. It was said that during their heyday each family could earn more than 100,000 baht from buyers for each annual marijuana crop. Almost every young man and woman helped in the cultivation and harvesting of marijuana plantations. But today, 10 years after the government suppression drive, Ban Taai is a village of old people and children. Most young men and women left the village "to chase the rainbow." The women mostly work in factories while the men work at construction sites in Bangkok or in foreign countries. A handful of men who chose to stay behind continue to till the land and eke out out a living by planting rice, chili and other cash crops. Others, however, offer their expertise in marijuana cultivation to financiers in other areas if the money is right. "I used to accept an offer of 3,000 baht a month pay excluding free lodging and food allowance from a financier to plant marijuana in Pha Nok Khao in Tambon Phu Kradueng of Loei Province," one of the "self acclaimed experts" told the Bangkok Post. He said marijuana plantations should be cultivated for just 3-4 months before being harvested. The most enduring task is at the beginning when marijuana plants must be cared for and manure must be used to nurture the plants, he said. He said his job was accomplished after the harvest, when someone else would take care of marijuana transportation, he continued. The man disclosed that the normal hiring price for an "expert" now was about 6,000 baht, which does not include free lodging and food allowances. Sometimes, he said, the experts were hired to plant or supervise the cultivation of marijuana crops in Laos. Apart from the monthly salary, some financiers also offered a small percentage from the sale of the marijuana crop to the experts, said the man. Sometimes, an advance payment which is called a "land opening fee" was made to the experts, he added. "One of my friends accepted a contract to supervise marijuana cultivation in Kammuan of Laos. He claimed that sometimes a helicopter with a few farangs would drop by to pick up the marijuana two or three times a year," said the expert, who spoke on condition of anonymity. [passage omitted] The expert admitted that planting marijuana in Laos involved a higher risk because of the uncertainty of law enforcement in Laos. In most cases, he said, the cultivation was done in a form of joint venture with Thai investors putting in 40 per cent investment and their Laotian counterpart 60 per cent. He also said that the experts risked being murdered if the marijuana consortium was betrayed to the authorities. Apart from Thais, several H'mong tribesmen have been hired to plant marijuana in Laos. Fibre from the plants can also be used for weaving. Inhabitants of Ban Taai who used to earn 1,500 baht per kilogramme of dry marijuana are now making only 12 baht per kilogramme from the sale of chili, said Mr Prasob, the assistant headman. "We can plant other crops. But there is the problem of marketing," he admitted. Without marijuana, their golden crop, the village is quiet and lifeless. A scarecrow is put up in front of every house purportedly to save the surviving members from the "ghosts of widows." "Several old and young men succumbed to these ghosts in recent months. So we had to build scarecrows to guard every household," said the assistant headman. An informed source said that despite the fierce suppression campaign, marijuana is still secretly planted among other cash crops in Phon Sawan, Tha Uthen, Ban Paeng and LSri Songkhram districts. Mixing crops makes detection of marijuana crops difficult from the air. The planting season normally begins in May when rain begins to fall, he said. The source further said because of the pressure applied by narcotics suppression officials, marijuana fields are now mostly in Laos along the Mekong River because the plants consume more water at the initial stage. Only a small amount is smuggled into Thailand to be exported to third countries, said the source, adding that the bulk of the drugs are transported to Danang in Vietnam befor being smuggled abroad. A police officer interviewed by th Post admitted that some officers allowed large-scale marijuana cultivation to take place in Nakhon Phanom. Most of the eligible voters in Ban Taai voted for Por Ped or Thanong Siripreechapong, former Chat Thai MP, in previous elections. "We used to help one another. We used to get rich together," said several villagers. A sign hung in front of Thanong's office in Tha Uthen District carries the message "Por Ped is happy to serve you." But the volume of visitors to his office seeking to get "rich together" has dropped significantly since he was implicated in narcotics trafficking.
