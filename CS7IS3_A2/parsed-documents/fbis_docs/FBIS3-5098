He also told a news conference after a regular cabinet meeting that he is "concerned" about President Bill Clinton's decision to revive the retaliatory "Super 301" provision of U.S. Trade Law, but said Japan must react "coolly." Asked about recent climbs in long-term government bond yields, Fujii said, "I do not think they are trending upward" and said they would not likely harm the economy. Fujii said market rates "fell quite far" after last September's cut in the Bank of Japan's official discount rate to a record low 1.75 percent a year. The benchmark 10-year government bond yield climbed to 3.94 percent Wednesday, the highest since just before the rate cut, with market players citing a central bank survey that showed a halt in declining business confidence and supply-demand concerns over stepped-up government bond issuance. Fujii cited markets analyses that overseas rate increases were pushing Japanese rates higher and that there are some expectations of Japanese economic recovery, but he repeated that the economic picture remains mixed. He also repeated that the effects of last month's record 15.25 trillion yen economic stimulus package have yet to be felt, adding that "the effects should steadily emerge." Fujii denied a suggestion that rates are rising naturally as the market thinks the economy has already bottomed and brushed off concern that premature rate increases could dash a recovery. On the Super 301 trade provision, Fujii said, "It is possible that unilateral moves could occur, and we are concerned about that." But he stressed that the overnight White House announcement merely sets in motion "procedures" that could ultimately result in sanctions or other moves. He expressed hope that Washington will make a "sensible response," and said Japan must act in a cool-headed way to avoid a breakdown into a trade war. Fujii said Japan plans to make a "voluntary, positive response," citing a pledge to complete a package of market-opening measures this month including deregulation, import promotion, improved government procurement practices and beefed-up antitrust enforcement. But he said Japan's policy is to continue to oppose numerical targets to gauge progress, saying that macroeconomic targets have not been mentioned in discussions on the package by government ministers. In the insurance sector, for which his ministry is responsible, Fujii said "substantial agreement had been reached" with the U.S. and that Japan will proceed "positively" on the issue. Super 301 allows the U.S. Administration to retaliate against trade practices judged to be unfair, but U.S. officials have said they hope both sides can avoid retaliation.
