This comes after both the Liberal Party and the Conservative People's Party have refused to move on the demands they are making in the field of foreign policy. The Progress Party has produced tougher new demands which are to be met if there is to be future cooperation among the Conservative People's Party, the Liberal Party, and the Progress Party. They are to be the party's compensation, because even at this present early stage Liberal Party chairman Uffe Ellemann-Jensen is already rejecting any suggestion of moving even an inch toward the Progress Party in the field of foreign policy -- and this includes the sensitive question of the EU [European Union]. In return for concessions on the EU question Progress Party leader Pia Kjaersgaard wants more influence in the field of domestic policy when the base for a nonsocialist government is agreed. "We are not simply the people who will go to the queen and point to Ellemann-Jensen or Engell as the prime ministerial candidate. We are setting a price," Pia Kjaersgaard stressed. She and Kim Behnke, the party's finance policy spokesman, have already planned in detail those areas in which the Progress Party requires payment before it will supply the necessary seats in support of a nonsocialist government: -- The party wants the personal tax-free allowance increased from 30,000 to 60,000 kroner. -- Large-scale privatizations, of the Danish Statistical Bureau and the State Vehicle Testing Service, for example. -- Basic pensions must be increased. -- And end to the right to family reunification and a reduction in the annual refugee quota. Both Pia Kjaersgaard and Kim Behnke stressed that the party will consider itself to have a free hand if the Liberal Party and the Conservaitve People's Party do not agree to its demands. Liberal Party chairman Uffe Ellemann-Jensen commented that it is too early "to negotiate the details:" "But it is obvious that they must have some influence."
