The evacuee, who refused to be identified, said long queues form daily at petrol stations and the public transport system had been virtually brought to a standstill. The curfew begins nightly at 9:00 p.m. until 5:00 a.m, after President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih declared a state of emergency Thursday. At night anti-aircraft salvos light up the sky searching out attacking southern planes, which have launched several air raids on the city, the Arab national said after landing on an evacuation flight in Jordan. He added that a total news black-out had been imposed since fighting broke out four days ago between rival army forces, and amid reports that southern troops had fired Scud missiles at the capital. He was not able to say whether there were any victims. So far there has been no official casualty toll in the fighting which erupted Thursday, but an Islamic party supporting the president said Saturday 150 had died. The evacuee was among 170 people, mainly UN personnel, flown out of Sanaa Sunday to Amman on a special flight. Hundreds of foreigners have fled the war which has pitted Salih against his southern rival Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid.
