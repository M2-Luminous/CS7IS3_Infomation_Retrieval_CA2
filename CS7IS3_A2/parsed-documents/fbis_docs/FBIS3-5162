Previously, the Indonesian Embassy [as received] in New York had been notified about the wish of the Bosnian prime minister to visit Indonesia. He said that in his two-day visit, he will discuss with Indonesian side the latest developments about the Washington accord and the future steps to be taken by Bosnia. Siladjzic, who is former foreign minister of Bosnia, was in Washington DC for peace talks between Bosnia and Croatia. In the meeting, both sides agreed to form a framework for the establishment of a federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

On the possibility of forming a confederation with Serbia, Siladjzic said that it depends on the initiatives from some NAM members and several "friends" in the West, especially from the Government of Russia. "I will meet Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev in Moscow to discuss the peace process and a possibility of inviting the Bosnian Serbs to the peace agreement," said Siladjzic who is going to visit Moscow mid of this month. [as received] He believes that Serbia is the one that must give territorial concession because Serbia is the aggressor of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Bosnian prime minister said that diplomatic ties between Bosnia and Indonesia will be established soon at the right time when some problems are solved.
