This will facilitate the task of the EU, which wishes, in an impartial way, to accelerate the normalization of life in Mostar, said Greek Ambassador Dimitros Rales, who leads the three-member EU delegation in its mission to investigate the situation on the ground before the EU begins the first steps to establish its administration. The members of the EU delegation toured the east part of Mostar and held talks with the Muslim authorities. Croat representatives at the talks raised the issue of significant changes in the national composition of the population of Mostar, caused by the arrival from eastern Herzegovina of Muslim refugees and displaced persons, which, in the opinion of the Croat side, had been the cause of the months-long conflict. We guess that it will be important to agree who will return and who will stay and live in Mostar. The second round of the prisoner exchange, agreed on in Uskopje between the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] and the Bosnian Muslim side, took place today. The 251 prisoners released by the Croats from Rodoc, near Mostar, arrived in the eastern part of Mostar in zUNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] vehicles this afternoon. The Muslim side released six HVO members from Gornji Vakuf. Another 32 Croat prisoners released from Vares are expected to arrive in Kiseljak this afternoon, as well as 315 Croat civilians who took refuge at the UNPROFOR base in Carici near Kakanj during the Muslim offensive last year.
