The passage of the bill on 25 January by the U.S. Senate on the initiation of Radio Free Asia is a criminal act of interfering in the internal affairs of and of hostility against our country and other Asian countries. The true intention of the United States in initiating Radio Free Asia is to infuse the so-called U.S.-style democratic values and the toxin of bourgeois ideology into our country and other Asian countries in order to crush [apsal] socialism in this region and demolish the independent governments there from within. The United States was able to use this machination and propaganda effectively to demolish from within the former socialist countries in another region in the past and to have them return to capitalism, but it is far from workable with our country. We have the chuche idea, the great guiding ideology of the era of independence, the spirit of independence, and our-style way of life; and our people regard the chuche socialism, in which the leader, the party, and the masses are wholeheartedly united, as their life and lifeline. The United States should immediately stop the game of initiating Radio Free Asia, a propaganda and machination organization with a hostile aim against our country and other Asian countries. If the United States initiates Radio Free Asia despite the consistent opposition and rejection of the people of Asian countries, it will gain nothing from it. The Asian people, including our people, will resolutely confront [tanhohi masso nagalkkosida] the U.S.-conducted cold war against Asia by steadfastly implementing an independent policy to reject Yankee culture and to protect Asian tradition, culture, and consciousness.
