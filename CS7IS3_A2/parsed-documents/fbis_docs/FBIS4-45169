In its latest report on Bolivia entitled "Behavior and Assessment of the Banking System," the company states that "international drug enforcement organizations are concerned over the high dollarization of the Bolivian economy." The report adds that in December 1993, "72 percent of demand account deposits, 91 percent of savings deposits, and 91 percent of time deposits" in Bolivia are in dollars. It states that "because of the high dollarization of the (Bolivian) economy, it is very easy to introduce `coca-dollars' into the banking system." Moreover, it states that "money laundering" in Bolivia is not a crime, and that the Bank Secrecy Law in force does not allow drug enforcement organizations to have access to information in conducting their investigations. After Peru, Bolivia is the second largest world producer of coca leaf, the main staple for cocaine manufacturing; and the second largest world cocaine refining center in the world.
