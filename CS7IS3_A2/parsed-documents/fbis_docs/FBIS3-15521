At its 1 March 1994 session, the Georgian Supreme Council ratified a document on Georgia joining the CIS, signed by Eduard Shevardnadze, the Supreme Council chairman and head of state, by 126 votes to 69 (two abstained), thus making an attempt to legalize the loss of independence by Georgia and Georgia's incorporation into a modernized empire. This act passed by the Supreme Council contradicts the law, and Georgia's union with Russia and other republics of the former Soviet Union is illegal because of the following conditions: 1. The act of the restoration of Georgian state independence, passed unanimously by the legally elected Supreme Council (parliament) of the Republic of Georgia on 9 April 1991, is based on the results of a referendum held in the Republic of Georgia on 31 March 1991, during which 99 percent of the participants voted for the independence of Georgia and in which 90 percent of electors took part. It is illegal to pass any resolution on a complete or partial abolition (limitation) of Georgia's independence other than by means of a referendum. 2. Over half of MPs on the list, yet less than two thirds (there are 222 members in the Georgian Supreme Council), voted for the approval of the 1 March 1994 resolution of the Georgian Supreme Council. Meanwhile, the above-mentioned resolution a) differs from a confirmation of a bilateral or multilateral treaty in its concept pertaining the statute of the Republic of Georgia as a state and, b) requires an amendment in the Republic of Georgia's law "On the state authority" that was voted for and passed by the qualified majority of the Georgian Supreme Council as a law of constitutional importance. Paragraphs Four, Nine, and others of the CIS regulations stipulate that a number of discrete rights of the Supreme Council listed in Paragraph Seven of the Republic of Georgia's law "On the state rule" are transferred to the competence of the CIS. Therefore, only a qualified majority can pass the resolution. 3. According to the Republic of Georgia's laws "On the state rule" and "On the statute of a deputy," certain executive occupations cannot be combined with the statute of a deputy (a list of those has been approved). There are 15 members of this kind in the Georgian Supreme Council at present. All of them consented to Georgia joining the CIS and this was known to other MPs before the vote and was proved by the vote. Despite the requirements of the regulations, these Supreme Council members participated in the voting. 4. A law "On conclusion, ratification, implementation, and denunciation of international treaties" was violated. According to Paragraph 11 of the law, the Georgian Supreme Council Foreign Affairs Commission carries out the preliminary discussion of an international treaty submitted for ratification and issues an appropriate conclusion. 5. Georgia's joining the CIS contradicts the Republic of Georgia's law "On defense," which recognizes Georgia's active neutrality and nonalliance to any military bloc. Apart from direct contradictions to the aforementioned law, the contents of the resolution passed by the Supreme Council, and the procedure taken have other political and procedural shortcomings. Namely: a) The election program of neither Eduard Shevardnadze, the Supreme Council chairman, nor any other member of the Supreme Council mentioned the prospect of Georgia joining the CIS. On the contrary, the election programs of all of them contained promises to defend and strengthen Georgia's independence. Thus, the 1 March 1994 Supreme Council resolution was not authorized by electors. b) Apart from the regulations, a Georgian translation (therefore nonauthentic) of which was distributed among members of the Supreme Council before the session, regulations on passing resolutions, as well the as rights and duties of the member countries of the CIS are defined by a number of other documents that were not available for the MPs. c) The discussion and voting in the Georgian Supreme Council on 1 March 1994 was preceded by a year-and-a-half-long process of Georgia's economic destruction and variable destabilization which, in our opinion, was artificial to a large extent and in which, in our opinion, communist and pro-communist high echelons of Georgia's executive authorities participated in order to provoke Georgia's joining a modernized Russian empire. Because Paragraphs two and Three of the above were read to the chairman and the speaker of the Supreme Council, a demand was made that the parliamentary authority of the above-mentioned 15 MPs [combining executive positions with Supreme Council membership] should be stopped and that voting should be ruled by two-thirds of the Supreme Council, and because these demands were rejected against the law and regulations by the parliamentary majority, we consider that this is a coup d'etat from above. During the session the police battered representatives of the National Liberation Movement who stood silent holding posters on the sidewalk in front of the Supreme Council building. The police also dispersed refugees from Abkhazia who stood beside them. During the session, Jaba Ioseliani, the former chairman of the "Emergency Committee," said from the rostrum that the opposition had to be jailed. For two months prior to the session a series of terrorist acts causing casualties were carried out in Georgia. Thus, the Supreme Council session, which made a decision on Georgia's joining the CIS was held in a state of terror. During the discussion of the resolution, the debates were stopped by a decision of the parliamentary majority, and not only were MPs who were on the list of speakers refused a right to speak, but even factions." The statement was signed by 69 deputies, who did not vote for Georgia becoming a member of the CIS.
