During the 10-day port call at Tsuruga, Captain Arne Sorensen and 18 Greenpeace activists will inform local residents of the dangers Monju poses for the environment in videos and a photo exhibition on the boat, spokeswoman Etsuko Ikeda said. The fast breeder operated by the governmental Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp. will soon reach what is called "criticality," the stage when a nuclear chain reaction is self-sustaining. Ikeda said Greenpeace estimates Monju will reach criticality on April 8. The reactor, which uses a mixture of highly toxic plutonium and enriched uranium as fuel, will then produce 280,000 kilowatts of electricity. In a recent report, Greenpeace warned that Monju "could explode like an atomic bomb, killing thousands and contaminating most population centers in Japan and neighboring countries." Greenpeace also alleged that the Japanese Government is withholding important data on the safety risk posed by Monju. Noting that the original safety assessment for the fast breeder was undertaken over 10 years ago, Greenpeace called for a new safety review and a full environmental impact statement. On its previous mission last October, the MV Greenpeace monitored nuclear waste dumped into the Sea of Japan by Russia and the former Soviet Union.
