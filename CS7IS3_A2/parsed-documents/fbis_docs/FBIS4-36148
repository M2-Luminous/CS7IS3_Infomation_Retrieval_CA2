Assigning itself the role of world watchman, it has adopted a very strong policy to check nuclear proliferation in Korea, South Asia, and the Middle East. Reports, however, come in occasionally which make it easy for anyone to understand that the U.S. policy on the nuclear nonproliferation issue is to a great extent discriminatory and subservient to its own specific considerations. According to the latest report released in the United States, which was prepared in accordance with the instructions of the upper house of the Congress, the United States since 1988 gave permission for 1,500 export consignments which could be used for the manufacture of nuclear weapons. They included very complicated high-speed computers, lasers, furnaces, and machine parts. At least half of these 1,500 export consignments were destined to companies and organizations which were involved with and working for the Israeli nuclear weapon program. During this period, 33 items were exported to India which could be used for the manufacture of nuclear weapons. All of these export items were sent to the Bhabha Atomic Research Center in Bombay where, according to the CIA, India is now engaged in producing a hydrogen bomb. The report says that a very limited quantity of exports also was made available to Brazil, Argentina, Iraq, South Africa, Iran, and Pakistan, but it was very negligible compared to what was supplied to Israel and India. Israel, in particular, was supplied 238 computers which were very useful in the manufacture of nuclear weapons. It is not at all difficult to understand from this report that the U.S. policy of pressure on the nuclear weapons issue is not only unfair and inequitable, but also aimed at helping the countries of its choice with their nuclear programs. It is unfortunate that despite pursuing such a policy, the United States is claiming that it is treating all countries in a nondiscriminatory manner on the nuclear nonproliferation issue. With direct U.S. help, Israel has become so advanced in the manufacture of nuclear weapons and missiles that if, God forbid, a situation occurs when it is forced to display and use its weapons then the world will remained stunned to see the height of advancement Israel has achieved in the production of nuclear weapons. Similarly, India, with the U.S. help and with its own resources has developed its nuclear program, turning itself into a significant nuclear power. Also, it is fast accelerating its missile program. India had temporarily halted its Prithvi missile test during Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's recent visit to the United States. Preparations, however, are under way now to resume the tests and Indian scientists have reached the test venue in Orissa. It has also been reported that these missiles will be deployed along Pakistan's border adjoining Indian Punjab and Rajasthan states. Later, they will be extended to the state of Jammu and Kashmir. The United States is fully aware of India's nuclear program and its implications. During his recent visit to the United States, the Indian prime minister had made it clear that India was not ready to accept any U.S. suggestion about its nuclear program. The Indian stand now is that it is not ready to accept any restriction on its nuclear program even if Pakistan signs the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty unilaterally and India will accept a restriction only when a program to abolish the nuclear weapon is implemented on a global basis. It is not realistic if, after knowing the Indian stand, the United States still feels that it can succeed in checking nuclear proliferation. Given this situation, there is no justification for the United States to exert any pressure on Pakistan. In view of the U.S. and Indian attitude, a school of thought in Pakistan is suggesting that we should also declare that we are not prepared to accept any restriction even if India accepts one on its nuclear program. If the U.S. and Indian attitude remains as it is now, then a time will come when it will not be possible to prevent this school of thought in Pakistan from becoming more powerful and popular. The U.S. Government now is realistic to the extent that it is not asking Pakistan to unilaterally roll back its nuclear program. Implementing the Pressler Amendment against us, however, is totally unjustified. In view of Indian designs and the policy of the United States itself, the United States has no justification for putting pressure on Pakistan. The whole nation supports the Government of Pakistan's stand that we will not accept any unilateral restriction on our nuclear program.
