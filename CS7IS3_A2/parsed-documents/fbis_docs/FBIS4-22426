Todoseychuk: "The New Party Is Centrist"] [Text] A press conference of representatives of the leading organs of the Democratic Party of Independence of Azerbaijan (DPNA) has been held. The DPNA is the 40th political party in Azerbaijan. The statute and program of the party were approved earlier, at the constituent conference on 26 March, and the Politburo and Ali Mejlis (Supreme Assembly) were elected. Gabil Guseynli, Vagif Kerimov, and Mubariz Gurbanly are cochairmen of the party. The party ranks number about 10,000; chapters have been opened in 61 regions of the republic. During the press conference, representatives of the DPNA answered numerous questions put by journalists. In particular, it was stated that the party occupies a centrist position and advocates holding parliamentary elections, which are a guarantee of successful democratic transformations, as soon as possible. The views of the DPNA are largely similar to the policy of the current leadership of the republic. The main objective of the DPNA is to achieve Azerbaijan's real independence. The party proceeds in its operations from the principles of its popular character, justice, and democracy. The DPNA comes out against the interference of the army in politics; it advocates implementation of the positive principles of Turkism, Islamism, and national-patriotism. As far as the economic sphere is concerned, a team of experts is at work within the DPNA. A privatization program has already been developed; it has been submitted to the leadership of the republic.
