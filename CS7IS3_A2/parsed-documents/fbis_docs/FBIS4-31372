Today, Nimetz is to be received by President Gligorov. This was the official announcement on the Crvenkovski-Nemitz meeting, with no details on the contents of the talks, which gave space to various media speculations. One such supposition even claims that Greek diplomats also arrived in Ohrid, along with Nimetz, and took part in the talks. The Greek prime minister bitterly refuted this. The A1 Television finds out from sources close to Papandreou's cabinet that Nimetz will probably not go back to Athens, as the Greek government wishes not to heat up the atmosphere four days before the elections for the European Parliament. Unofficial sources also point out that even if Nimetz does go back to Athens, there will be no one to receive him. Papandreou did not receive Nimetz even last Monday, and Papoulias left for Iran yesterday, and will afterward attend a NATO ministers' conference in Istanbul. Officially, the Greek government spokesman Evangelos Venzelos categorically denied all scenarios on new proposals by Nimetz, pointing out that such speculations are harmful, rather than useful for his country. He also underlined that the Macedonian question would not be brought up at the coming EU prime ministers' summit in Corfu. Meanwhile, the media in Athens report on the talks in Athens, making no comments, and with a general conclusion that the progress at the talks now depends entirely on Skopje. Thus, TA NEA claims that Nimetz's aim was to put pressure on the Macedonian leadership, while the Greek Foreign Ministry is somewhat optimistic as to a way out of the dead end. President Gligorov is of the opinion that there will be no essential progress in the negotiations, despite latest continuation in indirect talks under Nimetz's mediation, THE DAILY TELEGRAPH wrote yesterday. MAKFAX reports that the British paper concludes that the Greek embargo has considerably damaged the Macedonian economy, already at losses as a result of the sanctions against the Federal Yugoslavia. THE DAILY TELEGRAPH points out the economic crisis is an additional source of instability and could lead to a war, which would include Serbia, Greece, Bulgaria, and Albania, with Turkey as a patron of Tirana and the Turkish minority.
