Such selective chromogenic crown esters may be used, for example, in the colorimetric determination of cations. Furthermore, the capability of crown ester-containing styryl dyes to change structurally under light makes it possible to consider them as elements in photo-switching molecular devices. In the present work the synthesis of indole from nitropyridinium salts was improved and a method was developed for the synthesis of quaternary salts of new indolenine derivatives. The resulting indolenine salts condense with formyl derivatives of crown esters to styryl series dyes. Photoisomerization and complex formation of the crown ester-containing dyes with salts of alkali and alkaline earth metals was studied. A correlation was found to exist between the magnitude of spectral shift of the long wave absorption maximum of the dye, and the size and charge density on the metal cation.
