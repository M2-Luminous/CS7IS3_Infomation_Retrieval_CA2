The CPC Central Military Commission General Office demanded that, through studies and discussions, the document be implemented throughout the Army and viewed as the central task and duty. Themes of the Document Issued By CPC Central Military Commission General Office Document No. 9405 was a general report on: A speech by Liu Huaqing, of the Central Military Commission, made on 9 February when he met the division-level cadres of the three armed services in Xiamen; a speech by Air Force commander Cao Shuangming during an inspection trip to Shanghai Air Force Unit; and a speech by 2d Artillery Corps commander Yang Guoliang when he inspected a certain missile unit in Zhejiang. The themes of their speeches were: Develop and improve modernized equipment for the three armed services amid the reform and make preparations for counterattacking the subversion and destruction from hegemony as well as its military threat; and stress that hegemony, Japanese militarism, and Li Teng-hui's "Taiwan independence," "one China and one Taiwan," and two-China policies are the main enemies facing the three armed services. "Use Military Means To Settle Taiwan's Separation" Liu Huaqing said when meeting the division-level cadres of the three armed services: Whether a war will break out across the strait depends to a large extent on Li Teng-hui and the governing stratum in Taiwan. We do not want to see war breaking out across the strait because war will bring harm and destruction to the Chinese nation but this cannot be determined by our subjective expectations. The biggest sorrow and humiliation to a country and nation is its being split up and its invasion and occupation by other stronger powers. Concerning Taiwan, we have waited for 45 years and we can still wait, but this kind of waiting cannot be endless, nor can it be taken as tolerance of the activities promoting "Taiwan independence," "one China, one Taiwan," and two Chinas, or allowing foreign forces to intervene in Taiwan. Whether or not we will use military means and when we will use them depends on the development of the abovementioned matters. Taiwan is openly opposed to using the "one country, two systems" method of reaching reunification and this openly indicates that: Taiwan wants to follow the road of "Taiwan independence" in the future, a road which will lead to a test of military strength between the two sides of the strait. Li Teng-hui also pins hopes on the subversion of the mainland by the United States and the West as well as the interference and peaceful evolution being carried out by them. Judged from the development of things, the use of military means to settle Taiwan's separation is the eventual and only choice. When we use military means to settle reunification of the two sides of the strait and crush "Taiwan independence," we must mainly consider the interests of the broad masses of patriots in Taiwan, the degree of loss to the economic construction in Taiwan, and the price we have to pay in military and economic terms. We made preparations regarding this point a long time ago. Three Urgent Reasons For Developing the Air Force Air Force Commander Cao Shuangming made a speech to Shanghai Air Force Unit when a number of China-made J-18 II aircraft were commissioned into the unit. In a speech entitled: "Expedite the Building of a Modernized Air Force," he stressed the urgency for developing the air force: 1. It is to defend the motherland's territorial airspace and safeguard the socialist undertaking; 2. It is to resist hegemony and the aggression and interference of neighboring countries; and 3. It is to prepare for accomplishing the great undertaking of reunification of the motherland and for crushing "Taiwan independence" and the invasion of Taiwan by foreign countries. Cao Shuangming: "There Is No Other Choice" Cao Shuangming pointed out that Li Teng-hui is stepping up the effort to develop in the direction of "Taiwan independence" and to enlist and collude with the anti-China and anti-communism forces in the United States and Japan, in an attempt to turn Taiwan into an international dispute, reach the goal of separating Taiwan from Chinese soil. If things develop in this direction, we cannot other than adopt resolute and decisive military means to liberate Taiwan. There is no other choice.
