FBIS4-918 "drafr076_a_94017" FBIS-AFR-94-076 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Zaire URD Leader Comments on Premier Nomination Deadlock URD Leader Comments on Premier Nomination Deadlock AB2004100094 Kinshasa Tele-Zaire Television Network in French 1230 GMT 19 Apr 94 AB2004100094 Kinshasa Tele-Zaire Television Network French BFN [Text] At the High Council of the Republic-Transitional Parliament [HCR-PT], we are a day away from D-day: In principle, tomorrow is the deadline set by the HCR-PT for the political group opposed to President Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko to decide and nominate the prime minister who will head a 15-month national union government in accordance with the new constitution act promulgated on 9 April by Marshal Mobutu. On the eve of this deadline, the atmosphere is far from positive. Yesterday, we broadcast a few statements on the issue. Now we bring you that of Lawyer Kamanda wa Kamanda, chairman of the Nationalist Common Front and of the Union for the Republic and Democracy [URD] subplatform. [Begin recording] [Words indistinct] the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition [USOR]. But in view of the confusion created by Mende's statement and by some articles published in the newspapers which we consider inappropriate, on behalf of URD members I would like to make a few clarifications that would enable the national and international community to judge for themselves. On 13 April, at the People's Palace, USOR members of the URD who took part in the political consultations of the People's Palace turned up for the USOR executive committee meeting, which featured a single item on its agenda: examination of the problem posed by Article 78, paragraph 2, of the Interim Constitutional Act [ACT], in light of the HCR-PT executive organ's statement on 12 April 1994. At this meeting, the URD members, through me, their chairman, put forward a strategy and requested the others to let us examine how best to organize the consultations concerning Article 78 of the Constitutional Act and the HCR-PT executive organ's statement. We discussed how to tackle item by item a number of crucial issues, particularly the composition of the USOR delegation to the consultations with members of the Political Forces of the Conclave, the timing [preceding word in English] and procedure of consultations with the other components of USOR and Allies [USORAL]. 3. [as heard] The signing of the protocol agreement which concluded the political consultations of the People's Palace and of the special disposition by those who had not yet signed it and by the prime minister who would be presented at the end of the consultations. 4. The position of the prime minister elected by the Sovereign National Conference on this problem, on the protocol agreement, on the special disposition, as well as on the ACT. 6. [as heard] The management of subsequent candidacies and of ambitions within USOR first, and then within USORAL, taking into account the deadline problem for filing candidacies within USOR to achieve a joint presentation of the prime minister to the other members of the political class. The USOR presidium on that day categorically refused to open a debate on the issues I have just recalled and on the strategy we put forward, declaring that everything had already been settled at (?IMET) [expansion unknown] during the 6 April USOR plenary session and that there was no longer anything to discuss. The presidium had read the report which was prepared at (?IMET) at the 6 April plenary session which was not attended by URD members because they were uninformed, and at which suspension measures or disciplinary actions were taken against members of the URD for reasons we do not know. Faced with this refusal to hold discussion and with the will of the presidium to impose the fait accompli, the URD members pulled out after having recorded their disapproval in the meeting's report. Thus, they did not take part in the resource-pooling meeting between USOR, the civil society, and the Allies on 13 April at the People's Palace. I would like to add that the URD members did not take part in any vote during this meeting, because no vote was conducted in their presence, let alone in their absence, since only one group stayed back at the meeting place and sought to impose its view. After all, in relation to whom and to what other viewpoint could any vote have taken place? This is why members of the URD refute and rebut the shameless lies that were published in the newspapers.
