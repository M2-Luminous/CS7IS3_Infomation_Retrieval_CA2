New technology is being used in the territory to keep one step ahead of law enforcers battling to keep a lid on the sale of counterfeit computer games and the illegal copying of programmes. The latest scam involves copying more than 100 game programmes on to a compact disc which can in turn be copied individually on to customers' hard disks for as little as $10 a game. Original games can cost up to $500 each. Previously, Customs officers raiding game stores could easily identify whether copying was taking place because large numbers of hard disks containing the programme recordings were stored there. But the new CD ROM discs, the same size as music CDs, contain hundreds of times as much information as the older discs. One CD ROM with hundreds of games can easily be concealed during a customs raid. Officers from the Customs' Intellectual Property Investigation Bureau yesterday seized for the first time equipment they suspected could record game programmes on to CD ROMs. They raided a house in Kwun Tong and arrested two men leaving the premises at 3.30 pm. Officers subsequently searched two other homes and a private car and seized 1,128 counterfeit game cartridges, computer chips, and a large quantity of copy packaging valued in total at $500,000. But the bureau's deputy head, Simon Wong Shinming, said the most significant part of the haul was the confirmation that the counterfeiters had switched tactics. "We have been conducting raids on shops and had been able to seize equipment being used for copying together with the hard disks with the recordings on them. But recently we have not been finding any hard disks. We couldn't understand why so we switched our attention to the distributors." Intelligence information led to yesterday's raid on the distributors of CD ROMs and revealed the new tactics being used. Mr Wong said his officers would now consider reviewing their strategy. "We are likely to be focusing on the distributor level or posing as customers in order to be able to hit them at the right time," he said. Russell Yeh, director of KPS Video Express, the largest distributor of home entertainment software in Hong Kong, said he estimated the industry was losing up to $3 million a month from counterfeiting. "We need Customs to keep hitting (counterfeiters). We know of shops that are selling copy cartridges without even attempting to make them look like the real thing. Their quality is not as good and we believe there are a lot of people that would rather pay more and get the original."
