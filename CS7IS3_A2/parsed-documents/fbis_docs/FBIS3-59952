This announcement came on the occasion of the inauguration of El-Salam nuclear reactor at Ain Oussera. More details with Ahmed Khida: Khida: First, we stress that Foreign Affairs Minister Salah Dembri officially declared today in three languages Algeria's intention to join the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty. He was third to speak at the inauguration ceremony of the diplomatic missions--which were all invited, and most of whom attended--and before international and national journalists. Dembri: Therefore, I officially announce today--in the name of the highest authorities in the country--our intention to join the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Khida: Therefore, after the El-Nour nuclear reactor in Algiers, with its weak one MW capacity, another nuclear reactor was officially inaugurated in Ain Oussera, Djelfa Province. It is called the El-Salam reactor and has a capacity of 15 thermal MW. The inauguration coincided with the 35th anniversary of establishing Algerian-Chinese relations in 1958. This reactor was the product of Chinese companies. The representatives stressed ongoing Algerian- Chinese cooperation and revealed that IAEA experts had visited the Ain Oussera nuclear reactor many times during the stages of its construction, and they had become convinced that this achievement was for purely peaceful purposes of research. For his part, Algeria's Foreign Minister Dembri said that the El- Salam reactor had (?accepted) at the Algerian Government's request to meet the guarantees of the IAEA. National Education Minister Ahmed Jebbar, who was the first to speak, stressed that the construction of the El-Salam nuclear reactor was a logical culmination of the considerable efforts exerted over 20 years in training, science, and technology. Therefore, this new nuclear reactor is aimed at nuclear research, which has become a major component of all systems. The research to be carried out by this new reactor concerns the fields of medicine, X-ray treatment, and research development in the fields of agriculture and industry. Finally, we record the absence of the general director of the IAEA, Mr. [Hans] Blix, who on this occasion sent a message to the Algerian Government in which he stressed his belief that this new achievement constitutes an important landmark in the development of nuclear research and control technology.
