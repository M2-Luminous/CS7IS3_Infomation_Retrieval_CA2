It called on the Kigali government to desist from making such unhelpful remarks which do not help in finding a solution to the tragic situation. The charge d'affaires of the Rwandan Embassy in Kampala, Mr. Joseph Bukeye was this morning summoned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs where the minister of state for foreign affairs, Mr. Kirunda Kivejinja, presented him the protests from the Uganda Government. Mr. Kirunda Kivejinja told the charge d'affaires of the Rwandan Embassy that remarks made by Mr. Mugenzi on the BBC Focus on Africa, on the 27th of April, that President Museveni controls the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] and that if President Museveni directed the RPF, the killing taking place in Rwanda would stop, were baseless, irresponsible and dangerous. Mr. Kirunda Kivejinja told Mr. Bukeye that the Government of Uganda and President Museveni have no control whatsoever on the RPF. He informed him that the Government of Uganda views such a statement coming from a senior official of the Rwandan Government with grave concern and finds it totally unacceptable. The minister drew the attention of the charge d'affaires to the tireless efforts that President Museveni had made in trying to find a lasting solution to the conflict in Rwanda. He said that to clear the allegation that Uganda was involved in the conflict in Rwanda, President Museveni has requested for a UN observer mission which is (?planned) to man the Uganda-Rwanda border.
