In the communique, the Chinese Government restated its consistent position on the Taiwan issue, and the French Government recognized that the PRC Government is the sole legitimate government of China, that Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory, and it undertook not to approve in the future arms sales to Taiwan by French enterprises. It was announced in the communique that French Prime Minister Balladur will pay a formal visit to China in the near future. The joint communique indicated that Sino-Franco relations have begun to be restored after a difficult period. As all know, in November 1992, the former French Socialist Party government, in ignoring the Chinese Government's strong opposition and principled and stern representations, approved the sale of 60 Mirage-2000 fighter aircraft to Taiwan. This action undermined the foundation of the friendly relations between China and France and resulted in a serious retrogression in bilateral relations. In March 1993, the new French government headed by Prime Minister Balladur took office. In April, French business circles appealed through the press to the new government to take action to relax Sino-Franco relations, which had deadlocked, and they stressed that the French side "should take the first political step." Later, former French President Giscard d'Estang, former Prime Minister Chirac, and other French political leaders called for improving relations with China. French Foreign Minister Juppe separately issued a statement at the end of 1993 and early this year in which he expressed the hope of "restoring relations of greater trust with China at an early date." China responded positively to France's gesture. Prime Minister Balladur sent special envoy Friedmann to visit Beijing in July and December of last year for consultations on restoring Sino-Franco relations. On 12 January, the two sides issued a joint communique declaring that China and France have restored their traditional friendly and cooperative relations. It can be said that this indicated that Sino-Franco relations have come out of their low ebb and that a new chapter has been opened in their relations. The improvement in Sino-Franco relations was made possible due to various factors. First, tense Sino-Franco relations do not conform to France's long-term interests. Sino-Franco economic and trade cooperation is mainly in the nuclear power industry, transportation, energy industry, and other technical projects. According to statistics provided by the French side, as of this date, the amount in contracts that the French side has lost totals 6 billion francs. Some people have estimated that if Sino-Franco relations continued to deteriorate, its losses would reach 30 billion francs. French business circles have suffered seriously, and therefore their call to improve Sino-Franco relations had been the loudest. The East Asia region currently is the most economically vigorous region in the world. In particular, since it adopted the policy of reform and opening up, China's economy has grown rapidly and in a sustained manner, drawing worldwide attention. Asia's prosperity and the West's economic recession have formed a sharp contrast. Currently, Western countries, including the United States, have set their eyes on Asia and are attempting to seek markets there. Among EC member states, Germany has led the way. In the first half of 1993 alone, Germany doubled the amount of the sophisticated technological goods that it exported to China. The tense Sino- Franco political relations have directly affected France's exports of technological goods to China. Second, China's international status has kept on increasing. Both China and France are permanent members of the UN Security Council, and both of them possess nuclear weapons; therefore, in the current turbulent and unstable international situation, the two countries must hold consultations more often and have closer cooperation to make contributions to maintaining world peace and stability. The Sino-U.S. summit meeting in Seattle in November was both a shock and a push to France. France, which has always embraced an independent foreign policy, felt that it needed to coordinate with China on such major international issues as banning nuclear testing and arms control. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of Sino-Franco diplomatic relations. In 1964, because of the personal concern of General de Gaulle, Chairman Mao Zedong, and Premier Zhou Enlai, China and France established diplomatic ties, making France the first major Western country to establish diplomatic relations with PRC and winning wide international praise. The achievements of the development of Sino-Franco relations over the last 30 years were hard-won. Cooperation between the two countries has a solid foundation; China's market potential is huge, and France has an advantage in technological goods -- the two countries' economies are highly complementary to each other. We believe that as long as the two countries strictly abide by the principle on which they established their diplomatic ties and the principle laid down in the joint communique, Sino-Franco relations will gradually improve and will develop.
