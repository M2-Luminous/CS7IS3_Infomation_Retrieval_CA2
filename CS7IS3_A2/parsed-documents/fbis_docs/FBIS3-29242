Speaking at the House of Representatives plenary session, Hosokawa said, "it is a common view among the G-7 (Group of Seven) nations that foreign exchange rates should reflect the economic fundamentals of nations and that excessive exchange volatility is undesirable." "We will act appropriately to ensure stability in the market," he said. Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii also dismissed market speculation that the United States seeks to guide the yen higher to cut its trade surplus with Japan. "The U.S. believes that currency markets should not be artificially manipulated. Their attitude has not changed," he said. In the wake of the breakdown of bilateral "framework" trade talks, which fueled the speculation, the yen zoomed up by more than 6 yen during the first two days of the week, though caution over the high pace of the yen's advance pulled it back somewhat during Wednesday dealing.
