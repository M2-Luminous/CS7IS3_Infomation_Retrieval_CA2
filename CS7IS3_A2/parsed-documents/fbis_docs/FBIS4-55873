They denounced both the ongoing detention of the organization's leading members, on which the intervention of Albanian President Sali Berisha has been requested, and the ban on the functioning of its offices in Gjirokaster as well as repeated break-ins at homes by members of the secret police ShIK. Omonoia describes these actions as a violation of human rights and points out that they hurt relations between the Albanian people and the Greek minority. It recalls that the minority was banned from celebrating the 25 March anniversary and also leveled serious charges about the operation of minority schools. According to these charges, 200 children of the lower school grades are prevented from attending classes in Greek. On the organization's claims regarding language, Omonoia demands recognition of the right to education, the right to perform religious functions, and the broadcasting of radio and television programs in Greek, which is used along with Albanian. [passage omitted] On political rights, Omonoia demands that the minority population get the chance of being hired on every level of administration, having their cultural inheritance protected, and given freedom to be free to determine their national identity. In its national claims, Omonoia includes recognition of the right to establish national parties and the possibility of using Greek national symbols along with Albanian national symbols on official holidays and anniversaries. Omonoia believes that all its demands are within the limits stipulated by the Albanian Constitution and the law "on fundamental human rights and freedoms," which has been passed by the Albanian Parliament. The organization points out that despite the Albanian president's statement, Albania's stance toward the minority has not changed and repeated attempts were made to indirectly involve the minority in criminal actions at Peshkepi, which, together with any use of violence and arbitrariness, is denounced by the organization. Omonoia stresses that friendly Albanian-Greek relations are essential for peace and stability in the Balkans. [passage omitted]
