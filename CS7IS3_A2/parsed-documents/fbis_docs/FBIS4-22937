Lomonosov; UDC541.11] [Abstract] The electro-physical properties of high temperature superconductors, as observed at low temperatures, are determined by the conditions under which they were prepared at high temperatures, and for this reason study of phase equilibria and stability over a wide range of temperatures and oxygen partial pressures is of primary importance to the preparation of ceramic materials and films having good working characteristics. The notion of determining the area of thermodynamic stability of a substance comes down to the fact that any unforeseen changes in properties are excluded at equilibrium in this area; by fixing the thermodynamic variables, thermodynamics guarantees preservation of the state of equilibrium and also determines the trend and final result for any given changes in the system. The title phase (123), as well as others, may, and in fact does exist beyond the limits of the stated thermodynamic equilibrium range of temperature, pressure, and composition. This can only be metastable or frozen (labile) states of matter. In the first case the state may exist indefinitely, so long as no sources of activation energy, necessary for transition to stable equilibrium, enter the system. In a previous work, the thermodynamic stability of the 123 solid solution was determined on the basis of the results of a thermodynamic study of the system Y-Ba-Cu-O. In the present work the most recent data on the thermodynamic properties of this phase were used to calculate stable and metastable phase equilibria within the title system. The area of thermodynamic stability of this phase was constructed for the coordinates composition-temperature and partial oxygen pressure-temperature. The results were compared with existing published results of direct experimental research and the thermodynamic properties of Y[.sub]2[/]BaCuO[.sub]5[/] and the solid solution YBa[.sub]4[/]Cu[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]8.5+q[/] were estimated.
