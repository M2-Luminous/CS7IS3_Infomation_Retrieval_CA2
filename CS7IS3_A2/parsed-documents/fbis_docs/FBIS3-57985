At a meeting of his party's Central Committee in Helsinki on Saturday [27 November], Hakanen said the general validity of collective bargaining agreements and the labor union movement's rights to enter into international agreements have not been recognized in the membership negotiations. There has been too little mention of the funding of social security and public services. In Hakanen's opinion, a radical shift to the right and the West has occurred in Finland's foreign and security policies. Whereas an independent neutrality policy used to be emphasized, now submission to the EU foreign and security policies is the point of departure.
