The list contains businesses with property valued at 35 billion crowns. In an IMF economic policy memorandum, the Slovak Government has undertaken to privatise 500 state enterprises with a book value of 220 billion crowns. The memorandum states that 88 billion crowns worth of property will be privatised through the form of coupon privatisation. The preliminary list contains 40 percent of this amount. Janicina said that of the 53 billion shortfall, the government hopes to place 17 billion crowns of property from energy and gas companies into coupon privatisation, a further 15 to 20 billion crowns of shares from the first wave held by the National Property Fund, and another ten billion is still being discussed by the appropriate ministries. Janicina said that a number of businesses that would be privatised through standard methods had been excluded from the list. Privatisation of health facilities will be clarified by July 30. If these facilities do not find specific parties interested in their purchase they will also be included in coupon privatisation. The definitive list of businesses for the second wave will be completed by August 15.
