Hungarian Civic Party on Slovak-Hungarian Relations"] [Text] Bratislava--The editorial office received a statement from the Hungarian Civic Party [MOS] yesterday that states, among other things, that what is absolutely lacking is an institutionalization of the solution to the problems of the national minorities. Quite the contrary, the solution to these problems is being transferred to extraparliamentary forums. Individual components of power, political parties, and cultural and social organizations mutually interfere in their powers. MOS considers it alarming that leading government and parliament representatives have endorsed the demands of the assembly of Slovaks from southern Slovakia held at Surany on 2 January, which contain elements that are incompatible with the principles of parliamentary democracy and whose spirit and tone are reminiscent of the pre-1989 period. MOS does not identify with the appeal issued by the Association of Towns and Villages of Zitny Island because some parts of the appeal are not in conformity with the party's program. The statement observes that present power holders regard ethnic minorities merely as an appendix of the state. All citizens, including members of the minorities, are a source of the sovereignty of the Slovak Republic, and, therefore, they rightly demand legal and institutional guarantees of the preservation of their distinctive identity.
