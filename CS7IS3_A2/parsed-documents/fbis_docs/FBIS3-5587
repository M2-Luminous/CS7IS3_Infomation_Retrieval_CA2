The mechanism to stop an import surge, according to Trade Secretary Rizalino S. Navarro, will be activated whenever unscrupulous suppliers injure local producers with shipments of competing products at artificially low prices. "While we are removing or liberalizing trade, you have to make sure the guy on the other shore does not prejudice industries here through unfair trade practices," he said. Meanwhile, Navarro said, the import ban he proposed to the Monetary Board, policy body at the Central Bank of the Philippines late in February 1994 should not be treated as a signal that government was going back on its word to force local industries to be efficient by making it compete with foreign competitors. "I am not going to open that door wider so that everybody is protected," he said, dousing cold water on speculations of local manufacturers on a government aboutface on its import liberalization program. The proposed ban was for a six-month period. It will apply on tires, refractory bricks, paper products, and glass products. Navarro recommended the temporary ban after monitoring showed a surge in imports on these four items. Earlier, Sen. Leticia Ramos-Shahani asked the Senate to inquire into the reported dumping of foreign articles in the country at prices less than their fair market value in anticipation of the effectivity of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The Philippines is a signatory to the GATT whose protocol would be submitted to the Senate for ratification. The agreement is set to take effect July 1995. "This dumping would greatly prejudice local manufacturers or similar goods because they would find it difficult to restructure their capital requirements and update their factories, plant facilities, and their inventories," Shahani warned. Shahani said that uncontrolled dumping of goods from abroad would impair the ability of Philippine industries to compete in the world market. President Ramos and the senators led by Senate President Edgardo J. Angara, in their third regular Tuesday breakfast meeting this week agreed to ask Trade Secretary Rizalino Navarro to create a panel of Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) experts to provide accurate data on the GATT which would help senators understand the complexities of the international agreement.
