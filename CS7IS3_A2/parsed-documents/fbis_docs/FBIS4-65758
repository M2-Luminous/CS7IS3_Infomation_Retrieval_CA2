Meanwhile, the PKK, which recently established close relations with Jalal Talabani, leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK], has issued a statement on the attack through that party. The PUK official in Irbil said that Kala Dizeh, commander of the Zalakh camp, informed his office that "the attack by the Turkish military planes was completely unsuccessful. No one was killed or wounded." The air attack on the camp created a shock wave in northern Iraq. Many of the PKK militants, who did not expect another attack after the air raid in February, had already returned to the camp. With the return of the militants, the military officials in Turkey ordered several F-4 and F-104 aircraft to take off from their bases in Malatya and Diyarbakir to attack the camp for the second time. It has been reported that all the buildings and other constructions in the camp were destroyed. Meanwhile, it has been learned that groups of PKK militants have begun to leave the vicinity of the camp.
