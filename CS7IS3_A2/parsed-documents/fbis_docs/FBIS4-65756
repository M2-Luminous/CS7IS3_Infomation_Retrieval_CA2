Venizelos reminded the Albanian Government about the recent demarches that Greece made to international organizations about the issue. The spokesman made this statement after [Albanian President Sali] Berisha's regime accused six individuals from North Ipirotes of serious charges following the border incident in Episkopi. Venizelos stressed that the Greek Government has always linked the improvement of Greek-Albanian relations, an improvement that it wants and pursues, to full respect for the Greek Albanian's human rights. He added that Greek-Albanian relations as well as Albania's relations with the European Union [EU] depend on this prerequisite. Venizelos concluded: Greece will lodge new diplomatic demarches with all the international organizations and third countries. It has already lodged demarches with the United Nations, CSCE, the EU, and the U.S. Government. [passage omitted]
