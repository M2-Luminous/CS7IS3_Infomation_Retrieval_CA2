As the northern soldiers consolidated, opposition parties led by vice-president 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the southern leader, announced here early Tuesday they would form a High Council for National Salvation. 'Abd-al Rahman al-Jifri, who chairs a bloc of five opposition parties, told AFP the council would function wherever it had influence, not just in southern Yemen. "In no way does this mean the formation of a government of South Yemen," al-Jifri said. He said the decision to form a High Council was prompted by the constitutional vacuum and the illegality of the political institutions in the country. Around 50 northerners were patrolling the perimeter of the al-'Anad air base Monday and the junction of the two main roads to the northern capital Sanaa, an AFP photographer said. Backed by tanks, artillery and anti-aircraft batteries, they took up position around 3:30 p.m. (1230 GMT), cutting off southern troops further north. The official north Yemeni news agency SABA' reported Monday afternoon that the base had fallen to northern troops, who were mopping up resistance inside the base. Southern warplanes were bombing newly-won northern positions, defying anti-aircraft fire. Al-Jifri implicitly recognised that the base, garrisoned by 20,000 men, had fallen, saying that its weaponry had been removed. "The northerners knew all the military and artillery positions inside the base, so it was only natural that we took out the heavy artillery to hide it elsewhere," he said. The base appeared deserted Monday evening, but heavy fighting was going on in the surrounding hills. The AFP photographer at the base said the gun turrets on the northerners' tanks were turned towards the south. Asked if they had come from Aden or Sanaa, the soldiers replied joyously: "Sanaa." Some five kilometres separated the northern troops and the southern army, which was bringing up heavy artillery and pounding northerners' positions. Truckloads of civilians were fleeing in panic either towards Aden or to the mountains in the north. The northern army has been concentrating its efforts on the strategic route for the past few days. Heavy fighting was also reported on the eastern front some 40 kilometres (24 miles) from Aden, and journalists trying to get there were sent back by southern troops. Warplanes were continuously landing and taking off from Aden throughout Monday evening, but the local population remained calm. The two sides lurched into civil war on May 5 after months of arguing over how to run the country, formed from the unification in May 1990 of conservative North Yemen and poorer, Marxist South Yemen.
