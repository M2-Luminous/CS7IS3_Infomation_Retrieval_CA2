FR940516-1-00002 FR940516-1-00001 COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION 17 CFR Parts 1, 4, 30, 150 Proposed Amendments to Commodity Pool Operator and Commodity Trading Advisor Disclosure Rules AGENCY: Commodity Futures Trading Commission. ACTION: Proposed rules. SUMMARY: The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'' or ``CFTC'') is proposing substantial revisions to the disclosure framework applicable to commodity pool operators (``CPOs'') and commodity trading advisors (``CTAs''). The proposed amendments reflect the Commission's experience in applying the disclosure requirements set forth in part 4 of the Commission's rules and significant evolution in the purposes, structure and activities of the managed funds marketplace. These proposed modifications of the CPO and CTA disclosure framework are designed to achieve greater simplicity, focus and clarity in performance history presentations; streamlining of other required disclosures; and a more concise and readable format for disclosure documents. DATES: Comments on the proposed rules must be received on or before July 15, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments must be sent to Jean A. Webb, Secretary of the Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K Street, NW, Washington, DC 20581. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Susan C. Ervin, Deputy Director/Chief Counsel, or France M.T. Maca, Division of Trading and Markets, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K Street NW., Washington, DC 20581. Telephone: (202) 254&hyph;8955. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Commission Rule 4.21 1 requires that each CPO registered or required to be registered under the Commodity Exchange Act (``Act'' or ``CEA''), 7 U.S.C. 1 et seq. (1988 & Supp. 1992), provide prospective participants with a disclosure document containing the information specified in the rule on or before the date it solicits, accepts or receives funds, securities or other property from prospective participants for a pool it operates or intends to operate. Each CTA who is registered or required to be registered is also required, by Rule 4.31, to deliver a disclosure document prior to or at the time of soliciting or entering into an agreement to direct or guide the commodity interest account of a prospective client. These requirements were first promulgated on January 8, 1979, when the Commission published part 4 of its regulations relating to the operations and activities of CPOs and CTAs. 2 1 Commission rules referred to herein are found at 17 CFR Ch. I (1993). 2 44 FR 1918 (January 8, 1979). I. Summary of Proposed Rule Changes Based upon more than fifteen years of experience with administering the part 4 disclosure framework for CPOs and CTAs, the Commission has undertaken a comprehensive review of the disclosure requirements for CPOs and CTAs to identify areas in which the regulatory structure can be streamlined or simplified, while continuing to provide appropriate customer protection. Rules 4.7 and 4.8 were adopted in August 1992 as a result of the first phase of this review. 3 This proposal represents the second phase of the Commission's review of part 4, which will also include consideration of the appropriateness of a two-part format for pool disclosure documents. 4 The Commission is seeking public comment on proposed revisions of Rules 4.21 and 4.31. The amendments have three major purposes: (1) Simplification of past performance disclosures; (2) reduction of required disclosures as to matters of secondary relevance; and (3) clarification and modernization of various requirements. In addition, Rules 4.21 and 4.31 would be redrafted, reorganized and renumbered with a view towards greater clarity, simplicity and congruence with contemporary managed funds practices. 3 57 FR 34853 (August 7, 1992). Subject to certain conditions, Rule 4.7(a) provides relief from the specific requirements of Rules 4.21 and 4.23 and from certain of the requirements of Rule 4.22 to registered CPOs with respect to pools sold only to ``qualified eligible participants'' and satisfying the other conditions set forth in the rule. Rule 4.7(b) provides relief from the specific requirements of Rules 4.31 and 4.32 to registered CTAs with respect to the accounts of ``qualified eligible clients'' as defined in the rule. Rule 4.8 permits the CPOs of certain privately offered pools to solicit participants for those pools upon filing with the Commission and delivering to prospective participants the disclosure document required by Rule 4.21, eliminating the twenty-one day pre-filing requirement of Rule 4.21(g) for such pools. 4 If determined to be appropriate, such a document could consist of: A summary disclosure document, provided to all prospective pool participants, containing core information relevant to a determination to participate in the pool; and a supplemental document, which would be made available upon request, containing additional and more detailed information of interest to some investors. Proposed revisions to the disclosure requirements for CPO disclosure documents include the following.
