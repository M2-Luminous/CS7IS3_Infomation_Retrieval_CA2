The report, on the issue of boosting employment, particularly for middle-aged white collar workers, was compiled by the advisory panel to the Labor Ministry's Employment Security Bureau chief. It said middle-aged workers should accept being transferred outside of their company group in order to remain in employment, and that such transfers should be allowed to be permanent if those workers agree. Also, companies should consider sending "excess" workers overseas to Southeast Asia or Eastern Europe where Japanese business know-how is welcomed, the report said. According to a recent survey by the Management and Coordination Agency, the population of white collar workers aged over 45 swelled to 12.18 million in 1993, 18.8 percent of the entire workforce, from 6.07 million or 11.5 percent in 1973. The increase is partly because there are now more older people than younger ones in Japan. Many Japanese companies making streamlining efforts to cope with the current recession have "excess" workforce, particularly among their middle-aged, white collar workers.
