The fact remains that Gen. Briquemont is the third high-level military officer to have bluntly criticized the EU and UN ambiguity. French Gen. Philippe Morillon, his predecessor, was not mild in his criticism either, and thanks to his actions, which at some points ran counter to UN and EU directives, he became a hero to French public opinion. Gen. Briquemont addressed his criticism to UN and EU diplomats, who vote one resolution after another but neglect to provide the means for their implementation. Deciding that the Muslim enclaves threatened by the Serbs should become "safe areas" is one thing; making sure that the necessary people and equipment are provided to effectively create "safe areas" is another. One more duty, providing emergency aid to the ailing population, has been made impossible by the lack of troops and supplies. Not to speak of the harassment from all parties to which the UN troops are not allowed to respond. Gen. Briquemont said with contempt that he no longer read the UN resolutions because they were useless. French Gen. Jean Cot, commander of the UNPROFOR troops in the former Yugoslavia, was also very harsh. He attacked the diplomats sitting "in their Geneva palaces," while his troops had to do the actual fighting. Gen. Cot said he would no longer agree to allow his Blue Helmets to be helpless targets and hostages to the arbitrarily operating Serbian, Croatian, or Muslim militias in Bosnia. Briquemont and Cot hold all warring parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina responsible for the harassment and humiliation, although the Serbs have been mentioned with more emphasis. Grumbling generals are not uncommon. Generals at the frontline always complain about the gap between the words and the actions of politicians. As regards ex-Yugoslavia, however, dissatisfaction is very easy to understand. The inconsistencies between the decisions made by politicians and diplomats and the means available on the spot are obvious and have made many UN soldiers desperate. In France and Great Britain, suggestions have already been made to recall the Blue Helmets. EU mediator Lord Owen also stated that a withdrawal of UN troops might be considered if no substantial progress in the peace talks is made over the coming two months. It was also suggested that, if the warring factions do not observe the UN resolutions more rigorously, "other means" should be sought. This may mean that the West is prepared to use stronger military means to implement the resolutions, or else -- and is not unthinkable either -- decide to withdraw all blue helmets from that hornet's nest. For Belgian UN troops in Baranja, this would be the best thing to do. According to UN resolutions, UN troops were supposed to disarm the militias, make sure that the Croatian population was able to return home, and return the area under Serbian occupation to the authority of the Croatian state. As the situation is now, the Blue Helmets are indeed contributing to a consolidation of positions, although these favor the Serbs. In reality, UN troops are of no use in implementing UN resolutions, but they are an accessory in keeping an illegally occupying power in place. This cannot be the goal of a peacemaking operation.
