Sakaguchi said the move by Okuma Corp. runs counter to the law governing employment of senior workers that requires employers to make efforts to set the retirement age at 60. "We as the labor ministry will give instructions," Sakaguchi told reporters at a press conference. Okuma on Monday said it had lowered its retirement age for employees to 56 in a move designed to cut labor costs. "It might not stand to reason to interfere with an agreement between labor and management but this is a problem with social implications," Sakaguchi said. Many Japanese companies are trying to weather the recession by trimming labor costs by means of asking employees to retire voluntarily but Okuma is the first to slash the retirement age.
