The Rukh believes that the acts of terror against it are due to its political line aimed at the building of an independent democratic state and at ridding Ukraine of the former communist nomenclatura. Vyacheslav Chornovil quoted a number of facts: Several attacks, over the recent weeks, on the electoral headquarters of the Rukh Chernivtsi regional organization; a pogrom on Christmas night in the building of the Ternopil Rukh organization; the beating up of children of several leaders of rayon Rukh organizations in Odessa Oblast. Unknown people broke into the apartment of the chairman of the Kirovohrad organization, and on 15 January, there was an attempt to break into the apartment of Les Tanyuk, member of the central Rukh leadership and member of Ukraine's Supreme Council Presidium. On 17 January, in broad daylight, Colonel Serhiy Budko was beaten up in Vinnytsya. Finally, there is the attack on the Rukh secretariat in Kiev and the disappearance of the head of the secretariat Mykhaylo Boychyshyn, of whom nothing is known to this day. The Rukh demands that the president and the Supreme Council chairman intervene in the situation and that Ukraine's Security Service, Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Procurator General's Office investigate the criminal actions against Rukh activists.
