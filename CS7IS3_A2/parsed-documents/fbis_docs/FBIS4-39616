The ITAR-TASS correspondent was told this today by Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Russian Foreign Ministry's department of information and the press. He said that it was in the common interests of the world community "to deprive the internecine conflict of fuel." The warring sides, he said, should finally heed the voice of reason, cease the senseless destruction of their own country, and return to the path of political dialogue. Despite the efforts to stop the bloodshed, the official spokesman of the Russian foreign policy department said, reports are continuing to come from Yemen about large-scale combat actions and more deaths and destruction. In this connection, he stressed, Russia welcomes the efforts to achieve a normalization of the situation by the UN Security Council, the League of Arab States, the countries of the Persian Gulf, and other international mediators, and Russia confirms its readiness to coordinate actions toward the soonest possible cessation of the fratricidal conflict.
