Moving the motion at today's sitting, the minister of interior, Colonel Osei-Wusu, explained that since the declaration of the state of emergency, there have been reports of wanton killings of babies, women, and unarmed persons. He said that it is now obvious that some of the groups involved in the fighting are bent on causing more carnage. Col. Osei-Wusu said the current situation is such that the state of emergency must continue to enable the task force to achieve its objectives of ensuring the cessation of hostilities and disarming the combatants. Parliament appealed to the soldiers engaged in the peacekeeping exercise not to act on their emotion but to use diplomacy, dialogue, and minimum force in the execution of the peacekeeping mission.
