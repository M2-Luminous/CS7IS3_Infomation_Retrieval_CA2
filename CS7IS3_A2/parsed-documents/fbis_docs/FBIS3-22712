National disaster and emergency chief Leith Anderson said hundreds more were reportedly seriously ill. He said communications from Trobriand were poor, but information reaching his office Tuesday said the epidemic had killed more than 200 men, women and children in the past two months -- with the old and very young hardest hit. Anderson said the epidemic appeared to have hit Kiriwina -- the main island -- and the Kaileuna, Vakuta and Kitava island groups. The Trobriands are about 400 kilometers (240 miles) northeast of here.
