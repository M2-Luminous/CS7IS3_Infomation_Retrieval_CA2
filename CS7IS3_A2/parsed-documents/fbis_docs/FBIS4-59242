What once looked ike international unanimity is now nothing more than deception and a ploy Washington imposed on everyone by temptation and intimidation. Therefore, it is not strange to see Turkey lamenting its poor economic conditions and calling for help, and to watch Bulgaria speaking bitterly and cynically about the over-rich who no longer dig into their pockets. On the other hand, France is not hiding its bitterness about the so-called U.S. "reward" and the loss of its markets and friendships. Russia has not ceased complaining about the brunt of the damage it has sustained due to its support for the blockade. The same can be said about conditions in Germany, Greece, and many other nations. The unfair blockade imposed on our people by U.S. domination and influence in international decisions has become a cause for resentment and a source of great economic pressure in many nations due to the political stands they once adopted. Those who went along with the blockade and abided by its policy did not, in the worst or best conditions, realize it would take such a long time, and that the "booty" they had expected would not be worth their blessing or silence, instead of their objection or protest, especially since they had already been paid for their stands in advance and were compensated by both the Saudi and Kuwaiti treasuries for some time and later threatened by the United States if they tried to breach or ignore the unfair resolutions. Iraq's steadfastness and endurance, thanks to its leadership's ability and wisdom and its people's awareness, cohesiveness, and will power, have been and still are the main decisive factors in exposing and unveiling U.S. policies. This legendary steadfastness was the potent weapon that eroded and mutilated the logic of domination and made many countries reconsider their stands on the basis of their national interests. Their unjustifiable drift behind Washington's policy all those years has led to incalculable negative results, the least of which are the closure of factories, the bankruptcy of companies, increasing unemployment, mounting economic losses, and the loss of many markets in the area. If a number of French officials have admitted the enormous losses France has incurred as a result of drifting behind Washington's policy, Russia's losses are even greater in the economic and the political spheres. Turkey, whose foreign debts in 1990 were less than $13.6 billion, is now facing debts of $70 billion. Turkish Prime Minister Ciller admits the blockade has caused her country losses of more than $20 billion and has greatly affected its commercial dealings and economic situation. She calls for the need to end this blockade due to its disastrous results on her country. The Bulgarian Government has also demanded through its Deputy Prime Minister Yevgeniy Matinchev the need to lift the blockade on Iraq, which has caused damages to Bulgaria amounting to $3.5 billion. The Bulgarian deputy prime minister admits all attempts to resolve this problem have failed since the countries imposing this blockade "no longer dig into their pockets to compensate those who suffered damages." The increasing world outcry against the unfair blockade has established a tangible reality that accurately reflects the degree of its disintegration and erosion and the demand for its termination and burial. In as much as it showed the grave sin committed against Iraq and its people, the blockade revealed the great damage it has caused the world, and therefore fully exposed the logic of domination and the policy of monopolization being exercised by Washington. Thus, the mounting outcry to lift the unfair blockade against our country has convinced us of our sound policy, strong will power, cohesiveness, and spirit of patience, endurance, and firmness. Were it not for this legendary steadfastness, we would not have been able to defeat the logic of aggression and to expose the faces of the aggressors with all their ugliness. Indeed, it is now only a question of time, and all indications are time is in favor of steadfast Iraq.
