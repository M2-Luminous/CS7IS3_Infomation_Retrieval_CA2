Chemical enzymatic synthesis and cloning of an artificial gene in E. coli which encodes the immunoactive peptide thymosin _a_[.sub]1[/] is reported. The semisynthetic gene of the mutant human tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in the pTNF3314 plasmid used earlier to construct hybrids with antigen determinants of the foot and mouth disease virus which contains a unique BamHI restrictase site in the C-terminal part meets all of the necessary requirements. A preliminary investigation of the biological properties of recombinant fusion proteins shows that the Thy-TNF fusion protein is characterized by complete biological activity of the tumor necrosis factor in a cytotoxicity test on transformed fibroblasts of L-929 mice while the TNF-Thy fusion protein is considerably less active. The findings confirm the earlier conclusions about the important role played by the C-terminal TNF segment in the biological (cytotoxic) activity manifestation. Thus, artificial genes which encode the TNF and thymosin _a_[.sub]1[/] hybrids are constructed, and their expression in E. coli and the properties of the proteins encoded by them are examined. The cytotoxicity of the fusion proteins is determined according to Meager, Leung, et al. The authors are grateful to V.Ye. Zhemchugov, O.A. Kaurov, A.A. Kolobov, and V.A.
