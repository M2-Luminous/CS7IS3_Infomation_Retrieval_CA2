From January to April this year, the total output value of state industrial enterprises increased by 4.7 percent over last year's same period. In April, the figure rose by 5 percent. No large-scale suspensions or partial halts in production were recorded for state enterprises during the period. A recent investigation carried out in 16 provinces and municipalities showed that the number of enterprises suspending production or operating below capacity accounted for only 10 percent of the total number of state-owned enterprises, with 4 percent actually having suspended production. An investigation in Beijing indicated that the proportion was even less, accounting for only 2 percent of the total number of state firms in the municipality. In the country as a whole, enterprises required to suspend production or operate below capacity were mostly small and medium-sized enterprises in coal and textiles industries. A number of factors have contributed to the adverse situation, including the excessive production capacity and unsalable products turned out by certain industries. In other cases, the operation of some enterprises has been handled improperly. Still others have been forced to close, suspend production, merge with other enterprises, or switch to the manufacture of other products in accordance with state industrial policies, or due to readjustment in each individual enterprise's organizational structure, or urban transformations projects. Some reports about the increasing losses of state-owned enterprises are false and misleading. Since last July, to facilitate the establishment of a socialist market economic structure, state-owned enterprises have implemented the General Rules on the Finance of Enterprises and the Norms of Enterprise Accounting which dovetail the international accounting system. They have included some expenses formally paid by enterprise profits, such as interest on long-term loans and salary and bonus increases, into their production cost. Simultaneously, in order to accelerate technical transformation, such enterprises have been allowed to raise their rate of depreciation on equipment. All of the measures have helped enterprises expand their decision-making power and are beneficial to their long-term development. Although the actual book profits of enterprise have come down, with the result that the narrow profit margins of some enterprises have turned into losses and the latent losses of some other enterprises have been switched into explicit losses, the actual returns of enterprises have increased. According to statistics released by the Ministry of Finance, between January and March this year, the cost outlays of enterprises increased 11 billion yuan due to disbursements recorded as costs, including items such as interest on loans for fixed assets, depreciation, bonuses, and welfare and educational fees. Counting 8.1 billion yuan of actual profits kept in account books, the amount of profits increased by 50 percent over last year's same period. The government plans to adopt measures to solve the problem of losses incurred by some enterprises. For those with poor management, a modern enterprise system will be instituted, with due emphasis placed on turning losses into profits by deepening the reform and changing operational mechanisms. At present, relevant departments under the State Council and governments at all levels are adopting measures to carry out the work. In an effort to alleviate the difficulties facing some state-owned enterprises and inspire them to change their operational mechanisms, the State Council has readjusted its credit policy toward industrial enterprises' circulating funds. The bank will provide loans to enterprises whose products enjoy a ready market even if they are currently suffering from losses or are in debt or are in arrears with payment of bank interest. However, it is prohibited from granting loans to enterprises with an excessive stock of unsalable products. With regard to the basic living expenses of employees in loss-making enterprises, the bank will provide loans, and local governments will also offer discounted interest on loans in order to ensure social stability. Enterprises which have no possibility for turning losses into profits will carry out procedures outlined in the Bankruptcy Law. Experiments will be carried out prior to nationwide implementation of the measures. At present, some state enterprises are plagued by a shortage of circulating funds due to their excessive investment scale and extensive participation in construction projects. In addition, some enterprises seek increased output by engaging in blind production, and as a result the sales volume for their products has plummeted, loans cannot be repaid on schedule, and serious mutual delinquencies have occurred. To solve these problems, the government will strictly control excessive investments in fixed assets and bulging consumption funds. Meanwhile, the principle of "limiting the production of overstocked commodities, reducing inventories and facilitating marketing" will be implemented. The State Council has authorized relevant department to join forces with the bank and other departments to terminate mutual arrears between enterprises. The fund shortage is expected to be gradually eliminated through the concerted efforts of governments at all levels and enterprises themselves.
