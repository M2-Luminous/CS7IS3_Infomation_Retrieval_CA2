Gohner, coordinator of the German aerospace sector, Harmut Mehdorn (DASA [Deutsche Aerospace]) proposed a 10-point plan for German industry. The German aerospace industry has redoubled efforts in recent months to reaffirm its identity and its spearhead role in Germany's future. Its voice is beginning to be heard, as evidenced at the forum last Monday at Petersberg in Konigswinter held at the initiative of Dr. Reinhard Gohner, state secretary for aerospace sector coordination. Dr. Gohner discussed the eight-point program that he had announced last October with a view to preserving the competitive potential of the industry, which he noted has been the beneficiary of government aid totaling an estimated 10 billion German marks [DM]. Dr. Wolfgang Piller, president of BDLI, argued brilliantly for Germany's need to retain a significant presence in the aerospace sector if the country wants to keep its current exemplary level of economic and social development. He noted that the United States and Japan provide effective support for their aerospace firms, recognizing the great importance of the latter in helping maintain a strategic global position. Aerospace is an especially good field for Europeans because it lends itself so well to industrial cooperation. This is demonstrated for example by Airbus Industrie group, with DASA just recently having proven its value again by meeting the production deadline for the A321, which Deutsche Lufthansa is putting into service within the next few days. Indeed, no major country's economy can afford to do without a "stimulant" like the aerospace industry. "If we neglect this sector, it will be others who decide our future for us," Dr. Piller concluded. Another speaker was the president of Deutsche Lufthansa, Dr. Jurgen Weber. Attendees were particularly keen to hear Dr. Weber's remarks at this critical economic juncture, when the air transport industry as a whole has lost $14 billion over the last 4 years. Weber does not expect orders to pick up substantially before the second half of the decade. Discussing the contribution air transport operators have made to the industry--"without Deutsche Lufthansa and Air France, there would be no Airbus Industrie"--he appealed to aircraft makers for reciprocity. He called on all the airlines' partners, including the airports, to cooperate with the airlines on cost-cutting measures, because "the worst is still ahead of us, and competition will get even tougher. Improvement can come only over the longer term, when the air transport industry comes to its senses." Mehdorn Plan Harmut Mehdorn, who heads DASA's aeronautics division, told attendees at the forum, which focused heavily on the manufacture of civilian and space aeronautics equipment, that military aircraft building is still the economic foundation of the aerospace industry. He laid out a 10-point plan for surmounting "the most serious crisis the industry has faced since the years just after the war [World War II]." For German industry to be able to retain its competitiveness, Mehdorn is asking annual appropriations of DM300-340 for the sector (including helicopters and equipment but not engines) and an equal amount of supplementary assistance, analogous to NASA disbursements. Such aid is indispensable for meeting competition from Boeing and compensating for the increased aid funneled to industries in the United States, Japan, and Asian and the CEI [Commonwealth of Independent States] countries. Mehdorn also calls for early finalization of the proposed FLA [Future Large Aircraft] military air transport and immediate allocation of a DM25 million per year aid package to promote technologies associated with the project. He demands confirmation of the Eurofighter 2000 project and faster transfer to industry of maintenance responsibilities for military aircraft. Support is also needed for technology projects and demonstrators that respond to needs in the marketplace. Conditions must be created within the GATT framework that enable the industry to withstand global competition. Finally, budgetary appropriations are needed for cooperation with the CEI countries. Better coordination of research investments with major professional colleges, research centers, and the university is indispensable. Lastly, a policy of stronger support for marketing activities, comparable to the practice in other countries, is necessary. And Mehdorn reminded the audience of President Clinton's commitment to Boeing. Dr. Reinhard Gohner, state secretary for the German aerospace sector, personally conducted this discussion with industry representatives from start to finish--in part to show government goodwill toward the sector but probably also to offset the disastrous impact of statements made by some of his colleagues, such as Messrs. Ruhe (Defense) and Kruger (Research). He constantly laid stress, as did most other participants, on the need to put development of German industry systematically into a European perspective--and above all a Franco-German perspective. Dr. Gohner called on the industry to submit a list of aerospace projects for which state support would be required. But he warned that new investment outlays cannot be expected before the 1995 budget, since the 1994 budget is already overloaded.
