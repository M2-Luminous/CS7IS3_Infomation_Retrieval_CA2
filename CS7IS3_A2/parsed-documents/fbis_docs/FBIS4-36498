On pages 2, 3, and 17 the paper publishes approximately 3,500 words of remarks by Hizballah Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah at a news conference held on 24 May to lash out at the kidnapping operation. On page 5 the paper publishes an approximately 550-word report on a statement issued by the Bloc of Loyalty to the Resistance [Hizballah's parliamentary group] condemning the kidnapping of al-Hajj Mustafa al-Dirani, "a symbol of the Believers Resistance." The statement says: "This cowardly operation was a blatant defiance and an impudent provocation against the resisting Lebanon. It also clearly reveals the policy of indifference being pursued by the authority regarding the country's primary issues, foremost being the political and military confrontation of the Zionist designs of hegemony." On the same page, the paper publishes an approximately 250-word report on an address delivered by scholar Ibrahim Amin al-Sayyid, chairman of the Bloc of Loyalty to the Resistance, during a memorial service. Having accused the state of inaction on the abduction of al-Dirani, al-Sayyid says: "The Lebanese people are no longer living under the protection of a state because it is incapable of achieving security and safeguarding the people's dignity." On page 6, AL-'AHD publishes an approximately 3,000-word text of a statement issued by representatives of the Lebanese and Palestinian nationalist and Islamic parties and forces at the end of their meeting held at the invitation of the Believers Resistance to discuss the Israeli "act of piracy" in kidnapping al-Hajj Mustafa al-Dirani, a leader of the Believers Resistance; the date of the meeting was not given. Among those attending the meeting was Hizballah Political Bureau Chairman al-Hajj Husayn al-Khalil and representatives of "the Socialist Arab Ba'th Party, the Progressive Socialist Party, the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, the Socialist Labor Party, the Nasirite Popular Organization, the Union Party, the Islamic Amal Movement, the Congress Party, Fatah Movement--the Revolutionary Council, the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, the Islamic al-Da'wah Party in Iraq, the Islamic Group, the Islamic Resistance Movement--Hamas, the detainees follow-up committee, the Muslim Ulema Council, the Jabal 'Amil Ulema Committee, the secular conference, and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine." The conferees issued a statement, which says in part: "The participants demand that the Lebanese Government adopt a stance commensurate with the popular position expressed by the conferees to withdraw from the settlement negotiations, which continue to represent a cover for ceaseless Zionist crimes and attacks." The statement adds that "the conferees stress the need for the authority to adopt the option of resistance in the face of the enemy's plans and to support our resisting people in all fields and domains for the sake of liberating the land and safeguarding the holy places." On page 7 AL-'AHD publishes approximately 1,000 words of statements by various Lebanese officials and deputies in reaction to the kidnapping operation. His Eminence Shaykh Zuhayr Kanj, member of the Muslim Ulema Council, "notes that the timing of the operation, just five days after Warren Christopher's visit to the region, indicates the State Department's involvement in the operation." He blames the local authority and the Lebanese Government for negligence toward "the act of piracy." Kanj calls on the prime minister to "resign immediately because he is no longer capable to run the country and because his policies have proved futile." On page 9 the paper publishes an approximately 700-word interview with Deputy al-Hajj Muhammad Yaghi, member of the Bloc of Loyalty to the Resistance, place and date not given. He condemns the kidnapping of al-Hajj al-Dirani and says: "We must tell the Lebanese authorities that after the Zionist act of piracy that dereliction and negligence on the part of the government toward the basic issues, including the confrontation of the Zionist enemy's schemes and plots, are unacceptable policies for which the government must be held accountable." Yaghi adds: "It is useless to lodge a complaint with the Security Council as long as the U.S. Administration is the international power broker and also the unrepentent supporter of Zionist terrorism." He adds: "The only useful recourse is to support the resistance with every available means because resistance is the only appropriate reply to the continuing aggression and arrogance." On the same page, AL-'AHD publishes an approximately 2,000-word political and security analysis by Ibrahim Shams-al-Din of the kidnapping operation. The writer refutes the Israeli objectives and excuses behind the kidnapping operation, noting that the kidnapping will not give Israel any information about the whereabouts of Israeli navigator Ron Arad, simply because al-Dirani knows nothing about the Israeli pilot. The writer then discusses the "principles that should be upheld by the government to eliminate the loopholes that contributed toward the success of the terrorist operation." Shams-al-Din adds: "It is necessary that the government change the list of its priorities and give precedence to the issue of liberation. The government should close the gaps through which the Zionists penetrate the homeland's security and sovereignty." Shams-al-Din goes adds that "the Lebanese authority should take sufficient interest in the cause of the Lebanese detainees held in Israeli prisons. The government should investigate the recent kidnapping operation and unveil the identity of the collaborators, who, according to various stories, guided the enemy forces to the landing spot and to roads leading to the house of al-Dirani."
