Addressing the 35th Congress of the Turkish Cypriot Engineers and Architects Chambers Union, Ozgur described the Cyprus problem as a curse for the whole of Cyprus and said that we must be rid of it. Pointing out that he regards the UN umbrella as the only alternative, Ozgur remarked, however, that the United Nations does have its weak points, which must be criticized. He said: But, we do not have another alternative. Notwithstanding its good and bad points, the United Nations is the only organization that can attempt to protect peace. This is the reality and we must be aware of it. Ozgur also noted that it is wrong to continuously display the attitude that the world does not understand us and that the world has been deceived. If the world fails to understand us, then we must seek the reasons for this, Ozgur stated, adding: We must be coolheaded, well-intentioned, and constructive if we are to explain our problems to the world. Recounting that the talks concerning the confidence-building measures followed a positive course until the last day and the Turkish Cypriot side displayed a flexible and constructive approach, Ozgur announced that the talks broke off when Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special representative in Cyprus, insisted on discussing how the Greek Cypriots will access Maras [Varosha] from the south of Magosa [Famagusta]. Ozgur expressed the belief that the wrong method can be rectified and the talks could resume. He said that his party joined the coalition on the basis of the principle that efforts should be exerted to achieve a federal solution within the framework of the 1977 and 1979 summit agreements, rather than on the basis of the argument that a nonsolution is also a solution. The government is conducting its work within this framework, Ozgur added. [passage omitted]
