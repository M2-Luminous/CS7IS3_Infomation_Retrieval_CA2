Belizaire, president of the Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion [ACP], has shouted: Meddling! In Belizaire's opinion, it is not up to U.S. Ambassador to Haiti William Lacy Swing to ask the parliamentarians elected on 18 January to respect the New York pact. The following is a report by Daly Valet: [Begin recording, in Creole] [Valet] The nation's political crisis has begun to deteriorate. The problems of the high cost of living and the blackouts have turned the country, especially Port- au-Prince, into a hell. If the political authorities fail to take action, there could be social explosions leading to civil war in Haiti. Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer has not ruled out this danger, because hunger drives the wolf out of the woods. The U.S. Government also is aware of the fact that the worst can happen if the country's political crisis continues. This is why William Lacy Swing, U.S. ambassador to Haiti, has turned into a malevolent, master voodoo priest [yon papa boko] who wishes to bring the zombies that the Governors Island agreement and New York pact constitute back to life. The ambassador has disinterred the dead bodies of these two political documents, and is asking all the signers to respect their signatures. Regarding the [contested] parliamentarians elected on 18 January, the U.S. ambassador is very firm: He has asked them to respect the New York pact, which requires them to abstain [from participating in parliamentary activity]. This has angered Dejean Belizaire. [Belizaire] To become senator, on 18 January 1993, I campaigned under the slogan: The nation's independence is in danger. We must defend it. So I can hardly understand how today I, a senator of the Republic and a Haitian citizen, could be in such a situation, to have to obey orders given by Mr. Swing. Dejean Belizaire is a legitimate citizen. The parliamentarians elected on 18 January are legitimate citizens. We are therefore telling the ambassador that he has gone too far in his meddling in the country's internal affairs. They may be able to give orders to President Aristide, but they cannot give orders to the senators elected on 18 January. [passage omitted] [Valet] The U.S. ambassador's statements have angered the entire group of legislators elected on 18 January. All of them have used nationalistic words to reply to the ambassador, and have spoken of meddling and violation of the senators' independence. Margareth Martin is even more radical in her reaction. Her main demands are that the New York pact be declared null and void, that the country's president be impeached, and [that] Article 149 [be implemented]. [passage omitted] [end recording]
