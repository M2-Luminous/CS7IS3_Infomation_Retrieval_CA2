"I think what has happened is that Russia, Europe and America have passed the stage of romanticism in post-totalitarian diplomacy when both sides embraced each other so tightly that national security interests were left aside," he said. "Russia increasingly sees itself as a great power and it has started saying this loudly. Europe has understood that Russian interests will no longer dissolve in the interests of European diplomacy. At the same time, I would not say we are talking about a cooling of relations," noted Kostikov. "I think it is good, it is right because it will save us from disappointments or even mistakes in the future and negotiations will have a sound pragmatic basis," he stressed.
