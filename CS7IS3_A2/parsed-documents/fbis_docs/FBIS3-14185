The U.S. Administration has spoken in positive words about Jordan and its balanced and responsible policy. Yet this administration has not translated these words into solid facts. It continues to besiege al-'Aqabah, the sole naval outlet of this country which has endured the results of all events and regional and international conflicts throughout the previous decades without any justification or legal pretext. Jordan for years has stood as a model state that knows its responsibilities on the national, pan-Arab, and international levels. It has continued to bear all the results of these responsibilities, in terms of its obligations toward the causes of the homeland and nation. It has continued to respect international norms, charters, and resolutions. Jordan has continued to bear the heaviest burden caused by regional developments, responsibility for which is shouldered by international and regional parties, led by the state of occupation and aggression, Israel. Ross's visit to Jordan is a suitable opportunity to remind him and the U.S. Administration about direct and indirect U.S. responsibility for many problems facing this country, which has a sensitive regional position. What is needed is to expedite the translation of positive U.S. words about Jordan and its role into practical results, foremost of which is lifting the siege imposed on al-'Aqabah, Jordan's only naval outlet. Ross's visit, which precedes the new round of negotiations on various tracks, is supposed to bring in new elements that justify the resumption of these negotiations, whose realization is blocked by Israel. Certainly, we do not expect the U.S. envoy to ask for any concessions from us so the negotiations will succeed. Otherwise, this would be as if he is asking us to unconditionally surrender in the face of Israel's intransigence. In addition to the fact that we do not accept capitulation -- no matter how much pressure we face -- it is an established fact that a peace that is not just and that doesn not meet the people's demands to restore their usurped rights will not last.
