We simply acted on the rule: Get up before your murderer and kill him first. It was a very successful action based on pinpointed air force activity and the precise intelligence we have lately had on Hizballah activity in the al- Biqa'. The outcome is several dozen terrorists killed -- apparently 30 -- and about 60 casualties. In response to that activity, Hizballah fired several Katyusha volleys on the western Galilee. In some areas of the north, inhabitants are spending the night in underground shelters and security rooms. We will deal with any developments as necessary. [Ben-David] Was the Katyusha shelling a violation of the understandings in Lebanon, and will the IDF respond to it? [Baraq] There is no doubt that Katyusha shelling inside Israel is a grave violation of the understandings reached after Operation Accountability. We have no interest in escalating the situation for its own sake. The blow Hizballah received is one of hardest it has sustained in recent years. If they continue to act against us, we will know what to do, and we have a wide range of measures to use. [Qol Yisra'el correspondent Karmela Menashe] Do you think that the attack in an area under Syrian control can lead to an escalation in relations with Syria? [Baraq] We attack Hizballah wherever they are. I am sure it is not the last time we will have to take action and make use of the IDF's long arm to strike Hizballah, even in areas under Syrian control. That does not violate our understandings of what we are permitted to do. In my view, the Syrians understand that Hizballah is not immune to attack anywhere.
