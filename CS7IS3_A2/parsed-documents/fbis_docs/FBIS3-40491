The ones planned to be introduced would be a Central Processing Unit (CPU) system incorporating over ten units of super row calculators combined with a graphic calculator and an operation work station. PNC already has introduced a Bechtel Computer System at the Information Center, at O-arai Engineer Center last year and this will be their second unit. The new unit will also be installed at the Center and it will be used for studies of underground waste disposal and severe event conditions for fast breeder reactors (FBRs). At the Information Center, a CPU with one Bechtel calculator has already been installed and assimilation of complex phenomena are being treated. However, with only one CPU, it is not always effective for timely assimilation. For example, in research and development of underground waste disposal, many calculation codes must be combined and an event is assimilated while basic understanding and evaluation must be made repeatedly. At the same time, models are formed and systems are developed, and accuracy must be raised. In such cases, while trial and error is being repeated, tremendous number of parameter surveys are being made while the calculation process is being confirmed by visual reappearance and at the same time, it is important that conditions be changed during calculation in order that the best condition be found. In this way, while calculating, results are made real and visual at the work station, but with the Bechtel computer, it is not effective in using methods to change and evaluate established conditions in the midst of a calculation. In contrast, with a CPU containing super rows of computers, it is possible to simultaneously process multiple calculation codes in rows at high speed. It is also possible to dynamically establish changes during operation and it has the advantage of being able to evaluate results realistically. At PNC, the assimilation is to be used for real evaluation analysis such as for heat flow power of FBRs and also for various kinds of phenomena occurring in underground waste disposal. The introduction will be decided within this fiscal year, installation is to be made next year, tests on the applicability of the existing software programs for row calculators will be investigated, and trial is planned for 1995. The present introduction has been approved under this year's revised budget and Science and Technology Agency has decided to introduce computers not only to PNC but to the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research and to National Aerospace Laboratory.
