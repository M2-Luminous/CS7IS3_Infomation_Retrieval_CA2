Fini told reporters at a meeting of his movement that he had spoken to Forza Italia (Go Italy) party leader Silvio Berlusconi by telephone after the TV magnate met Northern League leader Umberto Bossi in Milan. Following that meeting, Berlusconi claimed the prime ministership, making it understood that Bossi no longer opposed his holding it. The right-wing alliance of the Northern League, National Alliance and Forza Italia parties won a landslide victory in legislative elections on Sunday and Monday. Berlusconi and Bossi are due to meet again in Milan on Friday.
