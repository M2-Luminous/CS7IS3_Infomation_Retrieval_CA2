The Nigeria Airways plane took off from Ashdod Airport [as published] for Lagos, Nigeria. A fault was detected in one of its engines as it flew into Egyptian airspace. The plane requested permission to land at Cairo but the Egyptian authorities rejected it strongly so as not to be accused of offering any assistance to the military regime. After the Egyptian refusal, the Nigerian pilots applied to Larnaca Airport from which they immediately received ... [ellipses as published] permission to land. According to our information, the repairs that are needed are such that the cargo of ammunitions must be unloaded today to avert any danger. A strong police force reinforced by MMAD [Mobile Immediate Action Unit] men took strict security measures around the plane and nobody was allowed to go near it.
