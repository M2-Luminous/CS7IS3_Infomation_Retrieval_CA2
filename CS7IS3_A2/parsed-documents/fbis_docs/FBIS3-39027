Fishing is one of the sectors which are being shaken up by the globalization of trade. But unlike cereals, fishing was virtually ignored by our GATT negotiators. For the last 10 years, especially since Spain -- whose fishing fleet is Europe's largest -- joined the Common Market, fishing has mostly been dealt with from Brussels rather than Paris, Copenhagen, or Madrid. The European Commission proposes and enforces orientation prices for major species; it organizes market support; it ensures that structural adjustment aid packages do not turn into operating subsidies; it sets the exact size of fishing nets; it comes up with the idea of monitoring fishing boats via satellites; and it sets the quantities of fish each country is allowed to catch. Above all, commissioners are in charge of negotiating trade treaties with maritime countries such as Argentina or Russia and, in exchange for an authorization for European trawlers to operate in their waters, the products of such countries are granted preferential access in Europe. Since customs duties never exceed 18 percent (2 percent for salmon), they never really amount to a deterrent likely to bring tangible meaning to the principle of Community preference. Even within Europe, there is a strong bone of contention between countries with a substantial fishing industry (France, Spain) and Northern countries (united around Denmark, Britain, and the Netherlands). The latter have powerful fish processing industries and purchase mostly low-priced fish outside the European Union. Their commercial interests are opposed to those of the Paris-Madrid axis. This is why the requests which France regularly submits to the EU in the hope of obtaining guaranteed prices or a protective clause are greeted with caution by its partners, which fear that any interventionism, even temporary, will work counter to the free-trade philosophy. Nevertheless, the "European fishing community" needs to become stronger. Indeed, what is at stake in the negotiations with Scandinavian countries -- and especially Norway, whose well-managed waters remain well-stocked with fish -- is nothing short of crucial in the field of fishing. What a gain should Community waters extend as far as the Svalbard archipelago! But what will Britanny's David do when he has to face Scandinavia's Goliath?
