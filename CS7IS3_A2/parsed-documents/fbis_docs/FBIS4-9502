The distinguished Russian guest did not meet with President Ion Iliescu. Primakov's visit again finds Magureanu again in a state that has had precedence: The head of the Romanian counterintelligence service holds discussions -- in an unexplainable way -- not with his counterpart in the Russian Federation but with the head of the Intelligence Service in Moscow. Among the issues discussed, one can note Russia's involvement in the conflict in Bosnia and its repercussions on Romania. Other issues discussed by Primakov and Magureanu were terrorism, drug smuggling, and a relative "nonaggression treaty" between the SRI and the SVR. The Military Air and Naval Attache of the Russian Federation in Bucharest, Colonel Yevgeniy Smirnov, Declares That He Did Not See Yevgeniy Primakov Yesterday Confidential sources reported that on 22 April the lack of Primakov-Talpes and Primakov-Iliescu meetings raised certain already existing problems to the level of diplomatic difficulties. Yevgeniy Primakov's visit was in response to the visit recently paid by Virgil Magureanu to Moscow. Thus, it is certain that as a result of this visit there will be more evident disputes between Ion Iliescu and Virgil Magureanu. Last night we contacted Colonel Yevgeniy Smirnov, air and naval military attache of the Russian Federation to Bucharest, who said that he personally had not seen the SVR chief yesterday and that he represents the Russian defense minister and not Moscow's civil intelligence service. Yesterday, the only flight from Moscow that arrived at Otopeni Airport was the regular Aeroflot flight, which landed at 0930 and then took off at 1150. No other special plane arrived from Moscow yesterday. AFP Promptly Reports That For the First Time Since Ceausescu's Fall, a Head of the Russian Secret Services Visits Romania. Only two hours after the national news agency ROMPRES announced that the head of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service Yevgeniy Primakov paid a flash visit to Romania, AFP took the piece of news and disseminated it together with its normal news items. The news item broadcast by AFP mentions that Yevgeniy Primakov's visit was made at the invitation of SRI Director Virgil Magureanu and that this is the first such visit since Ceausescu's fall in December 1989. "The talks focused on the issue of fighting terrorism and organized crime" read the text of the official release, as is usually the practice in case of such meetings.
