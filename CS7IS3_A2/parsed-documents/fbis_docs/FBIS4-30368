Efforts to improve administrative procedures. Recently, the Government made public Resolution No. 38 on improving administrative procedures a step further. The resolution focuses on a number of domains that cause inconvenience as well as loss of time and money, hurt the people's feelings, and lead to serious negativism. This is a breakthrough in the national administrative reform program. Therefore, the people welcome the move and hope that effective measures will be taken to implement it. Initial research results from Hanoi Municipality and Ho Chi Minh City indicate that because administrative procedures pose a troublesome problem, citizens earnestly hope that urgent measures will be taken to improve them. Let me mention a number of examples. In Ho Chi Minh City, the establishment of a private business organization requires 32 types of documents and 53 signatures and a waiting period lasting at least from six months to a whole year. The application for an investment permit must go through 13 steps and often takes two years to complete. Some cases even take four years. In Hanoi, motorcycle registration requires as many as 54 types of documents. The re-registration of a state business establishment under Decree 388 costs as much as 30 or even 100 million dong. The government resolution on improving administrative procedures has put forth adequate measures to organize practical implementation. It is the government's policy to adopt urgent and resolute measures to achieve at all costs the goal of effecting a breakthrough in the working relations and ways of handling affairs between state agencies themselves, between state agencies and other units, and between state agencies and citizens. Therefore, ministries, sectors, administrative organs at all levels, and state agencies are requested to carry out this important resolution very seriously and regard its implementation as a key task. Let National Assembly deputies contribute suggestions and see ato it that administrative organs at all levels, state agencies, and civil servants implement this resolution seriously. In cases where National Assembly deputies also work as managers, more serious measures should be taken to implement this resolution. 4. Order and discipline in state management. To reach socioeconomic goals, one must necessarily mention the need for order and discipline in state management. Regrettably, there are indications of lack of serious order and discipline in state management and of deliberate attempts to act at variance with the law. I want to stress the most evident cases of failure to seriously implement regulations on fighting corruption, smuggling, and wasteful spending. Let me mention a number of examples. The government has issued very strict regulations on timber exports. Nonetheless, there is no indications that illegal timber exports have ended. A number of provincial people's committees has legalized hundreds of smuggled cars or reduced tax rates at their convenience. Other provincial people's committees have claimed that their cars should be dutyfree because they are gifts. Actually, this is nothing but an attempt to buy cars and resell them for a profit. In some provinces, customs officials have fixed motorcycle import fees at their convenience and collected hundreds of millions of dong for their agencies. Some provinces have granted import licenses for explosives at their convenience. Dozens of state-operated corporations have imported motorcycles before applying for licenses, and so forth. It is necessary to bear in mind that whatever the motives and even if such moves are part of collective policies, heads of the sectors concerned and chairpersons of provincial people's committees must bear responsibility before the government and the prime minister of the government for violations against the law. Because our legal system is not perfect, continued efforts are being made to supplement and develop it. It is not correct to say that we have no law at all. It is worth noting that regarding the legal system currently in effect, many sectors and localities still fail to comply with it in a serious manner. It is necessary to stress again that heads of sectors and chairpersons of local people's committees must bear responsibility before upper echelons for the observance of law and for the restoration of order and discipline in the sectors and localities under their charge. First of all, it is necessary to implement very seriously regulations on finance, the use of capital, and expenditure. Agencies and units must discover corruption and smuggling cases on a voluntary basis. They must also inform organs of control and inspection of those cases so they can probe into wrongdoings and take punitive measures, including action specified under the criminal code. It is prohibited to retain cases of violations for internal action because such a move will lead to injustice and cause indignation among the masses. Law enforcement agencies must step up inspection and supervision. This applies first of all to the inspection system. Immediate arrangements must be made to carry out inspection in the sector and locality under one's charge. It is necessary to achieve close coordination among agencies to ensure serious implementation of laws and regulations without inconveniencing or affecting production and business operations. May I suggest that our National Assembly deputies step up management and supervision and, together with cadres and administrative organs, set a good example for other people to follow in observing law and in ensuring order and discipline. The above is a number of tasks that I would like to stress one more time. May I suggest that National Assembly deputies, leaders of the front and mass organizations, and comrades in charge of sectors and administrative organs at all levels keep those tasks in mind and contribute to directing their implementation to guarantee success for our set socioeconomic development goals. I would like to thank and wish our National Assembly deputies good health.
