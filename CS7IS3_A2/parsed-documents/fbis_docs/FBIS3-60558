The department announced that 126,000 units of blood products manufactured by UB Plasma, of Koblenz, had been bought by the National Health Service. Last year Britain imported 120,000 doses of a product to boost immunity. Since 1989 the NHS has bought 6,000 doses of albumin, also made by UB Plasma, to treat severe blood loss. ``Because of the length of time, it must be assumed that some of these batches have been used,'' a department spokesman said last night. The other countries which have decided to withdraw suspect blood products are France, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Austria, the Czech Republic and Greece. At the same time the Greek health ministry said it would take legal action against the German exporters of possibly untested plasma. It is feared that suspect products may also have reached the Middle East. Remaining stocks in Britain are being urgently recalled by Immono, an Austrian company which bought the consignment from Germany and exported it here, said the department spokesman. ``However, we are absolutely sure that these stocks were batch-tested by the National Institute for Biological Standards, Testing and Control and there was no trace of HIV,'' he said. The recall was ``purely precautionary and is to ensure total patient safety''. Authorities are seeking to establish how many doses of the immunity booster Gammabulin have been used. People with impaired immune systems or those travelling abroad and at risk of hepatitis would have been among those intramuscularly injected. The other product -- Human Albumin Solution, 4.5 per cent -- would be used in any situation in which blood was lost in quantity, such as accidents, surgery or a complicated birth. The spokesman said: ``There is no evidence that HIV has been transmitted by these two products. We are self-sufficient in blood and plasma and we do import blood products which are licensed by the Medicines Control Agency.'' Britain does not import blood -- only blood products. Since 1985, when the risks of spreading HIV were realized, all blood factors have been heat-treated. Mr David Blunkett, Shadow Health Secretary, urged the Government to make a clear statement to allay fears. Dr Harold Gunson, director of the National Blood Authority, said: ``British patients can be reassured that this blood in England and Scotland is the safest that one can have in the world. ``We have been fully testing all our blood since 1985 for HIV.'' But he added: ``We do import some final purified plasma products.'' He did not know whether any had come from Germany. British military authorities in Germany urged the small number of people treated in German hospitals in emergencies in the past 10 years to have themselves tested if they were worried. Pentagon officials issued similar instructions to US Servicemen in Germany. In Germany, where blood donations are paid for and where a number of people connected with UB Plasma have been arrested, there is evidence that the health ministry is uncertain of the extent of the spread of suspect products. When the scandal broke a month ago, the semi-autonomous Federal Health Agency was dissolved for failing to pursue evidence that UB Plasma had flooded the market with possibly untested blood products. Then on Thursday it was alleged that the firm had knowingly released ``slightly infected'' blood on to the market.
