Lubbers described the election of ANC leader Mandela to South African president as a moving event "at the start of a wonderful future." The outgoing prime minister was speaking at a joyful reception at the South African Embassy in The Hague. [passage omitted] Lubbers said that "the word apartheid has always been an open wound in the Netherlands. What could we do about it? From the left to the moderate right, there was an agreement: We had to do something. Now there is joy in our hearts. We belong together. We need no longer feel shame because of that word. But all is not achieved today. The world must help South Africa to maintain peace. For us too, much remains to be done. That is my pledge for the future."
