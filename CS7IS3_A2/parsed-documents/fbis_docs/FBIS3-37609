The meeting analysed the fulfilment of the presidential decree to settle the Ossetian-Ingush conflict and also the reasons why the implementation of several provisions of this document is being dragged out. The participants of the meeting mapped out agreed actions to ensure the practical reduction of tension in the region. In Filatov's opinion, the number of "sore spots" in Russia was diminishing in spite of the difficult economic situation. "The adoption of the new Russian Constitution," the head of the Presidential Administration stressed, "has laid the foundation for further social stabilisation in the country." "The strength of a state," he added, "depends on its unity and indivisibility, by concord among all the subjects of the Federation making it up. Therefore, the work of every regional leader should be assessed by what he has done to strengthen the Russian statehood and to resolve regional problems on its basis." The meeting noted with concern that the settlement of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict was complicated by differing approaches and a frequent desire "to grab all the pie". Filatov told the meeting that President Yeltsin's address to the Russian Federal Assembly (parliament), scheduled for February 24, would contain a package of comprehensive measure to strengthen the Russian state.
