[Begin recording of Social Democratic Party of Japan Chairman Tomiichi Murayama] The current Diet session has been extended to 29 January this year. The political reform bills should be passed in the Diet by that date, and the most important task I will have to accomplish is to have the bills passed in the Diet. I believe it would be good if both ruling and opposition parties find areas of agreement in revising the bills when they deliberate them. The matters of principle, especially corporation contributions, on which the ruling parties agreed whey they formed the coalition government, cannot be subject to deals between ruling and opposition parties. [end recording] In this way, Chairman Murayama indicated that his party would not go along with any call for revising the prohibition in the bills on the corporate contributions. [Begin recording of Shinseito representative Tsutomu Hata] After concluding that if Japan's politics remain unchanged as it has been, Japan would be unable to fulfill its responsibility in the international community, we have decided to reform even the current electoral system as part of the political reform. Some are arguing, however, that priority must be given to the prevention of political corruption and stimulus measures. I think the argument is ridiculous and out of the question. [end recording] [Begin recording of Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa] I hope that this year, we will achieve our long-standing goal of carrying out political reform. This year, I will do my best and work hard while refraining from making rash remarks. [laughs] [end recording] [Begin recording of Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa] The opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] is attempting to collapse the political reform by boycotting the deliberations of political reform bills in the Diet. I think that we should fight against the LDP's attempt. [end recording] [passage omitted on remarks by officials of other parties]
