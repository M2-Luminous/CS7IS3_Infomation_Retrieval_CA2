Several other companies, including French aircraft builders and a Swiss manufacturer, have considered cancelling their stands at the event. British Aerospace [BAe] said it would not participate in the continent's premier air exhibition because Modise "made quite clear" to the Gompany's South African representative that "an exhibition of defence equipment would break the United Nations arms embargo" against South Africa, which is still in place. BAe was planning to show its Hawk jet trainer system, of which it has sold close to 800 aircraft to the U.S. Navy, the Zimbabwean, Kenyan, and other air forces worldwide. Aware that the South African Air Force is currently investigating potential replacements for its aging Impala trainer, the company was keen to show its system at the bi-annual air salon. Buying the Hawk, argues BAe, would allow Atlas Aircraft Corporation and Denel to pitch for maintenance work for other African air forces. BAe was to have displayed a full-scale model of the Hawk, said the company's representative in South Africa, Robbie Roberts. "But of course we were in a bit of a predicament when the good Modise said forget the future if you come to this show." Modise is widely tipped to play a major role in military affairs in future, either as minister of defence or chief of the defence force. In either positions, he would be key to any large-scale procurement decisions, including the purchase of jet trainers. Observers have expressed surprise at Modise's apparent determination to see the arms embargo adhered to, despite its imminent demise. But ANC spokesperson Gill Marcus explained that the organisation felt "that South Africa's policy on arms should only be looked at once the UN embargo has been lifted". That will happen only after the elections. Other European manufactures were also approached, via their embassies in Pretoria. According to French sources, the first call from Modise was rather unspecific and seemed to suggest the ANC was opposed to Aviation Africa '94 as a whole. The embassy was told "it would be insensitive to be represented at the air show", without being told specifically whether this referred to civil or military participation in the event. A subsequent letter from foreign affairs chief Thabo Mbeki said there had been a misunderstanding, and that civil aircraft were welcome. But French manufacturers, including Airbus Industrie, Aerospatiale, and Eurocopter France, met in Paris early this week to consider withdrawing completely from the show. It is understood they agreed to participate, showing only civilian aircraft. Swiss manufacturer Pilatus, which produces short take-off spotter aircraft and recently sold replacements for the obsolete Harvard trainer to the SAAF [South African Air Force], is also rumoured to be considering withdrawing from the air show after an approach from Modise. Aviation Africa '94 organiser Lynn Brown said she had been in touch with the ANC's foreign affairs department, which had "expressed support for the show, but asked us to remind all participants of the UN arms embargo". But press information issued by the organisers still refers to "a number of local and international exhibitors" which "will be exhibiting military hardware, including Denel's Rooivalk [red falcon]". Czech manufacturer Aero, which built MiG fighters until 1972 for the Warsaw Pact air forces and which currently has light attack aircraft in its manufacturing programme, is featured in publicity material for Aviation Africa '94.
