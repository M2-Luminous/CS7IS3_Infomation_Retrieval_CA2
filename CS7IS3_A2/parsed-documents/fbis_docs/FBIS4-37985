Staff Brigadier Haytham Qasim Tahir, appointed as Defense Minister in the Democratic Republic of Yemen, which was unilaterally announced in south Yemen on 20 May, told Al-SHARQ AL-AWSAT in a telephone interview: "We have presented an initiative to form an international observer team to monitor implementation of the cease-fire and the withdrawal of northern troops to their position prior to the eruption of the fighting." He stressed he would "Not give up one inch of the lands of the Democratic Republic of Yemen." He described human, weapons and equipment losses as being "small and limited among the military circles in the southern army. As for the civilians, the losses are great because the battles took place on our lands and because northern troops launched a deliberate random and barbaric missile, air and artillery attacks on towns and villages, including the capital Aden, which caused the death and wounding of hundreds of defenseless and innocent people."
