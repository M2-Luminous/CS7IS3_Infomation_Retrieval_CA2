It has been learned, however, that China is playing an active mediating role. Zhang Tingyan, Chinese ambassador to the ROK, visited Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong today and reportedly told him that the Chinese Government is actively engaged in persuading North Korea and requested that the Governments of the ROK and the United States deal with the North Korean claims with flexibility. Ambassador Zhang Tingyan reportedly said that, according to what the Chinese Government has found out, North Korea has not replaced the fuel rods yet and asked that negotiations to resolve the nuclear issue continue. Ambassador Zhang Tingyan's visit to the Foreign Ministry was made at the request of the Chinese side so he would explain the contact between the North Korean and Chinese Governments. Because it has been revealed that the Chinese Government is actively mediating between North Korea, the ROK, and the United States, negotiations over the nuclear issue, which have run into difficulties because of the North Korean refusal to replace and safekeep fuel rods, are likely to reach a compromise without dashing toward a catastrophe. Meanwhile, the ROK and the United States are said to be planning to propose to North Korea that the matter of fuel rods inspection, which North Korea rejects, be solved at the third round of U.S.- North Korean talks without making issue of it any more at the present stage. It has been reported that the ROK and the United States are planning to disclose their position to begin additional inspections and technological inspections on North Korea around the end of this week and to hold the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks immediately after that.
