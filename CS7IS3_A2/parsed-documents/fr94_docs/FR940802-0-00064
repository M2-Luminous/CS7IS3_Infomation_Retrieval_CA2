FR940802-0-00064 FR940802-0-00008 (ii) 7.0 psi or less in the case of gasoline intended for use on or after March 1, 1996. (i) Special provisions for shoulder season. (1) The Governor of any state may petition for an extension of the non-commingling season for any or all reformulated gasoline covered areas within the state pursuant to §80.70. (i) Such petition must satisfy the following criteria: (A) Evidence showing an increase in the market share and/or use of oxygenates which produce commingling-related RVP increases in the area(s) that are covered by the petition; (B) Evidence demonstrating a pattern of exceedances for the period for which the extension is sought, including ozone monitoring data for the preceding three(3) years of the reformulated gasoline program; (C) An analysis showing that the pattern of ozone exceedances is likely to continue even with implementation of other ozone air quality control measures and/or programs currently planned by the State; and (D) Evidence that the responsible State agency or authority has given the public an opportunity for a public hearing and the submission of written comments with respect to the petition. (ii) Effective data and publication of decision. (A) If the Administrator determines that the petition meets the requirements of paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, then EPA shall publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing its intention to establish the non-commingling season as requested by the Governor, and specifying a tentative effective date. (1) The Administrator shall provide the public with an opportunity for a hearing and the submission of written comments. (2) The tentative effective date will correspond with the first day of the next complete non-commingling season beginning not less than one year after receipt of the petition. (B) If the Administrator receives adverse comments or information demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the criteria of paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section have not been met, that the tentative effective date is not reasonable, or that other good reasons exist to deny the petition, then the Administrator may reject the Governor's request for an extended non-commingling season, in whole or in part, or may delay the effective date by up to two (2) additional years. Absent receipt of such adverse comments or information, EPA shall publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing its approval of the petition and specifying an effective date for the extended non-commingling season. (2) In the case of any refiner that produces RBOB, or any importer that imports RBOB, the oxygenate that is blended with the RBOB may be included with the refiner's or importer's compliance calculations under paragraph (d) of this section only if: (i) The oxygenate meets the applicable renewable oxygenate definition under paragraph (a) of this section; and (ii) In the case of RBOB designated for ``non VOC controlled ether only'' the refiner or importer assumes that ETBE or other oxygenate that does not exhibit volatility-related commingling effects when mixed with other gasolines and approved by the EPA Administrator under subparagraph (a)(3) of this section will be blended with the RBOB and so labels the transfer documentation. 6. Section 80.128 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (e)(2); removing ``and'' at the end of paragraph (e)(4); removing the period at the end of paragraph (e)(5) and adding ``; and'' in its place; and adding paragraph (e)(6) to read as follows: §80.128 Agreed upon procedures for refiners and importers. * * * * * (a) Read the refiner's or importer's reports filed with EPA for the previous year as required by §§80.75, 80.83(g), and 80.105. * * * * * (e) *␣*␣* (2) Determine that the requisite contract was in place with the downstream blender designating the required blending procedures, or that the refiner or importer accounted for the RBOB using the assumptions in §80.69(a)(8) in the case of RBOB designated as ``any oxygenate,'' or ``ether only,'' or using the assumptions in §§80.83(c)(1)(ii) (A) and (B) in the case of RBOB designated as ``any renewable oxygenate,'' ``non VOC controlled renewable ether only,'' or ``renewable ether only''; * * * * * (6) In the case of RBOB designated as ``any renewable oxygenate,'' ``non VOC controlled renewable ether'' or ``renewable ether only'', review the documentation from the producer of the oxygenate to determine if the oxygenate meets the requirements of §80.83(a). * * * * * 7. Section 80.129 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (d)(3) (iii) and (iv), and by adding paragraph (d)(3)(v) to read as follows: §80.129 Agreed upon procedures for downstream oxygenate blenders. * * * * * (a) Read the oxygenate blender's reports filed with the EPA for the previous year as required by §§80.75 and 80.83(g). * * * * * (d) *␣*␣*␣* (3) *␣*␣*␣* (iii) In the case of RBOB designated as ``any renewable oxygenate,'' ``non VOC controlled renewable ether only,'' or ``renewable ether only,'' review the documentation from the producer of the oxygenate to determine if the oxygenate meets the requirements of §80.83(a); (iv) Recalculate the actual oxygen content based on the volumes blended and agree to the report to EPA on oxygen; and (v) Review the time and place designations in the product transfer documents prepared for the batch by the blender, for consistency with the time and place designations in the product transfer documents for the RBOB (e.g., VOC-controlled or non-VOC-controlled, VOC region for VOC-controlled, OPRG versus non-OPRG, and simple or complex model). * * * * * [FR Doc. 94&hyph;17649 Filed 8&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P
