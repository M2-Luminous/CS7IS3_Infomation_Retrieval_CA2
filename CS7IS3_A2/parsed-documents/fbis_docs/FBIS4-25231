Kim Yong-nam said that regarding the nuclear issue, the Western countries, especially the United States, have conducted an oppressive policy toward the DPRK -- which is regarded as the country that does not obey them -- but instead conducted a policy of overlooking the behaviors of other countries that are regarded as their friends. Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam also said that the DPRK is now considering Russia's proposal to hold an international conference attended by the United States, Russia, China, Japan, ROK, and DPRK to resolve the Korean nuclear issue. On the same day, U.S. President Clinton, who is visiting European countries, expressed the hope that the DPRK would change its view of the nuclear issue, and that it could avoid economic sanctions by the international community by reconsidering accepting the International Atomic Energy Agency's inspections of the DPRK nuclear facilities.
