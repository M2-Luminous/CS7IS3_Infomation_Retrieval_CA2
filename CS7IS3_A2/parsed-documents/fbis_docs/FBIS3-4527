The president arrived in Moscow on Sunday [27 March] for his first official visit to Russia. In Moscow, Nazarbayev held a one-to-one summit meeting with Yeltsin and met with Russian parliament leaders Vladimir Shumeyko, the speaker of the upper house, and Ivan Rybkin, the speaker of the lower house. The two countries signed 23 bilateral documents including agreements on cooperation in political, economic and military areas. The most important was the signing of the agreement on the disputed Baikonur Cosmodrome, a major missle-launch site of the former Soviet Union, now located in Kazakhstan. This document provides for leasing the cosmodrome to Russia for 20 years, with provisions for a 10 year extension. Russia will pay Kazakhstan 115 million U.S. dollars a year, and the cosmodrome will be considered Russian territory and Russian laws will be applied exclusively for the full duration of the leasing period. The accord is generally viewed as beneficial to both sides. Kazakhstan cannot afford to operate Baikonur alone, because it has neither the money nor the specialists to do so. For Russia, it will be years before its new cosmodrome is operational for manned missions. The Baikonur, also the largest space center in the world, was jointly built by the former Soviet republics. The first launch was made there on October 4, 1957. Four years later, on April 12, 1961, the space center sent the first manned spaceship into orbit. Dispute over the future of Baikonur began in earnest last summer, when Kazakhstan expressed its readiness to transform the cosmodrome into an international space port. This idea left no room for Russia to service and maintain the complex for all space launches. In a speech in Moscow, Nazarbayev also urged the CIS nations to create a "Euro-Asian Union" with a single currency and supra-national bodies to coordinate economic, defense and foreign policy. "If this fails to gain broad support within the CIS, it could be formed by Russia and Kazakhstan," he said in a veiled warning to other CIS members not to dismiss his initiative out of hand. Nazarbayev, whose huge country is one of the most powerful in the CIS because of its vast untapped energy reserves and its political stability, fist floated the idea of a Euro-Asian Union two years ago when the CIS was in its infancy. Observers here believe his revival of the idea now, just over two weeks before a scheduled CIS summit in Moscow on April 15, assumed greater weight given Kazakhstan's growing profile and the CIS's failure to forge any common policies. However, Russia's attitude towards the proposal was not immediately known. Up to now, most former Soviet republics have rejected any proposal for creating supra-national bodies. The Kazakh leader told reporters on Tuesday that Yeltsin had responded "positively" to the idea of a Euro-Asian Union during their talks. Commenting on the results of Nazarbayev's Moscow trip, a Kazakh diplomat working in Moscow said that "both presidents expressed their satisfaction" over the visit.
