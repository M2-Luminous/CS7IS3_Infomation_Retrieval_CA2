The Air Force, in line with the document's guidelines, has just started to reorganize its command structure. The goal is to draw a clearer distinction between the responsibilities for conducting operations and the so-called organic responsibilities of preparation and troop support. From now on there will be two operational commands and five organic commands. The operational commands will be: -- The Strategic Air Force (FAS), directed by Air Corps General Roger Mathieu; -- The Air Defense and Air Operations Command (CDAOA), still directed by Air Corps General Francois Vallat, which will lead defensive and offensive air operations. The five organic commands will be: -- The Combat Air Force (FAC), replacing the Tactical Air Force (FATAC) but with the same mission responsibilities, commanded by Air Corps General Bernard Nortain; -- The Projection Air Force (FAP), which will take over from the Military Air Transport Command (COTAM), directed by Air Division General Alain Bernier; -- The Academy Command, directed by Air Corps General Pierre Warme; -- The Air Commandos Command (no longer just a group) directed by Colonel Michel Chabot; -- The Air Command for Surveillance, Information, and Communication (CASSIC), which will bring together at Villacoublay the former Transmission Command and the organic section of the former Air Defense Command.
