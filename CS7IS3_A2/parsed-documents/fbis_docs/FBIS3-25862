"We will try to win the support of US companies through non- governmental channels," said Zheng Hongye, Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT). Last year more than 300 big American corporations demanded that the US Government extend China's MFN status without political conditions. The US Government will decide whether to extend China's status for another year in June. "To keep the trade status will not be an easy task," Zheng admitted. "Although there will be twists and turns on this issue, we are confident that China will retain the status." No country can ignore China's huge potential market, he said. China's total imports reached $103,95 billion last year. Zheng said that the US Government should solve the issue of China's status once and for all because it affects not only Sino- American economic ties but also political relations. This year CCPIT will intensify its non-governmental economic and trade exchanges and co-operative work with Western countries. Meanwhile, CCPIT will actively try to set up economic ties with countries that have no diplomatic relations with China, Zheng said, A business delegation is now visiting Latin American countries, including Paraguay and Honduras, to improve mutual understanding. Promoting economic co-operation between the mainland and Taiwan is one of CCPIT's priorities this year, Zheng said. Last year CCPIT hosted 15 Taiwan delegations comprising more than 300 businessmen. Although people from many circles on the mainland have visited Taiwan businessmen are still not allowed to enter the island. Zheng said CCPIT will try to arrange the first visit by a mainland business delegation to Taiwan sometime this year. CCPIT also plans to hold a mainland commodities exhibition in Taiwan and invite Taiwanese companies to attend trade fairs on the mainland.
