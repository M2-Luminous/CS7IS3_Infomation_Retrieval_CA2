FR940627-0-00191 FR940627-0-00019 (ii) May be compiled while gathering internal control data during emissions characterization studies on the manufacturer's non-baseline or atypical product; or (iii) May be obtained from various manufacturers in the course of their testing different additive(s) belonging to the same fuel family, or in the testing of a base fuel serving as representative of the baseline group for the respective fuel family. (e) Data bases. The literature search must include the results of searching appropriate commercially available chemical, toxicologic, and environmental databases. The databases shall be searched using, at a minimum, CAS numbers (when applicable), chemical names, and common synonyms. (f) Search period. The literature search shall cover a time period beginning at least thirty years prior to the date of submission of the reports specified in §§79.59(b) through (c) and ending no earlier than six months prior to the date on which testing is commenced or reports are submitted in compliance with this subpart. (g) References. Information on base fuel emission inventories may be found in references in paragraphs (b)(5)(i) through (xi) of this section, as well as in the following: (1) Auto/Oil Air Quality Improvement Research Program, Technical Bulletin #1 , December 1990.

(a) Generally. Subject to the provisions of §79.53(b) through (d), the combustion emissions of each fuel or fuel additive subject to testing under this subpart must be tested in accordance with each of the testing guidelines in §§79.60 through 79.68, except that fuels and additives in the methane and propane fuel families (pursuant to §79.56(e)(1)(v) and (vi)) need not undergo the Salmonella mutagenicity assay in §79.68). Similarly, subject to the provisions of §79.53(b) through (d), the evaporative emissions of each designated evaporative fuel and each designated evaporative fuel additive subject to testing under this subpart must be tested according to each of the testing guidelines in §§79.60 through 79.67 (excluding §79.68, Salmonella typhimurium Reverse Mutation Assay).
