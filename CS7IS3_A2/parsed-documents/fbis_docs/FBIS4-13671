He was identified as Shahar Simani, age 20, of Ashqelon. The funeral will take place in Ashqelon this afternoon. Details from Tzvi Pantanowitz: [Begin Pantanowitz recording] Shahar Simani's body was found in a wadi near the Arab village of Bayt Hanina, on the northern edges of Jerusalem. He had been stabbed several times in the back. A local resident found the body and summoned the police around 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon. Police and its special criminal investigation unit have been working around the clock to try to establish what happened. They say that the soldier was killed some 20 hours before the body was found and that he obviously struggled fiercely with his captors before he was murdered. The alarm was given by Simani's girlfriend, a resident of Moshav Massu'ot Yitzhaq near Ashqelon, yesterday morning. She said that Simani had telephoned at about 8 PM on Wednesday to say he was on his way to her from Beersheba after leaving his base in the south, where he was training to be an officer. It is thought that he took a bus to the Qastina junction from where he may have hitchhiked to Massu'ot Yitzhaq, about 10 km away. Security authorities think he was picked up by hostile elements. They are puzzled by the fact that the body was dumped so far away and are considering the possibility he was kidnapped in a car with Israeli license plates. Security forces have noted also that although his personal weapon disappeared, his identity tag and Army identity card were not taken -- moves common to the actions of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]. In addition, no terror group has so far claimed responsibility. The authorities are seeking witnesses who may have seen Simani getting into a car on Wednesday night. Prime Minister Rabin last night said that the soldier had been murdered by the enemies of peace, who were continuing to strike at Israelis in an attempt to strengthen those in Israel who were deluding themselves that halting the peace talks would stop the killing. Continued rule over another people would only increase terror, Rabin said. With all the pain involved, Israel would continue to fight extremist terrorism and to negotiate for peace. Shahar Simani, who was completing an officer's course, was promoted posthumously to the rank of second lieutenant. [end recording]
