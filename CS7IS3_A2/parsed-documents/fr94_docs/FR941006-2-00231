Metric Equivalent of the Federal Bridge Formula The Federal Bridge Formula found in 23 U.S.C. 127 is an integral part of the limits placed on vehicle weight. The Bridge Formula in English units is as follows: E:GRAPHICSEN06oc94.013 W=The maximum weight in pounds that can be carried on a group of two or more axles to the nearest 500 pounds. L=The distance in feet between the outer axles of any two or more consecutive axles. N=The number of axles being considered. Because the statute requires the use of English units to calculate Bridge Formula limits, a metric formula is not really possible. However, appendix A reproduces in English and the equivalent metric units the weight table generated by the Bridge Formula. The values in this table reflect the FHWA's policy of rounding down when calculated weights fall exactly halfway between 500-pound increments. Because the Bridge Formula is designed to protect the highway infrastructure, the agency has determined that this conservative policy is consistent with the statutory mandate. Congress decided to adopt the metric system nearly 20 years ago. A notice of proposed rulemaking would serve no purpose since conversion to that standard is the policy of the United States. There may be errors in the data published in this notice, however, and the FHWA has therefore established a docket to receive technical comments on these provisions. The interpretations will be corrected as necessary, and in case of omissions, consideration will be given to additional interpretations. (Sec. 123, Pub.
