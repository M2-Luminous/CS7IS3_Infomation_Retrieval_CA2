(Zhen Guobang), a spokesman for the PRC Foreign Ministry, said this to reporters yesterday [28 March] after talks between President Kim Yong-sam and PRC President Jiang Zemin. He made it clear that China has no intention of pressuring North Korea on the nuclear issue, saying that China has made efforts in its own way, but the role it can play is restricted and that, since North Korea is a sovereign country, no other country is in the position of telling or requiring it to do anything.
