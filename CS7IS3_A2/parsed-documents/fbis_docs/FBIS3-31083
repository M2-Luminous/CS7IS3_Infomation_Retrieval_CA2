Just before his departure Kontic said that there are a number of reasons for his visit to New York. [passage omitted] "We will use our stay in New York to contact top UN officials, particularly UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali and his aides, as well as officials of various UN agencies." According to Kontic the main topic of the talks will be the NATO ultimatum and the threat to bomb the Bosnian Serbs. "We will discuss this issue from two aspects. One of them is the position and the role of the United Nations in adopting concrete decisions on air strikes, and the other aspect is the consequences and dangers for the peace process and a possible escalation of the war if NATO threats are realized." "Of course, an unavoidable topic in the United Nations will be the sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the humanitarian aid, and the reintegration of our state in the system of the United Nations and the international community." [passage omitted] Recalling the NATO ultimatum, Kontic concluded: "I do not believe that there is one serious reason at this moment for NATO to realize its threats and bomb the Bosnian Serbs. I believe that the purpose of this visit to New York is to help ease the tension."
