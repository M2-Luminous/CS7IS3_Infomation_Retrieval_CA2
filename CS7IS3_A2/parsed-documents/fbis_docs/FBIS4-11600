FBIS4-11600 "drlat083_l_94009" FBIS-LAT-94-083 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 Bolivia Minister: Road Blockade `Failed' Minister: Road Blockade `Failed' PY2904034794 La Paz Radio Fides Network in Spanish 0130 GMT 29 Apr 94 PY2904034794 La Paz Radio Fides Network Spanish BFN [Text] According to government officials, today's road blockade has failed. Social Communications Minister Ernesto Machicado said that roadblocks were set up only in some parts of the country: [Begin Machicado recording] Our overall impression is that as a whole, the 10 national highways were not cut off by roadblocks. However, I am now going to itemize the roadblocks that were set up along specific points of the highways. This morning I reported that a roadblock was set up in (Puentevilla), in the Yungas region. This roadblock lasted all day long. Roadblocks were set up all morning on the railroad tracks in Oruro Department. Railroad tracks were also blockaded nearby Vilavila. A roadblock was set up in Villa Tunari, in Cochabamba Department. However, it is important to note that this part of the highway is being repaired, because it was damaged. Therefore, a few days ago National Road Service closed transit through this highway. Therefore, this roadblock did not have any impact whatsoever on traffic. In Santa Cruz Department, roadblocks were set up in (Pomarapa) during the morning; and also in La Angostura up to 2100 GMT. In Chuquisaca Department, roadblocks were set up all day long in Luis Calvo Province, in (?Monteburro) and Muyupampa. As we have already reported, in Potosi Department roadblocks were set up at the (Cruce de Machas) intersection and (?Petanzos). Both of these roadblocks were dispersed this afternoon. In Tarija Department, all (?streets) were blocked throughout the morning. These are specific areas. As I reported beforehand, if we review the situation of roads nationwide, we can conclude there was no generalized blockade of national highways. [end recording]
