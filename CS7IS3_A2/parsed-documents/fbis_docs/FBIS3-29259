FBIS3-29259 "dreas032_d_94013" FBIS-EAS-94-032 Document Type:Daily Report 16 Feb 1994 South Korea Papers Speculate on Dellums' Trip SK1602050194 SK1602050194 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Seoul vernacular daily newspapers on 16 February carry articles speculating on the purpose and background of the purported visit to Pyongyang by Representative Ronald V. Dellums, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. The conservative CHOSON ILBO on 16 February carries on page 3 a 1,200-word article by New York-based correspondent Kim Sung-yong entitled "To Play a Messenger's Role To Ascertain `the North's Intent' First-Hand." The article notes that Dellums' visit is made with 21 February, the supposed deadline for North Korea to accept IAEA inspections, only a few days away, and adds: "Many hold expectations that he will play the role of messenger to make a first-hand ascertainment of the North Korean leadership and to precisely convey the U.S. position, though his visit may not directly offer a key to resolving the issue." The article then notes: "There is a possibility that North Korea may try to use Dellums' visit as a propaganda opportunity to stress its rationale for its present position." The moderate HANGUK ILBO on 16 February carries on page 3 a 1,300-word article by New York-based correspondent Kim Su-chong entitled "Why Is the Chairman of the U.S. House Armed Services Committee Visiting Pyongyang?." The article notes optimistic expectations held by some that "Chairman Dellums' visit to Pyongyang could contribute to the resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue." The article then notes: "The United States could send a letter from President Clinton to Kim Il-song or explain the atmosphere of the U.S. Government and Congress to the North Korean ruler." The article then observes that "Dellums likes to utter the theme `peace is my passion,' and Pyongyang might have interpreted it to represent a personal trait, making it easier for him to generously appreciate Pyongyang's position, according to one analysis." The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN on 16 February carries on page 3 a 900-word article by Washington-based correspondent Kim Hak-sun entitled "Why Is the Chairman of the U.S. House Armed Services Committee Visiting Pyongyang?--The `Final Mediator' for the North Korean Nuclear Issue--`In-Depth Dialogue' May Be Possible as a Dove." The article begins by noting the significance of Chairman Dellums' visit to Pyongyang in light of the possibility that he is carrying a personal letter from President Clinton and in light of his position in Congress and his capacity to precisely convey the U.S. position to the North Korean authorities. The article then notes, "The fact that he is one of the most moderate doves in the U.S. Congress might give North Korea credibility." The article then notes: "It is not certain whom Chairman Dellums will meet when he goes to Pyongyang, but because he will probably be carrying a letter from President Clinton, he may well be meeting President Kim Il-song. President Kim Il-song will probably make extra efforts to heartily welcome him, according to Washington's North Korean experts."
