The United States and Britain will also support advancing the implementation date of the new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) trade accord to January 1 next year, Major said. Major, who met with Clinton over breakfast Tuesday, told reporters that he and Clinton spent "some time" discussing Japan's markets for foreign products. "We both share a wish to support the growing measure of opinion that exists in Japan, for example, for the further opening of Japanese markets," Major said after emerging from the White House session with Clinton. "This is a matter of concern to the United States. It's a matter of concern throughout the European Union as well," Major said, with Clinton looking on by his side. Japan runs big trade surpluses both with the United States and the European Union. Trade talks between Tokyo and Washington collapsed last month on ways to whittle down Japan's trade surplus with the U.S. On another trade matter, Major said he and Clinton agreed that "it would be desirable" to move up the starting date of the so-called "Uruguay Round" accord concluded last December under GATT auspices. "The sooner that agreement can be implemented, the better it will be," Major said. Under the terms worked out by 117 GATT member countries last December, the trade pact is tentatively scheduled to go into force on July 1, 1995.
