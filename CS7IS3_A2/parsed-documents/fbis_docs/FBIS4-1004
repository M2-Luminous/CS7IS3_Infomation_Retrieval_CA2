FBIS4-1004 "drafr075_c_94013" FBIS-AFR-94-075 Daily Report 19 Apr 94 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Election Coverage Procedures, Venue Reported Election Coverage Procedures, Venue Reported MB1604104494 Johannesburg WEEKEND STAR in English 16-17 Apr 94 p 2 MB1604104494 Johannesburg WEEKEND STAR English BFN [Report by Louise Marsland] [Excerpts] A barrage of television cameras and press photographers from the world's media will greet politicians as they roll up in their limos through the stately marble-and-glass entrance to Gallagher Estate on the day or night on which South Africa's final election results will be made known. The surrounding 14th ha [hectares] of the estate's landscaped gardens, with Koi ponds, gazebos and secret pathways, will form a magnificent backdrop to the historic event unfolding over the next two weeks. It is in these tranquil surroundings that Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler will have to decide whether all was free and fair and when to release the final election results. [passage omitted] A state-of-the-art media centre is being constructed in a hall as big as an aircraft hangar. About 800 special pay phones will be installed, 150 of which will have modem facilities to plug into laptop computers. There will also be about 160 televisions, computers, fax machines and printing facilities. Fastfood outlets and bars set up on the estate will operate almost 24 hours. A video wall in the media centre and closed-circuit television, linked to IEC offices, will keep everyone informed. [passage omitted] The media centre will be operational from Wednesday, when the IEC will begin press briefings at the estate. The commission has been provided with offices between the media centre and the main auditorium which will be used for press briefings. Election days -- April 26, 27 and 28 -- will see hourly briefings to keep the world's press up to date with events at the 9,000 polling stations and around the country. After voting closes at 7 pm on April 28, the all-night vigils will begin for the results. Counting starts at the about 800 to 1,000 counting stations across the country at 6 am on Friday April 19. Votes will be counted in batches of 3,000 and the information relayed to the IEC head office in Johannesburg via computer. The IEC will then release the information to the SABC, which will simultaneously relay it to the huge screens at Gallagher Estate and to viewers at home. The provisional "score" for each political party in both the national and regional elections, will be updated constantly by computer. By law, the IEC has between two and 10 days to take a decision on the election and release a final result. It is expected that the result will be released sooner rather than later, so as not to increase the political tension expected over the election. Once the IEC has taken a decision on when to release the results, guests and the media will be given about four hours' notice to assemble in Gallagher's main ballroom and the adjoining media centre. About 1,000 guests will be invited to be present in the ballroom where the IEC will announce whether the elections were free and fair and how many votes each party achieved in the national and regional elections. Each political party will be allowed a certain number of guests and the rest will be VIPs and foreign dignatories. The SABC, as host broadcaster, is in charge of producing the show. It is hoped that the "political stars" such as Nelson Mandela and F.W. de Klerk will attend the IEC ceremony to accept the election "prizes" and address a press conference. [passage omitted]
