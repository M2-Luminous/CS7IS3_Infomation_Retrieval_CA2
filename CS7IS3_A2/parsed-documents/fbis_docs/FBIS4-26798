A group of foreign correspondents visited Mashhad Thursday and Friday at the invitation of the Iranian Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, however, non-Moslem correspondents were rejected entry to the shrine to see the bombing spot. A bomb exploded Monday inside the shrine of Imam Reza, killing 24 people and injuring more than 100 others. In Qha'em hospital, Ahmad Amir Dervari, a worker of the hospital, said that no one could imagine that a bomb exploded in the holiest place of the shrine of Imam Reza. Telling correspondents that his legs were wounded by broken glasses and the bomb fire and his right ear deafened by the bomb sound, Dervari said he did not believe that it was a bomb at first but thought it was something dropping from the ceiling of the shrine. "When other people told me a bomb exploded I found I could not breathe," Dervari said. "I crawled to the door and was rescued by the people outside." Mohammad Reza Mahdavian told correspondents tearfully that when he heard the explosion he felt that his back was burned and after touching his back he found his backing was bleeding. He said he was lucky because the bomb was planted some distance away from him and urged the foreign correspondents to tell the world that the Iranian people are not afraid of dying. "Only the MKO (Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization) and the enemies of Islam can do such things," he said. "They want to root out Islam." Davud Ariyannejad, 20-years-old middle school student, was burned totally from head to toe and his right eye was blinded by the bomb. He was only one meter away from the bomb, he said, adding that he went the shrine to pray with one of his classmates and his classmate was also injured and hospitalized in another hospital. In Imam Reza Hospital, a 14-year-old boy showed foreign correspondents the wound in his stomach, saying that he and his cousin were praying in the shrine when the bomb exploded and after three hours his parents got the news that he was wounded in the explosion. Ghasemian, a 54-year-old worker from Iran's northwestern city of Tabriz, said that he came to the shrine with his family, his 7-year- old daughter was killed and his left leg was cut off in the explosion. Doctors in the hospital told correspondents that his another son was also killed in the explosion and four members of his family were injured in the bomb blast. A doctor said that 25 people were hospitalized in his section after the explosion and many others left the hospital after the treatment of their minor injures. In a press conference Thursday night, Ayatollah Abbas Vaez Tabassi, the custodian of the shrine of Imam Reza, said that 24 people were killed and 120-130 others wounded in the explosion, adding that the figure of the wounded may be even higher. It is difficult to count because some people left after treatment of minor injuries at hospital, the representative of Iranian leader 'Ali Khamene'i said. He denied any involvement of Sunni people in the bomb blast, saying that it was the MKO members that engineered and carried out the preplanned explosion. The Iranian authorities have undeniable evidence that the explosion was carried by the MKO members, he said, the evidence will be announced to the public.
