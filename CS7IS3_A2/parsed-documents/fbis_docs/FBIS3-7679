He told the media on Tuesday before leaving Hanoi that the Philippines, together with Vietnam and other countries in Southeast Asia, wish to share a common destiny and there is no other alternatives than promotion of economic cooperation and construction of peace among them. The president supported Vietnam's succession to ASEAN. He expressed readiness to share his country's experience to build infrastructure and a legal system in Vietnam. He maintained that the two countries have large opportunities in scientific, technological, educational, and health cooperation. Before leaving Hanoi, President Fidel Ramos held a press conference. [Begin Ramos recording in English] I have, like other heads of government in other parts of the world, been covering [words indistinct]. In an effort to develop [word indistinct] activities in our foreign relations, [word indistinct] the Philippines cannot [word indistinct] with the vigorous economies of Southeast Asia. I regard this trip to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam as a one of the most significant I have made. With Vietnam and the other Southeast Asian states, the Philippines has a shared destiny. There is no alternative for peace than economic cooperation among us in this region that we are inhabit. In Manila in 1992, Vietnam acceded to the Bali Treaty of the ASEAN nations which binds signatories to settle regional disputes peaceably. Vietnam's full membership in ASEAN is now a matter [words indistinct] in principle but mainly of time and procedure. I reiterated to Vietnam's leaders the consistent support of the Philippines to help facilitate Vietnam's entry into ASEAN. They in turn informed me of their intensive preparations for full participation in ASEAN activities. Philippine-Vietnamese relations are a critical factor for the solidarity of Southeast Asia and consequently for the peace and progress of the region. I believe my visit greatly enhances these relations. I had friendly and fruitful meetings with President Le Duc Anh, General Secretary Do Muoi of the Communist Party of Vietnam, and Vice President Nguyen Thi Binh; and I look forward to our meeting with Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet later today. Like our own leadership, Vietnam's leaders are all acutely aware of their country's need for regional stability so that they can have the breathing spell after four generations of almost continuous conflict to shape their economy and [word indistinct] self- sustaining role. With them I explored avenues of possible cooperation among the claimants to areas of the South China Sea and other nations of Southeast Asia in order to reduce tensions in the area and to promote joint development as called for in the 1994 Manila Declaration. We agreed on the need to devise confidence building mechanisms, cooperative ventures in the area that will begin to assure the claimant countries of the archipelagoes that the South China Sea can be transformed from waters of contention into an area of cooperation. We agreed that the increasingly favorable economic situation in Vietnam should make it easier for our two countries to work out the repatriation of the Vietnamese asylum seekers in the Philippines. My delegation also looked intensively into the opportunities for countertrade and into investments and joint ventures in each other's economies. We offered the help of our industrialists, academics, managers, and technologists in the building of Vietnam's infrastructure, in financial management, in legislative policy formulation, and in running the tourist facilities. We agreed there is great room for our two countries to collaborate in science and technology, education, and public health. And we agreed to exert every effort to raise the level of trade between us and to make and to take every advantage of complimentarities between our two economies. [end recording]
