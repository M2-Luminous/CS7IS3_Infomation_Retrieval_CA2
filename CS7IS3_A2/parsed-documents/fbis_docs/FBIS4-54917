[PESTI HIRLAP] When the Hungarian Way Circles were formed, you published a communique in your periodical, the HO NAP, that these are the FKgP's own children. However, now you will not participate in the event organized by Istvan Csurka [cochairman of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party, MIEP] which is to foster national cohesion. Why? [Torgyan] The term Hungarian Way is the newspaper name of the FKgP's extended arm, the Hungarian Community. This community had such outstanding leaders as Balint Arany, who was an organizing secretary of our party. They fought against Nazism and later the Soviet Union. This is the reason I could not call the Hungarian Way Circles anything other than the FKgP's own children. At the same time, when the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] was planned, the intention was to establish a substitute for the popular front. I am convinced that the whole peaceful process was preceded by an international agreement drawn up by the central committees of the given countries' communist parties, with the assistance of the KGB. In this structure, the role originally designed for the popular front was given to the Democratic Forum. After all this, Csurka talks about the MDF as the biggest force of national cohesion. In addition, he also invited parties like the Unified Smallholders' Party that had been sliced off from the FKgP. [PESTI HIRLAP] You mean the United Smallholders Party? [Torgyan] It does not make any difference, its name will be forgotten after 8 May anyway. Csurka invited the forces that are trying to divide the right wing. I think that this step can only nominally serve the goal of uniting the right wing. In real terms, it serves to draw away the FKgP's forces. It clearly has to be seen that, today, only the FKgP is able to defeat communism. [PESTI HIRLAP] At the same time, according to the interior minister, Gyula Thurmer, the main domestic representative of communism, strengthened you. [Torgyan] Please write it down in bold letters: The interior minister lied. If you do not print this then I will not let you print anything at all. [PESTI HIRLAP] According to a view published in a newspaper, your role is to attack the MDF and the communists at the same time, thus opening the way for the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. [Torgyan] Every day I mention in my speeches that God save us from the hissing parties. The SZDSZ is a pseudo-opposition party because their main task is to preserve communism. A popular figure was placed at the SZDSZ's head to deceive people and to hide the party's real character. At the same time, we can also see clearly that Gabor Kuncze who was put there to deceive the public will soon be replaced by Gabor Fodor, who was brought in as a second man. I have to point out that they have lost their support in the provinces so, in addition to the MDF, the SZDSZ will be the other big loser of these elections. The FKgP was the only party that had the audacity to say that, rather than a change of the regime, a communist preservation had taken place in Hungary. The pseudo-democracy operated as a multiparty dictatorship. It is precisely the MDF that serves the purpose of making people learn to hate democracy.
