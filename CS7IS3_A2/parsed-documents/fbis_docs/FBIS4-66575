It happened yesterday. This 8 March (International Women's Day), Algerian women rejecting fundamentalism and fanaticism answered the call by the Rally of Algerian Women for Democracy (RAFD) to challenge the state and remind it of its mission. Cries reflecting pain, anger, protest, and above all the attitude that: "I have had it up to here" were heard as the women expressed their deepest feelings. Their number included women who had lost their husbands, brothers, or friends. The family of the martyrs of hate-blinded terrorism was there to try to save what was left. But it must be said that 8 March in this year of 1994 was different. There were no longer any of the customary demonstrations or marches through the streets of the capital. This time, for once, the women had an hour of freedom of expression in front of Ibn Khaldoun Hall. Blocking all traffic so they could chant their slogans: "Where, where is the government?," "No to Djaballah" [Islamic Renaissance Movement leader], "No to Nahnah," and "No dialogue with the murderers who think they are war veterans." Those expressions had to be sincere because they came from women acquainted with suffering: the wives of Liabes and Djillali Belkhenchir. In the eyes of all women who are determined when it comes to defending human rights, the state must react so that blood will stop flowing and so that 8 March will remain eternal. In a letter sent by them to Liamine Zeroual, they challenge him, saying that women refuse to be sacrificed once again on the altar of a suicidal policy or of dialogue based on horse trading. "Yes, Mr. President, the bloodthirsty sect is continuing to bleed Algeria on this 8 March, the eve of Aid el Fitr." "Mr. President, genuine dialogue regarding the modern future of Algeria must include the women and men who believe in it and who are trying every day to protect this country from an Islamic diktat." In a separate development, the Socialist Forces Front (FFS) says in a statement that women are fervent fighters for human rights. It makes a most alarming observation, however. It says that in all the confusion, women are powerless witnesses to the tragedies that are occurring, being held hostage between terrorism and institutional violence, to which are added the sufferings of everyday life. It also mentions the absence of any official text to provide security and protection for women, who continue to be the victims of obscurantism and illiteracy. It also points out that no mention is being made of the ardently demanded suppression of exclusionary laws, including, among others, the Family Code. The date of 8 March used to be a kind of holiday on which women could review the progress made and call for more. Women are now reduced to asking for the most basic right: the right to live.
