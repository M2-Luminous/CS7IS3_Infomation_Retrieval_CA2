Kobelev was the chief sensation at the plenary session of the State Duma 16 February. The deputy demanded that he be allowed to read out a statement that he and party colleague A. Pronin were quitting the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] faction. Since the author of the statement was the "number two man" in Zhirinovskiy's party, observers believe that it is valid to talk about the possibility of a serious split in this large faction. Clearly, these considerations also influenced the speech of the LDPR leader and intensified his traditional stridency. Zhirinovskiy told participants in the session that V. Kobelev cannot be considered either a member of the LDPR or a deputy since he has been excluded "by a party decision" from its ranks "for actions incompatible with the status of a deputy and a member of the LDPR." We will strip them of their mandate, Zhirinovskiy stressed, and promised to institute criminal proceedings against the renegades for improper actions allegedly committed by them in the past. In conversation with your IZVESTIYA correspondent, Deputy Kobelev in turn termed Zhirinovskiy's accusations against him a lie and recalled that the LDPR leader is fond of insulting people. He also did not confirm the information about his expulsion from the party. "I have left Zhirinovskiy's faction, not the LDPR, because I consider myself a representative in the Duma of the LDPR and not of one man's party," Kobelev stated. In his opinion, Zhirinovskiy should be condemned for all his actions at the party congress because they are not commensurate with the LDPR program, which envisages neither extremism nor interference in the affairs of other countries. In conclusion, Kobelev promised Zhirinovskiy that if the latter continued his hostile actions against him he would fight fire with fire. Meanwhile the situation which has developed within the LDPR faction as a result of this goes beyond the bounds of internal factional disputes. After all, the Duma standing orders have yet to be ratified and, consequently, one of the main questions has yet to be resolved, which is: Does a parliamentary faction have the right to recall deputies who entered parliament on the party lists if they "betray" the interests of the faction. It is possible that the scandal within the LDPR faction will influence the solution of this problem in such a way that the recall of deputies will be banned, because there is quite a large number of legislators who have an interest in a split in the ranks of Zhirinovskiy's supporters.
