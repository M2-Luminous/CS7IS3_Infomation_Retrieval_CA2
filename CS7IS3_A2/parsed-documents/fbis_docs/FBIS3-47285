The letter said: "The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea demanded that the Armistice Agreement be replaced with a peace agreement and that the `U.N. Command' in South Korea be dissolved. But the United States and South Korea answered this with nuclear war exercises and with a grave provocation by alleging that the DPRK was using its peaceful nuclear facilities for the `production of nuclear weapons.'" Noting that the United Nations is under moral obligations to see that the DPRK and the United States sign a peace agreement and contribute to the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea, the letter urged the UN secretary-general to show enough response to this end.
