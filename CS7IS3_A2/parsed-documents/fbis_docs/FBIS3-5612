Ozawa, co-leader of Shinseito, one of the ruling seven parties, wants to visit the United States for talks with top U.S. lawmakers on Capitol Hill, the sources said. According to Shinseito leaders, the government has yet to decide on sending Ozawa as special envoy, but Prime Minister Hosokawa may have unofficially asked Ozawa to go, they said. Following the collapse of the framework trade talks between Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton in February, the Japanese Government will announce by the end of March a plan to reduce Japan's huge trade surplus and to open up various markets, the sources said.
