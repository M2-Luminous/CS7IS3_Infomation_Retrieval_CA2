It was perhaps the most impressive forum of the officers' patriotic movement to date in terms of the number of delegations and guests: There were 184 delegates from 21 regions, including nine republics of the former USSR. One hundred and fourteen guests took part in the work of the congress: These included well-known leaders of opposition tendencies and parties such as Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, Aleksandr Barkashov, Sergey Baburin, Sazhi Umalatova, Yuriy Vlasov, Iona Andronov, Vladislav Achalov, and Ivan Shashiashvili. Given that almost all of them addressed the assembly, the picture of the contemporary state of society given by the congress was composed of a wide spectrum of views and assessments from diverse wings of the opposition. On the main and fundamental issue of today those views proved to be similar, augmenting and developing the report by Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Terekhov, chairman of the Officers' Union, and the reports by regional delegates. The economic situation in the former USSR was described as catastrophic. The defense and security of the former USSR are in an equally catastrophic state. The congress also expressed the unanimous view that there is no possibility of reviving a great union state under the current regime. At the same time it was stressed that the achievement of this aim sacred to every patriot should be carried out in a prudent and well-considered way to avoid giving reactionary forces even the slightest opportunity to provoke a civil war. A civil war benefits only those bent on covering their traces and fending off accountability for crimes committed against the peoples of the USSR. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy urged those present to join his party amd "pressure" the regime from within it. The reply from the presidium was that the Officers' Union is an autonomous, independent organization, but it is always ready to cooperate with those who act for the country's good. Delegates asked Zhirinovskiy to support their demands for the restoration of officers' assemblies in units and combined units, which were unlawfully suppressed by the "democratic" regime. Serious concern was expressed at the congress that despite the opposition's renunciation of all strong-arm methods of waging struggle, representatives of the regime are ready to stop at nothing to hold on to the power that is slipping out of their hands. In this context the planned exercise involving 27 [Russian] motorized infantry divisions and three U.S. mechanized divisions near Orenburg was seen as the first step in preparing foreign military intervention to preserve the regime. Speakers reported alarming facts which indicate that a bloody provocation is being prepared for the May holiday as grounds for introducing a state of emergency, which the regime has long craved, since it is no longer able to stay in power without weapons. In closed session the congress formulated counterprovocation tactics, analyzed the state of Officers' Union organizations at local level, and defined the immediate tasks of the officers' movement. The breaks between sessions saw people actively joining the Officers' Union. Russian Federation People's Deputy Iona Andronov set the example here, reading out from the rostrum his own application to join the patriotic organization as a reserve junior officer. On 17 April the officer-delegates held the constituent congress of the Power Party [Derzhavnaya Partiya], the nucleus of which is formed by the Officers' Union. These organizations' aims and tasks were declared to be the same. But the party's social base will be broader. Not just officers, but any patriots who share its program can join.
