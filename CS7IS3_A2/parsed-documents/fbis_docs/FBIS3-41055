Referring to "sources in Washington," the newspaper maintains that rapid assault crafts, torpedo boats, destroyers, and minelayers are up for sale. Iran has allegedly been offered a submarine. This is obvious misinformation aimed at undermining Ukraine's prestige and compromising it in the eyes of the world community. As of today, Ukraine does not own any part of the former USSR's naval fleet, and, therefore, there can be no talk of it selling warships.
