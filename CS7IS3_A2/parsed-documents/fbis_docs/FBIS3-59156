The meeting took place at the Russian Embassy. A statement read after the meeting by Boris Zenkov, Russian ambassador in Cyprus, noted that the five ambassadors called on all interested parties to reply promptly to the UN secretary general in a way that will allow the beginning of discussions on ways of implementing the package on confidence-building measures. The five ambassadors also reminded that the position of the five Security Council permanent members is that the package on Varosha and Nicosia's international airport will not only prove beneficial for the two communities but will have a significant effect in overcoming the current lack of confidence between the two sides. It will also facilitate an overall solution to the Cyprus issue. The five ambassadors also referred to the Security Council's position that both sides are committed to full cooperation with the secretary general without delay in working promptly toward a general framework of agreement, the first stage of which is to reach agreement on the confidence-building measures package. The statement also notes that Clark advised the five ambassadors that the leader of the Greek Cypriot side repeated its acceptance in principle of the package of confidence-building measures for Varosha and Nicosia international airport. He also reiterated his readiness to discuss ways to implement this package when the leader of the Turkish Cypriot side accepts as well. Clark noted that Kliridhis informed him of his intent to repeat his acceptance of the package in a letter to the secretary general. Furthermore, the statement adds that Clark briefed the five ambassadors on Denktas' latest letter and his deliberations with the Turkish Cypriot leader on Monday [24 January] and Tuesday regarding the contents of the letter. Clark underlined the importance of insuring that the acceptance of the package by the Turkish Cypriot side will lead to the implementation of the package. Speaking after the meeting, Clark said that he must be certain that both sides mean the same thing when they say they agree in principle with the confidence-building measures. He said: I have to say we have not reached that point. Clark expressed the hope that in the coming days and following his deliberations in Athens, Ankara, and Istanbul he will be able to tell the UN secretary general that there is agreement between the two sides on the same issue. Asked whether he is optimistic, he said that a lot of distance has been covered. He also expressed the hope that both sides will show real willingness to take steps that will allow the implementation of the confidence-building measures. Clark refrained from commenting on Denktas' letter to the UN secretary general but added that after his discussions and deliberations with the Turkish Cypriot leader, he wants to make sure that the acceptance in principle will lead to discussing the implementation of the confidence-building measures.
