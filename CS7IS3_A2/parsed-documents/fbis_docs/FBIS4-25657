FBIS4-25657 "drchi113_v_94002" FBIS-CHI-94-113 Daily Report 13 Jun 1994 TAIWAN Report Views Trial of Qiandao Lake Suspects Report Views Trial of Qiandao Lake Suspects OW1306083694 Taipei CNA in English 0722 GMT 13 Jun 94 OW1306083694 Taipei CNA English BFN [By Yang Hui-chen and Debbie Kuo] [Text] Hangzhou, June 13 (CNA) -- All three men charged with robbing and murdering 32 people, including 24 Taiwan tourists, aboard a pleasure boat on Qiandao Lake March 31 were sentenced to death by the Hangzhou intermediate people's court Sunday [12 June]. The verdict, delivered during a 30-minute ceremony, completed the trial, referred to by victims' relatives in Taiwan as a "sham" and "nothing but a skit." Announcing the verdict, prosecutors said the suspects robbed the tourists, killed them and blew up the boat. They called the crime serious and handed down two death sentences for each of the three men. The evidence in the case, the prosecutors said, included reports prepared by public security police, written testimonies by witnesses and a videotape owned by a murdered Taiwan tourist discovered at the home of Wu Lihong, one of the three suspects. According to Mainland China's criminal codes, the three defendants -- Wu Lihong, Hu Zhihan, and Yu Aijun -- have three days to appeal their sentences. The fourth suspect, Wu Liming, who was prosecuted on charges of harboring goods stolen in the attack, was sentenced to three years in jail Monday. Wu Liming is a military police officer and the elder brother of Wu Lihong. Huang Chin-kun, one of the victims' Taiwan relatives, called the death sentences predictable. However, he said, many questions raised by the relatives and Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), a conduit for communications between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, remained unanswered. None of the Taiwan relatives appeared at the court to protest Beijing's decision to limit access to the trial and they did not want to give the impression that they were endorsing the verdicts, which they said they "will never accept." Chuang Shu-fang, another relative, said judging from the videotapes of the trial, she doesn't believe the three suspects are the real murders. The tapes showed that Hu Zhihan consulted his notes when answering questions and Wu Lihong even smiled during the trial. "How can a murderer forget what he has done and smile at a crime as heinous as this one," Chuang asked. After the trial, SEF's Deputy Secretary-General Hsu Hui-you expressed his indignation at the mainland's continuing refusal to talk with SEF about compensation for victims' relatives and signing an agreement securing Taiwan travelers' security in the mainland. The Qiandao Lake incident occurred on March 31 when 32 people were murdered and robbed aboard a pleasure boat ferrying them across the Zhejiang Province lake. Beijing did not publicize the incident until two days later and did not admit the deaths involved foul play until Taiwan threatened to review the fragile cross-Taiwan Strait ties.
