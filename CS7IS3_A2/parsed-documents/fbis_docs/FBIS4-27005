The conference, held in Beijing from June 21-24, called on the People's Bank of China, the central bank, to tighten supervision and control over the operation of all financial institutions in order to ensure safe and effective operation of the financial system. According to the meeting, although the People's Bank of China has done a great deal to rectify the financial order and strengthen supervision and control over financial institutions, there are still some problems. These included that some local governments and departments approved the establishment of financial institutions without authorization; some financial institutions have violated rules and regulations and overstepped their scope of businesses approved; there are also problems with regard to the registration of financial institutions as legal persons and in the management of increasing shares and capital. The conference said that the establishment of any financial institution must have the approval of the People's Banks of China. It urged the People's Bank of China to take stock of the financial institutions established without proper authorization and solve the problem by deepening reforms. It also called for efforts to formulate standards and examination and approval procedures for establishing financial institutions. The conference stressed that the power of macro-regulation in the financial area must be in the hands of the central authorities and there should be wavering in this regard. The conference drew particular attention to the supervision and control over trust and investment corporations, securities companies and other non-banking financial institutions to see that they operate according to law. The conference urged the urban and rural credit cooperatives to persist in the orientation of serving private and collective sectors of the economy in urban and rural areas. They may also establish cooperative banks by pooling funds. On the establishment of development cooperative banks, the conference said that there must be law first and such banks should be established in urban areas first and rural areas later. The cooperative banks should operate independently, responsible for their own profit and losses, exercising self-restraint and seeking development by themselves. Local governments are not allowed to interfere in their operations. Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, who is also governor of the People's Bank of China (PBC), was present at the conference and made an important speech.
