SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama held talks with leaders of seven coalition parties Tuesday at the Diet to discuss a new framework for a new government. The leaders of the coalition and SDP agreed to begin studies on policies for a new government, which the sources said needs to be managed "democratically." Meanwhile, the No. 1 opposition party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), continued efforts to establish a grand coalition with the SDP in an effort to regain the power it lost 10 months ago. LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori, in a meeting with SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo in the Diet, proposed putting up Murayama as head of a new three-party coalition among the LDP, SDP and new party Sakigake, an LDP splinter group. Mori also called for an early summit between Murayama and LDP President Yohei Kono. Kubo, however, did not respond immediately to the LDP's offer and instead told Mori that the SDP will put the priority on talks with the ruling coalition, the sources said.
