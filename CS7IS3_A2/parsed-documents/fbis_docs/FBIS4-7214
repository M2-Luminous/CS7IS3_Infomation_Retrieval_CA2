FBIS4-7214 "dreas082_a_94039" FBIS-EAS-94-082 Daily Report 27 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan MITI: Industrial Output Increased in Mar MITI: Industrial Output Increased in Mar OW2704075894 Tokyo KYODO in English 0732 GMT 27 Apr 94 OW2704075894 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 27 KYODO -- Japan's industrial production in March climbed 4.0 percent from the preceding month, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) said Wednesday [27 April]. The seasonally adjusted production index for the mining and manufacturing sectors stood at 92.1 against a base of 100 for 1990, MITI announced in a preliminary report. The March output growth compares with a 0.1 percent dip registered in February. A production outlook index for the manufacturing sector indicates falls both in April and May. Uncertainty shadows the future course of final demand, necessitating close watch of coming developments, MITI said, repeating wording used in the February report. Shipments increased 4.4 percent in March for the index of 95.0, following a 1.1 percent growth in February. The inventory index dropped 1.7 percent to 105.0, following a 1.0 percent decrease in the previous month. The March inventory-to-sales ratio fell 6.0 percent against a 2.7 percent decrease in February, with the index standing at 111.9. On an unadjusted basis, industrial production in March slid 3.1 percent from a year earlier, stretching a record string of year-to-year declines to 30 months. With the latest statistics, Japan's industrial output has shown considerable fluctuation over the eight months prior to the reporting month. Koichi Yoshimoto, chief of the ministry's Statistics Analysis Division, told a press conference that the basic undertone of both industrial output and shipment is still weak although bright spots are being detected in some sectors such as household electric appliances and housing purchases. The 4.0 percent growth in the March output, the highest since a 4.2 percent gain registered in September 1992, chiefly resulted from seasonal factors toward the end of fiscal 1993, Yoshimoto said. "It is too early to declare Japan's economy has hit bottom," he said. In March, production in all the 14 industrial sectors covered by the survey, except chemicals, scored gains from the preceding month, MITI said. Electric machinery such as air conditioners made a great contribution to boosting March industrial output along with transport vehicles such as passenger cars, MITI said. Shipments for the month rose in all 14 sectors, with electrical and passenger cars marking substantial increases. The production and shipment indexes rose above 90 for the first time since September. But the ministry forecast a 2.7 percent production decline for the manufacturing sector in April and a 2.4 percent decline in May. Demand for machinery will probably drop in these months in reaction to sharp increases in the January-March period, Yoshimoto explained. The inventory index fell in March for the third month in a row, thanks to smooth inventory adjustment in ordinary passenger cars, Yoshimoto said. Volume adjustment of corporate inventories is progressing steadily but the inventory-to-sales ratio of 111.9 for March is still high, Yoshimoto said, noting the slow growth of shipments. Corporate managers must feel a surplus of inventories, he said. Japan's industrial production for the entire year in fiscal 1993 fell 4.1 percent from the previous year while shipments decreased by 3.7 percent. Both industrial output and shipments thus registered declines for three consecutive years, a first for Japan. In the past, two years of decline were recorded in fiscal 1974-1975 when Japan's economy was struggling under the impact of the 1973 oil crisis.
