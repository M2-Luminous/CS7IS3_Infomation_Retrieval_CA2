Summary of Response Mission The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is responsible for coordinating offsite Federal response activities and Federal assistance to State and local governments for functions other than radiological monitoring and assessment. FEMA's coordination role is to promote an effective and efficient response by Federal agencies at both the national level and at the scene of the emergency. FEMA coordinates the activities of Federal, State, and local agencies at the national level through the use of its Emergency Support Team and at the scene of the emergency with its Emergency Response Team. 2. Capabilities and Resources FEMA will provide personnel who are experienced in disaster assistance to establish and operate the DFO; public information officials to coordinate public information activities; personnel to coordinate reporting to the White House and liaison with the Congress; and personnel experienced in information support for the Federal response. FEMA personnel are familiar with the capabilities of other Federal agencies and can aid the States and other Federal agencies in obtaining the assistance they need. FEMA will: (1) Coordinate assistance to State and local governments among the Federal agencies; (2) Coordinate Federal agency response activities, except those pertaining to the FRMAC, and coordinate these with the activities of the LFA; (3) Work with the LFA to coordinate the dissemination of public information concerning Federal emergency response activities. Promote the coordination of public information releases with State and local governments, appropriate Federal agencies, and appropriate private sector authorities; and (4) Help obtain logistical support for Federal agencies. 3.
