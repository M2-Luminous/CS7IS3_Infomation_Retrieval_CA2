Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, expressed this at a meeting with visiting denmark Minister of Environment Svend Auken and his party here today. China is launching a large-scale economic construction and environmental problems are becoming more conspicuous each passing day, Li said. The country needs, and has put great emphasis on, learning from and absorbing advanced foreign expertise in environmental protection, he said. In so doing, he said, "we hope to preserve a good environment, achieve economic growth and bring benefits to future generations." Denmark boasts many advantages in environmental protection, he said, voicing the hope that the environmental departments of the two countries increase contacts, strengthen exchanges and explore new spheres of friendly cooperation. During the meeting, Li recalled his recent visit to Denmark. He asked Auken to convey his thanks and best regards to the Danish prime minister, president of the parliament and other leaders. Though far away from each other, China and Denmark have had friendly ties for a long time. Denmark was one of the first Western countries to set up diplomatic ties with New China and also supported the resumption of China's seat in the United Nations, Li noted. Auken said China's economy is growing fast and Denmark is keen on extensive cooperation with China in the sector of environmental protection. Auken and his party are here as guests of the State Bureau for Environmental Protection. Xie Zhenhua, the bureau's director, was present at the meeting.
