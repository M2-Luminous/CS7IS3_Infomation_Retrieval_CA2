Yesterday he was elected South Yemen's vice president -- and ever since head of state al-Bid took refuge in his native Hadramut region, in the east, al-Jifri has become the highest political authority in Aden. Before starting the interview, al-Jifri -- who is 55 years old, and a long-standing member of Yemen's Socialist Party -- checked that the telephones were not bugged. Finally, he lifted one himself, looked underneath, and said: "No bugs, we can begin." [LA REPUBBLICA] Doctor al-Jifri, the war between North and South Yemen broke out after a union which lasted barely four years. What has come between Sanaa and Aden? [Al-Jifri] The problem is Salih. At a certain point, the northern leader took it into his head to control everything and everybody, establishing definite hierarchies. They have a certain system and they want to bring it here, but this is impossible because we have a democratic orientation and we do not accept impositions from anybody. Apart from that, we know Salih well: You cannot trust anything he says. He tells heaps of lies. Breaking the cease-fire is a blatant example... [LA REPUBBLICA] However, you also broke the cease-fire by firing a Scud into Sanaa. [Al-Jifri] We did not fire any missiles. [LA REPUBBLICA] Who was it, then? [Al-Jifri] I repeat, we did not break the cease-fire. [LA REPUBBLICA] Doctor al-Jifri, what then is the military situation around your al-'Anad air base? [Al-Jifri] The situation is excellent. We had a few problems in the beginning. They took the initiative first, and we responded. [LA REPUBBLICA] However, there was then a partial withdrawal on your part... [Al-Jifri] This was purely tactical. In fact, our move took them by surprise, and now the southern area is entirely in our hands. They are still shelling us from the north. [LA REPUBBLICA] What distance are the northerners from Aden? [Al-Jifri] Sixty kilometers. However, we recently destroyed one of their trucks, blocked eight of their tanks. In short, we chased them back beyond the mountains. Aden is safe, no problem there. [LA REPUBBLICA] Let us suppose, for a minute, that the north manages to close in, aiming to conquer Aden... [Al-Jifri] They are incapable of that. The people will fight, fight, fight. This is the key point. [LA REPUBBLICA] However, war is not simply a matter of will. [Al-Jifri] We have a just cause to defend our country. And we will do so, if need be, one street at the time, one house at the time. Furthermore, we have new, fresh forces joining us all the time. [LA REPUBBLICA] Meaning conscripts, rounded up and sent to the front. [Al-Jifri] No, they are militiamen, in short, reservists. They need a couple of days' training and then, indeed, they do go to the front. [LA REPUBBLICA] What steps are you taking at international level to try to put an end to this war? [Al-Jifri] We are striving to obtain other nations' full consensus, and many of them have requested the northern leaders to stop. But if the latter do not, what can we do? Salih does not at all mind killing civilians, he only wants money and power. [LA REPUBBLICA] How do you think the situation will now develop? [Al-Jifri] I believe our Yemen is here to stay, and that it will become a modern state. We are convinced of this. I do not believe the people in the north will accept that corrupt regime which has divided the country and caused so much suffering. [LA REPUBBLICA] Do you see in all this the possibility of a diplomatic solution, or rather the continuation of war? [Al-Jifri] I believe in diplomatic means to achieve peace. But if diplomacy does not work, there are other means of achieving peace.
