Rice imported from China is also fetching similar prices as both Chinese and California rice are close in taste to the medium short- grain Japanese staple, according to Beikoku Data Bank, a private market research agency. Earlier this month, the government began selling rice imported from China, Thailand and the United States to cope with a shortfall caused by a poor harvest last year. Thai rice, a long-grain variety, has proven less popular with the Japanese. According to Beikoku Data Bank, Thai rice is traded at 70-90 yen per kilogram on distribution channels outside official markets, way below the 199 yen at which the government sold the product to wholesalers. Faced with the unpopularity of Thai rice, the Food Agency has said it will begin selling a blend of rice imported from China, the U.S. and Thailand.
