Our position on settlement in former Yugoslavia is the same," Viktor Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Russian Federation Government, said today while answering questions from journalists after the conclusion of his talks with Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister of the state of Israel. The head of the Russian cabinet emphasized particularly that the Russian government "intends to do everything possible to reach a peace settlement in the Middle East". At the end of intergovernment Russian-Israeli talks, which lasted about two hours, Viktor Chernomyrdin and Yitzhaq Rabin signed six agreements between the governments of the two countries: on scientific and technical cooperation, on economic, scientific and technical cooperation in the agro-industrial complex, on avoiding dual taxation, on cooperation in health care and medicine, on cooperation in education and culture and on cooperation in tourism. Highly assessing the importance of these agreements for the development of bilateral relations, the Russian premier spoke about the necessity for the conclusion of a Russian-Israeli document on trade and economic relations in the immediate future. He pointed out that Russia and Israel have favorable prospects for expanding cooperation in various spheres including the economy and military spheres. It has become known to the ITAR-TASS correspondent from sources in the Russian Government delegation that during the talks various aspects of Russian-Israeli relations were discussed in detail and that the two sides spoke in favor of developing mutually beneficial trade and economic cooperation. The importance of strengthening the friendly relations between Russia and Israel, of which the broad cultural and humanitarian ties are an important factor, was also pointed out during the talks. A number of topical international issues including the situation in the Middle East were also discussed. Repying to the question whether the "Zhirinovskiy phenomenon" has any influence on increasing the threat of anti-Semitism in Russia, Viktor Chernomyrdin gave the assurance that "a large number of Jews live today in Russia but they are not threatened by any kind of anti-Semitism and that no kind of `Zhirinovskiys' will be able to whip up anti-Semitism." "Fascism or anti-Semitism will not prevail in Russia. Though, of course, there are certain forces which would like to agitate the situation by bringing up the ethnic issue."
