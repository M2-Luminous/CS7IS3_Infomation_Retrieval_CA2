We posed four questions to our interviewees, most of whom agreed in our succinct dialogues that their companies are "defenseless," although almost none of them would exchange stability and the convertible peso for anything. As for the interest rates that they would consider optimum, there was little agreement, except that the current rates are unaffordable. While the most radical would like to see international rates no higher than one percent, others would tolerate 7 percent. The questions were: 1) What do you think 1994 will be like for your sector and, in particular, for your business? 2) What are the main competitive disadvantages that you face as a sector and as a business? 3) Do you think that there will be affordable private credit for small and medium business and what rate would be "affordable" in your judgment? 4) If you had three wishes in economic policy, what would they be? Peso Must Be Devalued Jorge Mazza, Manager of Vilmax, a dye manufacturing firm that exports two-thirds of its output: 1) Our company is regarded as one of the 100 innovators, but I think that it still has a long way to go. The problem lies in the lack of responsibility and efficiency of the Argentine people. I feel that they do not do responsible work and that they would rather be charming and "hustle" everybody else. 2) What makes things hard for SMB is the exchange rate. Argentine costs are very high, and the result is an expensive, poorly made, inefficient product. 3) Loans would start to be granted if the government felt obliged to see this happen. Many SMB's are going to disappear unless they are helped. The tariff ought to be 5 or 6 percent. 4) Argentine costs that would enable us to compete internationally. A devaluation is needed. Italy is an example that ought to be kept in mind. They devalued the lira, and as a result costs did not rise. Our currency could be devalued if we did things in earnest. Halt the indiscriminate economic liberalization, and control and determine the usefulness of things entering the country. Let us educate ourselves so that we do better work. Fine, But Without Anyone's Help Omar Bacchi, owner of the Nogali cookie company: 1) I do not think that 1994 will be much different from 1993. Support for small and mid-sized industry will remain grudging. We can see the proof in what is happening with the federal fiscal pact. Everything is happening there as if industry, particularly SMB, did not exist. In spite of the risk, my company is investing in technology (to the extent of my potential and by going into debt). 2) One of my main competitive disadvantages on the domestic market is having to convert my products and sales structure quickly to reach other segments of the market amid a recession and stiff competition. On foreign markets, although we have the potential advantage of being an agribusiness, we have all of the disadvantages of the manufacturing sector in general and the lack of dependable government support (which is only talked about). 3) I do not think that there is going to be affordable credit, either private or governmental. The interest rate on loans should be in line with anticipated inflation. 4) To have a recovery on the domestic market; to see a genuine, dependable policy of support for SMB; and to see "affordable credit" and "production revolution," among other expressions, become more than just political slogans. SMB's Help the Banks Carlos Rodriguez, manager of Transfrigo, a refrigerated transportation firm: 1) 1994 is going to be a difficult, highly competitive year because there is an ever-increasing supply of transportation services, not only from freight haulers but also from the railways, which are more efficient in private hands. 2) The main problem is the lack of credit for investment. Having a place in the market means keeping up to date, and this demands investment in technology. Ground rules are needed. Up to now there has been no specific oversight of our industry. Only recently has the government been performing the policing function that properly belongs to it and begun considering the need for a transportation law that would provide a basic frame of reference. SMB's are the ones that have the most competition. Their competitors are individual truck owners, who up to now have shirked every obligation. 3) The banks are not helping SMB's, which are instead helping the banks. Interest rates should not exceed 7 percent a month; they should be between 3 and 4 percent. 4) Maintain stability; undertake labor reform and revoke any provision that violates free trade (regulations, fees); the government should get the policy of external investments moving. A Clear-Cut Economic Policy Mario Elkouss, managing partner of Longoni Electronics: 1) This year is not going to be the same all across the electronics industry. For example, things are going to be bad for telephones. The fact is that the country is seeing an indiscriminate economic liberalization, which complicates things for domestic firms, and even more so for SMB's. On the other hand, I think that this is going to be a good year for services companies. I feel that 1994 is going to be a good year for Longoni Electronics, as long as we work very hard. 2) The main disadvantage is the indiscriminate economic liberalization. Industrial decrees have established a zero tariff on many foreign goods entering the country. One good example is transformers, which have been allowed to enter the country tariff-free, and as a result domestically made ones have disappeared. Our country now has only the spare parts market left. 3) I do not think that private lending is possible. The Central Bank has issued regulations mandating increasing guarantees and interest rates for lenders. The ideal interest rate should not exceed 1 percent a month. The credit problem is serious for SMB's, which must modernize constantly by investing in top-quality machinery to compete with big business. The ones that get loans take many months to pay them back. 4) An economic policy. The government has to state clearly what the ground rules are. A recovery, inasmuch as without one there is very little circulation of money and you have to wait until you are paid to conduct transactions. Good times for all sectors, not just my company. Advertising and Deals That Close Gloria Lopez Lecube, owner of FM La Isla: 1) Growth in the sector will be in line with economic growth: 4 or 5 percent a year. My company will likely continue growing, because the advertising pie, which is increasingly selective, will be divided up among those media that specifically represent the interests of each sector. FM La Isla is aimed solely at the employers and executives with influence in essential decision-making. Also, we will have new products, such as the managers of pension funds that need to advertise to explain the advantages of the new system and capture potential customers. 2) The services sector and, in the area of communications in particular, my company are geared solely to the domestic market. The main competitive disadvantage is the growth of information pools in the print, radio, and airwave and cable television media, which restrict the development of the independent media. The only way to compete is with a media approach like FM La Isla's, which aims at the stratum with high purchasing power and serves a selective listening and advertising public. 3) There is a national and international trend towards promoting SMB. An affordable rate to overcome the lending bottleneck would be 12 percent. Another measure that makes this year look better for SMB is the new law on business obligations, which allows entry into a market that had been reserved, until now, for big business. 4) Maintain growth, but make a qualitative leap called development. Tax relief for investment, once and for all, in order to specify and speed up the capitalization of selected lines of business. Lower the political decibel level in order to meet the challenge of the economy. Long-Term Credit Ernesto Mario Dimov, owner of Dimov S.A., a garment manufacturer that has its own brands and also operates under international licenses: 1) We feel that 1994 will be a difficult year for our sector because we anticipate a marked decline in consumption and a lack of confidence about the credit to be given to customers in general. As for our company in particular, we feel that it will be a good year nevertheless. 2) The unfair importation of items at dumping prices, with underbilling and low tariffs in many cases, is perhaps our main competitive disadvantage. High financing costs make it impossible to achieve the much talked about goal of lowering Argentine costs. 3) I do not think that we will have affordable private credit in the immediate future, inasmuch as our sector has practically no access to the economic plan that the government is implementing to help SMB. There is no lending support. The really important thing would be to have the long-term credit needed for expanded production so that we could plan and budget for our activities over these same periods. We think that it would be reasonable to provide loans at preferential rates for domestic producers, with interest rates two or three points over current world rates. 4) Imports at real prices, because although there have been some tariff hikes, they are still not high enough. A recovery, which is essential for continued progress in the economic arena. A long-term credit policy, which is indispensable if we want to remain a domestic company. Laboratories: "Another Good Year" Juan Roberto Dominguez, owner of Dominguez Laboratories and vice president of the Cooperative of Argentine Patent Medicines Laboratories (Cooperala): 1) We will have a year very much like 1993. We are going to keep on growing, although there is going to be less and slower improvement for small and medium industries there than for big business. Large firms are going to continue absorbing smaller ones, which cannot survive on their own. Since our business depends largely on bringing in new products (and the formalities for authorizing new patent medicines have been speeded up greatly under Cavallo), this is going to be a point in our favor. 1994 is going to be very promising for us as a business because we have begun exporting and already have contacts with Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Chile. We are selling two items on the overseas market: Demospresin and A-acid. 2) Mercosur [Common Market of the South] concerns us from a competitive standpoint, although it would not seem to be hurting us as much as it is the big laboratories. We cannot compete with the prices of an economy as large as Brazil's or with the prices of local companies that manufacture pharmaceuticals in their plants in Uruguay or Brazil and then package them here. 3) I do not think that more affordable private credit for SMB is on the way. And today it is altogether unaffordable; I can say that from my own experience. The foreign supplier company can give me financing for drugs because it has had me as a client for more than 50 years. European equipment manufacturers, many of them Italian, are giving buyers of their products four or five years to pay for them, because their governments finance these loans as a way of promoting exports. The ideal rate would be the international rate, which almost never reaches 1 percent a month. 4) Continued convertibility, because stability is linked to it. The passage of the labor laws in order to lower costs and eliminate the chaos with gross earnings, among other advantages. Clarification of the meaning of the patent medicines bill, giving consideration to the proposal of certain laboratories that, while not rejecting a patent law outright, want intellectual property respected but without monopoly patents. A Difficult 1994 on the Way Guillermo Gomez Galizia, a businessman in the health services sector and a full member of the Chamber of Medical Diagnostic Institutions (Cadime) and of the General Economic Confederation of the federal capital: 1) We anticipate difficulties in several sectors of the economy and especially in the SMB sector. Many of them have been unable to cope easily with reconversion; in contrast, those that have managed to stay afloat are having a very hard time adapting. The sectors involved in consumer goods and the services sector have recorded a significant expansion in recent times, leading to excess supply at present. 2) The main disadvantages for SMB's in general on the domestic market are the inordinately high interest rates for firms of this size. The tax burden falls most heavily on production and consumption, not on income as in the developed countries. We suffer from technological obsolescence, arising mainly from these disadvantages. Services are expensive, which boosts production costs. And in the case of companies tied to regional economies, freight charges are uncompetitive because the transport SMB's have the same overall problems. 3) As the profile of SMB's is redefined, there will be a better chance of getting loans in the private sector as well. If the definition of an SMB is a company with, on the average, more than 200 employees, annual sales of over $15 million, or production assets of over five million pesos, then a great many are going to be left out. As for the interest rate, if we have inflation indices like those in the developed countries, it should be in line with them. 4) Maintain the stability that has been achieved; take immediate steps to grow and create jobs; establish mechanisms so that SMB's can take full part in the economy and thus facilitate its democratization. Efforts at Reconversion Rolando Pietrantueno, chairman of the Argentine Industrial Council (CAI) and a businessman in the metalworking sector: 1) and 2) The manufacturing industry has been engaged in intensive reconversion since the economy was opened up through the convertibility plan, this being part of the policy behind it. The result was immediate price competition between imported and domestic goods. Small and medium industry found itself at a clear disadvantage in achieving the goal as fast as was required and without "anesthesia." It made an enormous effort to cut its own internal costs but was severely restricted by external ones, which can be summed up as the so-called "Argentine cost," which includes fiscal policy, energy rates, ports, communications, the workmen's compensation law, and fiscal labor costs. To this we can add the genuine difficulty of obtaining credit, which is an essential tool for bringing in the necessary technology to improve productivity and replenish the working capital that was lost as a result of hyperinflation. 3) Affordable credit will probably not be available until a solution is found to two central problems restricting it: a system of guarantees that is streamlined and dynamic enough to overcome this fundamental restriction, and project appraisal. 4) Maintain the stability that has been achieved; sustained, equitable growth that safeguards jobs and output; human beings should be regarded as the hub of the system and as the sole beneficiary of all economic activity.
