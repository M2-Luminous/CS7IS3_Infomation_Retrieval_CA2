She said: "Cross-border operations have taken place." While flying to Adana to attend the True Path Party meeting, Ciller answered a MILLIYET correspondent's question about the credibility of reports that the security forces have crossed into Syria by asserting: "Cross-border operations take place on our eastern border from time to time. We shall continue to take the measures required to end terrorism. The question of cross-border operations is always on Turkey's agenda. It will continue to be on the agenda." Asked whether the border between Turkey and Iraq was included in the plans for the cross-border operation, Ciller said: "We have informed our neighbors not to attach too much importance to the air and ground operations. Penetrations have been made into Turkey from Iraq, but they were insignificant. Turkey is fourth on the list of countries with many neighbors. It is time for Turkey's neighbors to prove their friendship with our country. This year will be one in which the important stages of this issue will be wrapped up." [passage omitted]
