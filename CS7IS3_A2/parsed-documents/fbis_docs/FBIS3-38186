The same support, understanding, and courage must be displayed by Greece as well. Cetin met with Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special envoy for Cyprus, in Istanbul this morning. In a statement after the one-hour meeting, Cetin reported that the recent developments in Cyprus were discussed with Clark. Cetin recalled that in his letter to the UN secretary general, Rauf Denktas, president of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, announced that he accepts the confidence-building measures in principle. Cetin added: [Begin Cetin recording] Kliridhis must do the same. The two leaders will meet and discuss the confidence-building measures. We want a viable and just solution for Cyprus.
