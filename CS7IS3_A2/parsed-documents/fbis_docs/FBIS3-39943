This historic surplus is an encumbrance! In fact, it was obtained as a result of an equally unprecedented recession, with the low level of demand by households and the fall in investments by enterprises bringing imports down by more than 10 percent. On paper at least, the year is ending well, thanks to the sale of several Airbus planes. The trade balance showed a record monthly surplus in December of Fr13.2 billion, after the Fr6.5 billion in November. Exports, in figures adjusted to take account of seasonal variations, reached Fr103 billion, of which Fr5.3 billion came from the invoicing of 14 Airbus planes. Exports totaled Fr99 billion in November. Imports totaled Fr89 billion in December, as against Fr92 billion the previous month. Last year's record is almost a trebling of the 1992 surplus which was Fr30.9 billion. It also by far exceeds the government's budget forecasts which were based on Fr39 billion. However, the introduction of a new system of customs statistics for intra-Community trade on 1 January 1993 prompts caution. Since the establishment of the single market, the figures for trade with the rest of the European Union have been calculated on the basis of voluntary statements by enterprises. This is an innovation which has led to a lack of reliability in the figures for at least the whole first half of the year and forced the Customs Department to make major revisions from one month to another. Positive Balance with Germany Essentially, the government yesterday took care not to rejoice too much about the unprecedented trade surplus. According to the accumulated figures obtained from the Customs Department, 1993's historic surplus can be explained mainly by the fall in imports as a result of the economic recession, which weakened the demand from French enterprises and households. For instance, the accumulated total of imports in gross figures, the most significant in this case, amounted to Fr1,091 billion, in other words a drop of 10.4 percent compared with the previous year. Exports also fell, to Fr1,181 billion. But the drop of 5.4 percent was half that of imports, hence the record surplus. On the basis of geographical area, foreign trade doubled its surplus with its European Union partners: It reached Fr32.7 billion (gross figures) as against Fr16.6 billion. This performance can mainly be explained by the marked improvement in trade relations with Germany. Indeed, last year France recorded a surplus of Fr2.1 billion with its main trade partner, as against a deficit of Fr1.4 billion in 1992. On the other hand, Japan continues to account for France's biggest bilateral deficit (a deficit of Fr23 billion).
