Nagy met railway workers during his visit to Vas County. It remains a big question for him, too, whether it will be just as easy for him in his capacity of parliamentary deputy of the governing party to put the engine of trade unions on its tracks. We asked him about his views on the future of the trade unions that will become a parliamentary factor after the elections. [Nagy] The role of the trade unions will definitely change in the coming four years. If for no other reason then because the current government is trying to keep the MSZOSZ in quarantine, with the occasional support of the liberal opposition. Our struggle against this often distracted us from our essential duties. Our proposals were rejected and the government treated us as enemies. We will not have to face this when the government is led by the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. I expect that we will be seen as important partners. [Csala] In order to be seen as partners, do the trade unions definitely have to sit in Parliament, as deputies of precisely the governing party? [Nagy] I do not think that this issue is as important as is presented by the press nowadays. The deputies will indeed have to decide about their attitude. When the MSZP made the agreement with us, it could not have wanted us to deny our identity and it did not. Therefore, naturally, we will also represent the interests of employees in Parliament and we will not basically change our views. It is important that we take the requests and demands of employees into Parliament instead of explaining and mediating the government's measures to our members. This is not what they expect from us. [Csala] How can this be made consistent with the discipline in the parliamentary group? [Nagy] I cannot say anything about this at the moment because I do not know what discipline in the parliamentary group will mean for the MSZP. We will probably have conflicts but we would like these to remain manageable and possible to solve. [Csala] At the moment, you are chairman of the MSZOSZ, leader of the local social insurance administration board for pensions, and future parliamentary deputy. Are these not too much together? [Magy] The law prescribes that I have to resign my position at the social insurance administration board within 30 days after receiving my mandate. I will do this. However, in my view, the chairmanship of the trade unions does not clash with being a parliamentary deputy. There are other examples of this in Europe. [Csala] Would you perhaps accept a governmental function or a ministerial position? [Nagy] I did not think of this even when I decided to run in the elections. As a matter of fact, one does not have to be a parliamentary deputy to become a government member. At the moment, I do not have such ambitions. [Csala] What possibilities can you see to solve the problems of social insurance? [Nagy] Short and long-term proposals will have to be drawn up in both areas. However, it is important for the two systems of social insurance to be completely separated both organizationally and financially by the end of the year. Health insurance is impossible to finance in its current form and, because of the links, it is a burden on the pension insurance system. Together, the two insurance funds struggle with a 150 billion forints deficit, therefore, we have to begin to collect the debts owed to us as soon as possible and to have the state assets handed over to the insurance boards immediately. [Csala] What are your views on the coalition possibilities? What would be the attitude of the MSZOSZ in case of a balanced coalition between the MSZP and the Alliance of Free Democrats? [Nagy] I believe that a coalition led by a strong MSZP will emerge. It would lead to many senseless conflicts between the government and the trade unions if the liberal economic program was implemented. I trust that this will not happen and this is why I ask everyone to go to vote on Sunday [29 May] and not to let themselves be influenced in their decision.
