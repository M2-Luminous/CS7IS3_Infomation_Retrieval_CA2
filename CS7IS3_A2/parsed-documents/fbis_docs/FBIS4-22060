FBIS4-22060 "jptot016__l94017" JPRS-TOT-94-016-L JPRS Terrorism FOUO 4 April 1994 LATIN AMERICA PERU Peace Agreement With Shining Path Peace Agreement With Shining Path Peace Accord Divides Group Abroad PY1804172094 Lima LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 4 Apr 94 pp 16-17 PY1804172094 Lima LA REPUBLICA Spanish BFN [Report by Angel Paez] [Text] The Shining Path [SL] cells in Europe have also become divided over Abimael Guzman Reinoso's decision to reach a peace agreement with the government. One group, headed by Luis Arce Borja and Adolfo Olaechea Cahuas, is against a dialogue with the government, while the other, headed by a close relative of Guzman, is in favor of laying down arms. The Sol Committee in Paris, in a bulletin which it started publishing recently, confirms its obedience to the self-styled "President Gonzalo" with the argument that "the great masters of the proletariat (also) carried out negotiations and signed peace agreements," and accused a "small black group" of questioning the SL leader's decisions. According to the publication -- which unlike EL DIARIO INTERNACIONAL, whose editor is Luis Arce Borja, does not indicate the name of its editor -- this opposition group is "made up of a handful of opportunists who have banded together in a crazy and heated attempt to divide and create confusion in lashing out against the peace agreement proposed by our leadership." Apparently Luis Arce Borja, who lives in Brussels, and Adolfo Olaechea Cahuas, who heads another "Sol Peru Committee" in London, form the "small black group." Arce and Olaechea have both stated through their publications that the peace agreement being negotiated between Abimael Guzman Reinoso and President Alberto Fujimori is a great hoax, as they maintain that the letters were not written by the SL leader, nor is it he who appears in the videos, but rather an actor who looks very much like him. But the basis for Arce and Olaechea's argument is that there isn't a single note from Guzman explaining the grounds for the proposal for a dialogue with the enemy. Arce even created an "interview" with Guzman, fabricated from old interviews and documents, in which he is made to say that an agreement with the regime is unfeasible. In this regard the Sol Peru Committee in Paris states that those who maintain "with great insolence that President Gonzalo's letters and his proposal for a peace agreement are false and an invention have no arguments left in view of the overwhelming truth, (because) they will have to argue against 2,500 prisoners of war from throughout the country who have declared through a communique that `they will not take a single step without President Gonzalo's guidance,' also repudiating the provocation and black campaign against the proposed peace agreement." The Sol Peru Committee in Paris refers to the documents issued last December by SL members held under arrest in Miguel Castro Castro prison in Canto Grande, which endorse Guzman's letters to President Alberto Fujimori and uphold "the new decision and definition to strive for a peace agreement, (because) the people need it." The document drafted by the SL members in France -- which clearly refers to the groups abroad that have sided with Oscar Ramirez Durand, "Comrade Feliciano," who is against the peace agreement and acknowledges Guzman's leadership only until the second SL Congress, which is when "Feliciano" will allegedly take the reins of the organization -- asserts that "the opportunists and alleged `upholders' of the peoples' war who have settled in Europe will not be able to shout (...) that 2,500 prisoners of war of the Communist Party of Peru are "crazy," "stoned," or have been declared under "psychological pressure," and less still that they `have sided with Fujimori's government.'" The document goes on to state: "They will have to bite their dirty tongues and swallow the disgusting things they have said," "(because) one (cannot) label fellow comrades with renowned devotion as people who have `surrendered' or as `repentants,' which is how the black campaign against the peace agreement intends to describe them: Maria Pantoja, Martha Huatay, and Angelica Salas Osman Morote, who met with President Gonzalo, and (Comrade) Miriam (Elena Iparraguirre Revoredo) have passed on President Gonzalo's instructions." The bulletin is more precise: "(The members of the `small black group') will not be able to direct their disgusting charges against clean militants such as Edmundo Cox, Sybila Arredondo, (Victor) Zavala Catano, Maritza Garrido Lecca, etc., with the purpose of creating division in the work of the Communist Party of Peru abroad." Cox Beuzeville ia the author of a letter to Colonel Gabino Cajahuanca, director of the Castro Castro prison, in which he explains his efforts to convince his comrades to struggle for the peace agreement. He writes: "My commitment is full, total, unconditional, public, decided, and definite, to achieve what everybody needs: the peace agreement." The bulletin of the Sol Peru Committee in Paris published the letter from Cox Beuzeville and the prisoners of Canto Grande advocating obedience to the new guidelines of Guzman Reinoso. The letter says: "We strongly and unavoidably adhere to our leader, to our dear and respected President Gonzalo, with firmness and determination for the new great decision: the struggle for the peace agreement!" In these terms the SL cells in Paris show their total disagreement with the position taken by Olaechea Cahuas and Arce Borja, known for their SL propaganda, who are at large and under process of extradition. The two, through DIARIO INTERNACIONAL, contend that "agreeing with Fujimori's `letters' means disregarding the general political guideline of the revolution established by Abimael Guzman, and denying the validity of the party's program, the strategic objective of which is the seizure of power throughout the entire country and the creation of the Popular Republic of Peru." The two leaders also said that "the people's war cannot be negotiated, and there cannot be any dialogue with this reactionary and criminal government. The decision made by the revolutionaries is to destroy the old state and finish off the Armed Forces and the police" and "these objectives cannot be achieved with deals or `peace talks.' The class struggle cannot be auctioned off." This position is the same as that held by those who publish EL DIARIO in Lima. Last January EL DIARIO published a communique from the "Committee of Relatives of Political Prisoners, War Prisoners, and Those Missing of Peru" attacking the SL leaders who are in favor of the peace agreement. The communique says: "We raise our voices and belligerent souls to denounce, condemn, and reject with the deep hate of the classes the sinister actions of that handful of known and proven capitulators, informers, and cowards who would not sacrifice their lives, the execrable revisionist bitches (...) who have been mobilized through different prisons of the country to spread the so-called peace agreement, openly crying out for capitulation, reporting everyone, and taking refuge in the repentance law." This is the combat line of Oscar Ramirez Durand, Comrade Feliciano, which consists in asserting that the entire campaign for the peace agreement is a plot to destroy the Communist Party of Peru-Shining Path, PCP-SL, to put an end to the "people's war" and mainly kill Guzman. "(This sector) persists alone in the counterrevolutionary hoax within the premeditated, treacherous, and furious plan to murder President Gonzalo, thus uselessly attempting to spread capitulation among our heroic people, liquidate the party, and destroy the people's war." And in the recent issue of EL DIARIO, February-March, justifying the attack against the Metro commercial center and the fire at the Callao Naval Base, among other actions, the subversives say that the attacks "show in fact that the people's war continues unavoidably." But the Shining Path leaders of the Sol Peru Committee in Paris say that the sabotage is an action of the PCP-SL with the objective of demonstrating its capacity for negotiation, carried out based on "the new great decision and definition" which is the struggle for the peace agreement. "What would be the purpose of a `peace agreement' in Peru?" asks Arce Borja in an article in EL DIARIO INTERNACIONAL. He answers: "The only ones who will benefit from a `peace agreement' are exclusively the enemies of the Peruvian people, mainly the imperialist forces." According to the Sol Peru Committee in Paris, Arce Borja and Olaechea Cahuas would be the "opportunists and sellouts who are carrying out a dirty campaign with the so-called pretext of supporting the people's war and attacking our leadership. They are reactionary dark leaders whom the people will know how to punish." LA REPUBLICA was able to contact by telephone a spokesman for the Shining Path cells in France, who only confirmed the authenticity of the bulletin. LA REPUBLICA also talked with Adolfo Olaechea Cahuas, SL chief in England and head of another Sol Peru Committee in London, who acknowledged as real the French bulletin and identified its writers. Maximiliano Duran Araujo, brother-in-law of Osman Morote Barrionuevo and brother of Teresa [Juana Teresa Durand Araujo de Morote, aka Comrade Doris], is an SL leader on the Central Committee who has been living in France for years, and is currently in hiding. We asked Olaechea if he was the one. He said: No, it is someone else. A relative of Guzman.
