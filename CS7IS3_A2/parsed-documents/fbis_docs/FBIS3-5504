"Such practices deprive consumers from freedom to choose," an official at the agency said. In the face of a shortfall in last year's rice crop because of the cool and rainy summer, Japan early this year began to sell foreign rice imported from Thailand and China either mixed with domestic rice or separately. But some retailers and wholesalers are requiring customers to buy domestic and foreign rice as a set, since long-grain rice imported from Thailand is unpopular with Japanese consumers, who favor medium and short-grain rice as a food staple.
