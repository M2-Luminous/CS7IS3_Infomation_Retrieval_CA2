This was confirmed by the participants in a conference here today of leaders of Russian defense enterprises. The avalanche-like nature of conversion and the reduction in state orders and state budget funding are the main reasons for the sharp slump in production. According to Viktor Glukhikh, chairman of the Russian Federation State Committee for the Defense Branches of Industry [Goskomoboronprom], production has slumped over the past three years by 78 percent. The committee's action plan for the coming two years is intended to help rectify the situation in these sectors that possess a high scientific-technical potential, modern technologies, and a powerful manufacturing base. The plan was brought to the attention of the enterprise leaders. It is a document of almost 90 pages, which deals with practically all spheres of the defense industry and envisages the development of six major programs in the industry and their handover for government consideration. It also contains recommendations on improving the legislative base. The enterprises should themselves also seek a way out of the complex situation more energetically, Viktor Glukhikh thinks. There are considerable prospects in this area, in his view, linked with the development of programs for defense industry enterprises that take deeper account of the interests of regions. Those taking part in the conference said that priority measures should include increasing the preliminary payment for state orders from 20 to 75 percent, the financing of new developments, and the length of state order periods from one year to five years.
