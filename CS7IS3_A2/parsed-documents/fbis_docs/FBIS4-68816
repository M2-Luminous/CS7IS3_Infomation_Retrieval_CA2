Of the 25 City Assembly members elected in April, only two are "party" deputies. This is an achievement of multiparty democracy in St. Petersburg. Which definitely shows that no party structures have a real influence on political processes in the city. At the microlevel, on the regional scale, even federal parties, which distinguished themselves by an advertising blitz on the threshold of 12 December, do not have enough symbolic potential. And St. Petersburg, by the way, is not a provincial town where "serious" politicians have yet to tread--it is the "second capital," which many party builders call a political testing ground for their initiatives. What is the cause of such a flop? As usual, the losers began summing up the results by looking for someone to blame. They accused the authors of the rules of the game, who set the signature collection threshold at a level unsurmountable for some parties; they accused the city authorities, who extended the elections by an extra day, which destroyed the financial and tactical plans of party headquarters staff; and they accused the Moscow party leadership, who had not shown enough attention to St. Petersburg grass-roots cells... Everybody got it. Party functionaries have a much more difficult time recognizing their own mistakes. Why, one would ask, did the election campaign, which theoretically should have consolidated party ranks, in reality result in complete confusion? Before we answer this question we need to ask another: Was there a boy? Essentially, all the parties in St. Petersburg are imitations. It is hard to talk about them as structures representing social movements or trends in political thought. Formerly numerous political organizations in St. Petersburg completely crumbled. Over the past half-year rallies and other events have attracted between 10 and 50 people, which does not come close even to attendance at Krishna-ite Saturday processions. Movements have disappeared, their only accomplishment being that several club organizations have emerged in each part of the political spectrum. They did not have enough time to form stable connections with the corresponding sociocultural strata at the city level, remaining merely relics of the times of political activism. Ideological connections proved no more reliable, which also is natural. It is hardly likely that narrow-ideology organizations (and the liberal, social-democratic, communist, and nationalist parts of the spectrum are represented by three to five small structures) could solidly "cover" the corresponding strata of the electorate. The mind of the city man on the street does not identify them with broader and not necessarily political preferences. In addition, most party structures did their best to lose their "political face." Their leaders assumed that if they dissolved in hastily slapped-together electoral blocs and acquired stereotype rhetoric on the subject of economic "improvement," they would become more attractive to the depoliticized population. Only the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] and the CPRF [Communist Party of the Russian Federation] escaped being merged into blocs of the most unimaginable configurations; the rest scattered in every direction. For instance, the Communists-Bolsheviks, the RKRP [Russian Communist Workers Party], and Working Leningrad disguised themselves as patriots in the Motherland bloc; the Republicans, the SvDPR [Free Democratic Party of Russia], and the SDPR [Social Democratic Party of Russia] split three ways... Finally, there was a specific trait of local political leadership that had an effect. The independence of "second capital" politicians, traditional for this city, who often tried to compete with the Moscow "stars," only weakened the old personified image of parties. This special trait of the city party elite defined, by the way, the style of political interaction between various organizations. For instance, "democrats" who knew each other from the National Front, now finding themselves in some 15 different parties, made an effort to retain the luggage of old interpersonal confrontation. For them, discarding it meant crossing out their own political biography, to be deprived of the indulgence to commit the sin of independent "party organizational development." Therefore, contrary to the hopes, the elections could not systematize the political market in St. Petersburg and become a beginning of organizational and ideological integration of party structures--after taking into account the political needs of the population. Was there anything new in the behavior of the political leaders after the unsuccessful elections? Nothing that is principally new. Perhaps there are fewer "combiners" still searching for a cover in the form of some bloc or another--some have decided now to try their luck on their own. Democratic Russia's obvious disintegration contributes to sovereignization and the search for an individual "political face." The elections have demonstrated the worth of its internal strength and moral unity: Even a conference decision that Democratic Russia is to participate only in the Democratic Unity of St. Petersburg bloc was ignored by many party leaders. After the elections Democratic Unity, on a shared basis with like-thinkers from All Petersburg, began to put together "Gaydar's party." And run into a problem again: Gaydar has bequeathed the cell organization to Arsenal plant director Vitaliy Sychev and State Duma Deputy Yuliy Rybakov. The result was a dispute between democratic movement romantics and pragmatists-privatizers from directors' corps and Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee for Administration of State Property] structures. Parting ways with this company is the Christian-Democratic Union [KhDS], with its roughly 40 members. State Duma Deputy Vitaliy Savitskiy, to the great displeasure of his Democratic Russia colleagues, announced the creation of a "populist party." The KhDS, which has proclaimed itself the only real political force, is beginning to test the unfamiliar populist rhetoric, having proclaimed a merciless struggle against "pseudo-democracy," "compradorial bourgeoisie," and "red directors," against "democrats getting into bed with mafiosi structures..." The only example of political integration is the city's Public Chamber set up by 10 blocs. It is at the same time an example of how highly St. Petersburg politicians value their party principles. Opposition to Mayor Sobchak brought together communists, Zhirinovskiyites, nationalists, the NTS [People's Labor Union], socialists, and radical Democratic Russia members... The public actually is not shocked by this. While the politicians are busy playing marbles among themselves, the public does quite well without them.
