As a result of the undiplomatic remarks made by the French ambassador to Bonn, this time it was different: One expected a clarifying word on the alleged or real clouding of bilateral relations. In the statements immediately after the incident mutual relations were hastily hailed; however, such solemn declarations have become hackneyed over the decades. Thus it was good that Kinkel was able to come up with something practical in Paris: the idea of presenting a kind of joint government program for the period that the two countries hold the presidency of the European Union [EU] -- Germany in the second half of 1994, France in the first half of 1995. This is a lofty word for the cumbersome task of mediating, which one has to fulfill as EU president. Moreover, it is domestic policy that will play the main role in the two countries during this time: in Germany because of the Bundestag elections in October, in France because of the presidential elections in spring 1995. It is, therefore, uncertain whether good resolutions can translate into noteworthy action. Still, it is some progress that an attempt will be made to break out of the shortness of breath of the six-month rhythm in the EU. In Paris, Kinkel spoke of a "joint vision for the future of the Union." This is exactly what is lacking. In Germany the idea is fading that Europe could be unified on the basis of federal states; with the formulation "enlargement and simultaneous deepening," Bonn is asking for something like the squaring of a circle. In France, large parts of the political class are convinced that German unification has altered the foundation of the policy of integration -- which is why Ambassador Scheer only expressed a truism. Views in Paris, however, differ as to what conclusions should be drawn from it. Franco-German talks have for a long time been dominated either by day-to-day political business, or they have degenerated to noncommittal phrases. It is high time Bonn and Paris compared what each side means when they speak of "Europe." The councils and bodies where this can be discussed have existed for a long time. All that is needed is to use them.
