This episode is 130 minutes long, is moderated by NHK commentator Takashi Yamamoro, and carries separate live interviews with Tomiichi Murayama, Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ) chairman; Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) President Yohei Kono; Komeito (Clean Government Party) Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa, and Sakigake (Harbinger) representative Masayoshi Takemura, who is also chief cabinet secretary. Commentator Naoki Tanaka joins the program as an interviewer. At 0004 GMT, after introducing the program, Yamamoto starts interviewing SDPJ Chairman Murayama. When asked if the successor of outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa should be chosen from the SDPJ, the largest party in the coalition, Murayama says, "Before choosing a new prime minister, it is important to seek an agreement within the coalition through discussions on the framework or character or policies of the new cabinet." He adds that it is premature to discuss the possibility of his being chosen as the new prime minister. When asked what the SDPJ thinks of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) head Tsutomu Hata, who is foreign minister and is said to be a hopeful candidate, Murayama states, "Rather than saying that the SDPJ feels antipathy against Mr. Hata himself, our party, frankly speaking, feels antipathy against Shinseito's political methods." Murayama stresses that the current framework of the coalition parties should remain unchanged and thus hold in check the Shinseito-Komeito move toward creating a new framework, wherein the two parties said that the ruling parties should share common policies. He says his party will not join the Japan New Party (JNP)-proposed parliamentary group called Reform (Kaikaku) which Shinseito and Komeito are likely to join. Murayama then reiterates that it is necessary to effect policy coordination within the ruling parties. Asked by Tanaka how the SDPJ is dealing with North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons, Murayama replies: "Because the United Nations has not yet come to a final conclusion, it is necessary to carry out thorough discussions before making any decision. Meanwhile, the DPRK should accept nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. I think it is matter of course that we should not drive North Korea into a corner by threatening to impose sanctions, and therefore we should avoid making North Korea become isolated. However, if it should become unavoidable for the United Nations to adopt resolutions on taking sanctions, we will have to take actions in concert with the United Nations. But Japan has its own limitations, and it is possible for Japan to take action in accordance with UN resolutions but within its own limitations." Returning to the issue of the new cabinet, he rules out joining the new government that will be created mainly by LDP Vice President Watanabe, Shinseito, and Komeito. The interview ends at 0020 GMT. LDP President Kono then takes a seat. Asked how the LDP will act to deal with the current political turmoil, Kono says: "What our party has to consider first is how to deal with domestic economic affairs and the relations between Japan and the United States. The current Japanese-U.S. relations are at a very critical stage. The LDP will continue to do its utmost to correct such a situation." On the domestic front, Kono criticizes Hosokawa for failing to take initiatives in dealing with economic issues. When asked to comment on LDP Vice President Watanabe's possibly leaving the LDP, Kono rules out such a possibility. Kono then discusses the LDP's views on a move toward a political realignment and on the achievements of the Hosokawa government. He terms Hosokawa's having enacted political reform-related bills as deserving praise. Asked if the LDP hopes to return to power by allying with other parties, Kono notes "under the current situation, in which the new cabinet may be formed without elections, it is possible to ally with other parties which share common policies, and we have to seek such a possibility." At 0042 GMT, an interview with Komeito Secretary General Ichikawa starts. When Yamamoto asks how he views the criticism that the Hosokawa government has been led by Ichikawa and Shinseito Secretary General Ozawa, Ichikawa answers that the cabinet is run based on an agreement between the ruling parties. He says the ties that have bound the coalition partners together were broken after the political reform bill was enacted, and he notes there is serious gap in policies between the ruling parties. On the question of the possible framework of a new cabinet, he states: "We are very eager to hold frank discussions with the SDPJ. Although it is important to discuss who will be the next prime minister, we have a duty to the people to create a cabinet that can cope with issues which Japan will face soon or later." He adds, "In fact, our party is tired of coordinating policies with the SDPJ." Asked when the ruling parties will decide on a new cabinet, Ichikawa answers, "Yesterday we agreed to decide on the new prime minister at a plenary session of the Diet on Thursday [14 April] or Friday at the latest." In this connection, Yamamoto asks if there is a possibility of parties allying with LDP Vice President Watanabe. Ichikawa answers, "I am of the opinion that Mr. Hata is the most qualified person in view of maintaining the current framework of the coalition government. But the SDPJ and Sakigake say they oppose this opinion on the grounds that the government will be led by Shinseito and Komeito if Hata is chosen. However, when I ask them to further discuss the details of the ruling parties' basic agreements to deal with such upcoming issues as the DPRK and tax reform issues, they say that this is not necessary and that Komeito is trying to expel them from the coalition government. I think that if they continue to reject these proposals, we will then have to choose another alternative." The interview concludes at 0100 GMT. Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary and head of Sakigake, is then interviewed on issues such as the future political realignment. Asked about the reason for the deterioration of relations between his party and the JNP, Takemura says that Hosokawa's favoritism toward Shinseito and Komeito is the major cause. Asked if Sakigake will join the JNP-proposed Reform parliamentary group, Takemura answers, "No." On the issue of a political realignment, Takemura says that it is now an outdated concept to divide political parties into LDP and non-LDP parties. Yamamoto then asks how the framework of the new government should be constructed and asks whether it is impossible for Sakigake to get along with political parties or groups led by Shinseito's Ozawa. Takemura replies: "I do not know. In addition to our party, within the coalition government there are parties which are increasingly opposed to Shinseito's manner." Asked whether his party will support Hata as prime minister, Takemura says it depends on whether or not the current coalition partners can make a fresh start. He stresses that now is the time to break the "dual-power" structure. Asked about his party's role in forming a new government and the framework of it, Takemura says, "We will present our proposal at an early date." The interview ends at 0118 GMT.
