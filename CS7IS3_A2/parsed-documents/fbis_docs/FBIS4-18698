FBIS4-18698 "drweu068_p_94008" FBIS-WEU-94-068 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 GREECE * PASOK Developments, Succession Discussed * PASOK Developments, Succession Discussed 94P20623B 94P20623B CSO [Editorial Report] While the opposition New Democracy (ND) party has received its share of attention in the Greek press, most newspapers focused on developments within the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), in light of its upcoming congress and the rumors about the succession to the PASOK leader, Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou. It is generally accepted that the April PASOK congress will be the last with Papandreou as leader and that the prime minister intends to run for the presidency in 1995, writes Stavros Liyeros in the 27 March Athens daily I KATHIMERINI. The congress is therefore viewed as a "way station" during which potential successors will affirm themselves and alliances will be sealed in view of the "final battle." The absence of ailing Minister of National Economy Yiorgos Yennimatas has resulted in a "huge vacuum" and a lot of concern, for the election of PASOK's most popular official to the party leadership had been considered certain and had allayed fears of a succession struggle, Liyeros comments. The race for the succession, which is taking place in a "moving sands" environment, now includes the quartet of Minister of Interior Akis Tsokhatzopoulos, Minister of Defense Yerasimos Arsenis, Minister of Industry Kostas Simitis, and alternate Minister of Foreign Affairs Theodhoros Pangalos. While until recently Tsokhatzopoulos had been considered only Papandreou's "executive organ" and a significant factor in intraparty affairs, the picture has "totally changed" and the "Tsokhatzopoulos group" may presently be the most important intraparty apparatus. According to Liyeros, the interior minister is going to the congress with two main goals: -- Modify the existing--but not enforced--provision prohibiting the party's secretary general from simultaneously being a member of the government. -- Elect as many of his own supporters as possible to the new central committee to secure his reelection to the position of secretary general. Liyeros comments that this goal should not be difficult, for it coincides with Papandreou's. He also cites unidentified Tsokhatzopoulos aides as arguing that the prime minister has already selected the interior minister as his successor because "he would only entrust the government and the party to him." On the other hand, Arsenis will participate in the congress from a "position of strength," following a gradual and successful strategy of broadening his influence in the party and the parliamentary group, continues Liyeros. In recent years, Arsenis has become a "pole of attraction" for all dissatisfied PASOK members. He presently enjoys a broad network of supporters, among them, reportedly, Minister of Environment Kostas Laliotis, whose help has "symbolic" value, for it erases Arsenis' image of a "black sheep" and his past attempt to found his own party. According to Liyeros, Simitis has been attempting a "dynamic" comeback on the political scene in an effort to occupy the vacuum left by Yennimatas. Liyeros cites "reliable" sources as reporting that Simitis has concluded an alliance with PASOK luminary Vaso Papandreou and is hoping to secure the assistance of some members of the Yennimatas group. As the last potential successor, Pangalos, viewed as an "outsider," has been "desperately" attempting to enter the race. Liyeros comments, however, that the alternate minister's "garrulous and impulsive" statements are probably producing the opposite result. Liyeros cites Pangalos' own friends as saying that his greatest liability is "his own self." In addition, Pangalos lacks a power base in his party. Liyeros concludes that of the four candidates, Arsenis is reportedly attracting the support of many deputies, who "are not on the same wave length as Simitis, do not trust Pangalos, and believe Tsokhatzopoulos could not adequately fill Papandreou's shoes." A brief note in the 27 March I KATHIMERINI reports that according to recent information, Arsenis has been able to break out of his isolation and is maintaining open lines of communication with such PASOK luminaries as president of the Chamber of Deputies Apostolos Kaklamanis, Yiorgos Katsifaras, Minister of Public Order Stavros Papathemelis, Minister to the Prime Minister Andonis Livanis, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Yiorgos Papandreou, and Stavros Tzoumakas. Reportedly, Arsenis has also reinforced his ties with PASOK deputy Yiorgos Lianis, a relative of Dhimitra Liani-Papandreou. An article in the 30 March I KATHIMERINI reports on Simitis' speech to a large meeting of party officials. The industry minister criticized PASOK for its "inability to identify and prioritize goals and carry out its announced intentions." Simitis was also quoted as saying that "the control of economic power and the fairer distribution of income are far-away goals," and that "the context of politico-social life as it is now shaping fails to convince the public that our attempt at renewal will become reality." PASOK, Simitis continued, has been unsuccessful in finding a new role in a society where everything is changing. While the party leadership views criticism and "heretical" opinions as "importune," these usually express deeper social concerns or interests. The absence of internal confrontations undermines the party's programmatic and ideological renewal, as well as its future, Simitis is quoted as saying. The article points out that Simitis' criticism, sharp as it was, did not include concrete proposals for change. The 27 March Athens weekly TO VIMA TIS KIRIAKIS reports that the question of Dhimitra Liani-Papandreou's position in light of the upcoming PASOK congress has "bedeviled" the party, given that the prime minister's wife and director of his office has reportedly been an active PASOK member for a number of years. The initial solution of proposing her as a "meritorious" member of the central committee was rejected "out of hand" by the prime minister. The second proposal was to submit her candidacy to the local PASOK organization in Kifisia, to which she belongs, and launch her electoral battle for a central committee post from that base. The prime minister accepted the proposal and Liani-Papandreou was elected with 130 votes out of 220, or 60 percent, far outpacing other candidates.
