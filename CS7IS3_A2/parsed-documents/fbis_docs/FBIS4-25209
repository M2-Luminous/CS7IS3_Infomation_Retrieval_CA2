The move confirms the recent trend that to reassert central control and boost social stability, the leadership is restoring some elements of state planning. Top on the agenda of the conference, which will be the Fourth Plenum of the 14th Central Committee, will be working out mechanisms to ensure better state control of economic activities, particularly those of localities. An economic source said Beijing's goals included ways to ensure noninflationary growth; to contain fixed-asset investments by local governments and enterprises; to guarantee proper agricultural development; and to promote enterprise reform without excessive privatisation. And in view of the rapidly declining health of patriarch Deng Xiaoping, the Central Committee will also deliberate on measures to ensure political stability after his death. "The Third Plenum held last November endorsed a blueprint for bol+d market reforms," the source said. "The Fourth Plenum will in some ways rectify the Third Plenum resolution by determining what the authorities must do to prevent market forces from exacerbating dislocations such as inflation." It is expected to be called in the autumn after the leadership and party elders hold their annual informal meetings at the Beidaihe summer resort in August. The Central Committee is expected to institutionalise ways to prevent localities from earmarking too much funds for outside-state-plan projects. Mechanisms will be put into place to guarantee sufficient acreage for grain and essential produce. And in the course of the reform of state enterprises, Beijing will ensure that its hold on state assets will not be weakened and that not too many workers will become dispossessed. Analysts said the theme of the forthcoming plenum dovetailed with the policies of President Jiang Zemin and economic tsar Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, who believe in the need to use strong macrolevel measures to keep market forces within acceptable channels. It is understood that a team of drafters under Mr Jiang and Mr Zhu has started work on a resolution to be passed at the Fourth Plenum. According to a report in yesterday's edition of the pro-Chinese Hong Kong daily, Wen Wei Po, the plenum would be devoted to "the problem of management under the new system" of a market economy. The newspaper reported that while Beijing would mainly rely on economic levers and legal means to regulate the economy, "executive means are still required under certain circumstances".
