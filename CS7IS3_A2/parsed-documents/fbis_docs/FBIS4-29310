The protest for constitutional reform by Chalat Worachat which began with a big bang ended with just a heart-breaking whimper. After three weeks of tension and political cliff-hanging, the abrupt end of the protest by supporters of hunger striker Chalat last night and his decision to give himself up to police to face a lese majeste charge left observers almost dumbstruck. The surprise turn of events also left a host of questions that beg answers, particularly from Chalat himself and from the so-called Organisation for Political Reform. Have all the tireless efforts of Chalat's sympathisers and democratic aspirants for constitutional and political reform gone down the drain? Was this melodrama which had been played out in a deadly serious fashion merely a carefully-plotted political charade to fool the entire nation just for the sake of fun. If so it was not funny at all given the damages, which are yet to be estimated, already inflicted on our economy and on our investment climate. Or was it, after all, typical Thai politics which is unique in itself? Or has political sanity finally made a comeback to our childishly insensible political world? Although puzzled or disappointed by the twist, quite a few will certainly sigh in great relief now that the protest is over and the situation about to return to normal. For the Democrats, the unexpected event constituted a double triumph in a single day and it will certainly give them good, although unjustified, cause for celebration. It would be nice to be able to give credit to someone for bringing this unfortunate political event to a peaceful end. But there is no one that deserves the credit, not even Chalat himself who may well have instigated his own political demise by the sudden about face, for which he owes many of his supporters and sympathisers a reasonable explanation. He cannot take any credit and neither can the Democrats nor the Phalang Tham [PTP]. The Democrats have shown without any doubt that they had no intention whatsoever of ending the crisis despite the fact that it could probably have been resolved peacefully yesterday had the PTP rebels' motion for a panel to write a new charter been allowed to move forward, debated in Parliament and endorsed with the support of the Opposition. Yet, the Democrats chose to scuttle the motion and thus allowed the crisis to continue, at least until next Thursday when the House reconvenes. The adjournment of the parliamentary session by Deputy House Speaker Wan Muhamat Nomatha until next week which effectively blocked the motion was not coincidental, but plotted in advance in collaboration with the New Aspiration Party. This coup de grace is proof positive of the Democrats' political intrigue and treachery which are unequalled by their fellow MPs in the other parties. It is a special craft learned, nurtured and honed from decades of political experience by the Democrats. A victory and the sense of joy that goes with it, even temporarily, seems to be what the Democrats craved for, regardless of the cost that this country will be made to pay. If common sense and political sanity still prevail among the Democrats who seem to be blinded by their arrogance and stubbornness, the crisis should have ended with the Democrats rightfully claiming the credit. Yet, they knowingly and intentionally allowed the opportunity to slip past. After all, there are no real winners in this political charade. There are only losers -- and the real losers are undoubtedly the people in general. The unsavory political events in and out of Parliament yesterday were simply too much to digest, even by Thai standards. It was the ultimate in absurdity and defied all reason. Where do the people get their hopes from now after the end of this farce? What trust is there for a government which is only good at political manoeuvring and intrigue, but which has failed completely in national administration? Can we still place our hope and the destiny of this country in the hands of the same incompetent politicians a year, a month or a week longer? It's time we asked ourselves loudly whether we want a new hope -- perhaps a better future -- through a general election or should we just let ourselves go down the drain with this sinking ship of state?
