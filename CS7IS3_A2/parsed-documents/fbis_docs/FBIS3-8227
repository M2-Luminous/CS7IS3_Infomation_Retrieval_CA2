The wounded and some 47 family members were taken to Citluk, around 20 kilometres (12 miles) south of Mostar, in Spanish UN Protection Force vehicles, before being flown to the Croatian port of Split on British helicopters, said journalists. They were due to be flown to the Italian military base of Ancona where they are to be taken to a transit centre before flying on to hospitals in Britain, Denmark, Italy, Spain, the United States and the United Arab Emirates. The evacuation comes after a ceasefire between the Moslem-dominated Bosnian army and Bosnian Croat forces came into effect February 25. Some 55,000 Moslems are holed up in the shattered remains of eastern Mostar, battered by 11 months of shelling from Croat forces camped in the western districts of the historic city.
