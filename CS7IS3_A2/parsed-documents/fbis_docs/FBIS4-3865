He added that, in the fundamental interest of the two countries and the two peoples, bilateral relations should be raised to a new stage of overall cooperation, on the basis of seeking common ground while reserving differences, mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit. Extending his warm welcome to Hnatyshyn, Jiang said that in the 20 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries, bilateral relations have witnessed fruitful development in all fields. "We are pleased to see that during the past few years, China and Canada have overcome the temporary difficulties in bilateral relations under joint efforts and restored the vigorous development of such relations," the Chinese president said. Jiang said that he had very good talks with Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien when they met in Seattle in November last year, noting that Chinese Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua is in Canada on a visit now. He pointed out that "to enhance exchanges between leaders of the two countries is of great significance." It is learned that this is the first visit to China by a Canadian governor-general since 1987, and a senior Chinese diplomat here pointed out that Hnatyshyn's visit marks the resumption of political contacts between leaders of the two countries and the overall normalization of Sino-Canadian relations. On bilateral economic and trade relations, Jiang said that the two economies are highly complementary, and Canada has become one of China's major trade partners in the world. He continued that bilateral trade volume has grown by a large margin and that two-way investment and economic and technological cooperation have been continuously broadened. Jiang noted that Canada has valuable expertise in communications, telecommunications and hydropower, which are being emphasized in China's development for the next few years. He said that China's economy is in rapid and sustained growth, the market is expanding and the investment environment is becoming better, which provides good opportunities for the expansion of Sino-Canadian mutually beneficial cooperation. He asked his guest to urge the Canadian Government to seize the opportunities so as to further bilateral economic and trade cooperation. Hnatyshyn expressed his pleasure at visiting China, adding that bilateral relations date back to a long time ago and his current visit marks the further development of such relations. He said that "we admire China's achievement in its economic reform and believe that the Chinese people will have a better future." He noted that China is more and more important in the world, and Canada is ready to strengthen cooperation bilaterally, multi-laterally and in international affairs, so as to continuously promote relations between the two countries. On the human rights issue, Hnatyshyn expressed his understanding of China's domestic conditions, stressing that the human rights issue should not be linked to trade. He pointed out that Canada is willing to carry out discussions and cooperation with China on this issue. During the one-hour meeting, Jiang also briefed Hnatyshyn on China's economic development. Present at the meeting were Wang Bingqian, vice chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee; He Luli, vice chairman of the central committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang; Sun Yongfu, chairman of the reception committee and vice minister of railways; and Jiang Enzhu, vice minister of foreign affairs.
