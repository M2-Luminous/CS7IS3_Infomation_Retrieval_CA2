In view of the importance and sensitivity of the Court of Administrative Justice in the judiciary and in the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, we set out to interview Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Ferdowsipur, chief of this court, concerning this judiciary entity's accomplishments and procedures. What follows is the result of the interview. With thanks to him, we present the text of the interview for our esteemed readers. [RESALAT] What are the limitations and responsibilities of the Court of Administrative Justice? Was its formation an innovation by the Islamic Republic, or did it have a precedent? [Ferdowsipur] Ferdowsipur began by detailing the duties in the short history of the Court of Administrative Justice. He said: The Court of Administrative Justice actually exercises supervision over government administrative offices, units, organizations, and entities. It also deals with grievances from the public concerning guidelines and charters. It is a source of pride for the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran that we also have a substitute magistrate. If the chief justice is sick or on vacation, that magistrate can manage the branch court. Every branch court has an office manager, and it also has a secretary who helps register and distribute complaints and judgments. We have two review councils composed of five judges, and the chief of this court is the general chief of the court. The other four judges are chosen every six months in ballot voting by the chiefs of the branch courts, and they study the cases. One of the benefits of our constitution is the enactment of this same Article 173 concerning the formation of the Court of Administrative Justice. In previous governments we did not have such organizations and supervision over government offices. Of course, there was a legal body called the administrative council, but this administrative council was never established and implemented. After the great revolution of France, an Administrative Council Law was passed to supervise the work of the government. This council began its work under the supervision of the legislative power. According to them, this supervision has been successful so far. It is also the same way in England, except that it is under the supervision of the judiciary power. We do not have such supervision in other countries. [RESALAT] Must the plaintiff or the complaints definitely come from the people? [Ferdowsipur] If we refer to the proceedings of the Assembly of Experts we see that after this article was proposed debates occurred. In their remarks concerning the Court of Administrative Justice, some of the gentlemen paid no attention to the characteristics of the Court of Administrative Justice. However, Mr. Hashemi, president of the republic, gave a talk in which he said: "I, myself, was a defender of the Court of Administrative Justice, and my view was that we ought to have a powerful and authoritative organization to supervise the authoritative government organizations, one that will act with full power and decisiveness." The first session of the Court of Administrative Justice took place at the Higher Martyr Motahari School, chaired by Mr. Emami-Kashani. Because it was a newly established entity, they chose the best judges. The offices of chief of the Court of Administrative Justice were held by Grand Ayatollahs Rezvani, Feyz-Gilani, Musavi-Tabrizi, and Hojjat ol-Eslam Abbasifard. We have three pillars in the court, the plaintiff, the defendant (in the Court of Administrative Justice the plaintiff and the plaintiff side must definitely come from the people), in the sense that if the government, or the government office or institution or the prosecutor want to complain, it will be rejected in the court. He added: The defendant must definitely be the government, meaning the ministries, the district governor's offices, the general offices, the government organizations and any organization that procures the salaries for its workers through the government. Therefore, the Veteran's Foundation, the Martyr Foundation, and other foundations affiliated with the government, which are supervised by the president of the republic, the municipalities, the Urban Land Organization, and the seven-person councils can also be the defendants for complaints. The third pillar is the question of complaints, and this goes back to administrative violations, i.e., if any worker violates the laws and regulations, which pertain to his work, and if a complaint is lodged by someone about the violation, we will investigate these complaints. [RESALAT] In what way are illegal guidelines investigated and voided? [Ferdowsipur] If illegal guidelines are issued by the ministries or offices of governors-general and if someone complains about them, they are investigated, and if it is determined that they are illegal, the order to void them is issued. If we do not determine that it is illegal or if we have doubts, we seek an opinion from the Guardian Council. If the interested party complains about guidelines, letters of enactment, and charters, and guidelines for government organizations and centers, which is illegal, we are required to attend to it, and what we do is announce that it is illegal and order it nullified, or we announce that it is not illegal and issue a verdict of affirmation. [RESALAT] In what way can the people complain about government organizations, foundations, and municipalities? [Ferdowsipur] Our petitions have specific forms that are sold at the post offices in all the cities. The people can obtain the petition forms from the post offices, and the procedure for complaining is given on these forms. [RESALAT] What is the procedure for appealing and protesting the court's opinions? [Ferdowsipur] After the verdict is issued, if it is against the defendant, he has up to two months to protest and request an appeal. After we receive the information we study the request for appeal. Here either the original verdict is upheld and distributed for implementation or it is ruled deficient and sent to another court at the same level for reconsideration. [RESALAT] How many judges and branch courts deal with the cases? [Ferdowsipur] There were formerly 10 branch courts. This Court of Administrative Justice now has 20 branches. The chief of each branch is an experienced and committed judge with a record of service, and there is also a consultant. Likewise, after the verdict is approved on appeal it is distributed for implementation. If the verdict is against the defendant, the person who has executive responsibility and against whom the verdict was issued must carry out the verdict. [RESALAT] What happens if he does not carry out the verdict? [Ferdowsipur] We issue a reminder, and if he pays no attention we have a legal article called Article 21, which allows the branch court of the Court of Administrative Justice to terminate the employment of the executive official who refuses to carry out the verdict. This termination is in proportion to the violation, which has been committed. [RESALAT] What will happen if an executive official in a higher position does not carry out the verdict? For example, what will happen if the mayor of one of the districts of Tehran is convicted in the Court of Administrative Justice, but the mayor of Tehran, who is a higher executive official, does not carry out the verdict concerning his mayor from the court of justice? [Ferdowsipur] The implementation of the verdict pertains to the highest ranking executive official in that organization. For example, if we order the dismissal of the mayor of a district, the general mayor must implement it and if he does not, the highest level executive official, meaning the president of the republic, can do this. I told the chief of the branch court to carry out the law in accordance with the regulations he has and to coordinate it with me wherever he encounters problems. I coordinate with the highest ranking executive official to carry out that verdict. For example, regarding the position of president of one of the universities, we had a verdict on a complaint received from one of the professors of the university, which was issued for the professor and against that university. We had to implement Article 21, because this verdict was not implemented for about two years. I got in touch with the minister of culture and higher education and told him we have such prerogatives. I believe that we should not do such a thing without coordinating with the highest level executive official. He welcomed this, and because he was not familiar with the case the files were given to him to familiarize him with its details. He said that they would implement the verdict themselves if possible, and if not we were free to do as we wished under the law, and this is just what we did. [RESALAT] Where has the case gotten now regarding the dismissal of one of Tehran's regional mayors and his failure to obey the verdict from the court of justice? [Ferdowsipur] In this regard I have also heard that that official for the municipal district was sentenced to termination of employment. However, to keep from executing the verdict, they resorted to starting a rumor that he had been pardoned by the exalted leader. Then when Mr. 'Abbasifard told Ayatollah Yazdi, Ayatollah Yazdi said that he was the one who recommends pardons; how could this person have been pardoned by the exalted leader without me knowing? It is, therefore, nothing more than a rumor. Then they realized that the truth had been discovered. They worked in secret for a time and then were forced to carry out the order to dismiss the mayor of that district. [RESALAT] Do you have stronger procedures under consideration to carry out the orders of the Court of Administrative Justice? [Ferdowsipur] I have coordinated this subject with the minister of justice, with Ayatollah Yazdi, with other officials, with the Majles, and with the Article 90 Commission so they will support our verdicts so we can implement our verdicts decisively. God willing, we hope the issue will not arise. Second, if such a thing happens we will act in accordance with rules and regulations. [RESALAT] What is the difference between the General Council of the Court of Administrative Justice and the Supreme Court? [Ferdowsipur] Another organization we have is the General Council of the Court of Administrative Justice. This council meets once a week on Saturday. Verdicts that contradict each other are presented in this council. That is, if two similar complaints are presented in two branch courts and the issued verdicts are in conflict, these complaints are sent to this council to resolve the conflict. After a review, if it is decided that there is a conflict, a new vote is then taken on which verdict is correct. There is a general council both on the Court of Administrative Justice and on the Supreme Court, and it has law-making status, meaning that opinions issued by this general council have the force of law. The same is true of the national Supreme court, although the area of competence of each is different. [RESALAT] In the Court of Administrative Justice, may those who lack the credentials of an attorney represent the two sides in the consideration of the complaints? [Ferdowsipur] The interested party or his attorney may make the complaint. Of course, the attorney must be qualified and a member of the Attorney's Society. [RESALAT] Is it compulsory or optional to have an attorney at the Court of Administrative Justice? [Ferdowsipur] This issue was raised at a meeting of judicial officials and a decision was made that the attorney must be required. Of course, if the party himself does not want to get an attorney and says he will defend himself, we will not accept this and at the time of the trial officials must obtain a government attorney for him, because this is their right unless he himself has no interest. [RESALAT] What are the statistics on the court's backlogs and verdicts issued? [Ferdowsipur] Answering, the chief of the Court of Administrative Justice said: The total case backlog in all branch courts is 1,000 to 1,100 cases. About 100 cases arrive at each branch court each month. One of the distinctions of the Court of Administrative Justice is that every branch court is required to hear 70 cases month, meaning it must issue a verdict on them. If the number is less than this the court is reprimanded. If the number is between 70 and 120, in accordance with a measure we have this year it receives a commission. For the branch courts, which hear more than 120 cases, we give a prize to the three highest, and we have a court that completes 300 cases per month. Sometimes, however, when a case takes too long it is not the fault of the court of justice, because we must send one copy of the plea to the defendant, and sometimes the defendant does not answer for up to six months. [RESALAT] How far has the work on the seven-person land investigation councils gone? [Ferdowsipur] The work on the seven-person councils has been completed in the court. Of course, we have cases for which a verdict has not yet been issued, and they will also be heard. However, the final verdict will be given by a council designated by the Interests Discernment Council consisting of a judge confirmed by the chief of the judiciary, a Majles deputy confirmed by the speaker of the Majles, and a person chosen and confirmed by the minister of agriculture. These three people are a council, and they must study all the cases of the seven-person councils that have ended here with the issuance of a verdict. Recently a set of guidelines for these councils was presented at a meeting of judicial power officials by the minister of justice and was approved. The three-person councils will be formed to deal with these kinds of cases in order to determine their outcome. [RESALAT] In conclusion, do you have any special recommendations for the public and for the two parties to a case? [Ferdowsipur] Some complaints are time consuming. The complaint is rejected and they complain at another court, meaning they present their complaints several times. It would be better for people like this to consult with a judge or a lawyer to deal with the problem. A judge is not anyone's family. When he issues a verdict the right to protest is retained for individuals, but when the verdict is finalized it must be obeyed. Send individuals to give advice which, in the words of His Holiness the Imam (peace be upon him), will be plastered on the walls.
