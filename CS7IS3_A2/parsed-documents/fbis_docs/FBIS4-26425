Beijing is believed to share fears in the territory that a flood of mainlanders will flock towards Hong Kong after the handover. Growing friction between people and soldiers in Shenzhen are also a source of unease in Beijing. The government fears that this friction will be repeated in Hong Kong because the same units are to be deployed in the territory. China's Defence Ministry has authorised a huge outlay in cash and loans to expand military bases in the special economic zone and the adjacent Bao'an district. The executive vice-mayor, Wang Zhongfu, revealed the plans in remarks made on Tuesday, according to extracts of the speech carried in the Shenzhen Special Zone Daily. "Our aim should be to consolidate national defences and foster a stable social and economic environment," he said. Over the next two years, border defences would be strengthened "to take into account Shenzhen's special location and historical mission". In the past three years, more than 78 million renminbi (HK$69.3m [Hong Kong dollars] ) in funding and 190,000 square metres in additional land have gone into strengthening military bases in Shenzhen. An additional Rmb20m [renminbi] would be lent this year by the city for new military training centres, one of them at the Pinghu district base. In a sign that Beijing may be planning to increase the number of troops stationed in Shenzhen, Wang said finding jobs for families accompanying new soldiers would be a big task. A total of 598 spouses of soldiers had been given jobs in city departments over the past three years, and 380 children of soldiers placed in schools. Citizens drafted into military service would be given a "complimentary salary" of Rmb2,000 per year, 16 per cent more than draftees were paid in 1991. Wang's speech was made after Beijing declared Shenzhen a "double support model city" on June 3. "Double support" refers to attempts by Beijing since the Tiananmen Square massacre to blunt popular dislike of the military through a series of activities which espouse mutual support between civilians and bureaucrats on the one side and soldiers on the other. "With the handover of Hong Kong coming closer, carrying out 'double support' work well...will be beneficial for the convergence of Shenzhen and Hong Kong," Wang said. He said clashes between soldiers and civilians in Shenzhen, most of which occurred outside military bases, must be "cut off at the bud". "Our work still leaves a certain amount to be desired," he said. "We cannot be satisfied with the present situation and just sit on our haunches." To improve living conditions for soldiers, food allowances will be boosted by Rmb30 a month.
