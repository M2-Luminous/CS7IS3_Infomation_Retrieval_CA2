Here is a report by Shaban Arifaj from Kosova: [Arifaj] More than 200 armed Serbian policemen raided 22 Albanian families in this village under the pretext of searching for arms and Albanian adolescents who abandoned the former Yugoslav Army during 1991-92. A report that arrived today from the Kosova Information Center and the Council for the Defense of Human Rights and Freedoms in Mitrovice stresses that during the siege, the police arrested and physically maltreated several people, while many others were presented with summons to go to the police station. It is reported that the police behaved fiercely against the Albanian inhabitants of this village that borders Serbia. The expedition finally abandoned the village, taking several hunting weapons from the homes of the peasants, who had permission to keep the weapons, and threatened that unless the runaway adolescents are not handed over, the police violence will not cease. Reports from Mitrovice also confirm that the Serbian police this morning carried out the third consecutive search for Enver Brahimi, from the Tavnik quarter of the city, who has been living in Germany for three years now. Meanwhile, the Information Commission of the Kosova Democratic Alliance [LDK] first branch in Koder e Trimave in Prishtina reports that Nazif and Rexhep Beqiri were seriously maltreated at the police station in Dardani of Prishtina under the pretext that they were in possession of weapons.
