Therefore, in today's time of great change, upholding and developing Mao Zedong Thought and fostering the Yanan spirit is of extreme importance to the great undertaking of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. At present, the CPC Central Committee calls on the whole party to vigorously foster the main melody of our times. What is the main melody? It is Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, patriotism, collectivism, socialism, the dedicated spirit of the masses in the process of reform and modernization, the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation, and the outstanding revolutionary traditions created by the communists in the course of revolution and construction, including, of course, the Yanan spirit. Central leading comrades have said that grasping this main melody, emphasizing this main melody, and loudly singing this main melody can better inspire the people's enthusiasm, enhance the fighting spirit among the masses, concentrate the strength of the nation, arouse vigor in society, and push the times forward. We wholeheartedly support the decision by the CPC Central Committee, respond with all our strength to its call, and join the choir in singing the main melody to sing Yanan spirit more loudly, more clearly, and more forcefully. "We must publicize, restore, and develop the Yanan spirit (speech by Comrade Deng Xiaoping in 1980)," and let the "Yanan spirit shine forever," (words written by Comrade Jiang Zemin in 1990), and this is the purpose and goal of the struggle of the China Society for Studying the Yanan Spirit. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out in his speech, entitled "Implement the Principle of Adjustment, Ensure Stability and Unity," which he delivered on 25 December 1980, that "we must publicize, restore, and develop the Yanan spirit, the spirit we had shortly after the liberation, and the spirit with which we overcame difficulties in the early 1960's. We must first have confidence ourselves, then we can gather the masses and educate them on enhancing confidence." Along with reform, opening up, and the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of socialist economic construction, when we review these words today, we can more clearly see that situated in the initial stage of socialism, and at the time of changing the old economic system into a new one, we must develop the Yanan spirit all the more vigorously. The theory and practice of building a socialist market economy is a major breakthrough in the traditional concept and model, a great development of Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought, a very difficult and arduous undertaking never tried by our predecessors, and a brand new topic in the history of the development of our country. It requires us to inherit and develop the spirit of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts. The development of a socialist market economy is for the country's prosperity and affluence. Our country has limited strength, a weak foundation, and many difficulties, and this requires us to continue to inherit and develop the pioneering spirit which is characterized by independence, self-determination, self-reliance, hard struggle, willingness in spite of difficulties, diligence, frugality, being uncorrupt and law abiding, carrying out vigorous efforts in administration, and selfless dedication. We should launch activities among young people, and take this as the key point of our work, passing on the Yanan spirit from one generation to the next. According to the CPC Central Committee's strategic arrangement, our country's national economic development should reach the third goal of struggle to basically realize socialist modernization by the middle of the next century, that is, by the time of the 100th anniversary of the nation's founding. History determines that the realization of this grand blueprint and undertaking, which faces the whole party and the people of various nationalities in the whole country, rests on the century-spanning youths and their descendants. With what kind of spirit will they meet this historical mission? Can they properly take over the job of upholding the party's basic line unswervingly for 100 years and ensuring long-term peace and order in the country? Can they ceaselessly promote the great undertaking of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of it? Can they play an exemplary role and educate their offspring in struggling for the great ideals of communism in the generations to come? This is a big matter which has a bearing on the future and fate of our party, country, and nation. Grasping this strategic duty, we must coordinate closely with the relevant party and government departments and with the relevant groups of the masses, to help the broad masses of young people to gradually build up great faith and ideals when they carry out the solemn historical mission, to establish a correct outlook on life and the world, to inherit and develop the party's excellent traditions, to change their own subjective world when they change the objective world, and to grow up as socialism-building successors who have ideals, morals, culture, and discipline. We must care for clean government building, oppose corruption, and vigorously preach the noble Yanan spirit, which is characterized by being clean, law abiding, and selfless in dedication. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "We have scored quite a result in economic construction, and the situation is gratifying, and this is our country's success. But if the social atmosphere continues to deteriorate, then what is the point of economic success? A change of nature will take place in another area and then induce a change of nature in the whole economy, and such a development will lead to a world of rampant corruption, theft, robbery, and bribery." He also pointed out: "We struggle for socialism, not only because socialism has the conditions for developing the productive forces more rapidly than capitalism, but also because only socialism can eliminate the greed, corruption, and unfair phenomena inevitably produced by capitalism and other systems of exploitation." Indeed, this is an issue which has a bearing on our offspring, on communist ideals and faiths, on the inheritance of good traditions from the party and the nation, on the quality and hopes of the Chinese nation, on whether achievements made by hundreds of thousands of revolutionary martyrs can be consolidated and developed, and on whether socialism can be upheld and developed under the current world pattern. These sincere words and earnest wishes of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, a long-tested proletarian revolutionary of the older generation as well as the creator and architect of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, merit our deep thinking! Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, in the process of reform and opening up and socialist economic construction, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has time and again instructed us to do two kinds of work simultaneously, and equally firmly. What is the reason for the frequent deviations? This is a question which merits deep thinking. Since last summer, the central leadership has made decisions and clear arrangements to launch the struggle against corruption and for clean government; it said the struggle would be grasped for a long time and spiritual civilization construction must really become solid. The central leadership's determination has encouraged the whole party and the whole people and has fostered confidence in anticorruption and clean government. It is believed that under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee which has Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, problems will be solved step by step, and, in fact, some problems are being solved. In order to solve these problems, the whole party and people in the whole country will surely make the biggest efforts. In this area, we should have confidence and view it as an important duty of our own, we must do various tasks in society well and propose various constructive ideas, and, under the party's leadership, enthusiastically serve the purpose of anticorruption, clean government building, and correction of party work style. Our party's excellent traditions, especially the Yanan spirit, can play an active role in combating various kinds of corrupt phenomena and unhealthy practices. The three major work styles cultivated by Comrade Mao Zedong and the proletarian revolutionaries of the older generation, that is, linking theory to practice, fostering close ties with the people, and criticizing and accepting criticisms, are the three magic weapons ensuring that our party's purpose of wholeheartedly serving the people can materialize, as well as the main sign distinguishing our party from any other political party. The China Society for Studying the Yanan Spirit must look at how we can develop the party's three major work styles and overcome various kinds of healthy practices within the party. When these three major work styles are on the rise, the party will become prosperous, and this should be the irrefutable truth. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics has also integrated the universal truth of Marxism with the actual conditions of our country, followed our own road, and revealed the true rationale for building socialism with Chinese characteristics; it is a model for inheriting and developing Mao Zedong Thought. The theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics will surely lead the Chinese people to completely cast off poverty and build the country into a strong, prosperous, and modern nation. The publishing of Volume Three of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping has provided good conditions for us to profoundly and systematically learn from and understand Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory. Only by thoroughly grasping this scientific theory, can we do a good job in inheriting and developing the Yanan spirit and make our own contributions to building a socialist undertaking which has Chinese characteristics.
