"As the new chairman, 1 will try to maintain the social vision the commission has had to date, and the commission should have identical dispositions [regulations] toward all electoral commissions," stated Prof. Laczkowski. He believes that the guarantee of neutrality and apoliticalness, as well as the PKW's professionalism, lies in the commission's composition, which consists of three judges from each of the following: the Constitutional Tribunal, the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Administrative Court. The first matter that will face the commission under the leadership of its new chairman is that of clearing the accounts of the electoral committees. As of 11 January, only 64 of the 176 committees have turned in their reports to the PKW. The legal interpretation also requires that the closing date of the tenure of the gmina [parish, the smallest administrative unit] councils be specified. It is still not known whether the time limit will be the same for all gminas or whether it will be counted individually from the day of election. Prof. Laczkowski is 63 years old. He is a graduate of the Department of Law of the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan. As a specialist in public law, he lectures at his alma mater and also at the Catholic University in Lublin. Since 1990, he has held the office of judge of the State Tribunal. In 1991, he became a member of the governing body of the General Electoral Commissioner. Despite his new duties, the professor says that he has no intention of quitting his academic work.
