Claes said the troops would be redeployed from Croatia where they are currently stationed, and added that he was pleased the Serbs had abided by the NATO ultimatum Sunday thus averting air strikes. "The various warring parties in Bosnia must understand that we are ready to extend the (NATO) ultimatum if we realize that atrocities are continuing in other regions," he said. "And it goes without saying that we want to revive negotiations that could lead to a peace accord." Belgium has 1,038 UN peacekeeping troops in the former Yugoslavia, 708 of whom are in Croatia.
