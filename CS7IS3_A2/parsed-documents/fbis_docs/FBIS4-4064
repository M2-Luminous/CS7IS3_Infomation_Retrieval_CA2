He mobilized the people at the higher and lower levels across the province to further emancipate the mind, comprehensively implement the strategy of developing the export- oriented economy to bring along the entire economy, accelerate the progress of the patternized economy, and create a new situation in developing an open economy in Shandong. Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the provincial party committee, presided over the conference. Governor Zhao Zhihao's speech was divided into four parts: 1. Correctly understand the new situation facing the province's opening up and strengthen the sense of urgency of developing an open economy. Zhao Zhihao said: Since reform and opening up, particularly after the issuance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speech made during his tour to South China, the whole province has witnessed a developed economy, stable political situation, unity among the people, and social progress. The entire modernization drive has entered a new development period, and fairly big breakthroughs have been made in opening to the outside world. The province's open economy has begun to embark on the path of sustained and rapid development. At present, the new pattern of opening up in all directions and to all layers has been basically formed in the province; great breakthroughs have been made in the development of the export-oriented economy; noticeable achievements have been made in developing friendly contacts with foreign countries; and opening up has played a noticeable role in promoting national economic and social development. Zhao Zhihao pointed out: Although our province has made great achievements in opening to the outside world, we should also soberly recognize that compared with advanced provinces and cities, we still have disparities. The higher and the lower levels across the province should enhance the sense of responsibility and urgency, expand their work strength, and realistically turn the province's advantages of natural resources into advantages of the economy and competition, improve quality to promote quantity increase, and enable the province's economy to grow from a big one to a even stronger one. 2. Comprehensively implement the strategy of developing the export-oriented economy to bring along the entire economy and form a new advantage for our province's economic development. Zhao Zhihao said: It is necessary to optimize the economic structure, cultivate new industrial advantages, accelerate the building of market systems, cultivate new market advantages, press ahead scientific progress, form new technology and personnel advantages, give play to the impetus role of cities, strengthen the advantages of central cities, and establish new mechanisms by deepening reforms. 3. Concentrate efforts on priorities, expand measures, and promote a sustained, rapid, and sound development in the open economy. Zhao Zhihao said: To comprehensively implement the strategy of developing the export-oriented economy to bring along the entire economy, we must grasp the key points, pinpoint the priorities, strengthen measures, and strive to make new breakthroughs as quickly as possible. It is necessary to optimize the province's overall plan of opening to the outside world, raise the overall quality of opening up, continue to implement the strategic policy of opening all parts of the province to the outside world, making breakthroughs in some key areas, pressing the work ahead step by step, combining the efforts of the eastern part of the province with that of the western part, accelerating development, stabilize and improve the eastern part, accelerate development in the central part, and adopt special policies to support the western part. We should regard using foreign capital as the most important step in the development of the open economy, realistically regard the utilization of foreign capital as the key point for stimulating national economic growth, and grasp this work firmly. We should not be afraid of running an enterprise in the red as long as it is in line with the industrial policy of the state, is efficient, and is export-oriented; not fear letting foreign businessmen hold a big portion of shares in general trades, occupy a part of the market, or earn money. We should be bolder and give a free hand in inviting business and introducing capital. It is necessary to implement the strategy of developing various kinds of markets, develop markets at home and abroad, give emphasis to turning enterprises into industrialized and international enterprise groups, actively develop enterprise groups and companies in foreign countries, and persist in setting high standards and a high starting point in the course of accelerating the development of all sorts of development zones. At present, our province has established 62 state-grade or provincial-grade development zones of various descriptions. In principle, no new development zones will be established in the near future. As for those development zones that have been approved, we must give different guidance, persist in setting a high starting point, and make them have distinctive features. It is necessary to strengthen the service systems and realistically solve the prominent problems existing in the development of the current open economy. 4. Further strengthen leadership, form a joint force, and do a good job in the battle of opening to the outside world. Zhao Zhihao said: Comprehensively implementing the strategy of developing the export-oriented economy to bring along the entire economy and accelerating the pace of linking up with the international economic track is a new task, as well as a new test for our people at all levels. We must further strengthen leadership, mobilize the enthusiasm of all trades and professions, turn them into a powerful joint force, and resolutely fight well this battle of crucial importance. To achieve this, we must further emancipate the mind, intensify study and research, strengthen external propaganda, do a good job in building contingents, and strengthen this joint force. Zhao Zhihao pointed out: Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, expanding opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability is the overall situation of this year's work. We should properly handle the relations of reform, development, and stability, always uphold the principle of taking a two-handed approach in work and be tough with both, pay simultaneous attention to grasping economic work as well as propaganda and ideological work, fighting corruption, and promoting honesty. The provincial party committee and the government are firmly convinced that as long as the higher and the lower levels across the province unswervingly implement all central principles and policies on reform, opening up, and modernization, promote the spirit of fearing no hardships, are unwilling to lag behind, are making earnest efforts to do practical things, and are vying to create first-grade achievements, we will surely be able to comprehensively create a new situation in developing our province's open economy and triumphantly fulfill the grand objective of modernization.
