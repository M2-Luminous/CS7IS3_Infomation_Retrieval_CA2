Consequently, on Saturday 7 May, Claude Terrazzoni, Aerospatiale Aircraft Division's director, said that in the coming weeks Airbus Industrie will begin the second phase of studies on the project named A3XX, without interrupting the feasibility study it is engaged in jointly with Boeing. Three of the world's great manufacturers (Boeing, Airbus, McDonnell Douglas) work on this program: in no way will one be caught napping by the competition. At the moment, the project is in the very preliminary feasibility study phase. According to Aerospatiale, the market, mainly in the Asia-Pacific region, could accommodate a 60-craft annual production by 2010 and support this pace to 2020. The French aircraft builder--according to Mr. Terrazzoni--is afraid that cooperation with Boeing could be just a "deceptive ploy." Two months ago, this cooperation has been received with some skepticism by the European manufacturer, which is worried about losing its full liberty of action. Today, the French fear that the Americans will launch their own craft based on the 747-400. They feel that Boeing's recent announcement to build an extended-range 777 two-jet version, has confirmed their suspicions. According to Mr. Terrazzoni, this aircraft "would compete directly with the existing B747-400 four-jet craft, which will force Boeing to modify the B747-400 and begin studies on a new larger aircraft." The French have clearly decided not to let this market pegged at $220 million (1.25 billion French francs [Fr]) escape them. But, for the moment, only two companies (British Airways and Singapore Airlines) have shown interest for an aircraft larger than 500 seats.
