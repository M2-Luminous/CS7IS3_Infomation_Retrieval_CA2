Nikolay Savchenko, head of the Ukrainian Navy press center, said the BSF command ordered the removal of all property from the storehouses of a hospital base at Nikolayev after the officers serving at it applied to join the Ukrainian Navy, "having lost any hope that a civilized solution will be found to the problem of the Black Sea Fleet." Savchenko said the BSF command was obeying only the orders and instructions of the Russian Defense Ministry, though the hospital base officers and employees were Ukrainian citizens. "The uncontrolled removal of property from bases situated on Ukrainian territory does not help to find a civilized solution to the problem of the Black Sea Fleet," Savchenko said. BSF spokesman Andrey Grachev told Interfax on Friday that more than 300 Ukrainian military officers, 10 of them armed with submachineguns, had burst into the base after officers serving at it applied to join the Ukrainian Navy.
