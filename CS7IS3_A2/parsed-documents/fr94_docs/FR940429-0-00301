FR940429-0-00301 FR940429-0-00016 Change: None. 51. Comment: Some commenters questioned what would constitute a student's ``reasonable attempt to obtain employment'' and questioned whether it would be fair to expect the student to be able to document, or even remember such attempts that may have been made many years ago. Discussion: In the absence of evidence to the contrary, a student who states that he or she made a ``reasonable attempt to obtain employment'' will be presumed to have done so. The student is simply being asked to sign a statement to that effect. Change: None. Section 682.402(e)(3)(iv) 52. Comment: Some commenters, while believing that borrower cooperation is important in an enforcement action undertaken against a school or other related parties, were concerned that a borrower may be unable to take time away from work, home, or other activities to travel to multiple court appearances needed to assist the Secretary or his designee in the enforcement action. The commenters believed that a borrower should be required to assist in an enforcement action only to the extent practicable for the borrower. Discussion: The discussion following comment 23 also applies to a false certification discharge. Change: None. Section 682.402(e)(5)(i) 53. Comment: Some commenters opposed the requirement that a borrower must assign to and relinquish in favor of the Secretary any right to a loan refund (up to the amount discharged) from any private or public fund. The commenters were particularly concerned with the effect they believed this requirement would have upon state tuition recovery funds. The commenters also believed that the Secretary has no statutory right to any claim against a state tuition recovery fund because the HEA fails to specifically provide the secretary with that right. The commenters noted that the section 437(c)(2) of the HEA limits the assignment to the Secretary of a borrower's right to a loan refund only to the borrower's rights ``*␣*␣*␣against the institution and its affiliates and principals.'' The commenters contend that there is no indication that Congress intended the Secretary to have access to state funds or to require states to participate economically in false certification discharges. The commenters believed that the HEA's omission of state tuition recovery funds (or any other private or public fund) reflects the principal of statutory construction ``expressio unius est exclusio alterius'' (the expression of one thing is the exclusion of another). Discussion: The discussion following comment 24 also applies to a false certification discharge. Change: The final regulations have been revised to exclude the portion of a public fund that represents public money. 54. Comment: Some commenters questioned why a borrower must assign to and relinquish in favor of the Secretary any right to a loan refund (up to the amount discharged) with respect to the enrollment agreement for the program for which the loan was received. The commenters believed that the assignment of a borrower's rights pursuant to the enrollment agreement would not gain anything for the Secretary. They were concerned that the borrower would be forced to surrender some rights (unspecified) unnecessarily, despite the statement in §682.402(e)(5)(iii) that permits the borrower (or student) to pursue legal and equitable relief regarding disputes arising from matters otherwise unrelated to the loan discharged. Discussion: The discussion following comment 25 also applies to a false certification discharge. Change: None. Section 682.402(e)(6)(i) 55. Comment: Some commenters objected to the requirement that a guaranty agency must review records available from sources other than the guarantor after receiving a false certification claim from a lender or a discharge request from a borrower. The commenters believed this requirement is logistically unrealistic and unnecessarily complicates and delays the processing of a false certification claim. Discussion: The Secretary believes that the guaranty agency is in the best position to consult with other knowledgeable parties concerning a school's alleged false certification of a student's eligibility to borrow. The Secretary believes that the 90-day time period allows sufficient time for an agency to examine the lender's false certification claim in light of the information available to the agency and to either pay or return the claim to the lender. Change: None. Section 682.402(e)(7)(ii) 56. Comment: Some commenters believed that a lender that resumes collection activity against a borrower who fails to submit the documentation required for a false certification discharge should be required to grant forbearance to the borrower to absolve the borrower of any delinquency status existing on the loan, including delinquency that occurred before the date the lender suspended collection activity. The commenters believed that the borrower's delinquency is generally the result of the borrower's inability to pay due to circumstances caused by the school. Discussion: The discussion following comment 36 also applies to a false certification discharge. Change: None. Section 682.402(e)(7)(iii) 57. Comment: Some commenters objected to the requirement that a payment received by the lender from or on behalf of the borrower after the lender filed a claim on the loan with the guaranty agency must be forwarded to the guaranty agency within 30 days of its receipt. The commenters contended that the guaranty agency is not the legal holder of the loan until it pays a claim, and therefore has no right to the payment.
