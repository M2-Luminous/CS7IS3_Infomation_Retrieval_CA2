Surveys show that the PP is either the first or second mass party in Turkey today. The old political balances are disappearing in Turkey in 1994. The wedding ceremony held at the Swiss Hotel yesterday was in a sense a metaphor for the True Path Party-Motherland Party [TPP-ANAP] wedding. President Demirel and ANAP leader Yilmaz were there together, symbolically announcing that there are no longer any differences between the two parties. The present ANAP is not Ozal's ANAP. Instead, it is a "Demirelized" center party that is more like the TPP. The PP stands opposite these two intermingled parties. What about the Social Democratic Populist Party [SDPP]? This pretentious party of the past has abandoned most of its political claims and is now a mere fourth party. We are aware of it now because it is a coalition partner, but it is hard to believe that it will find any supporters other than a few marginal artists in the future. At present, the total votes that can be collected by the rightist parties stands at 70 percent. The number of votes the leftist parties (if you still consider Bulent Ecevit the leader of a leftist party) can receive has gone down to 25 percent. What do we see behind these figures? While he was prime minister, Demirel had 129 corruption files prepared against the ANAP. He had the assembly approve some of them and had them sent to the Constitutional Court. The ANAP did not lag far behind. It sued the TPP for corruption as in the ILKSAN case. The SDPP turned out to be more "productive" in corruption cases than the TPP or ANAP. Rumors of corruption and bribes in SDPP municipalities were rampant. The SDPP and the leftist parties in general lost votes as a result of these rumors. This situation gave a rare trump card to the PP. Due to the moral crisis they were in, the three parties, which are not very different from each other, made the PP the favorite party. Of course this is not the only reason why the PP is the favorite party today. In the new conditions, a reason which we can call a historically dialectic reason, has also played a role: The Bosnia-Herzegovina situation has deeply wounded the Turkish nation. The caring attitude of the PP toward this problem cannot even be compared to the attitude of the other parties. Our center parties are not able to bring clear solutions to the problems Turkey faces. The winds of change in the world cannot go beyond the rigid central bureaucracies of these parties. Faced with the PP's unbelievable rise, certain circles are trying to wage the struggle outside the democratic framework: they claim that the PP is getting aid from outside Turkey and that the prosecutor is investigating these charges. Such tricks also play a role in helping the PP rise to the top.
