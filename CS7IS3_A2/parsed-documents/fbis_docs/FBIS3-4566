He said Deputy Vice Foreign Minister Hiroshi Fukuda met with Israeli Ambassador to Japan Amos Ganor at the Foreign Ministry and reiterated a statement issued Saturday by ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada. Fukuda urged Israel to take measures to help ensure the creation of a trusting relationship with the Palestinians, Saito said. The Japanese Government will also convey the statement to the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Governments of Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, and tell them of the meeting between Fukuda and the Israeli ambassador, he said. As many as 39 Muslim worshipers were killed and many more wounded when a Jewish settler armed with an automatic weapon entered the West Bank mosque on Friday and opened fire. The ministry spokesman's statement said Japan "strongly condemns" the act of violence and hopes it will not have a negative effect on the current negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians over the withdrawal of Israeli military forces from Gaza and Jerico. It also said Tokyo strongly hopes that despite the massacre, not only those parties directly involved in negotiations but all Israelis and Palestinians will exercise restraint and continue to work toward peace.
