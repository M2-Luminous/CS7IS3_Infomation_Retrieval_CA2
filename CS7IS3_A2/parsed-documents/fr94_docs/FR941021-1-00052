FR941021-1-00052 FR941021-1-00009 Prevention vs. Safety Several commenters object to statements in the AMA Report that certain recommendations are based on concepts of preventive medicine. These commenters say that the FAA's responsibility is to safety rather than to a system of healthier pilots. According to these commenters, the purpose of the agency's medical examination is to determine if a pilot is able to perform safely the privileges of the airman certificate, not whether the pilot is generally healthy. FAA Response: The FAA is not proposing to change the primary safety objective of the medical certification examination. Rather, the proposed revisions to the standards embody what has been learned in the last 25 years about medical risk factors. FAA's interest in risk assessment is directly related to its need to determine at the time of a medical examination as much objective information as possible on the medical condition of the person being examined. This information is directly relevant to FAA's need to determine the likelihood that the person being examined will remain medically fit for the next 6 months, or 1 or 2 years, as applicable. The AMA report is fully consistent with helping the FAA meet its statutory safety responsibilities. The AMA Report notes that some of its recommendations include ``risk factor identification items.'' It further notes: These items add to the safety factor for which the examination is designed; they also increase the likelihood that pilots who pay attention to these risk factors will be able to enjoy flying aircraft for more years. The fact that the AMA Report mentions potential long term preventive health benefits that may accrue to the person being examined in no way diminishes the importance of the short term health evaluation benefits that are of primary concern to the FAA. AMA Contract Several commenters object to the AMA Report because they believe the recommendations are in the AMA's self interest. According to these commenters, any proposed increase in requirements would serve to increase the cost of the medical examination and thereby the income of doctors. FAA Response: In its consideration of the AMA Report, the FAA found no indication of self-serving motives. The AMA committees which worked on developing the recommendations were made up of experienced and respected specialists in each area of medical interest. Each committee did an in-depth and thorough analysis of the current standards in relation to advances in medical knowledge and examination techniques and recommended, as appropriate, optimum standards for safety. The FAA reviewed and considered these recommendations along with public comments (many from professionals in the field) and advice from its own staff. Factors such as pilot performance, aircraft technology, and cost, in addition to general safety were considered by the FAA in assessing each AMA recommendation. (A cost benefit analysis appears in the Regulatory Evaluation portion of this preamble.) The FAA believes the proposed standards will benefit all airmen as well as the general public. FAA Workload Several commenters express concern that the AMA Report recommendations, if adopted, would lead to an increase of denials and, therefore, an increase in requests for certification under the special issuance provisions of the FAR. This in turn would lead to certification processing delays. FAA Response: The FAA does not anticipate that the proposed standards will significantly increase the internal FAA workload. The potential for such an increase and the FAA's plans to meet the increase are discussed more fully in the regulatory evaluation. Industry Disincentive Several commenters state that general aviation is presently in economic trouble and that more stringent medical standards would discourage more people from becoming general aviation pilots. FAA Response: The FAA does not agree. The safer the system, the greater the number of participants and the lower the cost. The FAA believes that these proposals encourage and support aviation.
