Senegalese President Abdou Diouf is visiting Paris. He told Assane Diop that he agrees with the Western intervention there. [Begin recording] [Diouf] I favor the international community's stand against this violence and its attempt to stop it in order to allow political dialogue to start again under better circumstances. [Diop] Do you think intervention by an international force sponsored by the United Nations, the OAU or a third country such as France is useful in situations like the one in Rwanda today? [Diouf] I think it not only useful but absolutely necessary. It is necessary because it is obvious that those in charge on the spot cannot solve anything by themselves in the very short term. They must be helped to solve their problems. This is why I am in favor of an international solution. [end recording]
