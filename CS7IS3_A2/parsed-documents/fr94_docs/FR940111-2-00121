The meeting is expected to be attended by the following persons: Governors Alvarado, Daniels, del Junco, Dyhrkopp, Mackie, Pace, Setrakian and Winters; Postmaster General Runyon, Deputy Postmaster General Coughlin, Secretary to the Board Harris, and General Counsel Elcano. The Board determined that pursuant to section 552b(c)(3) of Title 5, United States Code, and section 7.3(c) of Title 39, Code of Federal Regulations, this portion of the meeting is exempt from the open meeting requirement of the Government in the Sunshine Act [5 U.S.C. 552b(b)] because it is likely to disclose information in connection with proceedings under Chapter 36 of Title 39, United States Code (having to do with postal ratemaking, mail classification and changes in postal services), which is specifically exempted from disclosure by section 410(c)(4) of Title 39, United States code. The Board has determined further that pursuant to section 552b(c)(10) of Title 5, United States Code, and section 7.3(j) of Title 39, Code of Federal Regulations, the discussion is exempt because it is likely to specifically concern participation of the Postal Service in a civil action or proceeding involving a determination on the record after opportunity for a hearing. The Board further determined that the public interest does not require that the Board's discussion of the matter be open to the public. In accordance with section 552b(f)(1) of Title 5, United States Code, and section 7.6(a) of title 39, Code of Federal Regulations, the General Counsel of the United States Postal Service has certified that in her opinion the meeting may properly be closed to public observation pursuant to section 552b(c)(3) and (10) of Title 5, United States Code; section 410(c)(4) of Title 39, United States Code; and section 7.3 (c) and (j) of Title 39, Code of Federal Regulations.
