SL Leader Moises Simon Limaco, also known as "Ramiro," is believed to be the right-hand man of Oscar Ramirez Durand ("Felicano"). Durand is the new SL leader, who is also striving to reactivate the weakened terrorist gang. Limaco planned to reactive the People's Aid of Peru force, an organization headed by lawyer Martha Huatay who has been sentenced to life imprisonment. This organization supplied clothing, food, shelter, and medical attention for SL commandos. The police have indicated that the reactivation of the People's Aid of Peru was financed with funds Limaco obtained from traffickers in the northern Peruvian jungle region where SL offers protection to traffickers in exchange for money and guns. Limaco was arrested on 17 June in the northern part of Lima.
