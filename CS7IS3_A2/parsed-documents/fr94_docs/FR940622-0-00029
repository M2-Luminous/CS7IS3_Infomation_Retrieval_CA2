FR940622-0-00029 FR940622-0-00011 We also proposed to revise §489.20, Basic commitments, to require hospitals to admit veterans whose admission is authorized under 38 U.S.C. 603 and to meet the requirements of §489.26. We also proposed to revise §489.53, Termination by HCFA, to show that HHS may terminate any hospital that fails to meet the requirements of §489.26. The proposed regulations would apply to inpatient services furnished to veterans admitted on or after July 1, 1987. C. Statement of Beneficiary Rights We proposed to add a new §489.27, to require participating hospitals that furnish inpatient hospital services to Medicare beneficiaries to give every beneficiary (or individual acting on his or her behalf) at or about the time of admission the publication ``An Important Message from Medicare.'' We did not specify the contents of the ``Message'' in the proposed rule, as hospitals are not responsible for writing it. We have distributed and will continue to distribute to hospitals the language of the ``Message'' that they are to use. A copy of the ``Message'' is included as Appendix I to this interim final rule. We proposed to require hospitals to obtain a separate signed acknowledgment from the beneficiary attesting to the receipt of ``An Important Message from Medicare'' and to retain a copy of the acknowledgment. Effective with admissions on and after March 24, 1986, PROs were required to monitor each hospital to assure that the hospital distributes ``An Important Message from Medicare'' to all Medicare beneficiaries. Therefore, we proposed to require the hospital to obtain the beneficiary's separate, signed acknowledgment attesting to the receipt of the ``Message'' and to retain a copy of the acknowledgment. We also proposed to revise §489.20, Basic commitments, to show that a hospital must distribute ``An Important Message from Medicare''. We planned to add a new paragraph (12) to §489.53, Terminations by HHS, to show that a hospital failing to meet the requirements of §489.27 may be terminated. Whether or not HHS would terminate a provider would depend on HCFA's judgment as to the scope of the failure and the hospital's correction or plan for correction of the failure. We did not anticipate any hospital opposition to the requirement that the ``Message'' be distributed. We believe we already have full cooperation from hospitals. The revisions were to apply only to Medicare admissions beginning after we distributed ``An Important Message from Medicare''. D. Hospital Emergency Care The revisions to the regulations we proposed on June 16, 1988 would have been revisions and additions to 42 CFR Part 489, Provider Agreements under Medicare, and revisions to 42 CFR Part 1001, Program Integrity_Medicare, and Part 1003, Civil Money Penalties and Assessments. Basically, the proposed provisions paralleled the statutory requirements that were then in effect. We note that, as discussed above in section II.D. of this preamble, OBRA 89 and OBRA 90 included amendments to section 1867 of the Act. 1. Requirements for Hospitals With Emergency Care Departments •We proposed to revise §489.20, which discusses basic commitments, by adding a new paragraph to require hospitals with emergency departments, as part of their participation agreement, to agree to comply with the new §489.24, which incorporates the statutory requirements. •We proposed to add a new section §489.24, Special responsibilities of Medicare hospitals in emergency cases, to set forth requirements for emergency cases for all hospitals that have provider agreements with Medicare. We planned to require a hospital to take the following measures: +␣Medical screening requirement_ For any individual, regardless of his or her eligibility for Medicare, for whom emergency treatment or examination is requested, we proposed to require a hospital with an emergency department to provide for an appropriate medical screening examination within the emergency department's capability to determine whether an emergency medical condition exists or whether the individual is in active labor, as defined below. The examinations would be conducted by individuals determined qualified by hospital by-laws and who meet the requirements of §482.55, which are that emergency services be supervised by a qualified member of the medical staff and that there be adequate medical and nursing personnel qualified in emergency care to meet the written emergency procedures and needs anticipated by the facility. We proposed to allow hospitals maximum flexibility in their utilization of emergency care personnel by not including specific requirements concerning education or credentials for individuals conducting emergency medical examinations. +␣Necessary stabilizing treatment for emergency medical conditions and active labor_ If the individual has an emergency medical condition or is in active labor, we proposed that the hospital be required to provide either further medical examination and treatment to stabilize the medical condition or treatment of the labor or transfer the individual appropriately to another medical facility. We would not hold the hospital responsible if the individual, or a legally responsible person acting on the individual's behalf, refuses to consent in writing to the further examination and treatment or the appropriate transfer to another hospital.
