FBIS3-28645 "dreas027_d_94016" FBIS-EAS-94-027 Document Type:Daily Report 9 Feb 1994 South Korea Ministry To Raise Special Taxes on Gas, Oil SK0802022094 Seoul THE KOREA TIMES in English 8 Feb 94 p 9 SK0802022094 Seoul THE KOREA TIMES Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] The government announced yesterday it will raise the special excise tax rates on gasoline, diesel oil and kerosene from 10-150 percent to 13-190 percent from February 15 in a move to generate revenue to finance the modernization of social infrastructure such as subways, roads and ports. The tax rate for gasoline, diesel oil and kerosene will rise to 190 percent, 25 percent and 13 percent, respectively, from the current 150 percent, 20 percent and 10 percent, the Ministry of Finance announced following a meeting of economic vice ministers yesterday. The tax rate hike will offset a reduction in oil prices which was announced by the government, which will link domestic oil prices to international prices. The Trade-Industry-Energy Ministry said last week that consumers can enjoy a reduction in oil prices by 4-5 percent from February 15. International oil prices fell to 12.85 dollars per barrel in January this year from 15.81 dollars per barrel last year. As international oil prices fall, the government estimates that its "transportation tax," which was introduced this year to finance the modernization and expansion of social overhead capital (SOC) projects, will be down by more than 600 billion won this year from the original target. The government set the tax base at 15.81 dollars per barrel for a collection of 3.2 trillion won in transportation tax this year, out of which 2.6 trillion won will come from the tax on gasoline. But as international oil prices fell, the tax base also fell. Thus, the MOF said the government decided to raise the tax rate on the three key oil prices. The end result is that drivers must buy gasoline at the current price of around 610 won per litter even after the government links the domestic oil retail price to international fluctuations from the middle of this month. The government has been under fire for "arbitrarily" raising tax rates or implementing a new tax without full debate at the National Assembly or through public hearings. Last month, it announced plans to collect 1.5 trillion won each year for the next 10 years to finance the rural sector, at the instruction of President Kim Yong-sam. The government also suddenly announced yesterday that it will raise the special excise tax rates on major oil products.
