It is estimated that there are approximately 3 million kerosene stoves in [word indistinct]. In 1993 the consumption plan was for 464,000 tons of kerosene which amounts to $90 million on the world market, where this fuel is no longer sold. Cuba cannot produce this fuel, so how do we solve this dilemma? The Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces's center for fuel development and research determined that a kerosene-diesel mixture was an answer for domestic kitchens. This became one of the outstanding projects of the Eighth Forum of Science and Technology. After several trials, researchers concluded that the most feasible solution was (Jet A-1 turbo) fuel, a refined kerosene used in aviation. The average cost of (Jet A-1) fuel is $205 per ton, which exceeds that of standard kerosene. To overcome this problem the refined kerosene is mixed with diesel fuel, which is much cheaper. The researchers took steps so that the mixture would not damage the stoves [words indistinct] and would have acceptable thermal safety and efficiency. They decided on a ratio of 30 percent diesel and 70 percent of kerosene, which will allow an annual savings of $3 million, equivalent to 20,000 tons more fuel for domestic use -- the amount that the population of Havana City consumes in three months. The first tests of this research were carried out in 50 homes with a 90-percent acceptance rate. According to Lieutenant Colonel Eduardo Perez Pena, more tests are taking place in a municipality of Havana City. The fuel should be available throughout the country by May.
