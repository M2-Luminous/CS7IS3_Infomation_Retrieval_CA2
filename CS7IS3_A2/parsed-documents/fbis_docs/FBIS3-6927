Tan Pyong-ho, chairman of the National Council of Trade Unions, criticized the Kim Yong-sam regime's "reform" as an exceptionally anti-popular mode of rule. The Social Justice Study and Practice Society and other organisations at a symposium on Kim Yong-sam's "reform" stressed that though the "civilian government" hung out the flowery signboard of "reform" it has in actuality employed the anti-popular ruling method of the military fascist dictatorial regimes and has reformed nothing in political, economic, educational and all other domains. The HANGYORE SINMUN newspaper charged that though the "civilian government" cried for "liquidation of corruption" and "change and reform" it keeps Kim Chong-pil, a chief culprit of the "May 16 coup d'etat", in power and defends him. The newspaper defined the present regime's "reform" as "a solo play for a rule minus politics." The opposition Democratic Party opened to the public the ten major crimes committed by the Kim Yong-sam puppet government over the last year since its emergence, saying that the deceptive nature of the "reform" is proved by the soaring prices caused by the anti-popular policy, treacherous opening of the agro-market, suspension of North-South dialogue resulting from the anti-reunification policy, serious pollution of the environment and never-ceasing disasters.
