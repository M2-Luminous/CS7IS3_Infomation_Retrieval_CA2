The president responded to a reporter's question about the report and the activities of the Civilian Self-Defense Patrols. [Begin De Leon recording] The State Department report says many things [words indistinct]. You have referred to one of them; that is, possible human rights violations by the Army, Civilian Self-Defense Patrols, and security forces personnel in general. The report only mentions the issue but does not include any specific information or evidence. The State Department has done the same with Peru and other countries. We are reviewing [words indistinct] and I am studying it. The report includes several recommendations that are acceptable and, admittedly, several of the things mentioned are realistic. However, responsibility for human rights violations falls on the state itself -- be it this state or any other -- thus the report says nothing new. Regarding the Civilian Self-Defense Patrols, the government is willing -- especially this year, when we expect to sign a peace agreement -- to eliminate them gradually. They have already started to be turned into [word indistinct] legal peace and development committees. However, the most important issue is that [words indistinct] patrol members who commit crimes, just as any Guatemalan citizen, will be tried and punished if found guilty. The State Department and the international community already know this. We sent a letter sent to President Clinton specifically expressing our willingness to improve the situation and outlining the positive steps taken by the government. This is alluded to in the report. As I recall, it mentions somewhere that there is hope and that with the arrival of President Ramiro De Leon Carpio, there has been a reversal in the attitude of the Guatemalan Government. Thus, the report is not entirely negative. We believe in some cases [words indistinct] is correct but in others, it is a bit speculative. The report does not present sufficient arguments or evidence to back its assertions. Just like any other State Department report, we will have to study and review it. We will look at its ramifications and the annotations and suggestions it makes to several ministries regarding labor, economic, and social issues, on special [words indistinct], assembly plants, and so forth. I would say it is more or less a repetition of the reports that the State Department has issued every year for the past three or four years. [end recording]
