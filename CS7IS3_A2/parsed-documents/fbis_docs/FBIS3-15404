It was alleged that the Russian party had demanded the postponement. Head of the Moldovan military experts, Nikolay Turturyanu, told INTERFAX that several supplementary provisions to the Moldovan-Russian general agreement on the 14th Army had been worked out during the consultations of the military experts. "The 8th round of the negotiations is to take place in the near future. It will focus on the issue concerning the 14th Russian Army," Turturyanu added. He stressed that Russia had, as yet, put forward no more demands. He reminded that the negotiations were held at the state level and the position of the Moldovan Defense Ministry reflected the position of Moldova in general. The position of Moldova has remained the same, he said. Head of the Moldovan delegation, Moldovan Ambassador to Russia, Anatol Taranu confirmed that Moldova had insisted on unconditional withdrawal of the 14th Russian Army before 1 July, 1994. Turturyanu refuted the allegations that the 14th Army might be reorganized into a Russian military base on Moldovan territory. "These allegations have no grounds. Those who circulate the allegations proceed from the example of when Russia transformed its military formations on Georgian territory into military bases. However, Russia has not even raised this issue at the negotiations with Moldova," he pointed out.
