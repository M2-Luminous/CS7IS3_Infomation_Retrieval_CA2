In an interview with an Austrian radio station today, IAEA spokesman David Kyd stressed that it is important to confirm if IAEA inspectors would have access to North Korea's seven declared nuclear facilities and that at present no details have been disclosed regarding it. He also said that details must be disclosed within a few days. Regarding North Korea's announcement that it will observe obligations of the Nuclear Safeguards Accord, a Vienna-based diplomatic source said that such a proposal by North Korea cannot be a breakthrough in resolving the nuclear issue and stressed: To find a breakthrough, North Korea should announce that it would allow the IAEA team to inspect their seven declared facilities. Actually, the nuclear inspections should be carried out in North Korea.
