FR941212-0-00036 FR941212-0-00014 Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, agencies may examine alternatives to minimize the economic burden of proposed rules on an industry. Given the obligation to assess fees imposed on the FMC by the IOAA and OMB Circular A&hyph;25, the Commission finds that there are no viable alternatives, and that the proposed tariff and ET filing fees, as amended herein, are the least burdensome choice for the Commission. Although there is no apparent alternative that would minimize the economic burden of tariff and ET filing fees on the industry and achieve the Commission's regulatory objective, the Commission is pursuing, nevertheless, an OMB exception, which would permit the Commission to forego collecting these fees. If the Commission receives a favorable response, the Commission will remove these fees from its rules. This final rule does not contain any collection of information requirements as defined by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, as amended. Therefore, OMB review is not required.
