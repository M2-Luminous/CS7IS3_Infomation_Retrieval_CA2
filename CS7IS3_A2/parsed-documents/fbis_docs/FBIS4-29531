It seems that the ghost has issued "a general mobilization order" to the people's Cold-War thoughts that had faded since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The U.S. high-altitude reconnaissance plane Blackbird (SR-71) that disappeared in 1990 is getting ready to be put into commission again. The voice demanding the cancellation of the order to withdraw tactical nuclear weapons issued by former U.S. President George Bush while he was in the office is resounding fiercely. In addition, some people even insist on a limited attack on North Korean nuclear facilities, and it seems that the attack would not be a limited one. As described above, the heat of the speculation on a crisis on the Korean peninsula that has spread in the United States is increasing in proportion to the cooling speed of the fuel rods taken out by North Korea from its five-megawatt reactor in Yongbyong. This is a so-called "bandwagon phenomenon". The U.S. doves, who originally supported a solution to the North Korean nuclear problem through dialogue, are one by one leaving their nest for that of the hawks. They have decided to no longer put up with North Korea's attitude after watching a series of measures it took. The actual development of the situation has made U.S. controversialists, who were denouncing the insistence on attacking North Korean nuclear facilities and on the inevitability of a second Korean war as a great mistake, change their position. [passage omitted] It is interesting that leading U.S. public opinion circles on the North Korean nuclear issue make it impossible for people to categorize their view as conservative or progressive. [passage omitted] It is clear, however, that every inch of the arguments by Americans on the North Korean nuclear issue are based on their own country's interests. Without mentioning some people's viewpoint that a scheme is being plotted, it can be said there is a common view that the United States will not hesitate in bringing about a war [chonjaengul pulsahal kosiranun ke sangsik] if it believes that raising the North Korean nuclear issue as an international crisis is advantageous to itself [segyejok wigiro pugak sikinun kosi yuikhadago pandandoemyon]. The Clinton administration, however, does not seem to have decided to fight with North Korea to the end. At present, the hard-liners are leading the main current of the U.S. policy toward North Korea. Accordingly, I think it is a reasonable view that a stick rather than a carrot is envisaged in the current U.S. scenario for resolving the North Korean nuclear issue. Although the stick policy might have been brought about by North Korea itself, it will certainly worsen the crisis on the Korean peninsula for the time being. No one can predict whether the crisis will rapidly increase or decrease at any point, or will go in a direction that all of us are concerned about. The North Korean nuclear issue, that has been dragged out for more than three years, is now on the edge of a precipice.
