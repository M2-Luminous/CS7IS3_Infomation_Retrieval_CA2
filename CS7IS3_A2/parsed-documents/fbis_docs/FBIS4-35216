The conferees examined some of the serious measures undertaken by the corrupt Oslo team in the context of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. In its statement, the APF said that the suspect role assigned to the so-called Palestinian police has shown them to be a repressive tool in the hand of the Zionist occupation. As part of the practical arrangements agreed on between the Oslo team and the Zionist enemy, a number of those affiliated with the Zionist enemy agencies made statements on disarming our people and their militant forces and on opening prisons for our people's honorable strugglers. In this context, they have started by detaining Hani 'Abid, an Islamic Jihad member, and pursuing our people's strugglers who reject the Oslo agreement and all its appendices, chapters, and objectives. The APF statement adds: We in the APF warn of the gravity of this dangerous behavior which will lead to detrimental results, sedition, and internal strife. We urge the masses of our people and their militant forces to firmly confront the practices of this team which has violated the will of our people, and its agencies which have been proved to be dens designed to absorb agents and spies linked to the Zionist enemy.
