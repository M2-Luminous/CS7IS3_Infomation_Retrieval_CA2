The Ministry of Defense believes that this may seriously affect the combat readiness of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belorussia--after all, half of the soldiers and sergeants are to leave over the course of two months. Things will also be difficult this spring for the republic's military commissariats--the call-up plan has been increased considerably, while the number of draftees has remained essentially as before.
