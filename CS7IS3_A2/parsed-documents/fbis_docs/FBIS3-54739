The existence of the center is no secret today, but its work, as well as the personality of its president, are shrouded in some kind of mystery. [Burbulis] There is awareness about the center. They do not know what it does, what results have been achieved, but the world knows it is there, and this is our achievement, as it were. [Correspondent] Speaking on the urgent issue of creating a political party, Gennadiy Burbulis stated that, sadly, he has had to be publicly involved, of late, in a dialogue on this issue with President Yeltsin, whose desire to also build a party comes into confrontation with Yeltsin's aspiration to be and remain an arbitrator of the society. [Burbulis] Our objective is to help Yeltsin to understand the following: That any further attempt to remain an arbitrator is threatening to him personally and to his political biography, and therefore, is threatening to the whole country. The transitional stage that we are undergoing, the sheer scale and depth of the contradictions, and of the clash of interests do not allow the president to take a stance of arbitrator today. One thing is to be a political arbitrator, and another thing -- to be a president who adopts a certain position in a clear-cut, business-like, and committed way, but at the same time, who is able to engage in a dialogue with all other political structures in the country and in the society. These are different things. Yeltsin needs to take up a clear position, to stop playing patron to the nation, especially since the nation is simply not there as such, so this precludes this patronage, what the nation badly needs is leadership. Yeltsin must learn to conduct dialogue with the society in forms for which a serious school of democratic leadership is needed. Should our assessment be correct, to some extent, then indeed one will not be able to move even a step forward without a party. However, this cannot be a presidential party any more. This cannot be a party built on Yeltsin's charisma. This must be a two-way street: Of the president moving toward the society and of society, in its growing awareness of the necessity of such political structure. They must both grow up mutually to meet this challenge. I believe our center can be equally useful by way of inspiring the authority and the person in authority, and by helping to implement this demand in practical terms.
