Djindjic told a press conference in Belgrade that political entities created after Bosnia-Herzegovina's division had to be viable and connected territorially. "The preliminary version takes into consideration only the Moslem-Croat territorial entity while the Serb entity is discriminated," he said. The contact group for Bosnia -- which includes representatives of the United States, Russia and the European Union -- is preparing a plan for Bosnia's division granting 51 percent of the territory to the Moslem-Croat federation and 49 percent to the Srpska republic. When the proposal is adopted by the foreign ministers of the countries represented on the contact group, it will be presented to the warring sides as an ultimatum. It is strategically important that the cease-fire hold, said the DS president. The truce shows that the international community has chosen to begin a territorial delineation, he said and added that this was not irrelevant because two concepts had been on the table so far -- the Serb, proposing a territorial demarcation, and the Moslem, proposing a unitary Bosnia. The one-month cease-fire agreement, signed in Geneva last week, took effect on June 10.
