Cautioning against "fashionable and politically correct" solutions to trade problems, Sir Leon distanced himself from recent suggestions made by U.S. President Bill Clinton during his maiden trip to Europe as head of state. In an address to the Centre for European Policy Studies one month after the successful conclusion of the GATT Uruguay round, the senior British commissioner also warned the U.S. against the use of unilateralism in trade disputes, and against strengthening retaliatory powers under Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act. "The U.S. will have to understand that it has committed itself to the multilateral process that I have described however tempting domestic policy considerations may be to resort to unilateral action." His words may irritate the Clinton administration, which has pledged to be "even tougher" in tackling unfair trading practices in the post-Uruguay round era. It may also raise hackles in the U.S. Congress, which is due to consider ratification of the Gatt accord this year. In his speech, Sir Leon described the agreement last month as just as significant as the creation of the GATT itself in 1947. It provided a new framework for open trade in services, a clear timetable for resolution of trade disputes, significantly lower tariffs in industrial products, and a binding agreement to reduce subsidies and protection in farm products. "It is more difficult for the law of the jungle to prevail," he said. Before leaving for talks in Brussels with Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of GATT, Sir Leon added that it was important to produce better offers on market access before the February 15 deadline. He singled out Japan as needing to improve offers on white spirits and liqueurs, though Tokyo has countered that the EU and U.S. deal on agriculture and offers on electronics is also unsatisfactory. On labour standards, Sir Leon expressed concern that it could lead the EU into unprofitable arguments over human rights and could be hard to administer. He also noted that the agreements attached to the NAFTA free-trade agreement by the U.S., Canada and Mexico provided only for signatories to apply their own rules rather than impose standards from the outside.
