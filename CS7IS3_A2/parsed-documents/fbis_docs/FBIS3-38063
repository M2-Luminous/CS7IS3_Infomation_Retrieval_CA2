He stressed that the U.S. mass media misinterpreted his statement on the Ames affair at the press conference on February 26. "Such misinterpretations pursue one unseemly objective -- to get confirmation of the assumption that the CIA officer and his wife cooperated with the Soviet and Russian intelligence services".
