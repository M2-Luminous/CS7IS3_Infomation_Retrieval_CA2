The retailers have begun actively buying popular brand rice, fearing imported rice, which will be on sale in March, will have more low-quality Thailand-made long-grain rice as medium- and short-grain rice imports from China will be reduced due to bad crop. The price of Koshihikari, the most popular brand of rice harvested in Niigata Prefecture, for instance, has been renewing its record high. It is traded at near 40,000 yen per 60 kilogram in a free market. The government has decided to import more than one million tons of foreign rice to make up for a shortage in supplies caused by last year's poor harvest, the worst during the postwar period. The Food Agency told rice retailers that 30 percent of imported rice to be on sale from March to June will be Thai long-grain rice. The prices of Koshihikari harvested in Ibaraki Prefecture and Akitakomachi of Akita Prefecture were 36,000-37,500 yen Wednesday, up 3,000-4,000 yen from the previous week.
