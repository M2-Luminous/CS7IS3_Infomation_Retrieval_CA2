Disoriented by the implosion of the USSR and the dismantling of the Warsaw Pact, it is trying to get its breath -- so far without success. Yet the challenges are many. Europe has never known such a threatening period, one so laden with risks since the time when, in the face of Stalinist imperialism, it decided to create the WEU [Western European Union] and then, in 1949, to join NATO. It is true, however, that the great ideological battle between communism and capitalism is dead, more because of the resounding failure of the former than the victory of the latter. Many Western governments, including that of the United States, have unfortunately made the mistake of believing that the disappearance of this opposition of two blocs would necessarily lead to the dawn of an era of peace and the disappearance of the risk of a major conflict in Europe. Nothing could be further from the truth! The death of the great dragon of communism allowed the reappearance of the old demons of nationalism, racism, religious fanaticism, intolerance, and populism, which, in interaction, could just as surely lead to widespread war in Europe. Yet the United States has withdrawn more than 200,000 soldiers from Europe, leaving just a symbolic contingent of 100,000 men, which certain congressmen would like to reduce even further. The countries of West Europe, hard hit by an unprecedented structural crisis, are also blindly reducing their military budgets and staff, even though the American disengagement should make them more responsible for their own security. Of course the WEU has been revitalized and was officially assigned in Maastricht to become the military wing of the European Union, but its budgets and resources remain ridiculously insignificant. In this context, the NATO summit to be held in Brussels on 10 January will take on special importance. Either the allies will recover their self-control, define priorities, and give NATO a new mission, or we risk seriously compromising the capacity of the Western democratic world for managing crises which will surely rock Europe in the near future. The main challenge to be taken up by the alliance in the short term is to respond to the pathetic appeal of the countries of Central Europe that are seeking protection and security. Czech President Vaclav Havel has explained better than anyone else why his country wanted -- legitimately -- to join NATO. NATO exists to defend democracies in Europe -- even new ones -- wishing to live in liberty and a rule of law state. The Iron Curtain did not fall so that we could take the states that were victims of Soviet totalitarianism for more than 40 years and toss them into the insecurity created by their Russian neighbors. If that was the desire of the governments of the alliance, the Brussels summit would just as shamefully take its place in history as did the sadly famous Munich accords, and even the Yalta accords. And yet, under the influence of the hesitant diplomacy of the Clinton Administration, the member countries of the alliance are preparing -- in response to applications for membership from Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary -- to propose a bogus form of membership called Partnership for Peace, which, in the eyes of the candidate countries, will soon look like a blunt refusal. Indeed, like in Cold War times -- not wanting to collide with the large and still powerful Russia -- the United States, which naively thinks that we can still trust the Russian leaders and Boris Yeltsin in particular, is preparing to obey the veto that Moscow has put on any expansion of the alliance. What a mistake! A Window of Freedom That Risks Being Closed Again The implosion of the USSR and the fall of the Iron Curtain have opened up a window of freedom to the East that risks being closed again very soon. Russia is in the midst of an anarchy that is preparing the ground for a new dictatorship. With every day, the Army is regaining more of the power it temporarily lost, while fascist forces are trying to take power via elections. We have already seen this somewhere else.... In this context, it is normal that the instability being experienced in the USSR, just like the traditional imperialism of the greater Russia, should frighten her neighbors. It is our duty to respond to this generously, firmly, and clearly! Not to do so would risk costing us very dearly in the long term. History constantly reminds us that peace and freedom must be earned every day. Have we fallen so deep into the cowardice and blind egoism which are already sadly guiding our steps in the former Yugoslavia? Have we lost so much moral sense that we are no longer capable of defending our primary interest: peace in liberty?
