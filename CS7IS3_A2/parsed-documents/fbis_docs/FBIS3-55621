The government of Belarus has embarked on creating a national program under this title. While it is being implemented, it will provide jobs for about 7,000 military servicemen in the republic who are now living in military townlets which the Russian strategic troops are leaving. Soon former servicemen and the members of their families will be able to work in the sphere of small and medium-sized business. Representatives of entrepreneurial structures of the republic and the Minsk energy center of the European community have declared an interest in this. The military townlets in the Polotsk, Gomel, Klimovichi, and Bykhov rayons will be the first to be reconstructed. The prospects for their transformation were discussed at an international seminar on conversion which ended in Minsk today. The problem of creating new jobs for military servicemen was discussed with representatives of international labor organizations and business circles of Britain, Italy, the United States, and Switzerland. Representatives of the World Bank and the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development have said they are willing to take part in financing the program.
