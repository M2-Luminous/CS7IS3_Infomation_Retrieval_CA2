The "No to the EU" organization is considering preparing a counterreport before the LO [Trade Union Confederation] congress. But first it will take a good look at the FAFO report. "The EU's importance for the trade union movement is exaggerated. The gloomy pictures that are painted both if we remain outside and if we join the EU are incorrect. There is much confusion in the debate. Many people engage in the discussion as if the EEA [European Economic Area] does not exist," FAFO research chief Jon Erik Dolvik said. Yesterday, alongside researchers Arild H. Steen and Dag Stokland, he made public the FAFO report on the consequences of EU membership which the LO secretariat had commissioned. This EU report will form the foundation for the LO's discussion of the EU question in the run-up to the extraordinary LO congress on 22 September. Yesterday LO leader Yngve Hagensen remained unwilling to signal what is his view of EU membership. The LO leader contented himself by saying that the LO congress in September will reach a clear decision for or against. As far as the trade union movement's working conditions and trade union rights are concerned, the report concludes that these will not be undermined in the event of EU membership. "There are no formal reasons preventing the continuation of the Nordic model of working life, and Norway will be included in the same set of rules in both the EEA and the EU," the FAFO report states. For the Norwegian economy the effects of EU membership are more uncertain, in FAFO's view. There is uncertainty about whether the economic growth resulting from EU membership will be so high as to meet the increase in spending resulting from membership. FAFO estimates net spending in the state budget at 6.5 billion, something that would necessitate an increase in growth in GNP of 0.15 percent per year over a 10-year period. For industry FAFO takes the view that competition for private industry and service companies will largely be the same in the EEA and the EU. The exception is the food industry. In FAFO's view, EU membership will give rise to tougher conditions and reduced employment for agriculture-based industry and agriculture, while fisheries-based industry on the other hand could experience more exports. Per Ostvold and Kjell Iversen, respectively leader and secretary of "No to the EU," said that Jon Erik Dolvik is extremely biassed in his presentation of the FAFO report. "He used most of his time to engage in polemics against the arguments of the no-organizations. I did not hear him arguing against a single yes-argument. In addition, he also said a number of things that were downright wrong -- among other things he rejected the suggestion that the EU's white book and the guidelines from the meeting of the EU's finance ministers will lead to bigger differences in wages," Ostvold said. Both Ostvold and Iversen stressed that they acquired copies of the report at the press conference. They could therefore only speak about the presentation. "But if the report is as it was presented we cannot rule out the possibility that `No to the EU' will produce a counterreport before the LO congress," Iversen said. The central no-sayers in the LO did not comment on the FAFO report yesterday. The spontaneous reactions of "No to the EU," however, indicate that the report will not be accepted as a neutral base for debate by the most active no-sayers in the trade union movement. The self-confessed yes-sayers who were present at the press conference yesterday were unable to understand the no-side's reaction. In the presentation it emerged, for example, that EU economic union is not suited to the Norwegian economy. The FAFO people in no way supported the government's claim that EU membership will give economic growth -- even if they did not say the opposite. It was also pointed out that fewer people will be employed in agriculture and the food industry as a result of EU membership. These are points that the yes-side does not usually make.
