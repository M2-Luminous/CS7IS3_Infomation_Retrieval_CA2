Relating to Modifications of the Stock Price Maintenance Requirement for Equity Options January 5, 1994. Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on December 20, 1993, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the Exchange. 1 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 1 The Exchange previously submitted this proposal on December 13, 1993, however, in response to Commission concerns, the PSE delayed effectiveness of the rule change pending amendment and resubmission to the Commission in its current form. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The PSE is proposing to amend Commentary .04 to Rule 3.7 in order to make technical corrections involving cross-referencing. The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, PSE, and at the Commission. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the PSE included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in Section (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change On November 30, 1993, the Commission approved an Exchange proposal to add new Commentaries to PSE Rule 3.7. 2 The Exchange is now proposing to amend one of those, Commentary .04, by changing two internal cross-references and adding the term ``this'' in two places. The exchange believes that the proposed changes are technical in nature and are consistent with the Commission's order approving File No. SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;91&hyph;19. 3 2 See Exchange Act Release No. 33257 (November 30, 1993), 58 FR 64416 (December 7, 1993). 3 Id . The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market. (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition. (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants or Others No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action Because the foregoing rule change constitutes a stated policy, practice, or interpretation with respect to the meaning, administration, or enforcement of an exiting rule, it has become effective pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act and subparagraph (e)(1) of Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder. At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549.
