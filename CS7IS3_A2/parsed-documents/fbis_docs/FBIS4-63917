Defense Sector To Mark 9 June With Whistles"] [Text] Defense sector trade union chairmen have sent an appeal to State Duma and Federal Assembly deputies expressing their "concern over repeated cuts in the expenditure on weapons and military hardware procurements, military research and development in the draft federal budget for 1994." In the opinion of the trade union leaders, the government should have "canceled the state order that is already being carried out" altogether because there will be just enough money to repay debts for products already manufactured and to operate weapons and equipment. In this case, however, around 80 percent of defense enterprises will go bankrupt, 1.4 million workers will be laid off, and it will take around 30 trillion rubles to pay unemployment benefits alone. The spending cuts and the cancellation of the state order, the trade union activists think, will bring about a situation where "the country will be stripped of its means of defense and will have to procure armaments and military hardware abroad." Given that, the trade union chairmen of the aviation, defense, general-purpose engineering, and radioelectronic industries wrote: "The workers collectives insist that the financing for weapons and military hardware procurements and military research and development should stay at the level established by the 1994 state order," and also that credit lines be opened for conversion programs and measures taken to increase the budget revenues "by creating incentives for production growth, fully collecting taxes, and organizing the sales of weapons, military hardware, and civilian products to foreign countries in the most efficient fashion with producer enterprises being directly involved in such sales." According to information received by your SEGODNYA correspondent at the Central Council of the All-Russia Trade Union of Defense Industry Workers, the trade union executive's decision to suspend the production of civilian and non-food consumer goods at the enterprises for 5-10 minutes on 9 June "to support demands that wages be paid and jobs retained" still remains valid. All trade unions of the defense industry have given their backing to the action during which sirens, whistles, and so forth will be switched on at military-industrial enterprises. It is expected that on 9 June rallies and meetings will take place at many defense enterprises to discuss whether an all-Russia strike in the military- industrial sector should be called in the near future.
