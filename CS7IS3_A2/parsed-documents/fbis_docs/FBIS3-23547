I will thus only point out that most pilots have not met the standards for flying time this year, and a considerable portion of them have lost their qualifications. There are units where combat readiness is maintained only by the leading combat crews. But is the situation really hopeless for our fliers? No. I had occasion to be persuaded of this when I heard the presentations of many officials at a session of the military council of the VPS [Air Forces] that was just held in Vinnytsa. Concrete proposals were made there with regard to obtaining funds for fuels and lubricants, moreover through the efforts of the fliers themselves. I will cite only a few of them. That will possibly promote their realization. It is no secret that some military transport aircraft are being used to ship the most diverse types of freight, both within the borders of Ukraine and to other countries. And it is providing quite a bit of profit, both for the state and for the armed forces. However, as commander of the military-transport aviation forces Major-General of Aviation Petro Matyukhin indicated in his presentation to the military council, the quantity of aircraft for this purpose could be increased considerably--first of all through better organizational work. Advertising, clear-cut planning and timely support are all needed here. It is not sufficient today. So it turns out that one crew flies more than four hundred hours in a year, but another takes their aircraft up for just a few hours. Matters are sometimes paradoxical with the provision of spare parts. Some parts for the aircraft are manufactured in Kiev and are delivered to Tashkent, to the plant where the aircraft are manufactured and their servicing and repairs under guarantee are performed. From there those parts, for example the so-called UZI, are returned to us again, to Ukraine, to be installed in aircraft; but they have now crossed the borders with customs and transport charges, and are thus considerably more expensive. It is not difficult to guess where that leads. The pilots of military-transport aviation this year gained operational experience in yet another use of the Il-76 aircraft. Here, as they say, misfortune forced them to. Fires that broke out in the forests of the Crimea demanded the use of unusual measures. The military aviators were fighting the fire in their mighty aircraft. It would be better, of course, if they did not have to do such things, but no one is insured against natural disasters. Great fires break out at various around the globe every year. The pilots of military-transport aviation could take part in extinguishing them. Their services need only be requested. Helicopters can be used as well as aircraft for the shipment of freight for so-called commercial purposes. There is a squadron of the giant Mi-26 helicopters, say, in the regiment commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Mykhaylo Shymkov. These are the most modern rotary-winged craft, able to ship freight of many tonnes great distances, perform installation work and the like. None of them are being used today, however. The reason is that the main rotor blades and some other parts have exhausted their service lives. There is nothing with which to procure new ones from Russia, since our financial difficulties are well known. But the rotor blades do not need to be purchased. They could be obtained through barter, say, for engines for the same helicopters. Those units, after all, are manufactured here in Ukraine by the Motor-Sich plant. The regiment even has spare engines on hand. This not-very-complicated operation need only be organized and carried out. When the Mi-26 helicopters are able to obtain their new "wings," they will be able to repay the funds spent on them a hundred times over. Great amounts of money, after all, are spent to install just one single derrick or electrical-transmission line tower, and the gain is twofold--profits for the state and the armed forces, and experience in practical flight work for the helicopter crews. All of this need only be organized and brought to life. The Commander of the 14th Air Army, Lieutenant-General Viktor Lyashenko, pointed out in his presentation to the military council that quite a large quantity of aircraft in good working order that are not part of the regular composition of air units is concentrated at the aircraft repair plant in Lviv. Large sums of money are spent every day to preserve them and keep them in working order. They are moreover becoming functionally obsolete, and will not be suitable for use after a certain time. They still have value today as combat aircraft, and thus could be sold to those countries where such types of aircraft are in service. So why not sell them? The storage area also has unmanned reconnaissance drones that could lose their combat capability or become functionally obsolete after some time. It would thus be better to sell them on the world arms market. Some of the funds obtained could be spent to develop and produce more modern aircraft of that type. Quite a few surplus motor vehicles have accumulated in the support units of the air forces. They have been mothballed, as they should be, and put into long-term storage. But there are not suitable conditions for storage everywhere. The equipment moreover grows obsolete even under the best of conditions, both functionally and physically. Considerable amounts of funds and mat√©riel are expended in order to preserve them and maintain them in battleworthy condition as well. A proposal was thus made at the military council to conduct an inventory of all surplus vehicles, so as to determine which it would be efficient to keep, as they say, for a rainy day, and which it would be best to get rid of while buyers can still be found for them. Some of the funds received could be used to buy new, contemporary models of vehicles that are in short supply today or could be needed in the future. The superfluous vehicles could otherwise be turned into scrap metal in several years. There is another problem. Quite a few difficulties are arising in the aviation units with the turnover of scrap metal. According to the prevailing directive instructions, all should turn over scrap metal only to the Vtorchormet organization. Taking advantage of its monopoly position, however, this outdated state organization has been dictating its own terms. All aircraft have to be cut up into pieces of the appropriate sizes and delivered by one's own transport to the receiving stations. And there, under certain conditions, they will possibly accept them, and after some time they will possibly also pay at prices they set themselves. It is often simply impossible to meet these conditions. Where can they get the heavy cutting apparatus? The aircraft are made from alloys, after all, such that they cannot be cut into pieces by ordinary cutting or even a simple oxyacetylene torch. And the scarcity of fuel reduces to a minimum the possibility of delivering scrap to the Vtorchormet receiving stations. Quite a few aircraft that have lived out their "winged" service are thus "rotting away" in the corners of airfields. At the same time, as was emphasized at the military council, there are several organizations that would be glad to cut up and take away aircraft that are unfit for service themselves, and pay considerably more than the aforementioned Vtorchormet. They moreover do not ship the scrap metal outside the boundaries of our state, but rather intend to use it in Ukraine. But the "taboo" from above does not let them do so. So it turns out that it is no use to them, but they cannot give it to anyone else. One could also make other proposals with regard to obtaining funds for the upkeep of military aviation. But these are certainly enough to conclude that we are still enduring losses in places where we could be getting profits. The approaches to resolving the problems must thus be changed. This should moreover be done today, otherwise tomorrow will be too late. The sources for obtaining funds could be gone, and the need for them could disappear if the pilots lose their combat qualifications.
