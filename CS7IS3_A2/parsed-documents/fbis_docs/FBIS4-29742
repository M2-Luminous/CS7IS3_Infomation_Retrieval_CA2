Toyota sent two executives to China on Sunday for talks with Tianjin Automobile Industrial Corp., the officials said. The two executives are Akira Takahashi, senior managing director for production technology, and Akira Yokoi, managing director for external affairs. During their visit until Thursday, they will hold talks with Tianjin officials over the possibility of forming a joint venture, they said. Moreover, the two Toyota officials will obtain information on China's policy on the participation of foreign capital in new passenger car manufacturing operations expected to be introduced in 1996. Toyota's car production in China, if realized, is expected to encourage other Japanese and foreign automakers, industry analysts said. Already, Ford Motor Co. of the United States and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. of Japan have declared their intent to move into the Chinese market. Toyota has supplied state-owned Jinbei (Gold Cup) automotive in Shenyang with commercial-vehicle technology. But it believes Tianjin Automobile Industrial would be the most appropriate production partner among China's eight car producers, since the company is expected to form the "core" of the Chinese auto industry in the future. Tianjin has been turning out cars in a tie-up with Daihatsu Motor Co. of the Toyota group. Chinese officials say China plans to create six or seven conglomerates by the year 2000, each capable of churning out 300,000 cars a year. These would be further reshuffled into three or four giants in the early decades of the next century.
