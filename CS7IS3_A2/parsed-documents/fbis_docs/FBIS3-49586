The National Assembly's decision is not concerned at all with the rights of minorites and is contrary to the Constitution, the minority law, and the stance that the parties and the public profess to take toward minorites, announced Bela Osztojkan, president of the Phralipe Independent Gypsy Organization at the years-end meeting of Romany organizations. The Gypsy organizations do not have enough resources at their disposal today to get even one Gypsy representative elected to the parliament on their own. They have started negotiations with Peter Zwack's Civic Party concerning possible cooperation, and the MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum] will probably run two Romany candidates--Jozsef Raguly of the Hundred-Member Gypsy Orchestra and Florian Farkas of Lungo Drom--in the elections. At the end of the meeting Bela Osztojkan said that the parliament is completely insensitive to the problems of the minorities, and for this reason he as an individual will not vote and will leave the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. "I am sorry that Bela Osztojkan will leave the SZDSZ, but I am even sorrier that neither he nor I can find a better solution for the representation of the minorities in the present parliamentary structure," said Antonia Haga, Romany representative and member of the SZDSZ's parliamentary group. The representative does not consider acceptable either the present situation or the version of the election law that was voted down, which would have put 13 representatives into the National Assembly on the basis of minority lists. "This way, once again only token Gypsies, token Croatians, and token Swabians, who would not even be able to come to agreement on the most important questions, would sit in the parliament." According to Antonia Haga, appropriate minority representation is imaginable only in a two-chamber parliament. [According to Duna TV, on 7 January President Goncz told the Minority Roundtable that he has not decided yet whether he will sign the election law or submit it to the Constitutial Court for a ruling on its constitutionality. He added that he has 13 days to make a decision.]
