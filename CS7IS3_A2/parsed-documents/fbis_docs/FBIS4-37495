Minister Peres noted that Israel is conducting talks with the Syrians on three levels: territory, the nature of peace, and security arrangements. The foreign minister stressed that had the Syrian president signed a peace treaty with Israel together with President al-Sadat, he would have received everything the Egyptian president did.
