FR940721-0-00006 FR940721-0-00003 NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD 29 CFR Part 100 Administrative Regulations AGENCY: National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The National Labor Relations Board is amending the current administrative regulations governing the standards of conduct and financial disclosure requirements of employees of the Agency. Most of these regulations have been superseded by the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch issued by the Office of Government Ethics (OGE). The NLRB publishes this rule to repeal the superseded provisions and to update cross-references in the current regulations that continue to be applicable, in conformance with the executive branch-wide standards. Thus, NLRB is not repealing the provisions of the existing administrative regulations requiring approval to engage in outside employment, the prohibition to engage in private practice of law except in family or civic matters, and the requirement to cooperate with the NLRB's Office of Inspector General in audits and investigations. EFFECTIVE DATE: The removal of §§100.202 through 100.209 and §100.306 became effective October 5, 1992. The redesignation and revision of §100.201 is effective July 21, 1994. All other amendments became effective February 3, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gloria Joseph, Director of Administration, National Labor Relations Board, Room 7108, 1099 Fourteenth Street NW., Washington, DC 20570&hyph;0001. (202&hyph;273&hyph;3890). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In 1967, the NLRB issued 29 CFR Part 100, administrative regulations governing employee responsibilities and conduct (32 FR 13560), primarily pursuant to and in conformance with E.O. 11222 (May 8, 1965) and regulations issued by the U.S. Civil Service Commission (5 CFR 735.104, 33 FR 12487). Executive Order 12674 (April 12, 1990)_as modified by E.O. 12731 (October 17, 1990)_revoked E.O. 11222 and directed OGE to ``establish a single, comprehensive, and clear set of executive-branch standards of conduct that shall be objective, reasonable, and enforceable.'' On August 7, 1992, OGE published new Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch (57 FR 35006). These uniform standards of conduct, codified at 5 CFR part 2635, became effective on February 3, 1993; and supersede most of the provisions in the NLRB's regulations found in 29 CFR Part 100. Additionally, the new standard authorized executive-branch agencies, with the concurrence of OGE, to issue supplemental agency-specific regulations that are necessary and appropriate to implement their respective ethics programs (5 CFR 2635.105). Therefore, NLRB is amending Part 100 by removing/repealing certain sections of subparts A, B, and C that have been superseded by the new OGE regulations and by revising or redesignating the remaining provisions. In subpart A, ``Employee Responsibilities and Conduct,'' §100.101 has been amended to cross-reference the new executive branch-wide standards. Section 100.102 has been revised to accommodate redesignated §100.113. Sections 100.103 through 100.105, §§100.111 through 100.112, paragraphs (a)(2) through (d) of §100.113, §§100.114 through 100.122 have been removed. Section 100.123 is redesignated as §100.201 of the renamed subpart B, ``Cooperation in Audits and Investigations.'' Sections 100.301 through 100.305 and §100.307 of subpart C, ``Special Government Employee Conduct and Responsibility,'' were also superseded as of February 3, 1993, and have been removed. Section 100.106, with a revised paragraph (a) to show the new street address ``1099 Fourteenth Street, NW'' of the NLRB headquarters, is redesignated as §100.401 of the renamed subpart D. Paragraphs (a)(1) and (e) of §100.113 have been redesignated as paragraphs (a) and (b) of §100.102. NLRB is not removing these paragraphs, because they contain the Agency's requirements for approval to engage in outside employment and activities, and the prohibition to engage in private practice of law except in family or civic matters. Pursuant to the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch, these requirements will remain in effect until February 4, 1995, or until NLRB publishes new requirements. Effective October 5, 1992, OGE regulations contained in 5 CFR part 2634, ``Financial Disclosure, Qualified Trusts, and Certificates of Divestiture for Executive Branch Employees,'' superseded the executive branch confidential reporting regulations at 5 CFR part 735, subpart D and §735.106, as well as the NLRB's implementing regulations. Therefore, the NLRB is further amending part 100 by removing §§100.201 through 100.209, along with the heading of subpart B,'' Employee Statements of Employment and Financial Interest.'' Section 100.306 and the heading of subpart C, ``Special Government Employee Conduct and Responsibilities,'' and also removed. Sections 100.120 (gambling, betting, and lotteries) and 100.121 (general conduct prejudicial to the Government) of the NLRB regulations are not superseded by 5 CFR part 2635 nor any other OGE regulation. However, pursuant to E.O. 12674 (as modified by E.O. 12731), OPM issued a final rule on November 30, 1992 (57 FR 56433) to complement 5 CFR part 2635. Enforceable by the employing agency, this OPM rule_which revised part 735 of title 5, Ch. I of the Code of Federal Regulations_became effective on February 3, 1993; and established executive branch-wide standards in these conduct areas. Accordingly, the NLRB is removing §§100.120 and 100.121. Additionally, subpart D, ``Employee Personal Loss Claims [Reserved],'' is redesignated as subpart C; subpart E, ``Claims Under the Federal Tort Claims Act,'' is redesigned as subpart D; and subpart F, ``Enforcement of Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Handicap in Programs and Activities Conducted by the National Labor Relations Board,'' is redesignated as subpart E of part 100 of title 29, Ch. I of the Code of Federal Regulations. Section 100.570 is amended to show the new street address ``1099 Fourteenth Street, NW'' of the NLRB headquarters and the Director of Administration. This rule relates to Agency management and personnel. As such, no notice of proposed rulemaking has been published. For the same reason, the rule is not subject to the review requirements of E.O. 12991.
