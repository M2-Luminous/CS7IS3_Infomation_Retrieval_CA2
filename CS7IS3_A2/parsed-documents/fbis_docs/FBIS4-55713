Moreover, in their efforts to dissociate themselves from [Caritas Director] Ioan Stoica, they went so far as to claim that it was not the PUNR, but rather another party, the Democratic Party (National Salvation Front) [PD(FSN)] that had been the protector of the great nationwide con. Why the PD(FSN) and not another political grouping? Because [PD(FSN) President] Petre Roman's party is being used by the current government coalition worse than the kulak subject was exploited in proletarian literature. Whenever a post-December 1989 disaster occurs, it is immediately blamed on the Roman government. The proletarian writers were always blaming the fat kulak for all the mishaps in the village: for the threshing machine being offbeat, for the wheat failing to sprout, and even for the lack of rain. For the propaganda machine of the current left-wing coalition, Petre Roman's party is responsible for all past, present, and future evils. The PD(FSN) is to be blamed for the scope of corruption, for the huge number of unemployed, and for the holes in the pavement. Therefore, in blaming the PD(FSN) for Caritas, the PUNR leaders cannot boast that they have shown a great amount of originality. At best, they have showed a bit of cowardice. The whole country was and is aware of the fact that the responsibility for the setting up and expansion of Caritas belongs to the PUNR. As shown by the group of items published on page 3 of today's issue of our newspaper, Ioan Stoica enjoyed the unconditional and direct support of PUNR President Gheorghe Funar. Without his decisive support, Caritas would have never reached such fame, which went even beyond Romania's borders. The Caritas kind of game relies on the constant difference between the number of people who deposit their money and those who cash it. The more the number of depositors exceeds the number of receivers, the better the game can ensure the multiplication of the sum of money due to be cashed. This vital difference requires that increasingly more citizens take the company's cashier desks by assault to deposit their money. However, this requires that the citizens must have trust in the seriousness of the game. Consequently, the explosion of Caritas was made possible by the much greater trust put in this game, than in other similar games throughout the country. This was due both to Ioan Stoica's ability to project himself as a messiah and to the categorical support lent to Caritas by a man of Gheorghe Funar's caliber: PUNR president and Cluj mayor. Therefore, no matter how hard the other PUNR leaders tried to prove to the contrary, Gheorghe Funar's responsibility stands beyond any doubt. As a matter of fact, since he is a correct man, the PUNR president reiterated his public support for CARITAS at the end of last week. What else can his eulogy of the bankrupt Cluj game be -- at a time when everybody has realized that it is a swindle -- other than a declaration of public support for it? Even though it was done pretty much indiscreetly, the PUNR leaders have tried to distance the party from Gheorghe Funar in the matter of the Caritas affair. For instance, they said that the PUNR president's support for Caritas does not mean that the party also supported it. They also maintain that the Cluj mayor's involvement in this affair has nothing to do with his capacity as PUNR president, but that he did it as a private person. However, these are but sophisms of people with their backs to the wall! The trust of the Caritas depositors relied on the fact that the game was supported not by just anybody, but by a prominent political figure. If the party had dissociated itself from CARITAS and Gheorghe Funar at the appropriate time, by publicly condemning not only the game, but also the Cluj mayor's involvement, the people would have been more prudent before giving away their shirts to enrich Ioan Stoica. But then, the PUNR was quiet at the time, thus conveying the impression that all of it supports the Caritas scheme. The current gesture comes too late. Gheorghe Funar's involvement throws the burden of responsibility onto the whole party. Any public trial of the disaster called Caritas will have to examine the PUNR's involvement in the affair, as it will also be unable to avoid examining the dubious role played by certain journalists in the dissemination of the swindle. Nevertheless, there is still a salvation for the PUNR, namely to publicly condemn, in particularly firm terms, Gheorghe Funar's guilt in the Caritas affair. Likewise, it should rid itself of its president, by invoking the legal proceedings against Caritas. But this is a difficult, if not impossible, thing to do, without risking a major convulsion within the PUNR.
