The action was clearly contradictory to Indonesian foreign policy. The visit was premature and could send the wrong signals about Indonesia's diplomatic position toward the Middle East in general, and the country's endorsement of the Palestinian struggle in particular. The minister said this when he received three of the four journalists at the Foreign Ministry office in Pejambon, Jakarta on Thursday, 3 March. The three journalists were from MEDIA INDONESIA, INDONESIAN BUSINESS WEEKLY, and EKSEKUTIF. The REPUBLIKA journalist was not present because he is still abroad. As disclosed by the Foreign Ministry Directorate of Information on the afternoon of Thursday, 3 March, the three journalists clarified their reasoning and the background of their visit to Israel. They admitted that the Israeli Government hosted their stay, but they had to pay their own air fares. Minister Alatas said that although their visit to Israel might be understandable from a journalistic point of view, on the other hand, it could have sensitive political implications. The visit was premature, and it is feared that Israel might take advantage of it to champion its interests, particularly in lieu of the agreement on the declaration of principles for setting up a provisional Palestinian government. He said: "We welcome the declaration, but we should not be proceeding too far ahead or assuming that we will move rapidly toward a process of opening diplomatic relations. The journey is still a long way from finished, and any hasty moves could backfire on Indonesia and damage its interests." Indonesia, as the most populous Muslim nation, is seen as having a major and important role in dealing with any particular international issue that could easily influence other nations. The foreign minister said: "Because of Indonesia's reputation, we can only change our position after a very cautious evaluation."
