However, he is very familiar with the situation in Guizhou and is clear about ways to eliminate poverty and improve the economic condition of people in the province. Guizhou is located in China's southwest and is a remote landlocked province. It is not situated in coastal areas, is not along the Chang Jiang, and has no border areas. About half of all counties in the province are poor, and the number of poor people in the province accounts for one-eighth of all poor people in the country or 30 percent of the province's total population. Therefore, eliminating poverty has become the most important work in the province. However, is Guizhou really in utter destitution? Chen Shineng does not think so. When reporters interviewed him, he counted on his fingers and listed six advantages that Guizhou can utilize as follows: Guizhou has the advantage of energy sources, with more than 18 million tonnes of theoretical hydraulic power [shui li zi yuan di li lun yun zang liang 3055 0500 6327 3293 4104 3810 6158 5686 5661 6852] and 50 billion tonnes of coal deposit. Guizhou has the advantage of both mineral resources and a metallurgical industry, with deposits of phosphorous, manganese, antimony, aluminum, alumina, and 24 other mineral resources all ranking front in the country and relatively advanced metallurgical technology and facilities. Guizhou has the advantage of joint military and civilian mechano-electrical industry. A large contingent of some 480,000 military industrial workers formed in the past and assets and facilities of military industries provide good conditions for transforming military industries into nonmilitary enterprises producing commodities that can compete well on the market. Guizhou has the advantage of light and textile industries, represented by famous tobacco and wine. Guizhou has the advantage of chemical industry by utilizing local coal and phosphorous. Guizhou has the advantage of beautiful natural scenery and customs of minority people in developing tourism. Touching on Guizhou's tourism advantage, Chen Shineng spread his arms and humorously told reporters: "I formally invite all of you to visit Guizhou. There are not only the Huanggushu Falls but also national forest parks and many natural sites and cultural relics. Guizhou can be described as a place with beautiful mountains and lakes and wonderful customs of people of minority nationalities." Chen Shineng pointed out: In the face of such a situation and conditions, Guizhou will utilize the above-mentioned advantages to develop related industries. At present, it is necessary to grasp the opportune time to accelerate reform; speed up the construction of infrastructure projects; develop aviation, transportation, and communications; and laid down a good foundation for enabling the people to live a relatively comfortable life. In the vast and poor rural areas, it is necessary to strive to achieve "two increases, one decrease, and one control." He explained: The two increases are: 1) to increase the peasants' income from the present annual per capital income of 579 yuan by 90 yuan each year and reach 1,200 yuan by the end of this century; and 2) to increase grain output by improving rural facilities and raising the level of farming technologies. One decrease means to take resolute measures to decrease the number of people in poverty. Guizhou will strive to eliminate poverty for all people by the end of this century and must not lay a burden on the country. One control means to strictly control the people's birth rate. Chen Shineng said: It seems the above-mentioned goals are not very high, but it is also not easy for Guizhou to achieve those goals. However, since the industrious and wise ancestors in Guizhou could make the world renowned and tasty Maotai liquor, which requires a complicated technological process, the people in Guizhou can certainly make good wine in the new era to eliminate poverty and become rich under the excellent situation of reform and opening up and to celebrate the arrival of the 21st Century.
