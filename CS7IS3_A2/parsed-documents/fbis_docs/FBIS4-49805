Morgan Company of the United States, the Barings Group of Britain, the Bank of New York and other foreign consortiums have opened representative offices in Shanghai since the beginning of this year. The Shanghai office of the Barings Group also serves as the China-based office of the European Consortium. The Merrill Lynch Group of the United States, the largest securities brokerage company in the world, opened its Shanghai office in March 1993. Since then representative offices have been opened by Credit Lyonnais Securities Company, the Peregrine Brokerage Company of Hong Kong, the Yamaichi International Company of Japan, the Daiwa Securities Company of Japan, the Nikko Securities Company of Japan and the Nomura International Company of Japan. An economist in Shanghai said that overseas consortiums have been spurred into action by the rapid growth of the securities market in Shanghai. Deals struck in the Shanghai Stock Exchange amounted to 500 billion yuan in 1993, he said. The exchange currently offers 161 types of A-shares, shares issued to Chinese to buy, up from only eight when it opened three years ago. It also offers 28 types of B-shares -- shares issued to foreigners to buy using hard currency. A number of overseas consortiums are moving their Asian head offices or their China head offices from Hong Kong to Shanghai, the leading financial center in China, he said. For example, in August 1993, Citibank of the United States moved its China head office from Hong Kong to Shanghai. The Morgan Stanley Company of the United States, which opened a representative office here earlier this year, has decided to move its Asian head office from Hong Kong to Shanghai. The economist said that other foreign consortiums which have not opened offices in Shanghai are trying to obtain trading seats in the Shanghai Stock Exchange so as to underwrite B-shares. Overseas consortiums are playing a major role in issuing stocks and securities and helping China raise money, he said. For example, in 1993 the Merrill Lynch Company undertook to issue shares worldwide for the Shanghai Petrochemical Corporation. Earlier this year, it undertook to issue bonds worth one billion U.S. dollars for the Chinese Government throughout the world.
