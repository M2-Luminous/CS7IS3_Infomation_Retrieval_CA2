Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that the Knesset will discuss the motion next Monday [31 January]. UTJ says the desecration of Jewish graves in the Mount of Olives has been going on for a long time despite recurrent complaints to the police and Police Minister Moshe Shahal's promise from the Knesset podium to increase security there. UTJ notes that the grave of Rabbi Yitzhaq Me'ir Levin, a former minister of social welfare in an Israeli Government, was vandalized last Saturday.
