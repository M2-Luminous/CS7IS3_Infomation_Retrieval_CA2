The special subunit Vympel was set up under the First Main Directorate of the KGB [State Security Committee] to "perform missions for a particular period." The subunit is manned by officers with a higher education and fluent in foreign languages. Vympel's ordeals began with the Union's disintegration, going from one department to another more than once. It is now being prepared be placed under the wing of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is generally a logical thing. The unique skills of the Vympel associates will come in very handy in combatting organized crime. There is talk, however, that a national guard for Russia will be created out of the subunit. A worthwhile prospect, you will agree. The catch is that it has never been explained sensibly to the Vympel associates just what functions the special subunit will fulfill in the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs]. As a result there is total uncertainty. According to preliminary reports, more than 100 of the Vympel staff have already submitted requests for discharge. What is the forecast? It is even less comforting. As many as 80 percent of the associates could leave, in which case there would be only memories of Vympel, a school of unique combat skills set up and carefully safeguarded for many years. The professionals estimate that it would take at least 10 years to resurrect the special subunit.
