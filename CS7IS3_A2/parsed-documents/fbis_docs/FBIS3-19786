According to reports by the Foreign Ministry in Bonn, Ambassador to Turkey Horst Oesterhelt was instructed on Monday [21 March] to ask the Turkish Interior Ministry to "observe strictly" its promise to grant the group of observers at the municipal elections in southeast Turkey security and freedom of movement. The Foreign Ministry regrets that the Turkish promise to grant security and freedom of movement to German observers in the Kurdish areas has not been kept. The promise had been made last Friday at a meeting in Washington between Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and his Turkish counterpart Hikmet Cetin. Kinkel sent a reminder telegram to Ankara on Saturday, when the arrest of the observers became known. A delegation from Mainz and Wiesbaden that is to monitor the human rights situation at the Kurdish Nevruz New Year celebrations has arrived in Kurdistan, in contrast to other human rights groups. In a telephone conversation, one of the participants said the delegation is in the Batman region and wants to go on to Kozluk after the elections to prepare a twin city program. The six-member delegation, including Friedel Gruetzmacher, land parliament group chairperson of the Mainz Greens, said they can move about freely, but are being monitored by police.
