With his background in corporate management, he is worried about the difficulties companies are encountering in finding credits to finance the economic recovery. He suggests some solutions. [Robin] The members of the Monetary Policy Committee (CPM) have, for several weeks now, been stepping up their contacts with economic agents, especially outside of the Paris region. What are your views on the recovery? [Gerard] The recovery appears to have started, and, as in all phases of transition, hope tends to alternate with doubt. It also appears to me that industrial groups are more aware now of exchange rates and the problems they could be faced with in Europe caused by sterling, the peseta, and especially the lira, since the Italian economy seems very competitive. Bankers, however, are more concerned with interest rates and access to the capital markets. From the meetings I have had with representatives of industry, it is clear that their order books are starting to fill up again, although this has yet to be converted into actual revenues. Moreover, economic growth is being driven a lot less by domestic consumption than by exports. [Robin] How does industry view the so-called "strong franc" or policy of monetary stability? [Gerard] First, we should note that all world currencies are floating. The only area where there is stability is vis-a-vis the mark and the currencies of northern Europe, since they are linked by the European Monetary System (EMS). The problem is where other currencies are concerned, those that are outside the EMS exchange rate mechanism, such as the lira or sterling, not to mention the dollar. The fluctuation in the U.S. currency plays a key role, and yet the Bank of France and Europe in general have no control over it. However, in general French industry appears to be suffering more from the weakness of the dollar than Germany's. This is especially the case in the high-tech and aeronautics sectors, where our companies are more exposed than the Germans to U.S. competition. The Germans are more active in sectors like mechanical engineering, where they can determine world prices. [Robin] After the successive cuts of recent months, have interest rates reached a satisfactory level for companies? [Gerard] What companies are more concerned about today is gaining access to credit rather than its actual cost. The banks are subjected to the Cooke ratio, which stipulates that their credits cannot be more than 12.5 times their capital assets. Some of them had to absorb losses last year which reduced their assets and thus their ability to award loans. They suffered in 1993, and are now looking to restore their operating margins by choosing their risks more carefully and lending at still relatively high rates. [Robin] Should we fear a shortfall of credits for the recovery? [Gerard] Companies have particularly large borrowing requirements in two circumstances. First, when they lose money and are faced with a question of how to survive; and second, in periods of recovery and growth. The latter is the current situation. Companies have to replenish their stocks when the orders begin to come in again so that more revenues can be generated, even though the money will only start to trickle in in another six months time. Companies therefore have high borrowing requirements at a time when banks' offers of loans are tending to dry up, for reasons that are not necessarily all their own fault. [Robin] What solutions do you propose to get us out of this impasse? [Gerard] We should implement a number of solutions, but one of the simplest things we could do would certainly be to use the "carry back" [previous two words in English] mechanism better than we do currently. Let me remind you how it works: Companies that go into the red in a given year can deduct this loss from the profits made in previous years. This operation generates a tax debt which is only called in after five years. In reality, the state will only reimburse companies if corporate profits for the following five years are less than the previous loss. Companies finding themselves in this situation would then be in quite a bad position. [Gerard] Thus, banks will not allow companies to refinance their loans generated by carry back, which is regrettable. The banks would be a lot less reticent, however, if these debts could be demanded from the tax authorities after just two years. I should also point out that companies using this kind of instrument are generally healthy ones, since they must have made profits in previous years to be able to apply the carry back principle. [Robin] Would that be enough to trigger credit distribution? [Gerard] Of course not. We would also have to consider widening the field of guaranty and mutual insurance systems to cover risks. Sofaris, which guarantees bank loans under certain conditions, is currently playing a very positive role. However, the guaranty system would be more efficient and less expensive if Sofaris was not the only body of this kind. In any event, we must try and match the banks' offer of credit with potential company demand. Unfortunately this is not the case at present because this has been an extremely difficult year for everyone. [Robin] The policy of the Bank of France aims at lowering all interest rates as much as possible, including both short- and long- term rates. This is a legitimate concern, but does it really correspond to the needs of companies which have mainly short-term debts? [Gerard] That is a major topic for discussion: How can different economic operators all be financed? It seems that the state and the housing sector are mainly concerned with long-term rates. Large companies use long- and short-term rates in roughly the same proportions. Small- and medium-sized companies, however, are mainly concerned with short-term financing, with credits often index-linked to the short rates. Let me add that, in periods of recovery, what companies need more than anything else are short-term cash facilities to finance their capital requirements. This is the ground that monetary policy covers, but this policy is clearly not neutral; like all policies, it has redistributing effects. The CPM is looking to reduce rates gradually. We have seen eight cuts of 0.1 percent in the discount rate since the beginning of the year. Experience has shown that each cut had a favorable impact on long-term rates. During the bond market crisis that shook all the financial markets in the first quarter, France and Germany came out on top. The monetary policy that was implemented therefore had a beneficial effect for everyone. From my experience in industry, I believe gradual change is excellent. There is nothing worse for economic activity than sudden shocks, which then require very painful adaptation mechanisms. [Robin] Can we expect further interest rate cuts in France? [Gerard] The cuts we have made prove our desire to go along with the economic recovery. However, the banking system also has to be able and strong enough to pass this on. You cannot have ailing banks issuing loans. [Robin] Price stability is the final, or even sole aim of our monetary policy. At the end of the day, though, is this not a secondary concern since inflation is well under control in France and has been for several years? [Gerard] The framework of the law, and our Constitution, is clear: The Bank of France must guarantee price stability. The problem is knowing what we are measuring, and this problem has not really been considered. The CPM has set itself the aim of preventing retail prices from growing by more than 2 percent a year in the medium term. Maybe this gauge is not perfect. It is designed to measure just retail prices and excludes industrial production prices which can vary quite significantly -- on average, these fell, sometimes quite sharply, during the recession. How else can we define stability if there are no other indices? The retail price index is, perhaps, the best of a bad bunch. However, it is still open to criticism. [Robin] Is not the link with the mark, although this is not in the Bank of France's remit, more important than domestic currency stability which currently guides the bank's action? [Gerard] The Bank of France's responsibility is to maintain the domestic stability of the currency -- price stability -- which it defines itself. This is what the law dictates. It is the government's responsibility to set out the exchange rate policy -- all the Bank of France has to do is implement it. This policy has been defined, and has as its reference the European monetary agreement of 2 August 1993. A Collegial Institution [Gerard] In practice, it is clear that our aim has been to keep interest rates as low as possible in France. However, we must of course be careful about how the foreign exchange markets will react. We do not have much influence over the dollar rate, but we do have to take into account the behavior of the franc in the EMS. I should add that we are happy with the current franc-mark exchange rate because, as it stands, it means that French industry has a competitive edge over Germany. [Robin] The CPM is composed of very different types of people. What are the discussions like? [Gerard] The CPM will have been very successful when it manages to convince people it is a collegial institution. Having said that, our discussions can be lively, but our decisions are taken collectively. [Robin] After a vote? [Gerard] Everything is possible: a consensus decision, a common agreement, a vote, etc. Our meeting closely resembles any other board meeting. [Robin] Leaving aside its collegial aspect, how do you view the CPM's mission? [Gerard] The CPM has been asked to play the role of a kind of guardian of monetary morality. You have to understand that the currency guarantees trade. All trade is a contract, a promise that must be kept in space and time: The law demands monetary stability, a guarantee that this promise will be kept, while inflation distorts these contracts. Secondly, it is the CPM's duty to listen and explain. Since sovereignty of the currency was passed to us, we have to explain clearly what we are doing with it. The law states that we are responsible for our actions to the president of the republic and parliament. The success of the CPM will finally depend on the success of the economy -- we can make our contribution, but of course it is not all down to us!
