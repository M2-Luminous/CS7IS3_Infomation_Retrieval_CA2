The president of the European Commission in Brussels thinks that an international peace conference should be held as soon as possible: [Begin Delors recording] As things stand now, that is what has to be done. Then if the Serbs have finally understood, an international peace conference should be organized in order to find a solution, which will unfortunately be based on the partition of the territory, which is now inevitable. This is the second time I have felt ashamed in my life. The first time was when I ran away, walking a 500-km distance, running away from the German troops in 1940 during the invasion of my country, when there were no French troops to defend us. This is the second time I have felt ashamed of myself. The first time I was 12 or 13 years old. The construction of Europe gave me hope that this would all change. I am nearing the end of my career and I fear that I will bear this shame until the end of life. Yes I am ashamed! [end Delors recording]
