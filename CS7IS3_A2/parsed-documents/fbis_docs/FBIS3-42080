The Aramar Center in Sao Paulo will add 900 centrifuges in addition to the 600 already available for enriching 400 kg of uranium a year. The Aramar Center will be inspected by international organizations to verify if the energy being produced is for peaceful purposes. This will bring an end to the suspicion that the program seeks to make an atomic bomb.
