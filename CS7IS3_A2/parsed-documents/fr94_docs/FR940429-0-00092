FR940429-0-00092 FR940429-0-00012 State review standards for referred institutions (pages 3611&hyph;3613); Procedures for the disapproval by the Secretary of State review standards (pages 3613&hyph;3614); Procedures regarding SPRE reviews of referred institutions (page 3614); Peer reviews of institutions (pages 3614&hyph;3615); Procedures that a SPRE must follow to effect the termination of an institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs (page 3615); and Due process requirements (page 3615). In order to approve a postsecondary education institution to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs and many other Federal programs, the Secretary must determine, in part, that the institution satisfies the statutory definition of an ``institution of higher education.'' Under the HEA, one element of that definition requires an eligible institution of higher education to be accredited or preaccredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Secretary as a reliable authority as to the quality of the education or training provided by the institution. Another element requires an eligible institution to be legally authorized to provide an education program beyond the secondary level in the State in which it is located. In addition, to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs, the institution must be certified by the Secretary as administratively capable and financially responsible. Thus, the HEA provides the framework for a shared responsibility among accrediting agencies, States, and the Federal government to ensure that the ``gate'' to Title IV, HEA programs is opened only to those institutions that provide students with quality education or training worth the time, energy, and money they invest in it. The three ``gatekeepers'' sharing this responsibility have traditionally been referred to as ``the triad.'' While the concept of a triad of entities responsible for gatekeeping has had a long history, originating in 1952, the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, Pub. L. 102&hyph;325, significantly increased the gatekeeping responsibilities of each member of the triad. Specifically, Congress amended the HEA to provide for a new part H of Title IV entitled ``Program Integrity Triad.'' Under the new part H, the requirements that accrediting bodies must meet if they are to be recognized by the Secretary as ``gatekeepers'' for Title IV are specified in detail. Part H also provides a new oversight responsibility for States: the State Postsecondary Review Program. Altogether, part H establishes a set of responsibilities for accrediting agencies, States, and the Secretary that creates a stronger and more coordinated evaluation of institutions that participate, or wish to participate, in the Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary recognizes that the approach to significantly increased gatekeeping activity outlined in the statute for the three members of the triad is a new one. This approach will require leadership in both implementation and evaluation if it is to achieve the effectiveness that Congress intended. The Secretary will take steps to assure that the various responsibilities of the triad members are carried out in a manner that, in fact, results in the identification of institutions that should not be eligible to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs, on the basis of either the quality of education they offer or their inability to handle program funds. At the same time, the Secretary is committed to carrying out the responsibility for coordinating the activities of the triad members that are inherent in the statute in a manner that causes the least burden to institutions participating in the Title IV, HEA programs. To these ends, the Secretary is committed to effective management of the gatekeeping function. The Secretary will review carefully the applications on accrediting bodies and the standards and operating plans proposed by State Postsecondary Review Entities (SPREs) under the State Postsecondary Review Program to insure that they meet the requirements of the statute and these regulations and will enable these triad agencies to fulfill their statutory purposes. The Secretary will also place a priority on the completion of the ``Postsecondary Education Participation System,'' the Department's new integrated data base, which will contain the information that the Secretary generates in the course of the Secretary's oversight of institutions participating in Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary will use the data base to inform accrediting bodies and SPREs of actions taken by the Secretary so that they may in turn carry out their responsibilities. This expanded data base is also critical to the Secretary's effective selection of institutions for program review. Monitoring the results of the gatekeeping process is a very important key to effective management. The Secretary will evaluate the activities of accrediting agencies, SPREs, and the Department to determine their effectiveness in improving the integrity of institutions participating in Title IV programs and will take such steps as may be indicated to improve the results. Finally, as provided in the statute, the Secretary will seek the advice and counsel of the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity in evaluating the effectiveness of the triad. The Secretary believes that the approach best suited to achieving the objectives of the statute is a complementary one, with each member of the triad focusing its evaluation on its obligations within the context of the HEA. Thus, the focus for accrediting agencies is the quality of education or training provided by the institutions or programs they accredit. States, in addition to providing the legal authority to operate within the state required for participation in the Title IV, HEA programs, will review institutions that meet certain statutory review criteria related to institutional performance in the Title IV, HEA programs. The focus of the Secretary's evaluation of institutions is on the administrative and financial capacity of those institutions to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. While the functions and responsibilities of each of the triad members are generally different, the statute does require, in some instances, that all members of the triad evaluate similar areas. For the most part, the principle of complementary functions will lead to the members evaluating those same areas from different perspectives for different purposes. For example, all three of the triad members are required to examine the finances of an institution. If each looks at financial strength from a perspective complementary to that of the others, accrediting agencies would focus principally on the capacity of the institution to continue to offer programs at a level of quality sufficient to meet accrediting agency standards and to fulfill the institution's mission over a 5&hyph;10 year period of accreditation. The emphasis of a review by a SPRE would be on whether or not the institution possesses the full range of resources needed to serve students currently attending the institution. The Secretary's responsibilities focus on the institution's finance in light of its ability to provide the services described in its official publications and statements, to provide the administrative resources necessary to comply with its Title IV, HEA program responsibilities, and to meet all of its financial obligations, including, but not limited to, refunds of institutional charges and repayments to the Secretary for liabilities and debts incurred in programs administered by the Secretary.
