Under the current system, a per-share capital increase resulting from a company's purchases of its own shares for write-offs is regarded as a taxable dividend. The business community and securities companies have been calling for abolition of the tax to make it easier for companies to buy their own shares. The officials said the system will be abolished under a fiscal 1994 tax reform program and in connection with the scheduled year-end lifting of restrictions on companies buying their own shares.
