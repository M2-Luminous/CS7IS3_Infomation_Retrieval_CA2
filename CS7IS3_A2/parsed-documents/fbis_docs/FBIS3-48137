"The bills are not completely dead. They could be resuscitated by again winning a two-thirds or more majority in the House of Representatives, or by gaining approval in the joint committee of both houses," an editorial of the ASAHI said. The upper chamber rejected the package by 130 votes to 118, with 20 members of the Social Democratic Party, the largest force within the ruling coalition, voting against or refraining from attending the voting session. "The prime minister said, `there is now more room to reach a compromise with the LDP.'...But we would feel compelled to tell the coalition to hold it right there if some members are simply planning to adopt all of the LDP's proposals just to get the bills passed, as some of them have begun to openly say." "We have thought all along that the LDP's bills, which were rejected by the lower house, had too many problems as they had a larger margin of single-seat constituencies than the government's plan, as well as less strict controls on political contributions by corporations. We cannot agree to the coalition snuggling up to the LDP without principle," the ASAHI said. "We hold steadfast in our assertion that political reform must move forward as soon as possible. But that depends on the contents of the reforms. Rather than adopting all of the LDP's ideas as they are, it would be better for the government to think seriously about starting afresh in devising ways to restrict political funds and prevent corruption, separately from reforms in the election system," the ASAHI said. The MAINICHI SHIMBUN and the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN said Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa should not to retreat in the content of the reform bills in negotiating with the opposition camp. "If (Hosokawa's remarks) mean he intends to ease restrictions on political contribution by corporations to individual politicians, we firmly oppose to that," the MAINICHI said. The MAINICHI also said it opposes dissolution of the Diet for a snap general election to break the deadlock. The NIHON KEIZAI said that at least measures for anticorruption and tightening political funds controls should be realized during the current Diet session, which ends on January 29, and that electoral system reforms, which are currently thought to be the pivotal part of the bills, can be discussed later. It criticized both the ruling and opposition parties for having altered the anticorruption drive into a means to change the electoral system. The YOMIURI SHIMBUN said, "The ruling and opposition parties must be aware of their joint responsibility to enact political reform and should begin talks immediately to fashion a compromise." The YOMIURI calls on Hosokawa and LDP President Yohei Kono to hold a meeting to reach a compromise.
