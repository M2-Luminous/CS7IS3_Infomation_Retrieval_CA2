The military government treats the strike as a police (or Army) case and Lula as a criminal. 1989: the military establishment mobilizes against the victory of Lula as presidential candidate of the PT [Workers Party]. 1994: leader in the polls for the October elections, Lula already has the sympathy -- or at least the tolerance -- of important sectors of the Armed Forces, from the high command to the recruits. And the PT returns the courtesy by starting to put aside old dogmas such as the end of mandatory military service and the Calha Norte Project that foresees a greater Brazilian military presence in the Amazon. For the PT leadership, the rapprochment with the military seems worth the risk of greater internal disagreements when those who longed for the historic program begin to criticize the dissidents. Just the same, the military hard-liners do not trust the PT's softer stand and are working on the candidacy of former high-ranking conservative officers. The objective is to transfer the votes for the military candidate to Lula's adversaries in the presidential race. The PT letter of introduction for debating with the military is a defense program draft project that was entrusted to Colonel Geraldo Cavagnari, retired, director of strategic studies at the University of Campinas. The PT leadership has not yet approved the document entitled Defense Policy and the Armed Forces which is based on a position shared by the Brazilian high command. The document says: "Regarding external defense, if war is justified, the Armed Forces cannot react quickly and do not have the operational capabilities to allow an appropriate and effective response." In conclusion, Cavagnari defends the creation of a Defense Ministry enclosing the four military institutions, keeping the mandatory military service in addition to a voluntary service, reequipping the Armed Forces, and continuing strategic projects such as the Calha Norte Project, the nuclear submarine project, the space mission, and the AMX fighter. The most important proposal, and the most controversial, is the enlargement of the military budget, from the current 0.5 percent to 2 percent of the gross domestic product. Four times more. Oddly enough, two days before finishing his project and soon after the cries of the high command in December prevented the budget cuts included in the economic plan of Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Cavagnari in an interview with ISTOE defended increasing the military budget from 0.5 to 0.75 percent. The cries of the military against the restrictions Cardoso wanted to impose on their budget also encouraged the approval on 4 January of a line of credit of $800 million for the next four years for the purchase of Army equipment. The PT wing in charge of the main contacts with the military is known as "the two Joses." They are Sao Paulo Federal Deputies Jose Genoino and Jose Dirceu who in some way are counterparts of the generals and brigadiers because they participated with the guerrillas against the military regime in the 1970's. Genoino is a veteran in this type of contact but his position in a minority group within the party has somewhat tarnished his star. Dirceu is known for coordinating some kind of PT information service. Another PT expert on military matters is Minister Secretary of Strategic Affairs Mario Cesar Flores whose alias is Admiral. Flores, who is often mentioned as the man to head a military ministry under a PT administration, dismisses that by saying: "It is just foolish speculation. There was never any contact." It is known, however, that his friend Jose Genoino is the main spokesman in Congress for Flores' proposal for reforming the information services. The officers' overriding concern in their talks with the PT leaders is to know exactly who will be at the wheel within the government if Lula is successful at the polls, since the most leftist factions control the political party machine. A party leader contends that "the commanders even accept the establishment of a Defense Ministry, but are of the opinion that putting an end to mandatory military service would lower the quality of their cadres." It is within the Navy and the Air Force that the PT finds itself more at ease to sail and fly. As an influential PT leader says, "they are indeed against authoritarian regimes because their activities largely hinge on technological development, which dictatorial governments end up by holding in check." Lula and his followers perceive that the greatest troubles are to be found in the Army. Besides small groups such as Our Homeland [Patria Nossa], from Rio de Janeiro, or Fiend [Anhanguera], from Goias, the PT has pinpointed a nucleus of hard-liners grouped around former Army Minister [under Jose Sarney, 1989-1991] General Leonidas Pires Goncalves. This nucleus allegedly includes General Benedito Leonel, the Army chief of staff, who during the crisis that erupted due to cutbacks in the military budget was the one who sounded a note of warning about the danger of the "wrath of the legions." "The PT candidate is not an utter disaster, but does not have any administrative experience," says Gen. Pires. Dirceu and Genoino frequent the world of the military with a view to accomplishing two things -- discussing issues directly with high- ranking officers, thus bypassing established procedures in military hierarchy -- which makes the military's hair stand on end -- and leaving Lula out of these contacts so as to dispel the idea that the PT is knocking at barracks' doors. Dirceu states that "neither the PT nor the other political parties can politicize the Armed Forces, which are, and ought to continue to be, professional." All the contacts are made with the utmost secrecy. As the rapprochement with the military is a volatile issue, it is feared that rumors of a self-inflicted coup d'etat by Lula -- similar to the one Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori spearheaded in 1992 -- will be bruited about in order to tie the parliamentary opposition hand and foot to prevent a possible PT government. The breaking of that confidentiality law about the rapprochement with the military earned Genoino and Sao Paulo Deputy Aloiso Mercadante a stern rebuke from their colleagues last December. Genoino did not try to conceal a visit he made to [Strategic Affairs Secretary] Admiral [Mario] Flores to discuss the constitutional reform. Mercadante, on his part, showed to Army Minister General Zenildo de Lucena the evidence obtained by the Budget CPI [Congressional Investigating Committee] proving the involvement of leading firms of building contractors in the budget scandal. A general of the Army Staff who asked not to be identified told ISTOE that "there is no mutual sympathy in the rapprochement between the PT and the military. It is pure pragmatism." "It is absolutely normal for the presidential candidate of a party whose relations with the Armed Forces have always been difficult to begin his campaign by calming us and by trying to please us," added a colonel holding a high post at the Secretariat of Strategic Affairs. "No one has talked as much with the military as Tancredo Neves did," he concluded. Historian Selma Rocha, who is preparing a master's degree thesis entitled "The Brazilian Army Thought, 1964-1984," to be submitted at the USP [University of Sao Paulo] School of History, has another opinion. "Things have changed, because in previous decades both leftist and rightist sectors sought to attack the military. PT members seem to be willing, for the first time, to make society debate on the subject and control the Armed Forces," she said. Army spokesman General Gilberto Serra made a drier remark. "The PT has merely realized our problems the way no other party has, but it is not an ally, just like no party is. Perhaps it is the PT which needs us as allies," he said. The facts of the matter are that now that the cold war is over, except in some areas, the PT no longer appears in the eyes of the military as the virus of the red danger. "We are not concerned about ideological or party matters but about the efficiency of the institution," said Colonel Luiz Henrique Pirez, professor of the Army Command and General Staff School (ECEME) of Rio de Janeiro, at which generals are trained. Supreme Militry Tribunal president Brigadier Cherubim Rosa Filho has said that "one of the factors that draws the PT and the military close is that neither military officers nor PT lawmakers are involved in the corruption scandals." He even supported the bill submitted by PT Deputy for Sao Paulo Helio Bicudo, ruling that regular courts should adjudicate the crimes committed by the military against civilians. The Superior Military School [ESG] itself, which at other times was a center for training conservative cadres, is already considering the possibility of Lula being elected. Says an ESG document: "The most probable situation, which was chosen because it is the most probable -- though not the most desirable -- is an election that will put a leftist candidate in power through a consensus that will include the following sectors: the largest industrial entrepreneurs, the Armed Forces, civil organizations, Congress, etc." The ESG stated that this alliance will cause a conflict between Lula and the PT leadership. ESG officers, with whom several PT members have engaged in debates over the past few years ("Interest on the subject was second only to the debates with Herbert de Souza, also known as Betinho, the coordinator of the program against starvation," as an officer put it), are other channels for contacts between the PT leadership and the barracks. In this case, the PT interlocutors are Rio de Janeiro state leader Cesar Queiroz Benjamin, also known as "Cesinha," who is an ex-MR-8 guerrilla, and sociologist Marco Aurelio Garcia, who is a Unicamp [Campinas State University] professor and a former Troskyist leader. ESG and PT members will meet in February to debate on a common agenda of priorities. Cesinha has even sent a handwritten message to one of the officers who is organizing the meeting saying: "The idea to engage in a debate remains valid. It will be before the national PT meeting, and Lula has already said he liked the proposal very much. Greetings, Cesar." The message was accompanied by a gift of two books: one on the environment, and the other on the PT as an alternative leftist party. The courtship between PT leaders and the military gained ground during the two months in which Luiza Erundina headed the Federal Administration Secretariat (SAF) last year. Erundina was considered the goddess of the military, because she supported their salary adjustment proposals. President Itamar Franco has even reportedly charged Erundina with "promoting agitation in the barracks." The command liked very much a decree drawn up by Erundina banning the transfer of operational military real estate properties, which former President Fernando Collor had put on the market. The military believed that transfer of the properties would paralyze the frequent transfers of contingents from one state to another. Within the SAF, there are comments that Itamar Franco reportedly designated General Romildo Canhim to replace Erundina, not because of Canihm's links with ex-president Sarney but to compensate the military for the loss of their goddess. But the rapprochement between the PT camp and the military barracks is not all roses. Federal Deputy Jacques Wagner (PT-BA) [Bahia] has stated that "I do not like this babbling at all," adding that "the national party leadership is lurching toward a big brawl with party affiliates." Colonel Cavagnari's proposal to continue with the nuclear project (and the nuclear-powered submarine) has triggered the wrath of the green and ecologist faction within the PT, like Rio de Janeiro Deputy Carlos Minc. The public employees lobby, which has a lot of influence inside the PT and the CUT [Sole Workers Center], does not accept military demands to do away with the salary equality policy. Federal Deputy Maria Laura (PT-DF) [PT-Federal District], public employees' standard-bearer, has promised to oppose any proposal to end salary equality. While unhappy PT followers get ready to fight the party's defense program, military hard-liners start cleaning their sabers to oppose Lula. The hard-liners have the option of promoting the candidacy of prestigious reserve officers in many states [to legislative seats] and thus attracting the vote of the military toward Lula's presidential adversaries. In Rio de Janeiro, hard-liners are supporting General Euclydes Figueiredo (brother of former president Joao-Batista Figueiredo) and Colonel Pedro Rostey, from the PFL [Liberal Front Party], and General Nilton Cerqueira (PP) [Popular Party], president of the military club, to run for seats in the Chamber of Deputies. General Newton Cruz, also known as "Nini," wants to run for Rio de Janeiro's governorship but he still has not found a party willing to support him. Brigadier Ivan Frota will run against Rio Grande do Norte Deputy Flavio Rocha for the PL [Liberal Party] presidential nomination. In the Federal District those opposing Lula will concentrate their efforts on Colonel Kurt Pessek's candidacy while Goias' radical group Anhanguera will support Colonel Silesio Gusmao. Hard-liners want to take the air out of Lula's campaign at the barracks and prevent the emergence of new leaders such as Captain and Deputy Jair Bolsonaro in Rio de Janeiro. Bolsonaro is not liked for having mobilized officers' families at the Military Village seeking better salaries. At this time Bolsonaro does not have a party to support his candidacy because Deputy Alvaro Valle vetoed his entry into the PL. "We recognized Lula as president-elect. We have studies showing he is winning," Bolsonaro said. Lula, who tried hard to keep a very low profile during the entire process of rapprochment with the military, has started to speak up. During an interview by THE NEW YORK TIMES on 27 December the PT candidate said: "The military are treating us as if we already were the next government." Former President Jose Sarney took advantage of the quote to ironically say: "If that is true he should begin taking classes on how to answer military salutes." We do not know anything about those classes, but Lula is undoubtedly flexing his muscles.
