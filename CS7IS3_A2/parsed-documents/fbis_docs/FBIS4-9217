Ognjenovic: "From Slavonia Bank-Djakovo Branch: Stock Shares From Old Foreign Exchange Savings"] [Text] Djakovo--In accordance with the decision by the government of the Republic of Croatia under which stock in 44 companies is offered from the portfolio of the Croatian Fund for Privatization [HFP] to people who have claims against the public debt of the Republic of Croatia--i.e., old foreign exchange savings--Slavonia Bank-Djakovo Branch has begun collecting bids from interested clients. The bank will carry out for depositors all transactions associated with this major campaign, which began on 28 February and will last 90 days, according to directions from the HFP. The first auction, at which authorized brokers will buy stock on behalf of buyers, is scheduled for 28 March. Depositors who decide to use old foreign exchange savings to become stockholders in one of the proposed companies can get all the information they need at the Djakovo Branch, Ulica Hrvatskih Velikana 4. They will be provided with an explanation of all details connected with the transaction and the relationship with the HFP, and if they decide to be represented on the Zagreb Stock Exchange by one of the bank's authorized brokers, the Djakovo Branch will give them the opportunity to talk with brokers in order to get a more complete picture. The Slavonia Bank brokers will not charge a fee to their depositors, they will represent them at the public auction, and they are contractually bound to protect their interests, to act with reasonable care and diligence, and to apply the highest standards of the profession. The offered stock can also be acquired by those who do not have old foreign exchange savings, i.e., by all legal and physical persons who want to buy shares. They too can turn to the bank, which in that case will be an intermediary between them and the depositors who want to sell their old foreign exchange savings. The procedure is very simple. The seller of the old foreign exchange savings submits his offer to the bank with an indication of the amount that he wishes to sell and the discount (concession) that he is offering. The buyer submits his offer of the amount of old foreign exchange savings that he wishes to buy, with the discount that he is willing to accept. From the offered terms of buying and selling, the bank chooses the most favorable for both the buyer and the seller. In these deals, the bank again acts as an intermediary offering full service. Those who are a little more daring will recognize the opportunity of investing their own money and the inception of real stock exchange dealing--something that was inaccessible until only recently, and in which this time Slavonia Bank, in addition to its depositors, is involved.
