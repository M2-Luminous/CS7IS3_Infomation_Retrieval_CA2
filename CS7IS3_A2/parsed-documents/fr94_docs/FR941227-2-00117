Blanch. Notice is hereby given that by letter dated December 31, 1992, Mr. Blanch requested that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (Commission) impose immediate enforcement action against Rosemount Nuclear Instruments, Incorporated for a knowing and intentional failure to submit, as required by 10 CFR Part 21, a notice to the Commission that ``basic components supplied'' to its customers ``contained defects,'' as defined by 10 CFR ยง21.3. In a second letter dated March 28, 1994, the Petitioner requested the Commission to inform all users of Rosemount 1150-series pressure transmitters and trip units of ``significant safety problems'' identified in Commission Inspection Report 99900271/93&hyph;01, and that the Commission take ``prompt and vigorous'' enforcement action against Rosemount for careless disregard of the reporting requirements of 10 CFR Part 21. The Director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR) has granted these Petitions in part and denied them in part. The reasons for the Director's actions are set forth in the ``Director's Decision under 10 CFR ยง2.206'' (DD&hyph;94&hyph;12), which is available for public inspection in the Commission's Public Document Room at 2120 L Street, NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC 20555&hyph;0001. A copy of the Director's Decision will be filed with the Secretary for the Commission's review in accordance with 10 CFR ยง2.206(c) of the Commission's regulations. As provided by that regulation, the Decision will constitute the final action of the Commission 25 days after the date of issuance of the Decision unless the Commission on its own motion institutes a review of the Decision within that time. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 15th day of December, 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. William T. Russell, Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.
