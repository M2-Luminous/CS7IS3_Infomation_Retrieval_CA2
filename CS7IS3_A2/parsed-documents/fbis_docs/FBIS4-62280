Signatures were previously attached to the agreement by the heads of Russia's executive and legislative branches of government, leaders of political parties and public organisations, and heads of industrial, business and financial associations. Speaking during the signing ceremony, Chairman of the State Duma Ivan Rybkin expressed profound satisfaction with the progress of the signing procedure. "There were so many organisations wishing to sign the document," he noted, "that it was impossible to have them all sign the agreement simultaneously." Rybkin said this was "a very reassuring symptom". Comparing the present Russian society with a very sick person, Rybkin said that this spring marked the beginning of changes and new tendencies, which will undoubtedly improve the national climate. He noted that substantial changes had occurred in the country after the December 12, 1993, elections. The Duma chairman believes that the Russian society today realises that nobody has any right to lay claim to political monopoly or, even more so, to undivided donimation. "If we want civil peace in Russia, we are simply `doomed' to concord," he noted. Rybkin said that the formation of a bloc of political forces, capable of adopting serious and balanced decisions, was among the results of the current social changes in the country. He pin- pointed the president, the Federal Assembly and the Russian Government as the key figures of the current political process. "The most influential public forces," he stressed, "are definitely striving for civil peace and concord." Rybkin described the Social Concord Agreement as another step towards strengthening Russia's statehood. He believes the document's special importance lies in the fact that its signatories have pledged to act jointly in order to eliminate the reasons leading to possible manifestations of mass dissatisfaction. "The agreement," he stressed, "envisages methods to eliminate conflicts among various political forces." Noting that the Social Concord Agreement was not a panacea, Rybkin said that it was in the interests of concord not to dramatise the prevailing situation, but to use all the possible ways to improve it. "Today's signing of the agreement by youth, sport, women's and charity organisations," head of the presidential administration Sergey Filatov said, "shows that not only politicised sections of our society are eager for concord." Interviewed by ITAR-TASS, he stressed that today's signing ceremony had confirmed that all the sections of the Russian society "solidarise with those who are working for concord." Filatov said that new groups of organisations were ready to sign the agreement. The next stage of the signing ceremony will be held in the Kremlin on May 19. Representatives of the artistic and scientific intelligentsia want to sign the document. They will be followed by an "industrial group" -- heads of large enterprises and concerns. A similar initiative is being displayed in the regions.
