Speaking in Bonn on Friday [1 April], Horst Waffenschmidt, head of the Federal Government's agency for resettlers, said that during the first three months of 1994, 49,254 resettlers have come to the FRG, 47,500 of whom are Germans from Russia. Over the same period of 1993, the total number was 44,703, while in the first quarter of 1992 it was 47,702. In March, authorities registered 16,495 resettlers, which was 2,563 more than in February (13,932). Waffenschmidt emphasized, however, that the number of applicants wanting to resettle in Germany has gone down by more than 15,000 (from 72,293 in the first quarter of 1993 to 57,095 at the moment). Also, the number of people of German origin moving from Central Asia to German areas in western Siberia is higher than the number of people moving to Germany from there. In the former Soviet republics in Central Asia, there is "growing insecurity" among the Germans still living there, Waffenschmidt said.
