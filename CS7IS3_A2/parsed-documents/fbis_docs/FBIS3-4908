Earlier Wednesday, Song Yong-tae, chief South Korean delegate to the inter-Korean working-level contact, sent a telephone message to his North Korean counterpart, Pak Yong-su, accepting a North Korean counterproposal to hold the meeting Thursday. With the meeting, Seoul plans to announce the suspension of the joint U.S.-South Korean military exercise "Team Spirit," on condition that an International Atomic Energy Agency team starts inspecting North Korean nuclear facilities and a special envoy exchange between the Koreas takes place. The South Korean side is also expected to convey President Kim Yong-sam's desire to hold a summit with President Kim Il-song as soon as possible and Seoul's willingness to send its special envoy to Pyongyang first, the sources said. Song will be accompanied by Chang Chae-yong, director general of the American Affairs Bureau at the Foreign Ministry, and Kim Il-mu, a councilor at the prime minister's office, as members of the Southern delegation to Thursday's contact, the sources said.
