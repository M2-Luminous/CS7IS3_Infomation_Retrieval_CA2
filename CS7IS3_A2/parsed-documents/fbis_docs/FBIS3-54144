Before his departure he said: [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] You are leaving today for Washington to take part in the 12th round of peace talks. What can you say about the Lebanese file you are taking with you to these talks? [Shammas] Before answering this question, I would like to say why I am going to Washington. After consultations with the United States and Russia in their capacity as cosponsors of the peace conference that was launched in Madrid, Lebanon yesterday received through the U.S. ambassador to Lebanon an invitation to attend negotiations that will resume on 24 January at the level of delegation heads. On this basis, I am leaving Beirut today for Washington provided with a unified Lebanese political decision made with the information available to the government and after thorough coordination, which is natural, between Lebanon and Syria. This coordination was capped two days ago with the expanded summit in Damascus. I am going to Washington carrying the Lebanese people's aspirations and desire for an honorable peace that will safeguard Lebanese rights and bring about peace and security in the region based on a comprehensive solution and justice. The concept of a comprehensive solution was established and confirmed at the summit meeting between Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton. In addition, a positive climate has been generated by this summit that we can use to push the peace process forward. [Reporter] The Israeli response is still unclear, as President al-Asad, who paved the way for a fair and comprehensive peace, has said. How can you interpret this? [Shammas] In fact, President al-Asad was extremely candid. He has committed himself to the peace process and answered every question with complete clarity. He declared Syria's sure commitment to the peace process and his desire for a genuine peace. He elaborated on the elements of peace, which I do not want to repeat. All I would like to say is that his clarity was sufficient and the topics he dealt with were clear and so the ball is now in the Israeli court. The Israeli prime minister, who on several occasions voiced his desire for peace, has to take the necessary steps within the framework of the one clarified at the joint news conference held by Presidents Clinton and al-Asad. I do not want to comment further on this issue. [Reporter] In your view, this time will the U.S. role of full partner be more effective in pressuring Israel to implement the UN Security Council resolutions, particularly Resolution 425? [Shammas] Resolution 425 is valid and is a basic factor in the Lebanese position. The press uses certain descriptions, which I can neither approve nor reject. What I want to say is that President Clinton declared in a loud voice that Syria is the key to peace. He used clear English terms that leave no room for misinterpretation or doubt. He said: Syria is the key [last three words said in English]. He used the article "the" [said in English] clearly. This word caused us problems because it was not used in Security Council Resolution 242 in its English text. The word was clearly used in Geneva this time. Such a stance by the U.S. President is significant. What counts is that all resources should be employed to lay the foundation for a comprehensive and fair solution. In a comprehensive solution, Lebanon will be protected, particularly because it entered these negotiations in close unison with fraternal Syria. This is not rhetoric but fact because as long as Lebanon and Syria are in full agreement, they will be safe and sound. [Reporter] Will the 12th round of talks be held this month, Mr. Ambassador? [Shammas] We are now going to Washington to resume negotiations at the level of delegation heads. The results of our contacts will decide if there is a point in holding a new round. So, watch what will happen in Washington. I would like to tell you that for a long time you are not going to hear my voice. This is the last time you will hear me; you will spare your listeners a dissonant voice. Thank you. [Reporter] The Israeli ambassador to the United States said yesterday that Syria is the key to a Middle East settlement. He does not expect peace agreements with Lebanon, Jordan, and the Palestinians at this stage. What do you think? [Shammas] We believe, and the Lebanese officials have made many statements at various levels that if progress is made on the Syrian track, all Arabs, especially Lebanon, will benefit. But I do not believe that the other negotiating tracks will be deadlocked; they will affect each other. The Americans believe that Syria is the key to a solution. If the head of the Israeli delegation to the talks with Syria, who is also Israel's ambassador to Washington, agrees, then this is perhaps a positive sign. But I do not necessarily agree with him about his other conclusions. [end recording]
