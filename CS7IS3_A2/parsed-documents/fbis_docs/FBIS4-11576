The Federal Police acted in compliance with a Federal Court warrant issued in light of a complaint filed by national telecommunications officials because the pirate stations were interfering with legal radio and television stations. Luis Vanni is a controversial individual and the leader of the so-called "Vanni brigades" which have been involved in strange political events during elections. As the federal agents closed down the illegal stations, they found Vanni at his private residence in Arguello district from where he operated these neighborhood media. Vanni tried to stop the officers from closing down the stations and had to be subdued. He was arrested and taken to the local Federal Police station, charged with resisting law-enforcement officers. He was turned over to Federal Judge Raul Bustos Fierro.
