FBIS4-43001 "drweu112__a94027" FBIS-WEU-94-112-A Daily Report 10 June 1994 ANNEX Germany Seized Plutonium Reportedly Traced to Arms Production Seized Plutonium Reportedly Traced to Arms Production AU0106185894 Hamburg DPA in German 1615 GMT 1 Jun 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0106185894 Hamburg DPA German BFN [Excerpts] Stuttgart (DPA) -- Some of the plutonium seized in a spectacular operation in Baden-Wuerttemberg comes from the production of nuclear weapons. On Wednesday [1 June] night, DPA learned from a reliable source about the preliminary results of tests carried out at the European Institute for Transuraniums at the Nuclear Research Center at Karlsruhe. Ten percent of the total of 60 grams of radioactive powder are purest Plutonium 239 with an enrichment grade of 99 percent, which is generated only in the production of nuclear arms. It was further stated that neither the compound of the remaining 90 percent of the powder nor its origin are known. This requires still further tests. Until now, the authorities had thought that the country of origin was an East European state. [passage omitted] According to experts, the amount of the discovered plutonium is not sufficient for the construction of a nuclear bomb. Under optimal conditions, this would require at least 500-600 grams of pure Plutonium 239.
