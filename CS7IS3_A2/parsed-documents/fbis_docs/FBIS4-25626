Wu Lihong, Hu Zhihan and Yu Aijun are accused of robbery and murder in the boat-fire tragedy which claimed the lives of 24 Taiwan tourists and eight mainland crew, at Qiandao Lake, in east China's Zhejiang Province. On the second day of their trial before the Hangzhou City Intermediate Court today, the procurator from the Hangzhou City People's Procuratorate repeated that the three accused jointly committed a crime "very serious and harmful" to society. In their own defence, the three accused men all confessed their guilt, but expressed repentance for committing such a heinous crime. Wu Lihong said: "I committed the crime for the sake of money. Now, all I can do is to say sorry to the victims and their families." The accused men's three defence lawyers did not raise objections to the facts or nature of the crimes committed, but expressed the hope that the court would punish the defendants leniently because they had all three confessed their guilt and had shown repentance. The intermediate court announced that it would pronounce its judgment on the case tomorrow morning.
