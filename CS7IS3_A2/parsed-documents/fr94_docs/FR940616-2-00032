ACTION: Notice of a program for providing financial assistance to LEAs. SUMMARY: Pursuant to section 386 of Public Law No. 102&hyph;484, as amended by section 373 of Public Law 103&hyph;160, the ``National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994,'' November 30, 1993, notice is hereby given of a program to provide financial assistance to eligible LEAs. Section 386(b) of Public Law No. 102&hyph;484, as amended, requires DoD to assist an LEA that cannot, without such aid, ``provide [its]students .␣.␣. with a level of education that is equivalent to the minimum level of education available in schools of the other local educational agencies of the same State,'' provided that the LEA meets one of the three criteria established by section 386(c). For the purpose of this notice, the term ``military dependent student'' has the same meaning as in section 386(h)(2) of Public Law 102&hyph;484, as amended. In making the necessary determination under section 386(b), the Secretary of Defense must consult the Secretary of Education. DATES: June 16, 1994. ADDRESSES: Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Personnel Support, Families & Education), room 3E784, The Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301&hyph;4000. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 0 Dr. Hector O. Nevarez or Mr. John B. Shaver, Section 6 Schools, 4040 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203&hyph;1635; telephone (703) 696&hyph;4354 or 4361; facsimile number (703) 696&hyph;8920. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: During fiscal year (FY) 1994, the Department of Defense shall provide 40 million dollars to assist LEAs that meet criteria in section 386 of Public Law 102&hyph;484, as amended. (For the purposes of this program, DoD shall rely on data from the Department of Education). Pursuant to subsection 386(c)(1) of Public Law No. 102&hyph;484, as amended, an LEA is eligible for assistance under this program if it satisfies subsection 386(b) and ``at least 30 percent (as rounded to the nearest whole percent) of the students in average daily attendance in the schools of that agency in that fiscal year are military dependent students counted under subsection (a) or (b) of section 3 of the Act of September 30, 1950 (Pub. L. 874, Eighty-first Congress; 20 U.S.C. 238).'' Pursuant to subsection 386(c)(2) of Public Law No. 102&hyph;484, as amended, an LEA is eligible for assistance under this program if it satisfies subsection 386(b) and its average daily attendance (ADA) of military dependent students increased by at least 300 or more students from FY 1993 to FY 1994 as a result of ``a relocation of Armed Forces personnel or civilian employees of the Department of Defense or as a result of a realignment of one or more military installations.'' Such 300 or more students must equal an increase in the ADA of military dependent students of at least 10 percent or more from FY 1993 to FY 1994. An alternate way of achieving eligibility for assistance is prescribed under subsection 386(c)(3) of Public Law No. 102&hyph;484, as amended. To qualify, the LEA must satisfy subsection 386(b) and ``by reason of consolidation or reorganization of local educational agencies be a successor of [an LEA] that for fiscal year 1992,'' was eligible to receive payments under DoD Instruction 1342.18, dated June 3, 1991 (32 CFR part 240, 56 FR 28821), and satisfy the requirements in subsection 386(a)(1) or subsection 386(c)(2). For the purposes of this program, the following definitions are applicable: (a) Applicant. Any LEA requesting assistance under this notice. (b) Current Expenditures. ``[E]xpenditures for free public education, including expenditures for administration, instruction, attendance and health services, pupil transportation services, operation and maintenance of plant, fixed charges, and expenditures to cover deficits for food services and student body activities. The term does not include expenditures for community services, capital outlay, debt service, or any expenditures made from funds granted for the purpose of chapter 1 and 2 of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 2701&hyph;2976). An expenditure for the replacement of equipment is considered to be either a current expenditure or capital outlay, whichever is in accordance with State accounting guidelines, law, or practice.'' 34 CFR §222.3. (c) DoD Contribution. The amount of financial assistance an applicant shall receive under this notice. (d) Federal Property.
