The latest results show that with more than 15 million votes counted, the African National Congress is just 1.7 percent away from wining a two-thirds majority. The ANC has 64.9 percent, while the National Party [NP] is perilously close to the 20 percent cutoff mark required to capture a deputy president position with 20.5 percent. The IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] is still third with 8.1 percent. The IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] said of the 15,054,768 received from throughout the country, 14,893,634 have been accepted. [passage omitted] This is how the picture looks for the first two parties according the provisional polling percentages for each provincial legislature: In the Orange Free State (OFS) the ANC has 76.9 percent of the votes, and the NP 12.3 percent; in North West the ANC has 83.8 percent and the NP 8.6 percent; in KwaZulu/ Natal the IFP has 57.1 percent of the votes against the ANC's 28.6 percent; in the Eastern Transvaal the ANC has 81.8 and the NP 8.4 percent; in the Northern Transvaal 91.6 percent for the ANC and the NP 3.3 percent; in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region the ANC has 57.9 percent against the NP's 24 percent; in the Eastern Cape the ANC has 81.2 percent, and the NP 12.2 percent; in the Western Cape NP has 53.3 percent, and the ANC 33.1 percent; and in the Northern Cape the ANC has 49.9 percent, and the NP 40.4 percent. The provisional results were received this morning after it was discovered on Tuesday morning that someone had interfered with the IEC's computer systems. The results are now being fed in and analyzed at a slower rate. A team of computer experts is investigating the problem. It is not yet known who the culprit was.
