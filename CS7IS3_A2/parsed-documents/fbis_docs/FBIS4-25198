Wong Chi-keung's case was listed before Deputy Judge Jones on Friday and yesterday for plea to be taken and sentence passed. However, Friday's hearing was in chambers and yesterday's was in camera, meaning the press and the public could not attend. Counsel for the Crown, Alan Lucas, and the defence lawyer, Peter Callaghan, would not reveal what had happened except to say that the judge had been given a good reason before ordering the unusual course. Wong was given an undisclosed sentence on an unknown charge or charges. Article 10 of the Bill of Rights states that any judgment in a criminal case shall be made public except where juveniles are involved or it is a matrimonial case. According to a list of criminal cases in the Supreme Court lobby, Wong was charged with two counts of trafficking in dangerous drugs. A judge can hold a criminal hearing in camera, under the Criminal Procedure Ordinance, only if it is in the interests of justice or public order or if it is for the safety or well being of a witness or any other person. In previous sensitive cases, part of the proceedings have been held in chambers, where the sentencing judge can be informed of facts which are not revealed in open court. However, the charge or charges are made public and so is the sentence. However, there is a precedent in the English courts where a case was heard in camera although the sentence was made public. On appeal the court said it should only be done in exceptional circumstances and should be avoided if there was any other way of serving the interests of justice. Vice-chairman of the Bar Association, Gladys Li QC, said last night that the case was a worrying move, especially at this time in the territory's history and she wanted to find out more about the case. A leading constitutional law expert strongly criticised what he termed a "cosy little arrangement" between the prosecution and defence saying it undermined the rule of law. "Is this a foretaste of the secret trials for the future? It is positively disgraceful. I cannot think of this ever happening in the Commonwealth since the days of the Star Chamber in the 16th century. "You cannot have a private arraignment. What is so sad is that the Attorney-General wanted it to happen," he said. A number of lawyers with international experience said they had never come across a similar case. They said the judge should have appointed a lawyer as a friend of the court if the interests of both parties before him coincided, which may not have been in the public interest.
