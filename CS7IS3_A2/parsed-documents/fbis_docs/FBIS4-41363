The Ukrainian parliamentarians returned today after participating in a session of the Black Sea Parliamentary Assembly in Bucharest. Among those who met the delegation at the airport was Romanian Ambassador to Ukraine Ion Bistreanu. Now, let us listen to an interview with Oleksandr Mykolayovych Tkachenko, conducted immediately after the delegation's arrival. [Begin Tkachenko recording] The assembly of nine European and Asian states aims at uniting their efforts after the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance ceased to exist. We believe that Ukraine has made a correct step by joining the Black Sea Assembly. The topics discussed at this session, and it was already the third one, primarily concerned economic issues, as well as the role and place of Ukraine among other states [words indistinct]. The third topic discussed concerned cultural and social ties among our states. In addition to these nine states, Bulgaria and Greece were invited to participate in the Black Sea Assembly session as observers, and we believe that they will join this organization in the near future. We believe that the Ukrainian delegation accomplished its mission, because we defended our position, which envisions that the next assembly session will be chaired by Supreme Council Chairman Oleksandr Moroz. [Words indistinct] Ukraine will be chairing the assembly during this period. [end recording]
