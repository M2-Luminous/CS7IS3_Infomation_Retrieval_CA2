As for the rest, the structural changes to the executive branch are unanimously acknowledged to be cosmetic: There were 30 ministries, now there will be 23; some the committees have been renamed, others have been transformed, and still others have been abolished. Is that all? At first glance it is. But if we take another look, it becomes obvious that we now have a two-tier executive branch: The Russian Federation Government and the federal organs of executive power. This is the "cosmetic" aspect -- there used to be one tier, now there are two. And what are we to understand by the government? Is it the executive branch or is it a kind of special superstructure with the federal organs of executive power below? Let us assume that this is so. But who then is in the government? According to the Constitution, it is the premier, his deputies, and the federal ministers. At the same time it has always been thought that the chairman of an intersector state committee is even higher than a sector minister. Provision has now been made in the structure for federal ministries and "other federal organs of executive power." We may assume that, in accordance with the Constitution, ministers will be part of the government unless the cabinet decides to restrict itself to five members. But what will happen to these "other organs"? I do not wish to belittle anyone, but I think everyone will understand that the government will not include the directors of the Russian Insurance Activity Oversight Service or the Taxation Police Department. But what will be the position of the committees for industrial policy or machine building, or the counterintelligence and employment services? Finally, what about the Committee for the Management of State Property? I mean to say that their place among the "other federal organs" is fixed. But what is their position vis-a-vis the government? It should be noted that, at this top level of political leadership, it is normally the case that nothing is ever "just so." Privatization began two-and-a-half years ago, and an appropriate law was adopted at the time. Among other things, it said that the chairman of Goskomimushchestvo [the State Committee for the Management of State Property] was a member of the government and an ex officio deputy premier. I cannot recall anyone rescinding that law, but the law, of course, is not the main issue -- the matter goes deeper than that. It is clear that at the time this committee was "elevated" because privatization had only just gotten under way. But what now? Maybe it has finished? The privatization program is supposed to have been adopted quite recently, so it is continuing. Although it must be admitted that by no means everybody is enthusiastic about the way it is developing. Surely it would be better if Goskomimushchestvo were to forfeit all its influence over the members of the government -- the federal ministers -- and through them its influence over regional authorities? Maybe Goskomimushchestvo has dropped down into the category of "other federal organs" because it has trodden on too many people's toes? In that case permit me to ask the central question: Generally speaking, what kind of government structure are we discussing? Everyone agrees that we are talking about a reform government. But privatization is at the heart of the reforms. Moreover, it is the part of the reforms, which gives something to people rather than taking it away from them. Incidentally, it is the only aspect of the reforms that has a clear, approved, and detailed program for the coming year. What reforms would the government implement if it were to drop this program? My conjectures could be mistaken, however: After all, the edict says nothing about Goskomimushchestvo's being outside the government framework. The fact is that anyone can, if he so desires, interpret the words of the edict in whatever way he pleases. But in such cases it is usual practice to issue an interim, trial document, which includes room for maneuver rather than a totally definitive text. And, depending on the reaction, the lacunae are then filled in with specifics. The proposed structure, it should be recognized, could be filled with any content whatsoever, right up to state sector regulation of the economy. It seems that the innovation involving dual subordination of certain organs belongs in the same experimental category. The Ministries of Defense, Internal Affairs, Foreign Affairs, and dozens of different services are part of the executive branch structure, but are also subordinate to the president. There is supposedly nothing unnatural about this, because the entire executive branch is subordinate to the president. He manages his own branch through the government, but how is he going to handle the elected representatives? He will apparently have to establish a special apparatus. But this is just another guess. No, I am still not going to describe the changes in the government structure as cosmetic -- these changes raise too many questions. Serious questions to which we have not yet received any answers. However, there is a rule of thumb: If you want to find out answers, you first of all have to phrase your questions in such a way that they lead to the desired result. Or you may not wish to phrase any questions at all. You can simply wait for additional information to appear; which apparently will not be long in coming.
