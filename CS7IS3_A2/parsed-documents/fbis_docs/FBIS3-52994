Riak Mashar, leader of a breakaway group of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), said the Islamic fundamentalist government was also massing troops for a new offensive against the mainly Christian and animist southern rebels. Fighting reportedly erupted between rebels and government forces near the Ugandan border last week, but details were unclear. Riak told AFP that John Garang, chief of the mainstream SPLA faction, was preparing an attack despite a new agreement between the rival rebel factions to conduct joint negotiations with Khartoum. "Garang is planning an attack on our positions at Lafun, north of Torit, in the next day or so," Riak told AFP. Torit, a town near Sudan's southern border with Uganda, has often been used by Garang as his field headquarters. "This is unfortunate, and I am still hoping that the ceasefire will hold," Riak said. A spokesman for Garang's group, however, denied the allegation. "It is not true," said Philip Lomodong, the faction's east African representative. Riak and Garang said they had agreed after talks in Nairobi last week with representatives of regional governments to renew a ceasefire declared in October. Riak, however, said Garang's group had broken the ceasefire only a week after it was agreed, and had captured two of his positions at Iktos and Chikudum in October. There had been no other major fighting between the two rival SPLA groups since October, he said. Riak said the government was "building up its forces for a new offensive" and was transporting troops to the south in five barges on the Nile. "We are expecting heavy fighting soon," he said. Riak's SPLA United and Garang's SPLA last week agreed to negotiate jointly with Khartoum after talks here with foreign ministers from Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Uganda, members of the regional group the Inter-governmental Authority on Drought and Development (IGAAD). The rebels are demanding self-determination for the vast, undeveloped south, where UN officials say a million people need food aid. But they might delay a proposed referendum on establishing an independent southern state if Khartoum agreed to interim arrangements, rebel officials said. Philip O'Brien, head of the UN's Operation Lifeline Sudan, said an outbreak of fighting between rebel and government forces would disrupt aid and could spark a huge humanitarian crisis. Sudanese government representatives who also met the IGADD ministers in Nairobi last week reiterated Khartoum's refusal to allow the south to secede. Riak's faction split from Garang's group in 1991 because Garang rejected calls for an independent south, insisting that he could break Moslem domination without dividing Sudan. But Garang has since changed his position to favour a referendum. "We are working to form a joint delegation to the peace talks with Khartoum which we hope will soon be convened by the IGADD," Riak said. "We have been fighting amongst ourselves on the question of self- determination," Riak said. "Now that Garang has changed, we are urging the international community to put pressure on Khartoum so that new talks can be held." Theoretically the next step in the process to end Sudan's decade-long war is a new round of IGAAD-mediated talks. But African diplomats expressed fears that Khartoum, whose relations with the West are strained, would instead mount an offensive. Fighting between rebel and government forces, and between the rival rebel factions, has often stopped aid from reaching the inaccessible southern swamplands, UN officials said. "The humanitarian situation is appalling," Riak said.
