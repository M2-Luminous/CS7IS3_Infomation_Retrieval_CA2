There were still many arduous tasks facing these zones, Mr. Wu said, such as the transfer of government functions, construction of legislation and the operation of the market economy. The personnel system still was not able to meet the demands of the market economy and spiritual civilization also faced a long-time task. These zones, therefore, had to exercise scientific management in order to meet the demands of the market economy. Reform and work in various sectors in these zones, he said, should go forward at the same pace. For example, emphasis should not be only placed on a single item but should be put on the coordination of industrial structure and its promotion; it should not only be put on the economic build-up but on reform for the administrative system as well as the construction of morality, culture and ideology and not only on the introduction of foreign capital and opening to the outside world but on the restructuring of the economy. Relevant departments and their staff should, Mr. Wu said, make full use of all the policies implemented in such zones, striving for realization of the strategic goals set for the zones by Deng Xiaoping.
