FBIS3-43144 "cr00000003094001" 20 January 1994 Article Type:FBIS Document Type:FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-009--UKRAINE UKRAINE'S BRAIN DRAIN: PROLIFERATION, NUCLEAR SAFETY IMPLICATIONS According to recent press reports, the Ukraine's brain drain is massive and critical, especially for the nation's nuclear industry. Both Ukrainian and Western governments hope that the establishment of an S&T center funded by the West will keep nuclear weapons specialists busy and at home. Actual figures for Ukraine's brain drain were given in the UkAS's monthly bulletin in July 1993. Over the past three years, the Academy has lost about 17,000 employees or about 20 percent of its workforce. However, only about 1,000 of these, or 6 percent, were scientific workers. When 300 scientists went abroad for sabbaticals of six months or more, 80 percent did not return when the sabbatical ended. Recruitment levels for the Academy have declined to half that of pre-independence years (Kiev VISNYK AKADEMIYI NAUK UKRAYINY Jul 93). Comparable losses have also been experienced by the numerous engineering centers and R&D enterprises operated by the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences--about 18,000 workers or 15 percent of the work force. (Kiev VISNYK AKADEMIYI NAUK UKRAYINY Jul 93). In a recent newspaper article, President of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences (UkAS) Boris Paton said that the Ukraine's brain drain was "massive" and that it is an "unquestionable threat to the country's national interests" (Kiev PRAVDA UKRAINY 14 Dec 93). It is the Ukraine's nuclear power industry, however, that has been most seriously affected by the brain drain. Ukraine is facing a 25 percent shortfall in electric power generation this winter because of fuel shortages at conventional power plants and cannot afford to close down its nuclear power facilities, which are responsible for about 40 percent of Ukraine's winter electric power production. They cost about half as much to operate as conventional power plants as well (Kiev DEMOKRATYCHNA UKRAYINA, 27 Oct 93). According to Deputy Minister of the Power Industry and Electrification B.V. Korotya, the situation is "close to critical." Coal supplies have been exhausted at many power plants and others are operating at only half capacity. Power plants that burn fuel oil are now receiving far less than the 20,000 tons per day promised by the chairman of the Oil and Gas Committee, which is about 9,000 tons per day less than what they actually need (Kiev Ukrayinske Telebachennya Television Network, 1900 GMT 24 Nov 93). Although Ukraine has an urgent need to maintain its nuclear power facilites, it is experiencing great difficulties in keeping them staffed. 1,254 employees left their jobs at Ukrainian power plants during the first nine months of 1993, including 1,100 "highly skilled professionals," according to a Ukrainian Television Network broadcast. 400 specialists left key jobs at the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Station alone in 1993, emigrating to Russia because they were dissatisfied with wages and working conditions. Yet, the Zaporozhye station saved Ukraine over 2 million tons of coal in the third quarter of 1993 alone (Moscow Ostankino Television First Channel Network, 2100 GMT 7 Nov 93). The industry has managed to cope with the losses by reassigning personnel from facilities where a moratorium on new facilities had halted construction or use. That manpower source has now been exhausted, and should resignations continue, there will be no further reserves to draw upon (Kiev Ukrayinske Telebachennya Television Network 1900 GMT 01 Dec 93). Ukraine is also experiencing difficulties in training nuclear specialists to replace those it has lost. According to Vladimir Bronnikov, director of the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Station, it takes five to six years to train new operators. Furthermore, because Ukraine's training facilities are among the best in the former Soviet Union, its graduates are in very high demand. Nuclear specialists leave because wages and benefits in Ukraine are not competitive. (Kiev PRAVDA UKRAINY 3 May 93). A complaint by Ukraine's Ministry of Environmental Protection suggests that current training is inadequate and hurried. According to the Ministry's press service, "personnel at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station, which were completely replaced in 1987-1988, do not have sufficient experience in dealing with complex or emergency situations at RBMK reactors. There is no full-scale simulator at Chernobyl to help train personnel in dealing with emergency situations" (Kiev UKRAYINSKA HAZETA 4-17 Nov 93), Meanwhile, Ukraine's economic crisis has made it impossible for the nation to purchase adequate supplies of conventional fuels, thus forcing the Supreme Council of Ukraine to lift a moratorium on building new nuclear electric power stations and putting them into service. The council was also forced to delay implementation of legislation mandating the closure of the infamous Chernobyl station, despite the lobbying of many antinuclear organizations (Kiev DEMOKRATYCHNA UKRAYINA 27 Oct 93). In addition to nuclear power plant workers, Ukraine is having difficulties keeping nuclear weapons specialists employed. On 25 October, the final decision was adopted to create a Scientific and Technology Center in Ukraine (STCU) to "ensure the nonproliferation of technologies and special knowledge associated with weapons of mass destruction." The center will be funded by the United States, Canada, and Sweden and will finance projects employing scientists and engineers who are specialists in nuclear weapons technology.
