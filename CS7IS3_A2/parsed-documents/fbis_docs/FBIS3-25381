It should be recalled that last year those soldiers robbed goods and resorted to other disorderly behavior, culminating in the detention of the presumed mutiny leaders. At the time (5 February) that assembly area, a few meters away from the station had already received 942 men who had already carried out their "check in" [preceding two words in English], of which 886 had already been registered. Three of the confined soldiers have perished in differing circumstances. Major De La Pena, head of the UN peacekeeping forces in the area, has reported that weapons handed over include 886 assault rifles (864 "AK-47" and two "FN") [figures as published], 16 submachine guns (six "RPG", eight "RP-46", and two "DP"), 49 pistols, three mortars (one "M-60" and two "M-82"), 12 "RPG-7" rocket launchers, two hand grenades, and 17 antipersonnel mines. There are several diseases affecting soldiers at the camp: malaria (84 cases), gonorrhea (38), diarrhea (118), conjunctivitis (17), parasite-related diseases (32), and dysentery (10). Namialo has no ambulance, but the seriousness of some the cases prompted the removal of seven patients to other health posts or hospitals able to afford better health care. Major Domingos Pilote, liaison officer and commander of that government assembly area, explained that, as a result of the mutiny in December last year, "strong arm tactics" had to be used to restore discipline to the camp. The forces of law and order had to intervene and had wounded one of the mutineers. He said that increased and more diversified food, the neutralization of the mutiny leaders, and constant visits by officials from government and other institutions were other measures that had been taken with a view to restoring discipline to the camp. The government sent 270 kg of fresh fish, 150 kg of pork, 191 kg of dried fish, 530 kg of salt, and 650 kg of corn to that area between 19 and 23 December. In turn, the World Food Program ferried to Namialo assembly area 27,609 kg of corn, 10,555 kg of rice, 3,878 kg of peas, 4,504 kg of beans, 1,185 kg of sugar, and 2,071 kg of cooking oil. The UN Operations in Mozambique Demobilization Technical Unit made available 978 blankets, 942 plates, 15 cooking pots, 432 kg of soap, and 250 kg of cement.
