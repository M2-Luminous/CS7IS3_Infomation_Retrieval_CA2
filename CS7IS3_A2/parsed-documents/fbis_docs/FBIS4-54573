The rate of inflation continued to slow in March. It went up 0.5 percent in March and 2.6 percent since the beginning of the year. According to preliminary data, the money supply expressed in terms of the M2 aggregate declined by 5 billion korunas [Sk] in March, compared with February. In terms of the M1 aggregate (money in circulation and nonterm deposits), it declined by Sk4.2 billion. The aggregate volume of primary deposits declined by Sk6.1 billion in March, which was caused, to a decisive extent, by the deadline for filing tax returns [last day of March]. Refinancing credits declined by Sk2.5 billion in March. The state budget deficit was reduced by Sk700 million and amounted to Sk4.5 billion as of 27 April. The government's net position vis-a-vis the banking system is approximately Sk60 billion. The NBS's foreign exchange reserves are growing gradually. At the beginning of January, they stood at $340.17 million, in mid-February at $350 million, by 23 March at $427.54 million, and by 21 April at $536.4 million (all these figures exclude gold reserves). The share of new loans in the increase has been minimal; purchases from commercial banks at the foreign exchange fixing have been decisive. The entire banking sector availed itself of foreign exchange reserves of $1.896 billion as of 20 April. The deficit on the clearing account with the Czech Republic is declining. At the end of December 1993, Slovakia had a deficit of 168.9 million XCU's [clearing European Currency Units] (Sk6.6 billion), at the end of January 1994 a deficit of 176.1 million XCU's (Sk6.9 million), and at the end of February a deficit of 125.9 million XCU's (Sk5.4 billion). By 1 April, the deficit dropped to 59.9 million XCU's (Sk2.3 billion), by 15 April to 42.1 million XCU's, and by 27 April to 12 million XCU's (Sk489.4 million). NBS Vice Governor Marian Jusko said that the NBS measures to reduce the amount of money in circulation, made necessary by the rapid increase in the state budget deficit in the last two weeks of last year, fulfilled their purpose and that the granting of refinancing credits is gradually being renewed. Promissory notes to finance agriculture have started being rediscounted [reeskontovat] again. The Sk500 million, which is the limit set aside for this purpose, should help bridge the shortage of funds in laying foundations for the new harvest.
