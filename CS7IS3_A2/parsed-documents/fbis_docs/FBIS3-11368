After the series of congresses and conferences and the plan of the parliamentarians, political parties and groups are multiplying proposals aimed at lifting the country out of deadlock. The following is a report by Wilker Fecond: [Begin recording, in Creole] [Fecond] While the parliament is divided, plans are coming from everywhere. Proposals are being made to get Haiti out of the difficult deadlock it is experiencing today. Reactions continue to come from political parties and people's organizations, each perceiving the situation differently. Reynold Georges, leader of Alliance for the Liberation and Progress of Haiti [ALAH], has reacted against the statement of the National Coalition [CN]. We remind you that the CN asked the Army to assume power so as to end the suffering and misery of the people. This statement has greatly shaken ALAH because it maintains its stance asking for the resignation of the head of the Army, which it considers the only way to resolve the crisis. [passage omitted] In the same vein, Saint-Martin People's Movement [Mouvman Popile Senmaten, MPSM] says in a statement to Signal FM that the country's problem is not the matter of a plan, but rather is compliance with what was contained in the Governors Island agreement to facilitate the return of President Aristide to power. [passage omitted] For its part, the Association of Young Haitian People's Power [Asosyasyon Jen Pouvwa Popile Ayisyen, AJEPOPOA] takes another stand, asking both President Aristide and General Cedras to step down. At the same time, the coordinator of this organization, Jude L. Jean-Jacques, has asked the Army to give the people a little leeway to go into the streets to demonstrate their discontent with all that is happening in the country. [Jean-Jacques] Without doing anything wrong, in order and discipline, without disorder or looting, we will go into the streets as early as next week carrying our placards of demands to say no to Gen. Cedras, no to Father Aristide, yes to democracy, yes to a national solution, and yes to a responsible power working in the interests of the Haitian people. [Fecond] This is how the situation is and many observers are wondering how long it will take Haiti to find a way to peace and reconciliation [and out of] the critical situation it is experiencing today.
