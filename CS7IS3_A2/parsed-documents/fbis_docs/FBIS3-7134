That's the view of the Australian trade minister, Bob McMullan. He is the first government member to visit Malaysia since Prime Minister Paul Keating's reference to Dr. Mahathir as recalcitrant threatened trade and diplomatic links. Indeed, despite Prime Minister Mahathir's apparent sensitivity to outside criticism, Senator McMullan said he would strongly encourage Australian business to invest in Malaysia. Trevor Watson reports from the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur: [Begin recording] [Watson] Malaysia's Trade Minister Rafidah Aziz met with Senator McMullan in the room she used for discussions with the minister's predecessor, Peter Cook, at the height of last year's row. While those earlier talks were charged with Malaysian threats and, I understand, Australian counterthreats of trade sanctions, Senator McMullan simply described his meeting as very useful. The new trade minister was reluctant to dwell on the crisis of last December, preferring to point out that bilateral trade grew by 30 percent in 1993, and is now worth $2 billion [currency not specified] a year. [McMullan] There are the jobs of thousands of people in each country dependent upon the success of our trade, and so we are both working to maintain and build on that success. [Watson] How would you characterize the relationship now, sir? [McMullan] Oh, I think it is a successful working bilateral relationship which is very successful at a trade level and is healthy at all those other things that are part of relationship between neighbors -- to do with tourism, cultural exchange -- but the strength of the relationship is the commercial, the trade, the investment relationship, and that is very strong and rapidly growing, 1993 was a year of outstanding growth in trade between our two countries. [Watson] While Malaysia could have suffered serious trade, investment, and employment losses, Kaula Lumpur was prepared last December to threaten links with Australia over Paul Keating's remarks. In the end, the prime minister said he regretted the remarks and relations rapidly returned to normal. Now it's Britain that's bearing the brunt of Dr. Mahathir's wrath. Last month, Kuala Lumpur announced that in future British firms would be barred from government contracts in retaliation for London media allegations of high-level corruption in Malaysia. The move could cost British industry billions of dollars. Given that so much can hinge on a loose word from a foreign leader or a newspaper article, would Senator McMullan encourage Australian business to invest in Malaysia? [McMullan] Yes, we are encouraging Australian business to invest throughout the region, we've consciously, as a matter.... [pauses] The government has consciously done research and released a report showing that more investment in this region will lead to more trade and create more jobs. So we encourage people to do it. It's a question for any individual company where their corporate strategy and their view of whether they might make a profit is where they should invest and if that happens to be Malaysia well then we will recommend that they do it. [Watson] Dr. Mahathir now says he may consider lifting the ban on British firms when the British press stops telling lies about Malaysia. [end recording]
