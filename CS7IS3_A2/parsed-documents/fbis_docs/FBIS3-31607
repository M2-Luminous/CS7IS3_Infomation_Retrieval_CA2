Transport officials from Turkey, Bulgaria, Albania and Italy and Macedonia told journalists they had agreed on a road and rail link to the former Yugoslav republic, which would be coordinated in the Bulgarian capital. The creation of such a corridor was an "urgent necessity" after Greece's decision Wednesday to bar Macedonia access to the Greek port of Salonika, halting its oil imports, the country's deputy Transport Minister Yorgo Sundovski said at a press conference.
