He was responding to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's demand that 'Arafat reaffirm in writing his commitment to the accord, otherwise the negotiations with the PLO would be suspended. Hasan 'Asfur, who has been director general of the department following up negotiations with the Israelis since his return to the Gaza Strip last week, has said that "commitment to the accord was announced before the entire world, not in a closed room. The Israeli Government, the PLO, and the cosponsors of the peace process all have a copy of the text." 'Asfur, who participated in the Cairo negotiations and in drafting the Gaza-Jericho agreement, said that "despite the difficulties that emerge from time to time, the agreement to continue the negotiations is binding on the Israelis, just as it is binding on the Palestinians." He went on: "There are no preconditions in the agreement. It might help Rabin to read its clauses." 'Asfur said that the second part of the negotiations concerning the early transfer of powers in the West Bank could begin in June. He added that Palestinian President 'Arafat's presence in the self-rule areas is essential before these negotiations begin. [passage omitted]
