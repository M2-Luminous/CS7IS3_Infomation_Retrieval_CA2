In a telephone interview with AL-DUSTUR in Aden yesterday, he emphasized that Jordan has played, and is still playing, a very important role in calming the situation in Yemen, whether through its active participation in the joint military committee or through its relentless efforts to bring the views of the conflicting parties closer together. On the recent meeting between Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his deputy 'Ali Salim al-Bid in Salalah, al-'Attas said the meeting achieved good results and the president and his deputy managed, in their closed meeting, to discuss a host of issues concerning the situation in Yemen and reached practical solutions for these issues. He added: We hope that this meeting will open the way for convening other meetings at the level of Yemeni leadership. The Yemeni prime minister emphasized that the meeting between the president and his deputy is in itself a national achievement. Answering a question on the possibility of a military explosion in Yemen in light of the charges exchanged by the parties regarding shipments of weapons to Yemen, al-'Attas emphasized that all parties in Yemen do not want the situation to reach the point of explosion, and all are prepared to do whatever they can to avoid bloodshed. The Yemeni prime minister said the situation is improving in Yemen, and stressed that the government meeting, planned to be held in Ta'zz today will take place and will discuss implementation of decisions made by the previous government meeting held in Aden. These decisions focussed on implementation of the accord document. He added that the government will adopt a number of other decisions to complete the mechanism through which the document will be implemented. Meanwhile, AL-DUSTUR made a telephone contact with Ahmad Jabir 'Afif, chairman of the Yemeni national dialogue committee, in which he emphasized that solving the Yemeni crisis is in the hands of the Yemenis, and this can be done through implementing the accord document. 'Afif said the committee, which was formed from outside the ruling coalition parties, unanimously agrees that the accord document should be implemented, and that it is useless to go anywhere outside Yemen. 'Afif criticized the ruling coalition for ignoring the national dialogue committee at this stage and for not informing the committee of developments. He said that during its today's meeting, the committee will discuss the practices of the coalition partners, and will convey its view to the coalition leaders. He emphasized that these practices have absented the role of the dialogue committee, and the committee became unaware of what is going on. He said the committee does not know in whose interest it is being absented.
