FR940413-2-00012 FR940413-2-00005 Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective upon publication of this notice of final results of review for all shipments of MMF sweaters from Korea entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: (1) The cash deposit rates for the reviewed companies will be those established in the final results of this administrative review; (2) for previously investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published for the LTFV investigation; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review or the LTFV investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established in the LTFV investigation for the manufacturer of the merchandise; and (4) the cash deposit rate for all other manufacturers or exporters will be the ``all others'' rate of 1.30 percent established in the final notice of LTFV investigation of this case, in accordance with the Court of International Trade's decisions in Floral Trade Council v. United States, 822 F.Supp 766 (1993), and Federal-Mogul Corporation and the Torrington Company v. United States, 839 F.Supp 864 (1993). Since the margin for Tae Kwang is less than 0.50 percent and, therefore, de minimis for cash deposit purposes, the Department will instruct customs to collect a cash deposit of zero antidumping duties on entries from Tae Kwang. These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review. This notice serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. Notification to Interested Parties This notice also serves as a reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (APO) of their responsibility concerning the disposition of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d). Timely written notification of return/destruction of APO materials or conversion to judicial protective order is hereby requested. Failure to comply with the regulations and the terms of an APO is a sanctionable violation. This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 353.22. Dated: April 6, 1994. Paul L. Joffe, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;8909 Filed 04&hyph;12&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;P
