"In fact, Yeltsin is returning to the position of Catherine II, who regarded Georgia as the gateway to the Caucasus," Svanidze said, "and he has timed things perfectly -- Georgia is ready to make concessions. Georgia simply has no choice but to make concessions to Russia: Having suffered what amounts to military defeat, threatened with economic disintegration and hunger, with gangs on the rampage, and most of its' territory out of control; Georgia could simply cease to exist. Shevardnadze understands this and is ready to say `yes' to many demands from Yeltsin." The package of agreements on military cooperation to be signed tomorrow has already "incurred wrath" in the northern Caucasus, part of Russia, Svanidze said as the video cut to President of Chechnya Dzhokhar Dudayev. Yeltsin, the government, Russia's Foreign Ministry, and military leaders are for union with Georgia. Most of the State Duma is against it, he said. He then interviewed Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the State Duma committee for CIS affairs, who said a treaty signed by Russia would mean that "Russia, having taken measures to arm the Georgian Army, must at the same time prevent Abkhazia's Armed Forces from arming itself, which creates a one-sided situation that would engender a desire for revenge." Armenia and Azerbaijan are waiting eagerly for the results of the Yeltsin visit to Georgia to see if Russia may also become "a local UN" for them, Svanidze warned. Opponents of the treaty on friendship and cooperation with Georgia in the State Duma fear most "the very serious" level of military assistance it implies, Svanidze said, pointing to article three, in which Russia undertakes to help in the setting up, strengthening, and equipping of the Georgian Army. "The text of the treaty says nothing about military bases," Svanidze continued, "but we have information that a memorandum will be signed during Yeltsin's meeting with Shevardnadze that will start a negotiation process for the setting up of seven Russian military bases on Georgian territory, I repeat seven; initially, the issue was of three bases being set up. It is precisely for this reason that the military, who were previously against union with Georgia, now insist on it." Two of the bases will be in Abkhazia -- one in Sukhumi, the other in Gudauta, Svanidze added. Zatulin concluded: "I would like to say, on the eve of the visit by Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, that peace in the northern Caucasus could be damaged." The council of State Duma factions today approved a letter to Yeltsin asking him not to go to Tbilisi, or at least not to sign the treaty, Svanidze said.
