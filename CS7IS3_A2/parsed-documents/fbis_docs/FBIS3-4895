The Thai deputy minister informed his Japanese counterpart of the latest progress and developments in telecommunications in Thailand and told him of the government's policy of allowing the private sector to invest more in the telecommunications field. As a result, the government has promoted free trade competition in line with Thailand's commitment to GATT. Phinit said that Japan and Thailand have cooperated with each other in developing telecommunications activities in both the government and private sectors. Japanese companies have invested several billion baht in the communications field in Thailand. Given that Thailand is currently more prepared for foreign investors, Japan's international trade and industry ministry is therefore asked to encourage Japanese investors to invest more in Thailand, especially in the telecommunications field, so that the telecommunications services in Thailand and Japan will develop on an equal basis.
