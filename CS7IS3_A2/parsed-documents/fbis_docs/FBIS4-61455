A spokesman for the Ministry said that the program may be hampered by the negative attitude towards it by the heads of the regional administrations. For example, only the leadership of the Akmolinsk Region gave its consent for burial sites of radioactive waste on its territory. This year it is also planned to devise maps of the burial of radioactive waste and its sources on the territory of Kazakhstan, to take photos and start research studies in the area of the Semipalatinsk test ground. The Ministry plans to spend 12.04 million tenges (over 414,000 US dlrs) Last year the volume of investments constituted 1.82 million tenges (over 384,000 US dlrs as of the date of the introduction of the national currency in the republic). However, the general contractor responsible for the fulfillment of the radio ecological works, the National Nuclear Center of Kazakhstan, could not cope with the planned volume of research work due to the lack of funds. At present the Republic has a total of 900 enterprises polluting the environment and over 75,339 other sources of radioactive pollutants.
