Zhirinovskiy took offense and sued me. Explaining and developing my metaphor, I published an article in IZVESTIYA under what seemed to me the quite expressive headline "Gambling on Scoundrels." The main content of the article came down to the idea that Zhirinovskiy's political activity was ideally suited to the definition of "fascist" and that he himself in terms of some of his personal features could serve as a graphic illustration in a museum on the history of fascism. This article seems to have made a powerful impression on Zhirinovskiy. As far as I can judge (I express myself so cautiously because information on his behavior is never accurate) he did two things. First he withdrew his lawsuit, explaining he was satisfied with the explanations I gave in my article. That is, this can be assessed as meaning that previously Zhirinovskiy did not guess he was a fascist but now that he has read the article and thought about it he has realized that yes, he is a fascist. Which satisfied him, and there he stopped. But there immediately followed a second action: Zhirinovskiy is suing me again, for the same article! I admit that from my viewpoint there is a certain contradiction between these two actions. I adhere to old-fashioned logic in which there is no third option. Either something is or it is not. Either he is satisfied with the article or he is not. But obviously Zhirinovskiy's logic is different. I cannot say it surprises me, it is in fact a pure example of the logic and conduct of a fascist politician. A small example of how demagoguery and lies are promoted as an example and taken to the limit, to the absurd. Therefore as long as a fascist is not in power his words and actions cause tittering and are declared a farce. As soon as he comes to power the titters turn to groans and farce to tragedy. It is not the pleasantest task to rake over piles of absurd, fantastic lies which he scatters at every step with unusual ease and shamelessness, trapping the credulous with this bait. It is simpler to keep quiet or to turn away squeamishly. But in the case of fascists keeping quiet means indulging them. So I shall unconditionally do everything in my power to ensure that there is a public trial of Zhirinovskiy, a public trial of fascist ideology and propaganda in our country.
