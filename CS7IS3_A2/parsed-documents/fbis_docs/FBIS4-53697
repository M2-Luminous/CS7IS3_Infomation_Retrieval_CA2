The move, long anticipated as USDP Secretary General Shogo Abe last December announced that the party's "historical mission" has been fulfilled with the government change, was made at a national party convention in Tokyo. Abe and party chief Satsuki Eda, who served as science and technology agency chief in the non-LDP coalition government under Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, has already joined Hosokawa's Japan New Party (JNP). The party's third Diet legislator, Yanosuke Narazaki, will retain his House of Representatives seat as an independent but is closely affiliated with the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ]. Many of the USDP's estimated 10,000 members in some 22 local party organizations, some of which have voiced ardent opposition to the dissolution of their party originally scheduled for January this year, are expected to enter the JNP. The USDP, founded in March 1978, evolved from the Socialist Citizens' League, which was formed in 1977 by a group of right-wing members of the then Japan Socialist Party (JSP), in conformity with the wishes of Eda's deceased father, JSP defector Saburo Eda. The party saw itself as bridging the gap between the JSP and its right-wing splinter, the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP). Since the 1985 party congress, Eda and Abe have been leading the party. Though a small party, the USDP wielded a certain influence through cooperation in supraparty bodies and parliamentary alliances with the SDPJ and the DSP. During its 16-year history, the USDP, struggling to find a raison d'etre between two other socialist parties and disrupted by intraparty differences, was more than once close to disintegration. In an effort to reinvigorate the party in 1992, Eda founded the political study group "Sirius" together with reformers in the SDPJ, but the body collapsed after the USDP suffered major losses in the general election in July last year.
