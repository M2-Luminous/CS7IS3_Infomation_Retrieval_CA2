Tang and Debbie Kuo] [Text] Geneva, May 21 (CNA) -- A Taiwan trade delegation Friday continued tariff-reduction negotiations with world countries in its bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The Taiwan delegation, headed by Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) Director-General Y.C. Huang, Friday held informal bilateral tariff concession talks with delegations from Japan, Colombia, and South Korea. The Japanese delegates urged Taiwan to adopt a zero-for-zero tariff formula on import products according to the Uruguay Round trade accords, and to remove area restrictions on automobile, motorcycle and farm product imports. The Japanese negotiators also asked for the zero-for-zero tariff package on alcoholic beverages. This request was denied by the Taiwan delegation, but they reportedly conceded on beer imports from Japan. Like the Japanese negotiators who were taking advantage of Taiwan's eagerness to join GATT before the world trade regulatory body becomes the World Trade Organization early next year, the Colombian delegates asked Taiwan for overall tariff cuts in general and on banana, citrus fruits, papaya and mango, in particular. The Colombian negotiators, who expressed support for Taiwan's GATT bid, said they hoped Taiwan will abide by the "rules of the game" of the GATT-initiated Uruguay Round trade accords. They added that some non-tariff related barriers and "discriminatory" treatment against products from some areas are unacceptable. Negotiators from South Korea and Taiwan concluded their negotiations amid a pleasant atmosphere, but "without concrete results," Y.C. Huang, Taiwan's chief negotiator, said. The Koreans asked for lower tariffs on 153 import items. They demanded that Taiwan open its market to Korean apples, peaches and plums, arguing that South Korea has already opened its market to produce from other countries. The Koreans also said that they are willing to share with Taiwan their experience in opening their domestic market to foreign rice. The 33-member Taiwan degegation will hold further negotiations on tariff and non-tariff issues in the future to pave the way for Taiwan's GATT entry. Taiwan has held first round tariff talks with a dozen nations, including Switzerland, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Hungary, Chile and Turkey. It held a second round of such talks with the U.S. in Washington earlier this month.
