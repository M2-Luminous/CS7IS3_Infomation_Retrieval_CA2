During their talks, Kim told Hosokawa that the future-oriented bilateral ties would impose great impact on Asian nations as well as the rest of the world. The two leaders also agreed that Japan, South Korea and Russia should make efforts to adopt measures to solve the problem of returning Koreans left behind on the Russian Far East island of Sakhalin to their homeland. They exchanged their views about political and economic reform efforts and discussed the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. A second round of talks between Kim and Hosokawa is scheduled on Saturday. They are expected to discuss economic issues.
