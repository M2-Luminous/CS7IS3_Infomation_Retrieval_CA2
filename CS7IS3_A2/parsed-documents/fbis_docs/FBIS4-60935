The ITAR-TASS correspondent learned from well-informed sources in Tajikistan that the Defense Ministry of Uzbekistan has confirmed that the cargo of "humanitarian aid" had indeed been prepared to be sent to Gornyy Badakhshan [Gorno-Badakhshan]. However, Tajikistan had not been informed about the exact time the aircraft would cross the state border. The aircraft landed at 1500 hours local time (1200 Moscow time) at the Khorog airport. After the landing of the AN-26, the landing strip and all access routes to the airport were surrounded by militants of a unit belonging to the "Tajik self-defense forces", under the command of Yedgor Mamadaslamov. The cargo was seized and taken away. In this connection, military sources in Dushanbe are not ruling out that there might be some contacts between certain forces in Uzbekistan and militants in Pamir, which are influencing the situation in the region. There has been no official reaction from the Tajikistan Government.
