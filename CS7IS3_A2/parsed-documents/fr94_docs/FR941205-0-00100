FR941205-0-00100 FR941205-0-00024 C. Must-Carry/Retransmission Consent Election and Implementation 66. Section 325(b)(3)(B) provides that television stations must make an election between must-carry and retransmission consent ``within one year after the date of enactment'' and every three years thereafter. In the Report and Order we established the implementation of these provisions indicating that the initial election for must-carry or retransmission consent must be made by June 17, 1993. We also provided that subsequent elections must be made by October 1, 1996, October 1, 1999, etc., and would become effective on January 1, 1997, January 1, 2000, etc. We determined that broadcasters were to send copies of their election to the cable operator and were to retain copies of such elections in their public files. We failed, however, to instruct television broadcast stations on the term of retention. Consistent with the requirements of the 1992 Cable Act and other recordkeeping provisions of §§73.3526 and 73.3527 of our rules, we will require television broadcast stations to retain election statements in their public files for the term of the three year-election period applicable to such election statements. We will amend §§73.3526 and 73.3527 to indicate not only the need to include such information in the station's public file, but also the three-year retention period for such election statement. 67. In the Report and Order we noted that no party had commented on our proposal to require a new television station to make an initial must-carry/retransmission consent election within 30 days from the date that it commences regular broadcasts. We adopted that proposal, as well as an effective date of ninety (90) days following the election. In considering this provision further, we believe that such an election schedule could have a detrimental effect on a new television station which is entering the market. The Commission's rules provide that a television station which has completed construction may commence program tests prior to filing for a license with the Commission. These stations generally know in advance the date they plan to commence broadcasting. On our own motion, we therefore alter the initial election and effective date with respect to new television broadcast stations. A new television station shall elect between must-carry and retransmission consent sixty (60) days prior to commencing program tests, and shall notify the cable operator of that election. In the event that must-carry status is elected, the new station shall also include its channel position in the election statement to the cable operator. The election statement should be sent to the cable operator by certified mail, return receipt requested. The initial election of the broadcast station shall take effect ninety (90) days after it is made. This will provide the cable operator with sufficient time to notify subscribers of any change which may be required in the channel line-up of the system. The result will be that a new television broadcast station will have the opportunity to be carried on a cable system 30 days after it commences broadcasts over-the-air. We believe that such a result serves the public interest and provides new broadcast stations with appropriate access to enable them to effectively enter a market. Section 76.64(f)(4) of our rules is being revised to reflect this change. 68. In the Report and Order we failed to provide for the introduction of a new cable system in a market. Consistent with the purpose of the 1992 Cable Act, a new cable system will be required to notify all local commercial and noncommercial broadcast stations of its intent to commence service. The cable operator must send such notification, by certified mail, at least 60 days prior to commencing cable service. Commercial broadcast stations must notify the cable system within 30 days of the receipt of such notice of their election of either must-carry or retransmission consent with respect to such new cable system. If the commercial broadcast station elects must-carry, it must also indicate its channel position in its election statement to the cable system. Such election shall remain valid for the remainder of any three-year election interval, as established in §76.64(f)(2). Noncommercial educational broadcast stations should notify the cable operator of their request for carriage and their channel position. The cable system must determine, in advance of commencing service on the system, whether a station is delivering a good quality signal and/or if a station will be required to indemnify for copyright purposes. The cable system must notify the broadcaster of any signal quality problems or copyright liability and must receive the station's response to such information prior to commencing carriage of the station's signal. These provisions are being added to our rules as §76.64(l).
