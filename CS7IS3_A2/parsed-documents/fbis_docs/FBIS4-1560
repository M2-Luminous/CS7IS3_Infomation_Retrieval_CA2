The new schedules will focus on four areas. Firstly, branch companies of PICC throughout the country will be more independent both in management and finance, forming a mechanism which combines responsibility, right and benefit, tying the risk and advantage of the insurance business together. Within the branch companies themselves, there will also exist three kinds of responsibility system. Firstly, general managers, business departments and employees of the branches will all be involved in the system. Secondly, the branch companies will direct 20 per cent of their domestic business to the PICC, thus allowing the central company to share part of the insurance premium of the non-risk and the non-life business. Thirdly, the central company is to separate the management of policy insurance business from the commercial insurance business. The former is a favoured status business that the insurance company makes available to projects which are part of the development plan of the country, such as agricultural projects. Part of these premiums are supported by the Ministry of Finance. The latter commercial insurance business includes life and property insurance . Finally, the company is establishing the management practice of tying the responsibility, salary and bonus payments together. Insurance companies expect that in 1994, the expanding sectors of their business will be in domestic property, enterprises' property, freight, travel/flight, agricultural and commercial agricultural insurance. Endowment insurance and cover against malpractice are amongst current development projects. By the end of 1993, the total income of the PICC was 49.8 billion ($5.72 billion), a 36 per cent increase on the previous year. The popularity of their product range varied considerably. Some 700,000 enterprises had their properties covered by the company, while more than 100 million families had taken out domestic property insurance. Parties compensated by the PICC in 1993 were largely satisfied. Total compensation amounted to some 27.13 billion ($3.12 billion). Among these sums, the domestic kinds were 16.32 billion ($1.9 billion), and the life insurance 8.67 billion ($1 billion), overseas business, 2.16 billion ($248.2 million ). In 1994, PICC will fortify its management, strengthen its macroscopic control on planning, and begin to establish a standard system to define the insurance business for the next century.
