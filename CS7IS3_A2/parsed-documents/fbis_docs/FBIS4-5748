According to the survey results, Japanese companies are not yet highly motivated for investments in Mexico and other NAFTA nations, and the EPA concluded that NAFTA's impact on the companies' behavior has not been clearly observed so far. As a trilateral agreement among the United States, Canada, and Mexico, NAFTA is seeking tariff cuts on a step-by-step basis to establish a free trade zone involving the three nations. Following implementation of NAFTA, the EPA surveyed 1,990 Japanese companies which have sales or production subsidiaries overseas. As a result of the January survey, responses were obtained from 635 companies. In response to a (multiple-choice answer) question asking in which countries or regions companies desire to expand their operations, 41.6 percent said they want to expand business in the United States; however, those who favored Mexico and Canada remained at 10.4 and 6.5 percent, respectively. By contrast, 39.7 percent were interested in newly industrializing economies (NIE's) in Asia, 53.2 percent preferred ASEAN, and 51.3 percent were for China. The companies thus showed great interest in Asia rather than NAFTA. Commenting on this, the EPA said that the business sector prefers brisk and prospective markets, and that NAFTA is unlikely to drastically change companies' investment policies for the time being. Yet, about 40 percent of the companies that are planning expansion of operations in Mexico said their plans are to "catch up with the regional economic merger." The EPA said that influence of NAFTA is observed on this point.
