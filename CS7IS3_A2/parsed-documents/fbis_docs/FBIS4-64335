"Herzog is a candidate of the Union, not of the liberals" he told HANDELSBLATT. Hirsch explained that the president of the Constitutional Court was trying to secure his election by exerting political pressure on the FDP. "In this connection, we had to resolve the coalition issue very quickly to win back our maneuvering space," he said. Hirsch did not say which candidate the FDP would vote for, but made it clear that it would back Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher in the first two rounds of voting. If no decision is reached by then, the liberals will vote for one of the two remaining candidates, said Hirsch. "I support Johannes Rau because I consider him the right man to bring the two parts of Germany closer together," he said. But he added that should the FDP faction vote for Herzog, he would accept this. Hirsch considers it wrong to criticize the economic-political powers of the FDP, even if his party has abandoned its original stance vis-a-vis nursing care insurance. "One cannot expect the FDP on its own to resolve a problem in the teeth of public opinion," said Hirsch, explaining his decision to vote for the law on nursing care insurance. He said that in this law, the liberals had achieved adequate compensation for employers, so that the work factor does not become an even greater burden on employment. Hirsch considers his own position inside the FDP secure; after all, he achieved the fourth best result in the elections to the chairmanship of the North Rhine-Westphalia FDP branch. Leftist liberals are certainly not finished inside the FDP, he said. Therefore he expects Gerhart Baum to regain his seat in the Bundestag. "I am tired of being treated as a liberal fossil all the time," said Hirsch.
