The deputies, of whom two-thirds were elected under communist colours in 1990, accused Shushkevich of contributing to the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991 and of delaying the return of Belarus to the ruble zone. The closed-session debate on Shushkevich's future will take place on Friday, Loiko said. Shushkevich was elected parliamentary speaker, and thus head of state, in September 1991, replacing the conservative Nikolay Dementey who resigned following the failure of a hardline coup attempt in Moscow the previous month. Along with the Russian and Ukrainian presidents, Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk, he signed an accord, prepared at Brest but known as the Minsk Agreement, in December 1991, declaring the end of the Soviet Union and the creation of the loosely constituted Commonwealth of Independent States. The Belarus deputies also discussed the possible dismissal of Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, Interior Minister Vladimir Yegorov, secret service chief Eduard Shirkovskiy and state prosecutor Vasiliy Sholodonov, the Baltic News Service reported.
