Banda] [Text] Pretoria April 23 SAPA -- Conservative Party [CP] leader Ferdi Hartzenberg said the accord on Afrikaner self-determination signed earlier on Saturday [23 April] furthers only the interests of the ANC and SA Communist Party [SACP]. The accord was signed by negotiators of the Freedom Front, the government and the African National Congress. Dr Hartzenberg said in a statement ANC leader Nelson Mandela had already made it clear that he was not interested in the creation of a volkstaat [homeland]. "It is very clear that the ANC and the SACP will win the elction, and this will place them in a stronger position, since they have given no real undertakings in regard to a volkstaat in terms of the definition as set out by the Afrikaner Volksfront [AVF, Afrikaner National Front] and the CP," he said. "In these circumstances, even this accord offers no possibility of the Boere Afrikanervolk [Boer Afrikaner people] to obtain their full self-determination and independence." Dr Hartzenberg said the "accord, taking part in the election and being part of the new Parliament will not enable the freedom front to achieve the freedom of the Afrikanervolk".
