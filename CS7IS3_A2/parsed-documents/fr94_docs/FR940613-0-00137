FR940613-0-00137 FR940613-0-00017 Executive Order 12606, the Family The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and, thus, is not subject to review under the Order. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs result from promulgation of this rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns. Regulatory Agenda This rule was listed as Item 1688 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on April 25, 1994 (59 FR 20424, 20470), in accordance with Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. List of Subjects in 24 CFR Part 968 Grant programs_housing and community development, Indians, Loan programs_housing and community development, Public housing, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. For the reasons set out in the preamble, part 968 of title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows. PART 968_PUBLIC HOUSING MODERNIZATION 1. The authority citation for part 968 continues to read as follows: Authority: 42 U.S.C. 1437d, 14371 and 3535(d). 2. Section 968.103 is amended by revising paragraph (c) to read as follows: §968.103 Allocation of funds under section 14. * * * * * (c) Set-asides. After deducting amounts for the reserve for natural and other disasters and for emergencies under paragraph (b) of this section, HUD shall set aside from the funds remaining: (1) Regarding vacancy reduction, an amount equal to 4 percent of those funds, to be further allocated as follows: (i) Twenty percent of this four percent shall be available only for carrying out activities under section (6)(j) of the United States Housing Act of 1937; and (ii) Eighty percent of this four percent shall be available under the vacancy reduction program (see subpart D of 24 CFR part 968). (2) Regarding the comprehensive grant program, no more than five percent for the purpose of providing credits to PHAs that were formerly designated as mod troubled agencies under the Public Housing Management Assessment Program (PHMAP) (see 24 CFR part 901). The purpose of this set-aside is to compensate these PHAs for amounts not allocated by HUD because of a PHA's prior designation as a mod troubled agency. (3) Nonapplicability to IHAs. The Vacancy Reduction Program in subpart D of this part does not apply to IHAs. In addition, because the PHMAP performance indicators under 24 CFR part 901 do not apply to IHAs, these agencies cannot be deemed ``mod troubled'' for purposes of the CGP and are not eligible for funding under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. Hence, IHAs are not subject to any reduction in funding under section 14(k)(5)(A) of the Act, and IHAs do not participate in the set-aside credits established under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. * * * * * 3. A new subpart D, consisting of §§968.401 through 968.425, is added to read as follows: Subpart D_Vacancy Reduction Program Sec. 968.401␣Purpose. 968.403␣Applicability. 968.405␣Definitions. 968.407␣Vacancy reduction plan. 968.410␣Assessments. 968.413␣Funding. 968.416␣Fund requisitions. 968.419␣Grantee's oversight responsibilities. 968.422␣Progress reports and completion schedule. 968.425␣HUD review of grantee performance. 968.428␣Program closeout. 968.425␣Other program requirements. §968.401 Purpose. Section 14(p) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 establishes the Vacancy Reduction Program, in conjunction with statutory provisions on public and Indian housing modernization. It is the policy of the Department that public housing agencies should maximize the use of housing resources, using every reasonable means to achieve and maintain high levels of occupancy by eligible families in PHA-owned or -operated housing. §968.403 Applicability. (a) Participation. A PHA shall participate in the vacancy reduction program under this subpart if: (1) The PHA has a vacancy rate among dwelling units owned or operated by the PHA that exceeds twice the average vacancy rate among all public housing agencies; (2) The PHA is designated as a troubled or mod troubled agency under section 6(j) of the Act; or (3) A receiver has been appointed for the PHA pursuant to section 6(j)(3) of the Act. (b) Exclusions. Units owned or operated by a PHA that are not eligible for funding under section 14 of the Act are excluded from coverage under this subpart and shall not be used to calculate the eligibility of a PHA under this subpart. (c) Examples of eligibility. The following are specific examples of eligibility under this program: (1) All units in the Federal Low-Rent Public Housing Program are eligible; (2) In the Section 23 program, only those units that are in projects that are bond-financed and for which the PHA would receive clear title at the end of the lease term will be eligible; and (3) Section 8 projects are not eligible. §968.405 Definitions. In addition to the definitions applicable under §968.105, the following definitions apply to this subpart: Average vacancy rate means the average vacancy rate for all public housing agencies. NOFA means Notice of Funding Availability. NOFAs announcing available funding under the program will be published in the Federal Register , and will set out the application requirements and applicable selection criteria. Operating subsidy means the annual contribution for operating subsidy made to the PHA by HUD, which is determined in accordance with part 990 of this chapter. PHA means public housing agency. For purposes of this subpart, the term excludes Indian Housing Authorities. PHMAP means the Public Housing Management Assessment Program, authorized in 42 U.S.C. 1437d(j) and implemented in 24 CFR part 901, which is designed to allow HUD and the PHA to identify PHA management capabilities and deficiencies and to lead to better overall management of the public housing.
