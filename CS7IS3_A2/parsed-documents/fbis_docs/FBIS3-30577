May we just warn that this statement orbited the entire world via REUTERS and caused considerable concern among the international public. Here is the explanation of our UN ambassador: [Begin Nobilo recording] The threat that Croatia will declare war against Krajina if sanctions are introduced was simplified and taken out of context. Journalists insisted on knowing what would happen if sanctions were to be introduced. My opinion is that sanctions would move Croatia and the entire region closer to war. Apart from this, they would create a new wave of refugees throughout Europe, and disturb the balance of forces because Serbs would then be in a more favorable position with all the unforeseeable consequences this would entail. Croatia, as the victim of aggression, would find it difficult to accept sanctions as far as its morale is concerned. In any case, both the Bosnian ambassador and I are trying to place this whole new situation within the context of successful talks expected at the next round of Croatian-Muslim talks on the settlement of the remaining controversial matters.
