General Aidid meanwhile continued negotiations in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, with representatives of the Group of 12 factions led by Ali Mahdi that oppose him, Aidid's aides said here. The United Nations, heavily criticised for getting peacekeepers embroiled in clashes with Aidid's militia that cost the lives of more than 70 UN soldiers, was officially involved in neither the Nairobi, nor the Mogadishu talks. But Aidid has met U.S. envoy Richard Bogosian in Nairobi, an American official in Mogadishu said. Ahmed Darman, a member of the central committee of Aidid's Somali National Alliance (SNA) faction, urged the UN to arrange another national reconciliation conference to bring Somalia's warring factions together. But he said the UN should stop meddling in negotiations and leave the Somalis to work out a settlement without outside interference. "We hope the Nairobi talks will pave the way for a national reconciliation conference which might be held in Mogadishu," Darman told reporters. About 175 members of Aidid's Habr Gedir clan and Ali Mahdi's Abgal group held a second day of closed-door talks at the Kah Hotel in Ali Mahdi's north Mogadishu enclave Friday. Chaired by a prominent Islamic leader, the Imam of Hirab, the meeting brought together traditional clan chiefs, the "Ugaasis," religious leaders, military officers and leaders of youth groups, conference officials said. The negotiators were expected to announce the outcome of the talks, which were preceded by a month of informal consultations, when they end Saturday [15 January]. Senior UN officials who were privately skeptical about previous attempts to broker agreements among Somalia's 15 warring clan-based factions said they sensed a greater willingness by the warlords to lay down their arms. "They are under pressure from their own rank and file," said one UN official. "The warlords themselves have done well out of the fighting, but the fighters are tired." Aidid's faction is estimated to have lost hundreds of men in four months of fighting with U.S. and UN forces in Mogadishu before the UN dropped efforts to arrest him in October. In other developments, a UN spokesman said a Somali had been shot dead during an anti-UN protest in a coastal town south of Mogadishu this week. UN officials had earlier said no one was killed and denied reports on pro-Aidid Radio Mogadishu that two people had died when a demonstration outside a residence of the UN Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) in Merca, about 60 kilometres (35 miles) southwest of here, turned violent. "UNOSOM guards fired in the air. The demonstrators fired back, and in so doing killed a Somali," said UN spokesman Major Tim McDavitt. The UNOSOM guards were Somalis, he said. In another attack on the UN, a residence of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Buale, southern Somalia, came under rifle-propelled grenade and small arms fire for several hours on Thursday evening. There were no casualties. The attackers were believed to be bandits, McDavitt said. Five Indian soldiers were wounded earlier the same day in an ambush 70 kilometres (40 miles) south of Buale, just outside Jilib. Five U.S. congressmen were expected in Mogadishu on Saturday for a brief visit, U.S. spokesman Colonel Steve Rausch said. The delegation leader is Representative John Murtha, chairman of the House Defence Appropriations Committee, a Democrat from Pennsylvania. The 5,563 American soldiers in Somalia are to leave by March 31, but Washington may keep a Marine force offshore.
