Last year alone, there were 11 attempts to steal uranium from Russian nuclear facilities, according to Yuriy Yefimov, head of the Department for the Protection of Strategic State Facilities of the Russian Interior Ministry troops. Speaking at a conference of the Russian Interior Ministry senior officials in Moscow on Wednesday, Yefimov said that law enforcement bodies reported about 900 attempts of illegal penetration into secret nuclear facilities in 1993. In 700 cases their employees were caught while trying to smuggle out secret documents. Experts of the Russian Ministry of the Nuclear Power Industry tend to blame the stealings on the worsening economic situation in the country which forces people to resort to extreme measures in order to eke out their existence. Experts claim that the thefts of radioactive materials are carried out by people who know technology as their own palms. This opinion was shared by Yefimov who said that one of the attempts to steal uranium and smuggle it out of the country was made by a group of employees of one of the secret plants near the city of Yekaterinburg, the Urals region, which included some of its top officials.
