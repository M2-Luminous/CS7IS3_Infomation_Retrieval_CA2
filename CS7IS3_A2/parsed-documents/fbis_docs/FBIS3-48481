FBIS3-48481 "dreas017__a94014" FBIS-EAS-94-017-A Document Type:Daily Report 26 January 1994 ANNEX Japan New Stimulus Package To Focus on Imports OW2201035494 Tokyo NIkkei Telecom Database in Japanese 21 Jan 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2201035494 Tokyo NIkkei Telecom Database Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 21 January 94 Morning Edition] [Text] The government plans to decide early next week on a new package of measures to stimulate the economy, measures which will focus on expanding Japan's imports. Major steps in the package are: 1) to increase funds for the industrial infrastructure in order to upgrade the existing import-related infrastructure and the foreign access zone (FAZ); 2) to build additional or expand existing import-related facilities -- including the General Import Promotion Center -- in an effort to help foreign firms smoothly gain access to the Japanese market; and 3) to strengthen the import promotion tax and import loan system. Prime Minister Hosokawa expressed his intention last December to expand Japan's imports, setting the "basic policy for import expansion." The government plans to take these steps on the eve of Japan-U.S. summit talks scheduled for February in order to boost Japan's imports, with the aim of stressing Japan's posture to cut its trade surplus with the United States. In the new pump-priming package, the government intends to upgrade the FAZ ahead of schedule, which is equipped with storage and disposal functions at its ports and airports. The government plans to add approximately 4 billion yen to the funds for the industrial infrastructure to partially finance the cost of constructing import-related complexes and installing facilities there in six areas including the Kansai International Airport and Kobe Port. The government also intends to make preparations for securing sites in five areas where the construction of import-related complexes were approved in 1993. In the new package of stimulus measures, the government plans to construct more import-related facilities in a bid to help foreign companies smoothly gain access to the Japanese market. The government intends to additionally establish two general import promotion centers where foreign firms are given free offices and can display and sell their goods, as well as three regional import promotion centers. The government also plans to establish four imported housing exhibition centers. The government believes upgrading the existing import-related infrastructure and facilities will greatly contribute to expanding Japan's imports of manufactured goods. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which intends to ask for a total of 10 billion yen in the third supplementary budget, is now negotiating with the Ministry of Finance. In the new stimulus package, the government will strengthen the preferential tax system and the policy loan system for both foreign firms eager to invest in Japan as well as Japanese importers. As for the import tax system for Japanese manufacturers and wholesalers who import foreign manufactured goods, the government will keep the system in effect after the end of March 1995. Imported housing, some auto parts, and other items which the multilateral trade negotiations (the Uruguay Round of GATT) decided to abolish duties on immediately, will be subject to tax deductions. The government plans to establish a preferential tax system during 1994 under which a certain ratio of the taxes from increased sales by foreign firms in Japan over the previous year is deducted. The Japan Development Bank established the loan system in late December 1993 for the import promotion and strengthening of the infrastructure, and the government will ask the Small Business Finance Corporation to extend the loan system for smooth import and sales by the end of March 1995.
