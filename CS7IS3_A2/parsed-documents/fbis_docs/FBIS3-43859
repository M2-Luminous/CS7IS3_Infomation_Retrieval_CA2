Ostensibly it was all about 100-percent pay rise the soldiers were demanding. But there has been talking of rival factions developing with some elements of the defense force openly opposed to the 10-month-old government led by Ntsu Mokhehle. At the weekend South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha intervened and calm appeared to have been restored, but there are still a few political rifts to be patched up, as Candy Ramanoene reports in this telex from Maseru: The capital Maseru was calm today with shops and businesses open as usual. Military presence was less than it has been over the past three days, but people are still fearful of further shootings. It is still not known what has happened to the soldiers involved in the incidents, but it is thought that they are under arrest. No statement has, however, come from the government. The prime minister, Ntsu Mokhehle, today announced that on Wednesday [19 January] they will be having a meeting with members of seven political parties to try and work out a solution to the crisis, but surprisingly, the two main opposition parties, the BNP [Basotho National Party] and the royalist Marematlou Freedom Party are unlikely to be at the meeting, because they haven't signed, unlike the other seven parties, the letter requesting an urgent meeting with the prime minister. Political observers here say that popular opinion firmly believe that the prime minister should not give into the soldiers' demand for 100-percent pay rise. Despite the party's denial, the talk on the streets is that BNP was somehow behind the weekend's incident.
