On Saturday [4 June], the approximately 660 delegates adopted large parts of an election program in which they advocate the strengthening of the rights of foreigners, oppose the electronic bugging of apartments, and support the abolition of the church tax. Against the resistance of the party leadership, the delegates also called for the division of parliamentary mandates and government offices. On the sidelines of the deliberations, FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel announced that, irrespective of the statement in favor of a coalition, the FDP will conduct an independent election campaign. He stressed that, for the FDP, the election program will be the basis for negotiations on a coalition with the CDU/CSU. Referring to opinion polls, according to which it is uncertain that the liberals will return to the European Parliament and the Bundestag, Kinkel said that he is convinced the FDP will achieve good results. [passage omitted] The party congress advocated the development of peacekeeping and peacemaking UN missions. Germany's unrestricted participation in these missions will be made possible by a Basic Law amendment. The adherence to compulsory military service was affirmed.
