The run-offs were held in the bewildering absence of the old party symbols, abandoned by virtually all candidates to avoid association with such scandal-tainted parties as the Christian Democratic and Socialist parties, former powerhouses on the island. In the only provincial vote yesterday, among the 14 mayoral run-offs on the island, 39.47 percent of the voters in the Catania province picked Nello Musumeci, the candidate for assembly president for the neofascist MSI [Italian Social Movement], over moderate Pact for Italy hopeful Stelio Mangiameli. Out of the turnout, which compared to 60.59 percent in the first round of balloting, 66.35 percent of the valid votes went to Musumeci, 38, who becomes province's 54th president. Also captured by the right were the mayors' offices in Acireale and Acate with one, in Santa Teresa Riva, near Messina, taken by a moderate. On the left, a mayoral candidate on a Democratic Party of the Left slate scored victory in Ribera to lead the way for the nine other left candidates awarded the keys to the offices in their municipalities. One, Vincenzo Lota', vied successfully in the town of Menfi against Guido Lo Porto, a member of the Rome Lower House for the neofascist MSI. In Santa Lucia del Mela, moderate mayoral candidate Francesco La Camera dropped out of the race after the first round of voting when he received an unspecified Mafia threat, a move which prompted his fair-minded adversary, Santo Marcaione, to urge the townspeople to abandon the polling places. The voters here largely heeded the call and the turnout of 24.67 percent nullified the run-off because it fell far short of the 50 percent turnout required by law. Santa Lucia del Mela will try again in 90 days time, after the March 27 general elections for a new Rome parliament.
