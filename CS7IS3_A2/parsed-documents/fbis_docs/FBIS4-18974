This was agreed on in talks held in Ankara today between Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and his Turkish counterpart Hikmet Cetin. A giant deal to purchase drinking water from Turkey to supply water for the Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza Strip was concluded in the course of the visit. Our correspondent Gadi Sukenik reports from Ankara: [Begin recording] [Sukenik] All signs indicate that a real chemistry has emerged between Israel and Turkey. Prime Minister Tansu Ciller told Peres this evening that her country will become much more involved in our peace process and will participate in any international presence in the territories, and Peres welcomed her announcement. The Turks will soon waive visas for Israelis and will sign a series of cooperation agreements this year, first and foremost, concerning a free trade zone with Israel. They are also interested in partnership in the gas deal, if it goes through, between Israel and Qatar. In their news conference, the two foreign ministers did not disclose the contents of their tete-a-tete talks in which it was agreed that the Turks would attempt to help arrange secret contacts between Israel and Syria, a rather problematic neighbor of the Turks as well. I sought comments on this information from the horse's mouth, Cetin. Incidentally, he believes that Israel will give back the Golan in exchange for full peace. [Cetin, in English] We will do our best, and we are doing and will do our best in practical and to help. [sentence as heard] [Sukenik, in English] Trying to discuss it with the Syrians, maybe? [Cetin, in English] Well, at this moment, let's keep it like this. We do our best in every arena, in every meeting, in every talk, and we will continue to do that. [Sukenik] Water was a key issue in the talks. At stake is the purchase of huge quantities of drinking water from Turkey, initially through international funding to meet the needs of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, and in the second stage to meet the needs of the State of Israel. The water would be transported by sea, either in tankers or by huge water-borne plastic containers known as medusas. Peres pressured the Turks not to suffice with promises on the water issue. This evening he is scheduled to confer with Turkish President Suleyman Demirel and will return to Israel tomorrow. [end recording] [Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television Network in Hebrew at 1700 GMT on 11 April carries a recorded passage from the joint news conference held by Cetin and Peres, in which the latter states in English: "As I understand, now in Cairo we have agreed that the target date will be the end of this month, April. Then, I think, there won't be needed much time to implement the agreement. The agreement can be implemented in a very short while."]
