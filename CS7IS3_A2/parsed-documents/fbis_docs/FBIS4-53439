"We think North Korea has yet to allay concerns that it is diverting its nuclear materials for military use," the top government spokesman told a news conference. "We therefore want North Korea to accept in earnest full nuclear inspections demanded by the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency)," he said. The IAEA, the Vienna-based international nuclear watchdog, has started monitoring the changing of fuel rods at a 5-megawatt experimental nuclear reactor in Yongbyon, some 90 kilometers north of the North Korean capital. But it is suspected that Pyongyang has already started the process of removing spent fuel rods from a nuclear reactor despite warnings that international monitors need to be present.
