He was speaking at a Black Lawyers Association function in Johannesburg. He said the right wing posed a far more serious threat in South Africa than the likes of (UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] leader) Jonas Savimbi posed in Angola. "We are facing even more violence than that which is raging now," Mr Mandela said. He said the ANC was not bothered by the right's black surrogate forces, which he did not identify. "But the ultra-right is powerful in the proper sense of the word. They are trained and experienced and they know the country better than we do. They are likely to create havoc," Mr Mandela said. To illustrate the right wing's destructive capacity, Mr Mandela said the ANC's armed wing Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation], in spite of its small size and inexperience, had been able to strike at will. He said the ANC had made it clear there was no question of it accepting a separate "volkstaat" [Afrikaner homeland] and that it would be suicide for the ANC to accept an ethnic solution. Rightist demands presented a challenge which black lawyers would have to contribute to sorting out. Earlier, Mr Mandela said constitutional democracy was incompatible with continued white domination of the economy. Paraphrasing former South African Prime Minister John Vorster, Mr Mandela said the implications of continued white domination were "too ghastly to contemplate". At a second function on Thursday night, this time at Investec at which the company announced plans to help establish a business school at the University of the North, Mr Mandela said the exclusion of the black majority from mainstream economic life was a major ANC concern. "Up until now black business persons have been restricted to the role of taxi owners, shebeeners, tuckshop owners and the like. Notwithstanding, they have performed with remarkable aplomb. We can no longer be content with that limited role," Mr Mandela said.
