The report by the Customs Tariff Council, an advisory panel to the finance minister, came just two days before a deadline on Japan-U.S. trade talks, which both sides say have become particularly bogged down over the contentious auto and auto parts issue. The council urged repealing a 4.6 percent tariff on rubber tubing for radiator hoses, a 2.4 percent levy on rubber belts and a 9.6 percent tariff on polyester material used for seat covers. The report, which excludes levies covered by December's global accord under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), says scrapping the import duties would almost eliminate Japanese tariffs on auto parts. A ministry official said the foreign share in the three areas should increase, adding that foreign radiator tubes account for only 200 million yen of the 85 billion yen annual Japanese market, and that foreign rubber belts and the seat cover material each amount to 600 million yen of 11 billion yen markets. The report said tariffs on raw sugar should be slashed by 21.5 yen per kilogram to 20.0 yen, which the official said would amount to about 60 percent. It called for lowering those on refined sugar by the same amount to 35.5 yen per kilogram, which he said would be about 80 percent.
