FR940707-0-00009 FR940707-0-00004 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;AWP&hyph;6] Modification of Class E Airspace; Arcata Municipal Airport, Arcata, CA AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action modifies Class E airspace at Arcata, CA. An Instrument Landing System/Distance Measuring Equipment (ILS/DME) standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) has been developed for the Arcata Municipal Airport. Controlled airspace extending from 700 feet above the surface is needed for aircraft executing the approach. The effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace for instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at Arcata Municipal Airport. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 u.t.c., December 8, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Scott Speer, System Management Branch, AWP&hyph;530, Air Traffic Division, Western-Pacific Region, Federal Aviation Administration, 15000 Aviation Boulevard, Lawndale, California 90261; telephone (310) 297&hyph;0697. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On April 15, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class E airspace at Arcata, CA. (59 FR 23034). An Instrument Landing System/Distance Measuring Equipment (ILS/DME) standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) has been developed for the Arcata Municipal Airport. Controlled airspace extending from 700 feet above the surface is needed for aircraft executing the approach. Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceedings by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No objections were received concerning this proposal. The coordinates in the proposal are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designations listed in this document will be published subsequently in this Order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class E airspace at Arcata, CA, to modify controlled airspace from 700 to 1200 feet AGL at the Arcata Municipal Airport at Arcata, CA. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
