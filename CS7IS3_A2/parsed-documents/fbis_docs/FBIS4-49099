The first phase of the railway, starting from Xining, capital city of Qinghai Province, and ending at Golmud, a city of the same province where the railway meets the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, was completed and opened to traffic exactly ten years ago. Linking the remote "roof of the world" with vast domestic areas, the 846.9-kilometer railway is truly a life artery of the Tibet Autonomous Region and Qinghai Province. Most parts of the line pass through either freezing areas on high ice-capped mountains or harsh deserts that are frequently stricken by natural disasters. Its construction has cost years of devotion and diligence by more than 10,000 young technicians and workers--and even their lives--as well as huge state investment. Also thanks to the efforts and self-sacrifice of innumerable workers, the Qinghai-Tibet Railway has been well maintained during the ten-year period of operation. Several advanced units and outstanding individuals were rewarded for their dedication at the meeting. They were honored for their victory in a kind of struggle not only with adverse natural conditions but also with their inner selves, while working all year round in extremely desolate places along the railway line. Their sweat and blood have been rewarded with vitality and hope brought about by the steel dragons moving on the line. During the past decade, four million passengers and 15 million tons of cargo have been transported via the railway. Difficulty in communication between Tibet and other parts of the country has been greatly relieved. Local people suddenly find themselves among colorful products from all over the country, while veils over the mysterious land have also been lifted, with rich local mineral resources being exploited and more and more people riding the rails to visit or trade here.
