After the meeting, Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic told journalists that we cannot expect a complete peace in our country as long as the borders with Serbia and Montenegro are open. Until control is established over these borders, we will not have peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, our prime minister pointed out among other things. Mirela Hukovic has the details: [Begin Hukovic recording] After their meeting today, Gen. Rose and Haris Silajdzic gave statements for domestic and foreign journalists. Gen. Rose said the following: [Rose, in English with superimposed Serbo-Croatian translation] I talked with the prime minister about the latest development of events along the lines of separation. I must say that I am encouraged by the development of events. We only had one or two cases of truce violations and that number is not increasing. Recently I visited (?a certain) number of positions in the sensitive regions. I think that it is very calm and I hope that (?it will stay) [word indistinct]. [Silajdzic] [words indistinct] also talked about the solution -- a political solution, of course -- and I told General Rose again [word indistinct] we cannot expect a complete peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina as long as the borders with Serbia and Montenegro are open. Until control is established over these borders, we will not have peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. If the regime in Belgrade says -- and it does say so -- that it has nothing to do with the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, then why does it not allow these borders to be controlled? (?There is this) Resolution 838, the Security Council resolution, we have to implement that resolution, and then we can begin to seriously talk about peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We posed the question again of what to do if representatives of the aggressor (?refuse) any peace solution and whether we shall -- as we did after the (?London) conference -- say that [words indistinct] or we shall [words indistinct]. (?In my opinion), the international community has several things to chose, from ranging from increasing the sanctions to lifting the embargo [words indistinct] control of borders. I think that the control of the borders with Serbia and Montenegro is the key to peace not only in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but also in the entire region. Thank you very much. [end recording]
