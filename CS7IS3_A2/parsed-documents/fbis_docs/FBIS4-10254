Endara's statements followed the arrival of a U.S. mission headed by Republican Phil Crane. The U.S. delegation is in Panama to collect information from different economic and political sectors on the possibility of renegotiating the presence of U.S. military bases in Panama. According to the Panama Canal treaties, the last U.S. soldier has to leave national territory before midnight on 31 December 1999. The U.S. delegation of about 25 people met with President Endara yesterday. The delegation also plans to meet with different business groups, as well as with the presidential candidates for the 8 May elections (Ernesto Perez Balladares, Ruben Blades, Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, and Ruben Blades [as published]). "They visited me, and I told them I had a promise to fulfill for the people--a promise I made in the 1989 campaign, when I vowed that during my administration the renegotiation of the treaties will not be considered under any circumstance," the Panamanian president said. According to Crane, prolonging the presence of U.S. military bases along the Panama Canal and in national territory will guarantee the security of both countries, as well as the security of the entire world. Crane also said Panama would benefit economically "because it will simply be a business deal between two countries."
