The former Belarusian Military District will continue to reduce its forces, which until recently numbered about 250,000 servicemen, and was an unbearable burden to the state budget. In addition, according to the new Belarusian military doctrine based on the nonnuclear status, the size of the Armed Forces should be reduced to the levels sufficient only to defend the country's sovereignty and security. The size of the Belarusian Army is expected to shrink to 100,000 servicemen within the year.
