"Idiot," he snapped at his interrogator, "why am I sitting behind bars?" Marwan Khreesat, 49, born in Jordan, revealed an astounding story to the State Protection Department of the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation (BKA). "I'm one of you," maintained the Arab, who had been arrested as a suspected terrorist. He lamented that arrangements had been made with the German authorities that he would be given a chance to escape. The criminal investigator couldn't understand this at all. He took the Arab's testimony, three pages' worth. Even the public prosecutor in charge began to suspect during the subsequent investigation that the prisoner apparently was under special protection. In any case, the record of the interrogation ended up shredded in the trash, thanks to a warning from West German secret service officials. In other respects, too, the arrested Jordanian enjoyed striking concessions. An office of the Duesseldorf public prosecutor telephoned the German Embassy in the Jordanian capital of Amman--Khreesat could speak with a fellow national who was sitting there in the office of the military attache. The latter made it very clear: "Trust the German authorities." Germany, in the fall of 1988, two months before the downing of the jumbo jet over Lockerbie: Following a tip from the Israeli secret service, Mosad, and on the basis of their own investigations, German security officers surrounded a cell of the Palestinian terrorist group PFLP-GC (Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine--General Command) in Neuss, near Duesseldorf. The Israelis reported that the PFLP-GC fighters wanted to attack American targets in Central Europe. The Office for the Protection of the Constitution [BfV] for the time being knew only--according to an internal report--that the Palestinians "were recruiting new members" in Germany. Pulling the strings was Syrian arch terrorist Hafez Kassem Hussein, today 48, member of the PFLP-CG Central Committee and leader of the European network. His nom de guerre: Dalkamoni. Officials knew that wherever he surfaced there was more going on than mere recruiting activities: The group was planning several bomb attacks. In July 1988, the American cruiser Vincesses had mistakenly shot down an Iranian Airbus over the Strait of Hormuz. All 290 passengers and crew had been killed. Arab groups swore revenge--if possible three airplanes were to be dispatched from the skies at the same time. German security officials, therefore, planned a big coup against Arab terrorists on German soil. Code name for the operation: Operation Autumn Leaves. Dalkamoni summoned the top specialist Khreesat, cover name "Safi," to Neuss. The partisan of the PFLP-GC had earned a reputation in the terrorist branch. Area of expertise: attacks against airlines. Khreesat is suspected of having helped prepare two attacks against jets belonging to Swissair and Israel's El Al, in 1970 and 1972. What Dalkamoni didn't know was that Khreesat had threefold duties in the intelligence service and terrorist business. The East Berlin Ministry for State Security had learned early in October that the Arab was an agent for the West Germans--this from a "reliable source" in the German Intelligence Service [BND], according to a memorandum. The BND had recruited Khreesat "with the concurrence of the Jordanian secret service" to infiltrate PFLP commandos, for example. But the big operation against Arab terrorism ended in a disaster that the authorities have shrouded in silence to this day: - A German policeman died while defusing a PFLP bomb; - An informant in the western services whom the BfV had infiltrated into the Neuss group was presumably liquidated; - A Karlsruh investigating judge released the second informant, Khreesat, even though he was responsible for constructing four bombs. From the middle of October 1988 on, according to Stasi [State Security Service (GDR)] findings, Khreesat had become a full player in Operation Autumn Leaves. Whenever he or Dalkamoni telephoned, the BfV's tape recorders were running. Both men were under constant surveillance. On 20 October, they talked about procuring "three large black cans with lids," as well as "gloves" and "paste." On the following day, they talked about "pointed buttons made of aluminum," four of which were to be "electric." On 24 October, according to a record, "it was determined that Dalkamoni purchased three mechanical alarm clocks and possibly one digital alarm clock.... Next Khreesat...together with Dalkamoni bought 16 1.5-volt batteries (appliance batteries, finger thick), diverse small switches, screws, and a large tube of Pattex." Khreesat reported to Damascus that he had made changes in the "medicine," and that it "was now better and stronger than before." What Khreesat meant was clear to the eavesdroppers: explosives. He told his contacts in Amman that it would be "two to three more days" before he returned. Dalkamoni, too, called his homeland and a liaison person in the King's Take Away restaurant on Cyprus. The job, he said, was about finished. From this the observers concluded that the Neuss terror duo, Dalkamoni-Khreesat, wanted to disappear and would be replaced by a new team--a very common practice with such operations. Klaus Gruenewald, department chief in the Cologne BfV, sounded the alarm: "To ward off threatening danger, an executive intervention was imperative." On 26 October 1988, special operation commandos of the police took 16 people belonging to the Neuss Palestinian unit into temporary custody. Whole arsenals of electronic apparatus and weapons were seized. Among those arrested was Ramzi Diab, born in Akko, Israel, in 1959. Diab appears only incidentally in the German Autumn Leaves papers. An official noted: "n.p.u., which means: further personal data unknown." But that is anything but the truth. Diab, a secret service collaborator, had been assigned to watch Dalkamoni, which the BfV knew--a dangerous case of double dealing. Diab is said later to have been exposed and murdered by the PFLP-GC. The carelessness with which German authorities carried out Operation Autumn Leaves also cost a German policeman his life. He had lived with this danger for over four years. On 20 march 1989, BKA Chief Commissioner Hans-Juergen Sonntag typed on his office typewriter a kind of letter of resignation: "Withdrawal of my willingness to serve. I hereby withdraw my declaration to volunteer to deactivate unconventional explosive and incendiary devices." It seemed clear to him that his chief would have no objections: Star athlete Sonntag, parachutist, body builder, swimmer, and soccer player, as well as tennis partner of BKA President Heinrich Boge. And the young man had had the prospect of a new job for a long time: security officer at the German Embassy in Teheran. The last bomb that he was to disassemble took the life of Sonntag, 35. On a special table in the basement of the office lay a stereo tuner, which looked harmless, but which in reality was a devilish explosive trap--a piece of Khreesat's making. "Come on, Thomas," said Sonntag to a younger colleague, "let's go to the lunchroom first and then get the job over with quickly. If it explodes, we'll be in heaven." The dangerous work had almost been completed. "It was just a matter of the last screw," Sonntag's father knows. An accidental turn of the screwdriver activated the firing mechanism. Sonntag survived the tremendous explosion only a few hours. The other official was badly injured. Three days later, at the small cemetery in a little spot called Erfweiler-Ehlingen, between Saarbruecken and the French border: State funeral for Chief Commissioner Sonntag, formulaic speeches for the good policeman who had to die in service for his country. No one wants to say how absurd Sonntag's death was in the jungle of the secret services. The official died from the blast of a bomb that the informant of another German security service had put together. It is fitting for this tragedy that the German judiciary did not issue a new arrest warrant for Khreesat for the involuntary manslaughter of policeman Sonntag until the fall of 1990, when the perpetrator was no longer in reach. The Fifth Criminal Division of the Superior Land Court in Frankfurt mentioned the scandal only in passing when, on 3 June 1991, after eight months of proceedings, it sentenced the terrorists Dalkamoni and an accomplice to 15 and 12 years in prison for other attacks: "In October 1988, Dalkamoni asked the fellow accused, Marwan Khreesat, an expert in the production of explosives, to come to the Federal Republic. Khreesat was to make bombs out of radios. These bombs were intended to cause plane crashes." Operation Autumn Leaves ended up in the registry.
