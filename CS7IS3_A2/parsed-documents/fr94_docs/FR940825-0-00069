FR940825-0-00069 FR940825-0-00014 The particular control measures contained in the SIP are addressed above under the section headed ``RACM (including RACT).'' These control measures apply to residential wood combustion activities. The SIP provides that the control measures for the affected activities apply throughout the entire nonattainment area. The SIP provided that all affected activities would be in full compliance with the implementation of applicable control measures by December 10, 1993. However, funding problems has delayed implementation of the wood stove change-out and home weatherization programs until the summer of 1994. IDEQ is responsible for running the voluntary episodic wood burning curtailment and public awareness programs. The curtailment program for Pinehurst is part of a statewide program that evaluates air quality and meteorological parameters in the PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas on a daily basis, during November 1 through the end of February, and declares burning bans as necessary. The public awareness program is a broad-based strategy designed for the entire Silver Valley (which includes the Pinehurst NAA). IDEQ, through the Pinehurst Particulate (PM&hyph;10) Air Quality Improvement Plan and supporting documentation, commits to carrying out the curtailment and public awareness programs in Pinehurst. If either of these two measures are discontinued without EPA and public approval, then the State of Idaho would be subject to a findings letter for non-implementation of an approved part of the plan (see section 179(a)(4) of the CAA). This in turn could result in Federal sanctions imposed against the State and the loss of State base grant funds. IDEQ's submittal and the TSD contain further information on enforceable requirements. The TSD also contains a discussion of the personnel and funding intended to support effective implementation of the control measures. 8. Contingency Measures As provided in section 172(c)(9) of the Act, all moderate nonattainment area SIP's that demonstrate attainment must include contingency measures (see generally 57 FR 13543&hyph;13544). These measures were required to be submitted by November 15, 1993 for the initial moderate nonattainment areas. Contingency measures should consist of other available measures that are not part of the area's control strategy. These measures must take effect without further action by the State or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to make RFP or attain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline. Contingency measures for the Pinehurst PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area have not yet been submitted by IDEQ. A findings letter, dated January 13, 1994, was mailed to the Governor of Idaho which informed him that the State had failed to make the required PM&hyph;10 contingency measures submittal for Pinehurst. The State has until July 13, 1995 to correct this deficiency for Pinehurst, or it will face federal highway or offset sanctions (see section 179 of the CAA). EPA intends to take action on the contingency measures for the Pinehurst PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area when the requirement is submitted, or intends to impose sanctions in the event this deficiency is not corrected. III. Implications of This Action EPA is approving the plan revision submitted to EPA on April 14, 1992 for the Pinehurst nonattainment area. Among other things, IDEQ has demonstrated that the Pinehurst moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area will attain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by December 31, 1994. IV. Administrative Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq. , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the state is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. U.S.E.P.A. , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this Federal Register publication, the EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action will be effective October 24, 1994 unless, by September 26, 1994 adverse or critical comments are received.
