FR940525-1-00044 FR940525-1-00007 (C) For mortgage servicing rights that are recourse arrangements or direct credit substitutes, the outstanding amount of the loans serviced; (D) For representations and warranties (other than standard representations and warranties), the amount of the loans subject to the representations or warranties; (E) For assets sold with recourse, the amount of assets from which risk of loss is directly or indirectly retained excluding the amount of the recourse liability account established in accordance with GAAP standards; and (F) For loans strips that are recourse arrangements or direct credit substitutes, the amount of the loans. (iii) Second-loss position direct credit substitutes. The on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount for certain direct credit substitutes is the face amount of the direct credit substitute if: (A) There is a prior credit enhancement that absorbs the first dollars of loss from the underlying assets that the direct credit substitute fully or partially supports; and (B) The direct credit substitute is a financial guarantee-type standby letter of credit, a guarantee or other guarantee-type arrangement that absorbs the second dollars of loss from the underlying assets. (iv) Participations. The on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount for a participation interest in a financial guarantee-type standby letter of credit, a guarantee or other guarantee-type is calculated as follows: (A) Determine the on-balance credit sheet equivalent amount as if the savings association held all of interests in the participation. See paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section (direct credit substitute in the first loss position) and paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section (direct credit substitute in the second loss position). (B) Multiply the on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount determined under paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(A) of this section by the percentage of the savings association's participation interest. (C) If the savings association is exposed to more than its pro rata share of the risk of loss on the direct credit substitute ( e.g. , the savings association remains secondarily liable on participations held by others), add to the amount computed under paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(B) of this section, an amount computed as follows: multiply the amount computed under paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(A) of this section, by the percent of the direct credit substitute held by others and the multiply the result by the risk weight appropriate for other holders of those interest. (Note: This risk-weighting is in addition to the risk-weighting done to convert the on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount to the risk-weighted asset amount under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section.) (v) Related on-balance sheet assets. To the extent that an asset is included in the calculation of the capital requirement for a recourse arrangement or direct credit substitute under this paragraph (a)(3), and may also be included as an on-balance sheet asset under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the asset shall be risk-weighted only under this paragraph (a)(3) except: (A) Excess mortgage servicing rights that are recourse arrangements, and purchased mortgage servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships that are direct credit substitutes are risk weighted as on-balance sheet assets under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and the related recourse arrangements and direct credit substitutes are risk weighted under this paragraph (a)(3). (B) Purchased subordinated interests that are high quality mortgage-related securities are not subject to risk-weighting under this paragraph (a)(3). Rather, these assets are risk weighted as on-balance sheet assets under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(H) of this section. (vi) Limitations on risk-based capital requirement _(A) Low-level exposure. If the maximum contractual liability or exposure to loss retained or assumed by a savings association in connection with a recourse arrangement or direct credit substitute is less than the capital required to support the recourse obligation or direct credit substitute, the capital requirement is limited to the maximum contractual liability or exposure to loss. For assets sold with recourse, the amount of capital required to support the recourse obligation is limited to the maximum contractual liability or exposure to loss less the amount of the recourse liability account established in accordance with GAAP standards. (B) Mortgage-related securities or participation certificates retained in a mortgage loan swap. If a savings association holds a mortgage related security or a participation certificate as a result of a mortgage loan swap with recourse, capital is required to support that percentage of the mortgage related security or participation certificate that is not covered by the recourse obligation, and the recourse obligation. The total amount of capital required for the on-balance sheet asset and the recourse obligation, however, is limited to the capital requirement for the underlying loans, calculated as if the savings association continued to hold these loans as an on-balance sheet asset. (vii) Obligations of subsidiaries. If a savings association retains a recourse arrangement or assumes a direct credit substitute on the obligation of a subsidiary that is not an includable subsidiary and the recourse obligation or direct credit substitute is an equity investment in the subsidiary under GAAP standards, the face amount of the recourse obligation or direct credit substitute is deducted from capital under §§567.5(a)(2) and 567.9(c). All other recourse obligations and direct credit substitutes retained or assumed by a savings association on the obligations of a subsidiary are risk-weighted in accordance with paragraphs (a)(3) (i) through (vi) of this section. * * * * *
