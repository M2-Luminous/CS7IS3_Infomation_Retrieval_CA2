The mission, composed of trade officials from San Diego, California and business leaders from Tijuana, Mexico, is led by San Diego Mayor Susan Golding. During a seminar Friday [27 May] morning, mission members said San Diego and Tijuana offer all the privileges any investor could hope for including convenient transportation, tax exemptions, and the huge United States, Canadian and Mexican markets. NAFTA, with the potential to create US$6 trillion in business and become the biggest trade block in the world, has already attracted some 600 companies to the free trade zones, said Daniel O. Pegg, president of the San Diego Economic Development Council. Among the 600 manufacturers, some 100 are Asian companies, including Sony and Samsung, Pegg said. Mayor Golding said she is confident that San Diego will turn itself into a "Hong Kong in North America" in the 21st century with its excellent investment climate and a large area of land.
