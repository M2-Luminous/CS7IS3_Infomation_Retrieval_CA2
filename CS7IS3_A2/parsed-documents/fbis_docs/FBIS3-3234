He summarized the following factors adversely affecting an increase of Chinese exports this year: --Foreign trade enterprises are lacking circulating capital and it will be difficult for them to get bank loans. There will also be a shortage of funds for the purchase of goods for export. --The purchasing price for goods for export will increase following the price hike in the country. This will affect export goods' prices and the confidence of overseas businessmen in Chinese commodities. The depressed world economy will lead to a small demand from overseas markets. Mr. Wei said that foreign trade enterprises last year had achieved more autonomy in their management and had received financial aid from banks in the country. China was planning to set up banks dealing with import- and export-related business. Such things would help meet this year's foreign trade target. Mr. Wei, who is now director of a research group for reform of the Chinese foreign trade system, said that the most difficult period for reform of the foreign trade system had now gone. Difficulties now facing China were how to develop various kinds of markets, letting the foreign trade enterprises move towards forming large-scale groups and how to prevent a draining of talented people from this sector.
