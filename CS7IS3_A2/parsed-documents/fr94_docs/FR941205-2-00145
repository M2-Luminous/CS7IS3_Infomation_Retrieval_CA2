FR941205-2-00145 FR941205-2-00073 (iv) National Objectives. As previously stated in this NOFA, all CDBG-assisted activities must address one of the three broad national objectives. Since economic development projects usually result in new employment or the retention of existing jobs, these activities most likely would be categorized as principally benefitting low- and moderate-income persons in this manner. Such projects will be considered to benefit low- and moderate-income persons where the criteria of 24 CFR 570.208(a)(4) are met. HUD will consider an activity to qualify under this provision where the activity involves jobs at least 51 percent of which are taken by or made available to such persons, or retained by such persons. The extent to which the proposed project will directly address employment opportunities for low- and moderate-income persons in the applicant jurisdiction will be a primary factor in HUD's assessment of the proposed program. In determining whether the person is a low- and moderate-income person for these activities, it is the person's family income at the time the CDBG assistance is provided that is determinative. When making judgments concerning whether an individual qualifies as a low- and moderate-income person, both family size and the income of the entire family must be considered. This consideration is necessary because a low- and moderate-income person is defined as a member of a low- and moderate-income family. The 1992 Act amends the HCD Act by stating that a person may be presumed to be a low- and moderate-income person if the employee resides in a census tract where not less than 70 percent of the residents are low- and moderate-income persons. HUD will also accept a written certification by a person of his or her family income and size to establish low- and moderate-income status. The certification may simply state that the person's family income is below that required to be low- and moderate-income in that area. The form for such certification must include a statement that the information is subject to verification. The application must contain adequate documentation to explain fully, and to support, the process that will be used to ensure that project(s) comply with the low- and moderate-income employment requirements. The documentation must be sufficient to show that the process has been developed and that program participants have agreed to adhere to that process. (v) Application Requirements . To the extent feasible, the material listed below should be submitted for economic development projects. The material should be submitted for each proposed activity (e.g., each loan will be considered a separate activity), whether the proposed activity is presented as a separate project or as part of a project involving multiple activities. Since economic development projects are rated against each other, the more completely these submission requirements are met, the greater the potential exists for enhancing the impact score of the project. 1. A letter from each appropriate developmental entity which includes at least the following information: a. A detailed physical description of the project with a schedule of events and maps or drawings as appropriate. b. The estimated costs for the project, including any working capital requirements. c. A discussion of all financing sources, including the need for CDBG, the terms of the CDBG assistance, and the proposed lien structure. The amount, source and nature of any equity investment(s) must also be provided as well as a commitment to invest the equity. d. A discussion of employment impact which includes a schedule of newly created positions. The schedule should identify the number, salary and skill level of each permanent position to be created. If jobs are made available to low- and moderate-income persons, the applicant must also demonstrate and document how persons from low- and moderate-income households will be accorded first consideration for employment opportunities. e. A discussion of all appropriate feasibility issues including, but not limited to: site control, zoning, public approvals and permits, impact fees, corporate authorizations, infrastructure, environment and relocation. f. An analysis and summary of market and other data which supports the anticipated success of the project. 2. A development budget showing all costs for the project, including professional fees and working capital. 3. Documentation to support project costs. Documentation generally should be from a third party source and be consistent with the following guidelines: a. Acquisition costs should be supported by an appraisal. b. Construction/renovation costs should be certified by an architect, engineer or contractor. Use of Federal Prevailing Wage Rates should be cited where applicable. c. Machinery and equipment costs should be supported by vendor quotes. d. Soft costs (e.g., legal, accounting, title insurance) need be substantiated only where such costs are anticipated to be abnormally high. 4. Letters from all financing sources discussing (at a minimum) the amount and terms of the proposed financing, and the current status of the application for funding. 5. Historical financial data of the development entity, preferably for the last three years. This information may be submitted under separate cover with confidentiality requested. It is recognized that historical financial data may be unavailable or inappropriate for some projects (e.g., start-up companies and real estate transactions). 6. A two-to-five year cash flow pro forma with accompanying notes citing basic assumptions.
