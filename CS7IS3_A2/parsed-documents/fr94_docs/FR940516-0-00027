FR940516-0-00027 FR940516-0-00013 (1) Have an arithmetic logic unit with an access width of 32 bit or more and a ``composite theoretical performance'' (``CTP'') of 80 million theoretical operations per second (Mtops) or more; (2) are manufactured from a compound semiconductor and operate at a clock frequency exceeding 40 MHz; or (3) have more than one data or instruction bus or serial communication port for external interconnection in a parallel processor with a transfer rate exceeding 2.5 Mbyte/s. ECCN 3A01.e.1 is revised to indicate that it does not control batteries with volumes equal to or less than 27 cm 3 (e.g., standard C-cells or R&hyph;14 batteries). This rule also revises ECCN 3C03A to control organo-arsenic, organo-antimony, and organo-phosphorus compounds having a purity (inorganic element basis) better than 99.999%. In addition, a Note is added to 3C03A indicating that the entry controls only those compounds whose metallic, partly metallic or non-metallic element is directly linked to carbon in the organic part of the molecule. This rule removes specific control language in ECCN 4A03A applicable to: (1) Disk drives and solid state storage equipment and input/output control units designed for use with such equipment and (2) color displays and monitors. ECCN 4A03A retains specific control parameters for ``assemblies'' and graphics accelerators or graphics coprocessors. ECCN 4A03A controls: (1) ``assemblies'' that are specially designed or modified to be capable of enhancing performance by aggregation of ``computing elements'' (``CEs'') so that the ``CTP'' of the aggregation exceeds 260 Mtops and (2) graphics accelerators or graphics coprocessors exceeding a ``3&hyph;D Vector Rate'' of 1,600,000. The following changes are made in the Notes for Category 4: (1) Advisory Notes 1 and 2 are revised to conform with the new paragraph designations in ECCN 4A03A (there are no changes in the administrative exceptions levels); (2) Advisory Note 3 is revised by establishing new administrative exceptions treatment levels for exports to Country Groups Q, W, and Y and the People's Republic of China for ``digital computers'' (a ``CTP'' not exceeding 1,000 Mtops), graphics accelerators or graphics coprocessors (a ``3&hyph;D vector rate'' not exceeding 3 million) and equipment specially designed to provide for the external interconnection of ``digital computers'' or associated equipment (a total data transfer rate not exceeding 400 MByte/second); (3) Advisory Note 4 is removed and reserved because 4A03A no longer contains control parameters that apply specifically to disk drives and input/output control units therefor; (4) Advisory Note 6 is revised by establishing new favorable consideration levels for Country Groups Q, W, and Y and the People's Republic of China for ``digital'' computers (a ``CTP'' not exceeding 1,500 Mtops) and for graphics accelerators or graphics coprocessors and equipment specially designed to provide for the external interconnection of ``digital'' computers; (5) Advisory Note 7 is revised to conform with the new paragraph designations in ECCN 4A03A (there are no changes in the favorable consideration levels), and (8) a new Advisory Note 8 is added to provide administrative exceptions treatment for equipment controlled by 4A03.g that is exported for use in interconnecting peripheral equipment to ``digital computers'' not controlled by 4A03.b. In the telecommunications section of Category 5, ECCN 5A02A is revised to control modems using the ``bandwidth of one voice channel'' with a ``data signalling rate'' exceeding 28,800 bit/s. Previously, ECCN 5A02A controlled modems exceeding 19,200 bit/s. On January 13, 1994, BXA published a determination that foreign availability exists within the meaning of the Export Administration Act (EAA) for certain telecommunications equipment controlled under ECCN 5A02.a to Country Groups Q, W, Y, Z, and the People's Republic of China (59 FR 1924). The determination applies to telecommunications transmission equipment employing digital techniques, including digital processing of analog signals, and designed to operate at digital transfer rates up to 623 Mbit/s. The determination notice specified that the Administration would enter into negotiations to preserve national security interests concerning this equipment. The Administration intends to negotiate to remove foreign availability of this high technology equipment to military end-users in Country Groups Q, W, Y, and the People's Republic of China. It has been determined that the validated license requirement is retained on telecommunications equipment controlled by ECCN 5A02.a to military end-users and for military end-uses in Country Groups Q, W, Y and the People's Republic of China, consistent with EAA section 5(c)(6), to allow meaningful negotiations to take place. Section 5(c)(6) permits the Secretary of Commerce to maintain controls, notwithstanding foreign availability, for an initial period of six months. For purposes of this control, military end-users and end-uses include conventional military activities and all proliferation activities described in Part 778 of this subchapter. This action does not affect the control status of this equipment to other end-users or destinations. General License GLX continues to be available for shipments of equipment controlled by ECCN 5A02, except 5A02.h and .i, to civilian end-users and for civilian end-uses in Country Groups QWY and the PRC. In addition, all of ECCN 5A02 remains eligible for General License GFW to Country Groups T & V, except Iran, Syria, and the PRC. Foreign policy controls are retained on all items controlled by ECCN 5A02 to Country Groups S and Z, Iran and Syria, and the South African military and police. Exporters are also reminded that the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control maintains prohibitions on exports to Iraq, Haiti, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). In the Notes for Telecommunications in Category 5, Advisory Notes 1, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 19 are revised, and new Advisory Notes 23 through 27 are added. Advisory Note 8 is revised to provide administrative exceptions treatment to the People's Republic of China for test, inspection, and production equipment controlled by 5B01A or 5B02A and ``software'' and technology for such equipment. Advisory Notes 11, 12, and 13 are revised to restrict their application to Albania, Bulgaria, the People's Republic of China, Mongolia, Romania, and Vietnam. Advisory Notes 14 and 17 are revised to clarify which parties are responsible for the supervision of controlled spare parts.
