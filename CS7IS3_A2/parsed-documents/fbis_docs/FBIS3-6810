With the failure, Korea has no choice but to revise part of its agricultural country schedule if ongoing bilateral negotiations with the United States and other interested parties fail to reach a settlement. At the second verification, the ministry said, the United States and other countries took issue with Seoul's plan to keep tariff rates on farming imports at higher levels than it offered in the country schedule submitted to GATT in April 1992. They also raised objections to the number of farm products which are subject to Seoul's import markups through state trading enterprises. Under the country schedule, Seoul seeks to slap import markups on 118 agricultural products, compared with 10-odd items contained in the previous country schedule. The other nations also expressed dissatisfaction with Seoul's plan to impose specific tariffs on 97 farm imports, at levels higher than those in the previous schedule in April 1992 when Korea included the ad valorem tariffs, according to the ministry. Of 48 countries which underwent the second round of verification Sunday, about 20, including the United States, the European Union, Switzerland, Indonesia, Sweden, Malaysia, Israel and Korea, failed to get their country schedules endorsed. The GATT secretariat is asking the countries which had their schedules rejected to settle their disputes through bilateral negotiations and then inform GATT of the results by Monday night. The Korean Government, in a move to help settle the farming issues, dispatched Pak Sang-su, first assistant agriculture minister, to Geneva yesterday. Korea has been conducting bilateral negotiations with the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Canada on farming issues since Friday, according to the ministry.
