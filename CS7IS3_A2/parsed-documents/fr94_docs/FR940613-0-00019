FR940613-0-00019 FR940613-0-00008 These interim regulations conform the Customs Regulations to the changes made to section 321 by section 651 of the Act. In addition, the interim regulations clarify entry procedures applicable to merchandise subject to section 321. The dollar amounts currently provided for in 19 CFR 10.151 through 10.153, 145.31, 145.32, 148.12, 148.51, 148.64 and 159.6 are changed to the minimums provided for in the amended section 321. The interim regulations amend part 143 to clarify the procedures for entries of shipments qualifying for the administrative exemptions in section 321(a)(2). Shipments covered in section 321(a)(2) are included in the merchandise which may be entered under the procedures provided for by regulation under 19 U.S.C. 1498. That provision authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe rules and regulations for the declaration and entry of the merchandise described in the section. Entries which may be provided for by regulation under section 1498 are distinguished from entries which are required to be filed under 19 U.S.C. 1484 ( i.e., formal entries). As authorized by section 1498, these amendments provide that the person who may make entry of shipments covered by section 321(a)(2) is the owner, purchaser, or consignee of the merchandise or, when appropriately designated by one of these persons, a Customs broker licensed under 19 U.S.C. 1641. Under the same authority, an amendment to part 143 makes it clear that the person who may make entry of other merchandise ( i.e., merchandise not qualifying for the administrative exemptions in section 321(a)(2)) which qualifies for informal entry is the owner or purchaser of the merchandise or, when appropriately designated by the owner, purchaser, or consignee of the merchandise, a Customs broker licensed under 19 U.S.C. 1641. A corresponding amendment to part 111, concerning Customs brokers, is added to the list of transactions for which a broker's license is not required. The new provision provides that a person entering merchandise qualifying for and entered under the informal entry procedures authorized by 19 U.S.C. 1498 is not required to be licensed as a broker unless required to be so licensed by regulations issued under the authority of section 1498. A reference to the provision included in part 143 is included in the new provision. Also under the authority of 19 U.S.C. 1498, amendments are made to part 143 to clearly provide the procedures for entries of the merchandise covered in section 321(a)(2). Shipments of such merchandise may be entered by presenting the bill of lading (or a manifest listing each bill of lading) or other document used to file or support entry. Manifest information is required consisting of the country of origin of the merchandise, shipper name, address and country, ultimate consignee name and address, specific description of the merchandise, quantity, and value. Cross references are provided to section §§148.12 and 148.62 to make it clear that entry by oral declaration continues to be allowed. No amendment to the regulations is being promulgated at this time to implement the new subsection (a)(3) of section 321, added by section 651 of the Act. This provision allows Customs to waive the collection of duties, fees, and taxes due on entered merchandise when such duties, fees, or taxes are less than $20, in order to avoid expense and inconvenience to the Government disproportionate to the amount of revenue that would otherwise be collected. Regulations implementing this provision are being delayed pending an analysis of the expense and inconvenience to the Government in view of the revenue involved. Section 159.6, authorizing Customs to disregard a difference of less than $10 (now $20 under the amended section 321(a)(1)) between duties deposited and duties actually due on an entry, is amended to authorize Customs to apply the exemption to the total of duties, fees, and taxes, as provided for in section 321(a)(1), as amended by section 651 of the Act. Customs also is making amendments to the Customs Regulations in part 128 relating to express consignments. These amendments are intended to make it clear that all shipments carried into the United States by express consignment operators and carriers are required to be entered, unless specifically exempt from entry. Basically, a 3-tier approach applies to such shipments. That is, shipments valued in excess of $1250 are required to be formally entered, as provided for under 19 U.S.C. 1484 in parts 141, 142, and 143 (except subpart C) of the Customs Regulations. Shipments valued between $200 and $1250 may be entered under the informal entry procedures, as provided for under 19 U.S.C. 1498 (unless the shipments consist of merchandise which may not be entered under those procedures). These procedures consist of the filing of a Customs Form 3461, either modified to cover all importations under the special procedures for express consignment operator or carrier importations or all such importations on a daily or flight basis, and the advance filing of the manifest information provided for in 19 CFR 128.21. This information consists of the country of origin, shipper name, address and country, ultimate consignee name and address, specific description of the merchandise and the tariff classification of the merchandise, quantity, shipping weight, and value. An entry summary (Customs Form 7501) and estimated duties are required to be filed with Customs within 10 days of release of these shipments. The third tier is for shipments valued at $200 or less. These shipments also may be entered under the informal entry procedures, as provided for under 19 U.S.C. 1498 (unless the shipments consist of merchandise which may not be entered under those procedures). The procedures for these shipments are the same as those for the second-tier shipments (valued between $200 and $1250), except that the tariff classification of the merchandise is not required for the shipments and no entry summary or estimated duties is required to be filed.
