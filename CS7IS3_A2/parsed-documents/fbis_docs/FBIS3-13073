The decision was made at the peak of police wrath at foreign correspondents. A week ago, the Interior Ministry summoned the AFP bureau chief and reproached him for circulating inaccurate reports. He was accused of hostility to Egypt and threatened with expulsion. AL-SHA'B has learned that the Ministry of Information was not notified of the expulsion decision, but the information minister learned of the matter at the last moment -- before the decision was enforced -- from the foreign correspondents association. He made immediate contacts that resulted in revoking the expulsion decision. Not only did Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif revoke the decision, he even met with the board of the Foreign Correspondents Association last Saturday and voiced his confidence in them. He assured them that his ministry and not the Ministry of Interior, will be responsible for dealing with foreign correspondents. It is rumored that the information minister's decision has created a crisis between his ministry and the Ministry of Interior.
