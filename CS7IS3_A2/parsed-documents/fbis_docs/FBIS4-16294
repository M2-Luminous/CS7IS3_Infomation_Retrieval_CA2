Lithuanian and Russian negotiators met in Kaliningrad Wednesday [13 April]. Domarkas, who headed the Lithuanian delegation, said the meeting was devoted to boundaries of territorial waters, land border and several versions of a draft agreement on Lithuanian-Russian state border. Domarkas said completely no progress was made in any of the issues because "the demands were too high." Zenonas Kumetaitis, head of the Lithuanian Geodesy Service, told Lithuanian TV that Russia unexpectedly decided to review border on the Kursiu peninsula. But in his words, sea border remains the main stumbling block in bilateral talks. Lithuanian and Russian negotiators are scheduled to hold their next meeting after a month. Domarkas said Lithuanian and Latvian delegations intend to discuss sea border problems at a round of talks 18 April.
