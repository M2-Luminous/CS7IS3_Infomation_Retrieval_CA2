The military chief told NOTIMEX via telephone the country is calm, although he admitted there are sectors, which he did not identify, interested in destabilizing Guatemala, as part of a strategy to affect de Leon' government. Various sources reported this afternoon a group of officers discontent with the country's political situation had tried to overthrow the former human rights ombudsman, who took power on 6 June 1993. De Leon, who replaced deposed President Jorge Serrano Elias, has faced over the past months a severe political and economic crisis, heightened by the violence which claimed the life of Constitutionality Court President Epaminondas Gonzalez. Gonzalez, who declared as "unconstitutional" Serrano Elias's decision to assume extraordinary powers last 25 May, was gunned down on 1 April, dying the following day in a local hospital. The defense minister termed as false rumors of an armed uprising within the military ranks, because "Guatemala is on its last leg toward peace." "I have contacted some of the 22 military zones in Guatemala and have confirmed there is no attempted coup d'etat," he added. "We have confidence and faith in the president, because he is doing things well, and, although his government is temporary, he will set down irreversible bases for lasting peace in this country," Enriquez added.
