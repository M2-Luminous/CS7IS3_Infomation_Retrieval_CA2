Yeltsin told journalists at Vnukovo Airport that he expected difficult talks with Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Russia's debt problem and the issue of the farewell ceremony for the Russian armed forces in Germany. Yeltsin confirmed that Germany is meeting all its social obligations, including the construction of housing for the troops returning from Germany. "Germany is the only country that is strictly fulfilling its obligations," the president said. "They (the Germans) have even made available an additional sum of 550 million German marks to step up the construction of soldiers' housing." According to Yeltsin, Germany as an economic power ranks third in the world. That is why Russia must above all put its stakes in Europe on cooperation with Germany, Yeltsin said. Yeltsin does not intend to discuss in Bonn the return of artistic items that were taken during World War II. He said that this was a matter to be dealt with by "the specialists." "They will find a solution, and the politicians will listen to them."
