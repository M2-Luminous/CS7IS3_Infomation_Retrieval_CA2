Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-16MAR94-RUSSIA-US Kozyrev Hails Renewed Partnership Af ter Vladivostok Meeting SUMMARY Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev hailed the results of his meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher as indicating that the U.S.-Russian partnership is able to surmount recent strains and continue to develop. Kozyrev's reaction contrasted with his recent statements on the bilateral relationship in which he suggested that Russia was being relegated to a subordinate role ill-suited to its capabilities and national interests. END SUMMARY Kozyrev gave an upbeat assessment of the state of U.S.-Russian relations following his 14 March meeting with Secretary Christopher in Vladivostok. He expressed satisfaction with the results of the meeting, emphasizing that the two countries acted as equals during discussions on a broad range of international issues. Dismissing the recent strains in the relationship, Kozyrev asserted that "we are partners and we will continue to work in this direction" (ITAR-TASS, 14 March). He told reporters that "circles" in both Russia and the United States object to the "mature and strategic nature" of the bilateral relationship and that "all sorts of hiccups and problems," like ex-President Richard Nixon's protocol difficulties or "spy fever," are bound to occur, "but we are too serious to give into them" (Interfax, 14 March). Previous Concerns Prior to the meeting, Kozyrev had expressed concerns about the state of U.S.-Russian relations and suggested that adjustments to the partnership needed to be made: -- On the eve of his departure from Moscow for Vladivostok, he told reporters that the aim of the meeting would be to develop the partnership on a "new basis," stressing that there could be no question of a "junior" or"senior" partner, or "more freedom for one to the detriment of the other." Rejecting suggestions that relations had begun to cool, he noted that there can be "differing interests" within the partnership (Moscow radio, 14 March). -- Similarly, in a 10 March television interview he said that he and Christopher would discuss what form of partnership the two countries should have, stressing that "we should agree on this so it does not cause annoyance" or "come as a surprise when Russia comes out with its own initiative." Noting that Russia feels "offended" when U.S. officials launch an initiative that the two countries should have agreed upon together, Kozyrev said that such differences needed to be "clarified" and a "mechanism for interaction" should be "finalized" (Moscow TV, 10 March). -- In an article on U.S.-Russian relations published in Izvestiya on 11 March, he also called for adjustments in the relationship, while at the same time stressing that "there is no reasonable alternative to partnership," which he implied is essential to shape a democratic Russia and "transform the unstable post- communist world into a lasting democratic one." He claimed that Russian and U.S. national interests concerning "the main world problems" not only "do not conflict" but "complement each other." He stressed, however, that "certain illusions" such as a Western view that "if the Russians are good they must follow us in everything," or a Russian view that partnership "is an idyllic situation without conflicts and problems" must be abandoned. He contended that partnership "based on common values and sympathies" does not mean renouncing "competition and disputes" or "a firm or aggressive policy of upholding your own national interests." He cautioned, moreover, that agreeing to play a subordinate role would be as "unwarranted as it is politically dangerous" for Russia in view of the "extreme nationalist and reactionary [domesticj forces" who would "immediately take advantage" of such a stance. Warning that exponents "of gloomy self-fulfilling prophecies" would exploit U.S.-Russian disputes if they continue, he called upon the two countries to develop a strategy and instruments for partnership, and particularly a mechanism "for coordinating their actions" on international problems. Media Concerns About Relationship Russia media commentary on the Vladivostok meeting has so far been sparse, but its thrust has been to dismiss the upbeat official assessments of the meeting and continue to focus on problems facing the relationship. A 15 March commentary in the reformist newspaper Kommersant-Daily dismissed the official line that the meeting "plastered over the cracks" in the relationship, asserting that despite "the upbeat tone of the joint statement," "more cracks may develop soon." Commenting on Russia's new involvement in the Middle East, the article noted that U.S. actions in the region were "emphatically independent from Moscow" and warned that "there is an obvious rivalry in Middle East peacemaking between Moscow and Washington." In a 16 March article in the reformist newspaper Segodnya, a commentator, chiding the "incompetence" of both U.S. and Russian officials, contended that the Russian Foreign Ministry, by displaying the "most intense activity possible," had created a "legend" about "stunning foreign policy successes" that could trigger U.S. ideas about "containment." The commentator said that Washington appeared "ready to go to any lengths" to prevent a return to a "global nuclear standoff," but warned that the "stabilization in bilateral relations" proclaimed at Vladivostok "may be shortlived." Before the meeting, Russian media commentators had speculated about whether or how badly U.S.-Russian relations had been damaged in the wake of controversy over Bosnia, the Ames spy case, the Nixon visit, and other differences. Some commentators, echoing Kozyrev, tried to minimize any coolness or weakening in the partnership while others, ignoring the Vladivostok meeting, contended that the United States had already changed its policy toward Russia: -- Echoing the government line, Moscow radio commentaries on 12 March played down any differences. Commentator Yuriy Solton said Secretary Christopher had refuted reports that Washington was dissatisfied with Moscow's active policy in Yugoslavia, noting that he had said the United States welcomed Russia's initiatives, in Bosnia and elsewhere. Solton stressed that statements that U.S.-Russian relations had become "more strained" or "in poor condition" were "absolutely groundless." Admitting that each country "wants to pursue its own end," Solton emphasized that Moscow and Washington were doing this "in close cooperation with each other" and without any of the "rivalry" of the Cold War. Contending that both Moscow and Washington saw their main task as consistently improving their relationship, Solton said this task would "define" the atmosphere at Vladivostok. Likewise, commentator Valentin Zorin, dismissing the recent disputes as occurring in a period marked by "the loss of illusions" on both sides, stressed that "global confrontation" between the two countries is "a thing of the past" and that "what unites them is so much more important that frictions that may emerge." -- In contrast, a 5 March article in the mass-circulation newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda took issue with Secretary Christopher's reported statement that Russia could not act unilaterally in responding to appeals for military assistance from countries of the former Soviet Union, but could only respond under the auspices of the United Nations or other international organizations. The article also alleged that the Secretary had commented on Russian President Boris Yeltsin's 24 February speech, which had spoken of Russia's right to act to ensure stability and protect Russians in the near abroad, "with some scorn." Contending that the warnings from Washington were an attempt to keep Russia in the inferior state to which it had been reduced in recent years, often by the "shortsightedness of [Russian] diplomats," and to "guarantee" Washington's "superpowerdom," the article advised Kozyrev to have a "serious talk" about this with Secretary Christopher in Vladivostok. -- A 12 March article by prominent foreign affairs commentator Aleksandr Golts in the Defense Ministry's newspaper, Krasnaya Zvezda, titled "The Chill Must Not Develop Into Confrontation," warned that "conflicts and microcrises" in U.S.-Russian relations had been following each other "virtually without interruption and in ever-increasing intensity." Criticizing Washington for, among other things, intensifying U.S. involvement in CIS affairs in order to prevent the revival of a dreaded Russian "empire," Golts charged that such an approach not only was inappropriate for states "that only yesterday were calling themselves allies," but went "beyond the bounds of common sense" and could scuttle efforts to settle conflicts. Taking issue-with Secretary Christopher's remarks on Russian peacekeeping efforts, Golts asked with evident sarcasm if the United States allowed its own freedom of action to be restricted "anywhere at all" by consultations with international organizations. Golts contended that Russia's active involvement in trying to end conflicts both in the former Soviet republics and elsewhere was important not only because Moscow was "offering sensible ways to end the suffering of thousands," but also because it strengthened Russia's self-esteem by demonstrating that Russia was a state that could resolve global problems. While asserting that US.- Russian differences were "not insoluble," Golts warned that neither Russia nor the United States can afford the "luxury of a new confrontation" while they search for a new model of mutual relations, and he called upon both states to use the Vladivostok meeting to "prevent undesirable developments." -- A 12 March article in the pro-Yeltsin newspaper Izvestiya headlined that U.S.-Russian relations are experiencing "the most serious crisis of recent years." In describing the reasons for the "time of coolness," the article supported Moscow's "proper" response to the Nixon visit and diplomatic activism in the Balkans, the Middle East, and the "near abroad," but fretted over how Washington might react to such policy "changes." For example, the article cited a "Western diplomat" as complaining that after the reformers' poor showing in the December parliamentary elections, the Yeltsin administration adopted the "slogans of the opposition," adding it was difficult to know who was making foreign policy pronouncements--Kozyrev or Communist leader Gennadiy Zyuganov. Ending on an optimistic note, the article reported that the Russian Foreign Ministry would "strive to avoid confrontation with Washington" at Vladivostok and quoted an "informed" ministry source as saying "there are no major reasons for exacerbating" U.S.-Russian relations. -- Ignoring the upcoming meeting entirely in a 12 March article in procommunist newspaper Pravda, commentator Vladislav Drobkov reported on what he called "Washington's change of direction" and "campaign" to reevalute relations with Russia and develop ties with other countries of the former Soviet Union. Claiming that all his Washington interlocutors had "invariably" said that "coolness" had set in between Moscow and Washington, Drobkov backed up his argument by quoting alleged statements about Russia by U.S. officials. For example, he quoted Senator Richard Lugar as saying "[The United States] is not Russia's partner, we are bitter rivals." Implications Kozyrev's efforts to play down any substantive differences with Washington probably reflect Moscow's determination to keep bilateral relations on track, but his emphasis on achieving equality in the relationship indicates an equally strong determination that Russia not be relegated to what Russians would view as an inferior role. The media's continuing preoccupation with the differences and disputes between Washington and Moscow suggests an ongoing tension between pride that Russia is resuming what is perceived as its rightful role as a global power and concern that a confrontation with Washington might revive a Cold War-like climate.
