FR940721-2-00161 FR940721-2-00086 F. Review Criteria A proposed project should reflect the environmental regulatory purposes stated and described in the Background section of this competitive area. The evaluation criteria are closely related to each other and are considered as a whole in judging the overall quality of an application. Points are awarded only to applications which are responsive to this competitive area and these criteria. Proposed projects will be reviewed on a competitive basis using the following evaluation criteria: (1) Long-range goals and available resources. (15 points). (a) The application explains how the specific environmental regulatory enhancement goal(s) relates to the proposed project. The description includes local objectives related to the program purpose of this competitive area. The discussion should highlight specific environmental regulatory needs and explain how the community intends to achieve the goal. It documents the type of involvement and support of the community in the planning and implementation of the project. The application has a clearly delineated strategy to improve the capability of the governing body of a tribe to regulate environmental quality through enhancing local capacity to perform necessary regulatory functions. (b) Available resources (other than ANA and the non-Federal share) which will assist and be coordinated with the project are described. These resources should be documented by letters or documents of commitment of resources, not merely letters of support. ``Letters of support'' merely express another organization's endorsement of a proposed project. Support letters are not binding commitment letters or documents that factually establish the authenticity of other resources. Letters and other documents of commitment are binding in that they specifically state the nature, amount and conditions under which another agency or organization will support a project funded with ANA money. For example, a letter from another Federal agency or foundation pledging a commitment of $200,000 in construction funding to complement proposed ANA funded pre-construction activity is evidence of a firm funding commitment. These resources may be human, natural or financial, and may include other Federal and non-Federal resources. Applicant statements that additional funding will be sought from other specific sources is not considered a binding commitment of outside resources. (2) Organizational capabilities and qualifications. (15 points). (a) The management and administrative structure of the applicant is described and explained. Evidence of the applicant's ability to manage a project of the scope proposed is well documented. The application clearly shows the successful management of projects of similar scope by the organization, and/or by the individuals designated to manage or consult on the project. The tribe itself may not have experience to meet this requirement but the proposed staff and consultants should have the required qualifications and experience. The application should clearly describe any previous or current activities of the applicant organization or proposed staff and/or consultants in support of environmental regulatory enhancement. (b) Position descriptions or resumes of key personnel, including those of consultants, are presented. The position descriptions and resumes relate specifically to the staff proposed in the Approach Page and in the proposed Budget of the application. Position descriptions very clearly describe each position and its duties and clearly relate to the personnel staffing required to achieve the project objectives. Resumes indicate that the proposed staff are qualified to carry out the project activities. Either the position descriptions or the resumes contain the qualifications and/or specialized skills necessary for overall quality management of the project. Note: Applicants are strongly encouraged to give preference to Native Americans in hiring staff and subcontracting services under an approved ANA grant. (3) Project objectives, approach and activities. (40 points). The application proposes specific project objective work plans with activities related to each specific objective. The objective work plan(s) in the application includes project objectives and activities for each budget period proposed and demonstrates that each of the objectives and its activities: •Is measurable and/or quantifiable in terms of results or outcomes; •Supports the community's strategy for environmental regulatory enhancement; •Clearly relates to the community's long-range environmental goals;
