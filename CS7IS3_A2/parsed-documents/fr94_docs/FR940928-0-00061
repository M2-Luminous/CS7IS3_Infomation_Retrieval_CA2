Lamps shall be operated at the appropriate voltage and current conditions as described in ANSI C78.375 and ANSI C78.1, C78.2 or C78.3. Lamps shall be operated using the appropriate reference ballast as described in ANSI C82.3. (See §430.22) 4.1.2␣Lamp lumen output (lumens) and lamp electrical power input (watts) at the reference condition shall be measured and recorded. Lamp efficacy shall be determined by computing the ratio of the measured lamp lumen output and lamp electrical power input at equilibrium for the reference condition. 4.2␣General Service Incandescent Lamps 4.2.1␣The measurement procedure shall be as described in IES LM&hyph;45, except as noted below. Lamps shall be operated at 120 volts and 60 hertz regardless of the rated lamp voltage. (See §430.22) 4.2.2␣The test procedure shall follow section 7 and lamp lumen output determined in accordance with sections 4.2a or b of IES LM&hyph;45 at the reference condition. Lamp electrical power input in watts shall also be measured and recorded. Lamp efficacy shall be determined by computing the ratio of the measured lamp lumen output and lamp electrical power input at equilibrium for the reference condition. The test report shall conform to section 8 of IES LM&hyph;45. (See §430.22) 4.3␣Incandescent Reflector Lamps 4.3.1␣The measurement procedure shall be as described in IES LM&hyph;20, except as noted below. Lamps shall be operated at 120 volts and 60 hertz regardless of the rated lamp voltage. (See §430.22) 4.3.2␣Lamp intensity distribution shall be measured in accordance with section 6.0 and lamp lumen output, or total flux, shall be determined in accordance with section 7.3 of IES LM&hyph;20, at the reference condition. The integrating sphere measurement method, section 7.1, shall not be used. Lamp electrical power input in watts shall also be measured and recorded. (See §430.22) 4.3.3␣Lamp efficacy shall be determined by computing the ratio of the measured lamp lumen output and lamp electrical power input at equilibrium for the reference condition. The test report shall conform to section 10.0 of IES LM&hyph;20. (See §430.22) 4.4␣Medium Base Compact Fluorescent Lamps 4.4.1␣The measurement procedure shall be as described in IES LM&hyph;66, as it pertains to lamps with integral ballasts. Lamps shall be operated at 120 Volts and 60 Hertz. Lamp lumen output shall be measured according to section 11 of IES LM&hyph;66 at the reference condition. Lamp electrical power input in watts shall also be measured and recorded. (See §430.22) 4.4.2␣Lamp efficacy shall be determined by computing the ratio of the measured lamp lumen output and lamp electrical power input at equilibrium for the reference condition.
