The action came after a recent meeting between the 14 economic ministers of the Cairns Group. Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak was the leader of the Thai officials. The Cairns Group now is working out what areas the group has to include after the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of world trade talks. The Cairns Group was formed out of concern that the Gatt members would not include a farm agreement at the latest round of Gatt talks. But though the round has concluded with a requirement for subsidy cuts on farm products, the Cairns Group has decided not to abolish the grouping but continue to work as a supervisory body to push for free farm trade in the post-Uruguay Round environment. Thailand was assigned to conduct a feasibility study of fish and fisheries products, said Kanitson Nawanukhro, deputy director-general of the Business Economics Department. He said at a press conference after the Cairns meeting that Thailand would like to add fish and fisheries products to the farm products category. "If Thailand's effort is successful, it means that Thailand will have more access to the fisheries products market," he said. Fish resources are the main interest of Thailand and many countries in the group. But the recent Gatt agreement does not force its members to liberalize the fisheries trade, leaving an opportunity for some countries to unfairly restrict fishery imports. Thailand also will work with New Zealand in working out a framework proposal to prevent the export of subsidized goods and food aid that distort international trade. On other countries: Argentina: responsible for conducting a primary study on market dumping and export subsidies not stated in Article 9 and their impact to be used as a guideline under the World Trade Organization. Canada: seeking a mechanism to review and monitor the agriculture policy under the agriculture committee. Brazil and Colombia: considering the impact of the Green Box Policies peace clauses and the condition to use the protection measure for farm products, and evaluating the new dispute settlement mechanism of the Cairns Group. Brazil and Chile: studying how to promote goods, including processed food products and fruit, which will benefit the group.
