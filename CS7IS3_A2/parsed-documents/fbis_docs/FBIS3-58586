Esko Tavia asks whether this goal is in keeping with the existing reality and our prospects for the future. All of a sudden we get the impression from the discussions of the past few days that the country's economy will get back into shape all at once by giving up the new F-18 Hornet interceptors that have been ordered for the Armed Forces. Television current affairs programs, the equipment displayed in parades, the lines of generals at Independence Day [6 December] celebrations, and the presidential election panels have probably misled people into thinking that the country, which is struggling with its economic difficulties, has totally exaggerated its defense needs. In trying to cope with the nation's economic difficulties, there is talk of budget limits and cutting expenditures. Each of the various business sectors has received a given share of future budgets on which to base their plans. The expenditures for the major chief categories of the national budget are in large part prescribed by law. The Eduskunta has passed laws in keeping with our world of values. Our society has evolved through the joint decisions of those who look after the interests of its different groups. Our national defense was not separately developed by promoting some private sphere of interest. Defense policy has been part of our foreign policy. Defense Committees Have Come Up With Common Approach The Armed Forces' mission has been determined by law and the parliamentary defense committees have provided the directions and goals for their development. In retrospect, however, we have to assert that the objectives determined by them have never been achieved. The development of Finland's national defense has long been guided by the tradition that expenditures for defense must amount to about 1.5 percent of the gross national product. The only reason for continuing the tradition appears to be the realization that we cannot afford any more than that. The reason for the niggardliness cannot be a lack either or will or of appreciation of the situation. Parliamentary defense policy debates conducted over the decades demonstrate this. The defense committees have always come up and agreed on a common approach. Nevertheless, there has never been an open, polished analysis in terms of military technology and military policy like those made in the West, based on their reports. Recollections of military experiences, the tradition of the proletariat army, and an active, peace-seeking neutrality policy currently constitute the basis for our defense decisions. The security policy debate now in progress is getting nowhere fast. Nonalignment and an independent defense sound like mere empty rhetoric if we adhere closely to the defense expenditure level of 1.5 percent while the national economy is being strangled. Defense policy studies conducted in areas close to our borders and in West Europe have raised the level of appropriations for defense in those countries to over 2 percent of the gross national product. A rigorous discussion of values is needed now so that we do not do irreparable damage with shortsighted decisions to cut expenditures. The present defense policy solution cannot be changed in the foreseeable future, nor is there any need to either. The danger lies in the fact that the defense capability it is based on may crumble very quickly. A parliamentary committee does not have to be appointed at this point, but it is urgent that we set in motion a major study to determine our defense capability. When considering the order of importance of things, the foundation pillars of an independent nation's existence, the provision of external and internal security, should be raised to their own position. If they totter, it will be hard to imagine what can be achieved for the rest of the development of the society with long-range investment. In principle, we can only see what else we can afford after matters involving our security are at an at least satisfactory level. Appropriations for defense accounted for only 5 percent of this year's budget. This was a drop of about 8 percent from the funds allocated last year. Of this 8.7-billion-markka appropriation, 2.7 billion were used for expenditures for defense equipment. Appropriations will decrease over the next few years to a point at which we will only be able to spend about a billion markkas a year on new fighter aircraft after the mid-1990's. This approaching sharp drop is not based on need, but on tradition. It is perfectly clear that all of the Hornets that were ordered will have to be purchased. Speculations on a reduction in the number of fighters that have appeared in the press are irresponsible populism. Our air defense is built on 60 interceptors, or three squadrons. No one can show that a single one of these is unnecessary given our security environment. Military Technology May Become Unattainable Reports on the development of military technology that are to be prepared in the not too distant future will show that appropriations cannot be reduced because of military technology, but that their present level must be raised to the average European level. Suspending development of our ground forces for decades will give our immediate neighbors an unattainable lead over us. A decision to increase appropriations for defense to a level compatible with an independent and credible defense is certainly a politically difficult one. We must nevertheless now have the courage to act and bear the responsibility for such a decision. The technological level and real performance capability of our immediate neighbors' armed forces is growing so fast that our present funding level will under no circumstances be high enough to provide a credible defense by the turn of the century. The basic question is: Will we defend this country in the future or not?
