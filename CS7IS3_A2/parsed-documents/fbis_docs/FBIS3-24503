Lagarkov, Moscow; UDC 621.] [Abstract] The proliferation of today's composite materials consisting of heterogeneous mixtures of various particles bound by a common matrix in aerospace engineering, modern microwave devices, nonlinear composite resistors, and high-temperature heaters necessitated an investigation into the electrophysical properties of such materials in RF fields. To this end, the behavior of dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability is examined in greater detail; in particular, the random frequency variance of the dielectric constant, the dependence of the static conductivity of a nonordered mixture of insulator and conductor particles on the relative bulk concentration of conducting particles, the behavior of the dielectric constant and conductivity as a function of concentration, the frequency dependence of the effective dielectric constant and magnetic permeability and their real and imaginary parts, etc., are plotted. Attention is focused on the behavior of these constants near the conductivity threshold in electromagnetic fields allowing for the electromagnetic field skinning. The use of quasicritical systems for attaining high dielectric constants in RF fields is addressed. It is noted that the scope of the paper makes it virtually impossible to describe numerous properties inherent in composite structures in the RF spectrum since there are no natural materials capable of even marginally meeting the broad range of today's needs. It is speculated that the development of future materials will require further development of both a comprehensive body of theoretical data and adequate practices which realize complex spatial structures.
