The newspaper adopted a moderate line and is a champion of the peace process. Our correspondent in the territories 'Amir Hay visited newspaper location: The first issue of THE JERUSALEM TIMES in English was first disseminated in the territories over the weekend. The weekly consists of 16 pages, in which the reader will find reports, articles, and commentaries on current affairs, with an emphasis on the political process. The publication is designed to become a daily within a short time. In the first issue, editor Hanna Sinyurah, who is currently in Spain, chose to emphasize the details of the Cairo agreement. On our visit to the weekly's East Jerusalem offices today, we were told by several staff members that the publication aims to boost grass roots support for the political process. [passage omitted] One of the things the reader will not find in the new weekly is, for instance, criticism of 'Arafat's performance in the negotiations with Israel -- criticism which became more clamorous in the wake of the Davos summit and the Cairo agreement, and which has been voiced in the two old-time dailies, AL-NAHAR and AL-QUDS. Editors of the new weekly say it is financed by commercial advertisements, with the PLO extending only ideological support. 'Arafat's opponents say he has prepared himself a new unfledged newspaper that will give him unreserved support after the implementation of self-rule.
