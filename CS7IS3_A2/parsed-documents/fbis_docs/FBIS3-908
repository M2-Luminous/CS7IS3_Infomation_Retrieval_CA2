The CAR expresses its profound gratitude to all those who worked toward the success of these elections in many ways, particularly the CEN, the International Monitoring Committee, friendly countries, the French and Burkinabe military observers, the international civilian observers, the security forces, the prefects, and the mayors. The CAR also wishes to thank the electorate who turned out in their numbers during both the first and second rounds of the poll. Finally, the CAR thanks its activists, particularly its representatives at polling stations, for the quality work done. The CAR considers the victory achieved by the opposition as the victory of the entire Togolese people, who have in this manner expressed their desire for change, for the birth of a new Togo in which all Togolese, civilian or in the army, feel a sense of brotherhood irrespective of their political persuasion or tribe, so that the social and political conditions conducive to reviving our country's socioeconomic development may be created. To this end, it is important that the men and women who will direct the nation's affairs following these elections are chosen in accordance with the will manifested by the people.
