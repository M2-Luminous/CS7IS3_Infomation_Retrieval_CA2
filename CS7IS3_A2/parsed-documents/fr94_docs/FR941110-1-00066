FR941110-1-00066 FR941110-1-00011 In summary, the Program currently operates as follows: •In order to produce controlled ozone-depleting substances, companies must use both production and consumption allowances; •In order to import controlled substances, companies must use consumption allowances; •No allowances are required in order to export, once allowances are expended in the production or importation of the substance. Rather, companies that export can apply for and be granted additional consumption allowances; •If a company exports certain controlled substances to an Article 5 country (developing nations as defined by the Protocol that consume less than .3 kilograms of CFCs per capita), the company producing these chemicals can request additional production allowances as well as the consumption allowances normally granted for export. Production by Parties to the Protocol for these developing countries will continue for 10 years after the phaseout in the United States. The number of additional production allowances that can be provided to a company for this purpose is currently limited to 10 percent of their baseline allowance but will increase to 15 percent upon phaseout of these controlled substances. •No allowances are required to produce ozone-depleting substances that are transformed or destroyed domestically; •Used or recycled ozone-depleting chemicals can be imported without allowances. No consumption allowances are granted if used or recycled ozone-depleting chemicals are exported; •Companies are required to maintain records and to provide the data to ensure compliance with the regulation and to meet the reporting requirements of the Protocol. The Program currently controls and monitors the production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances in the United States. The production and import of halons has already been phased out, and the phaseout for the remaining class I substances, except for methyl bromide, is scheduled for January 1, 1996. In order to ensure an orderly phaseout in 1996, the EPA must alter the administrative requirements of the regulations so companies may continue to produce for exempted uses permitted under the Montreal Protocol and Clean Air Act Amendments.
