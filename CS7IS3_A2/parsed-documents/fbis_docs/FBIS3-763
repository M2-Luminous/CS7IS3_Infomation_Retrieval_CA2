Only a few white Bophuthatswana government officials arrived for work at the government offices in Mmabatho and there was little economic activity in the downtown Mmabatho/Mafikeng central business districts. Hardly any public transport was running during the usually busy early morning peak hour. Mini-taxis were standing idle at their ranks and most vehicles on the roads were driven by white motorists. The Mega City shopping complex in central Mmabatho, which was looted on Thursday night, was still closed on Monday morning. Most shops and department stores in Mafikeng were also closed. There was still a strong presence of South African troops deployed on street corners and protecting key points in Mmabatho and Mafikeng. The South African Defence Force has declined to give details of the number of troops sent to Bophuthatswana to quell the disturbances. But it would appear that at least two crack army battalions equipped with a variety of highly mobile armoured personnel carriers are deployed in the Mmabatho/Mafikeng area.
