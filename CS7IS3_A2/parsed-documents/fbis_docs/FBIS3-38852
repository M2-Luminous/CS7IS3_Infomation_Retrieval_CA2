The ministers have also demanded that the United Nations should, as soon as possible, see to it that the Danish tanks, which are part of the Nordic battalion, arrive at their destination, Tuzla. This was the outcome of an extraordinary meeting of the Nordic defense ministers at Rosersberg north of Stockholm yesterday. In addition to host Anders Bjorck, his counterparts Hans Haekkerup from Denmark and Jorgen Kosmo from Norway were present at the meeting. Not surprisingly, Finnish Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn had indicated that she was prevented from attending. Finland was represented instead by ministry counselor Hannu Toivola. The call for air support has been voiced in robust terms by the head of the battalion in Tuzla, Colonel Ulf Henricsson, among others. The idea that the defense ministers have now expressed their support for is that, if UN personnel are attacked by any fighting unit, this unit must be quickly knocked out in a targeted air attack. "Of course it means risks for personnel if the United Nations decides to adopt a tougher line against the warring factions," Anders Bjorck said. "But after the briefing we received today from Ulf Henricsson, we share his view that the risks are probably even greater if nothing at all is done." Anders Bjorck and his colleagues stressed that it is important that possible future air operations are directed solely against groups that attack the UN forces. "We do not want to contribute to an escalation of the fighting, and we also have to prevent other UN personnel in humanitarian operations in the region from finding themselves in a tough spot." A number of Danish tanks are part of the Nordic battalion. However, the tanks have not yet arrived in Tuzla, where the over 1,000 man battalion is stationed. At present they are in Split in Croatia. "There is an urgent need that the tanks get into place and can be made use of as soon as possible," Hans Haekkerup said. "At present the United Nations is giving priority to another task -- that of replacing the Canadian personnel in Srebrenica with Dutchmen, but after that we expect that it will tackle the problem of moving the tanks. Hopefully this will be able to happen in early March." One of the Nordic UN force's main tasks is to open the airport at Tuzla. "We hope that the United Nations will be able to reach a negotiated agreement about the airport with the warring factions, but if this proves impossible we must give consideration to using force to open it. Such a decision on the part of the United Nations must of course be preceded by consultations with us," Anders Bjorck said. Anders Bjorck also thinks that it is now time for the United Nations to review its military organization. "Bosnia is probably the most difficult UN mission since the Congo crisis. Past operations have been more like policing actions, whereas now we are facing the prospect of direct military operations." The ministers consider that one of the most important lessons that can be learned is that peacekeeping operations must be put in place as early as possible in a risk area. "Just look at the Nordic force in Macedonia. Not very much attention is paid to it in the media, but it is doing an excellent job, in that it has succeeded in preventing fighting from flaring up," Jorgen Kosmo said.
