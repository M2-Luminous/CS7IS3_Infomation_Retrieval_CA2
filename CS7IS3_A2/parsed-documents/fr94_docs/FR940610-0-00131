FR940610-0-00131 FR940610-0-00023 (v) Annuity and unitrust interests for a term of years or until the prior death of an individual _(A) Annuity interests. The present value of an annuity interest that is payable until the earlier to occur of the lapse of a specific number of years or the death of an individual may be computed with values from the tables in 20.2031&hyph;7(d)(6) as described in the following example: Example. On January 1, 1991, the donor transfers $100,000 into a trust and retains the right to receive an annuity from the trust in the amount of $6,000 per year, payable in equal semiannual installments at the end of each period. The semiannual installments are to be made on each June 30th and December 31st. The annuity is payable for 10 years or until the donor's prior death. On January 1, 1991, the donor is 59 years and 6 months old. The donor's age is taken as 60 for purposes of computing the present value of the retained annuity. The section 7520 rate for January 1991 is 9.8 percent. The present value of the annuity beneficiary's interst is $35,424.00, determined as follows: ␣ 1␣ 1␣ Table S value at 9.8 percent, age 60 .23158 Table S value at 9.8 percent, age 70 .36468 Table 80CNSMT value at age 70 .68248 Table 80CNSMT value at age 60 .83726 Table B value at 9.8 percent, 10 years .392624 Table K value at 9.8 percent, 1.0239 Factor for annuity beneficiary's interest at 9.8 percent: E:GRAPHICSER10JN94.005 Present value of annuity beneficiary's interest: ␣ 1␣ 1␣ ($6,000×5.7662×1.0239) $35,424.07 (B) Unitrust interests. The present value of a unitrust interest that is payable until the earlier to occur of the lapse of a specific number of years or the death of an individual may be computed with values from the tables in §1.664&hyph;4(e)(6) as described in the following example: Example. The donor who, as of the nearest birthday, is 60 years old transfers $100,000 to a unitrust on January 1, 1991. The trust instrument requires that each year the trust pay to the donor, in equal semiannual installments on June 30th and December 31st, 6 percent of the fair market value of the trust assets, valued as of January 1st each year, for 10 years or until the prior death of the donor. The section 7520 rate for January 1991 is 9.8 percent. Under Table F(9.8), the appropriate adjustment factor is .932539 for semiannual payments payable at the end of the semiannual period. The adjusted payout rate is 5.595 percent (6% × .932539). The present value of the unitrust beneficiary's interest is $40,495.00 determined as follows: ␣ 1␣ 1␣ Table U(1) value at 5.6 percent, age 60 .37017 Table U(1) value at 5.6 percent, age 70 .50971 Table 80CNSMT value at age 70 .68248 Table 80CNSMT value at age 60 .83726 Table D value at 5.6 percent, 10 years .561979 Factor for the unitrust beneficiary's interest at 5.6 percent: (1.000000^.37017)^(.561979×(68248/83726)×(1.000000^.50971))=.40523 ␣ 1␣ 1␣ Table U(1) value at 5.4 percent, age 60 .38183 Table U(1) value at 5.4 percent, age 70 .52086 Table 80CNSMT value at age 70 .68248 Table 80CNSMT value at age 60 .83726 Table D value at 5.4 percent, 10 years .573999 Factor for the unitrust beneficiary's interest at 5.4 percent: E:GRAPHICSER10JN94.006 ␣ 1␣ 1␣ Factor at 5.4 percent, age 60 .39399 Plus: Interpolation adjustment .01096 n,s Interpolated Factor .40495 Present value of unitrust beneficiary's interest: ($100,000×.40495) $40,495.00 (3) Transitional rule. (i) If the valuation date of a transfer of an interest in property by gift is after April 30, 1989, and before June 10, 1994, a donor can rely on Notice 89&hyph;24, 1989&hyph;1C.B. 660, or Notice 89&hyph;60, 1989&hyph;1 C.B. 700, in valuing the transferred interest.
