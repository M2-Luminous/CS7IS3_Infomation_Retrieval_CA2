Though a state department underling she, it is said, has a lot of clout in the United States administration because she is supposed to be close to the U.S. president, Mr. Bill Clinton. Last October, Ms. Raphel had attacked the Indian position on Kashmir by saying the U.S. administration did not take as final the state's accession to the Indian Union. That time Ms. Raphel's revelation had come as part of a background briefing to the media. In four months, she has come back to the very same theme of Kashmir, saying that it is as bad as Afghanistan. But this time it was a public speech at the Asia Society's Washington branch. Ms. Raphel went further to warn that Kashmir, like Afghanistan, has "the potential to mutate into wider regional conflicts." This bombshell from the head of the South Asia bureau of the state department was unexpected for U.S watchers in India. In fact, most of them had tried to dismiss Ms. Raphel's earlier statement questioning Kashmir's accession to India as the outburst of an individual in the U.S. government and not the latter's considered view. Explanations were even sought and received from official quarters in Washington. It was given out that Ms. Raphel did not represent the official U.S. viewpoint. This time no such alibi can be forthcoming since the lady herself has been quoted as saying whatever she had said was backed by the "full authority" of Mr. Clinton. She added that all her remarks reflected the U.S. administration's policy and were not personal observations. A careful analysis of the present state of the U.S. government's attitude to India makes it abundantly clear what Ms. Raphel said both now and earlier could not possibly be dismissed as the impudent remarks of a U.S. official airing her personal opinion and thereby breaking protocol. In a sense, Ms. Raphel has done India a good turn by leaving very little scope for any illusions about the U.S. administration's attitude to India. Some in India feel the U.S. approach towards India has radically changed for the better. They argue old prejudices about India as a camp follower of Moscow no longer exist since the Soviet Union itself has disappeared and the world has emerged out of the superpower rivalry of the Cold War years. This argument is buttressed by the theory that since India has scrapped the Nehruvian model of development, is willing to toe the World Bank's free market line on the economic front and has invited multi-nationals to invest in the country, the United States has come to regard it not only as a good friend but as a virtual camp follower. Not only on the economic front but in defence as well, Washington must have -- or should have -- noticed New Delhi's readiness to comply with its injunctions. This was evident by the fact Indian military authorities extended their cooperation to the U.S. Pacific command, and then, more pointedly, agreed to send forces to Somalia as desired by Washington. The expected results turned out rather discomforting for this pro-U.S. lobby in India. Mr. Clinton's speech on Kashmir before the United Nations general assembly last year made it abundantly clear he saw the situation in the state as a civil war. Over the last two months, he has demonstrated which way he leans by responding with a touch of affectionate sympathy to a letter from one of the militant organisations in Kashmir demanding secession from India. As if this were not enough, he has sympathised with a Khalistani outfit as well. Mr. John Mallot to Ms. Robin Raphel with Mr. Clinton's rather unorthodox interjections in between -- it is clear Washington is hardly reconciled to New Delhi's stand that Kashmir is part of India. While a number of Western governments have in recent times expressed their misgivings at the violation of human rights in Kashmir, none has questioned the validity of Kashmir being part of India. When Mr. Clinton in his address before the UN general assembly referred to Kashmir as having a civil war situation, he implied the legitimacy of the Indian government's authority over Kashmir was in question. If it was only a case of human rights violations on the part of the Indian security forces, then one does not have to use the term civil war. The concept of civil war itself implies that rival forces are contending for state power. In other words, the two sides, namely the Indian security forces and the armed militants, are to be looked at as being on par in their respective claims to state power. In this context, Ms. Raphel's October observation sought to provide a historical justification for the U.S. official position, that is, Kashmir's accession to the Indian Union itself could not be regarded as final and irrevocable. Her latest remark that Kashmir is in the same category as Afghanistan is all the more ominous. What is the situation in Afghanistan today? It is admitted by all that there is no state authority in that country, torn as it is between rival factions fighting one another to extend their respective domains by sheer use of force. There is no central authority in Afghanistan. It cannot even be said that he who controls Kabul rules the country. The three contending leaders -- Mr. Abdul Rashid Dostum, Mr. Ahmad Shah Mas'ud and Mr. Golboddin Hekmatyar -- are all equally matched and none can claim to be superior to the other. When someone in all seriousness compares Kashmir with the Afghan situation, it is clearly a case of inciting the Kashmiri militants against the authority of the government of India. It is an announcement the Indian government is as effete as President Borhanoddin Rabbani, and no superior than Messrs Hekmatyar, Dostum and Mas'ud. Washington's position has thus moved very far from expressions of concern at the violation of human rights. It is often pleaded by the U.S. administration and its cohorts that what really bothers Washington about the present unrest in Kashmir is that it might spark off a full scale war between India and Pakistan. In this war, it fears, both countries might at some stage be desperate enough to use nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons, the U.S. authorities are convinced, both India and Pakistan possess or are capable of producing at short notice. So the real U.S. concern, it is argued, is the danger of a nuclear war breaking out in south Asia, particularly when both countries have not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. But the Indian perception is that the nuclear war danger is being used as a excuse for U.S. intervention in the world after the Cold War. The United States tries to justify its persistent inroads into Iraq's sovereignty by saying Mr. Saddam Husayn might build the nuclear bomb. This is taken as an example of the U.S. cooking up an alibi for direct intervention -- next time in the affairs of south Asia with the Kashmir crisis being played up beyond recognition. It is time New Delhi woke up to these new realities. To expect that the Clinton administration will pull up Pakistan and thereby ensure arms supply to Kashmiri militants is stopped is to misread the U.S. objective in Kashmir. The U.S. has in fact no interest in curbing militant secessionism in the valley. It needs to be stressed that both Ms. Raphel's and Mr. Clinton's pronouncements must have acted as a tonic to the Kashmiri militants. New Delhi's campaign last year beseeching the U.S. administration to declare Pakistan a terrorist state was unrealistic. For those in the Indian government who tried to do so, the U.S. official pronouncements must have come as a shock from which they will take a long time to recover. One can guess from their pathetic position how unreal it would be to expect the prime minister, Mr. P. V. Narasimha Rao, to pay an official visit to Washington, which is what some of his officials have been trying hard to arrange this summer. *
