The meeting between the presidents Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton could make Russia more compliant in talks with Latvia, said a NATO representative in another press conference today in Riga. Commenting on the issue of human rights, Ulmanis said he was "surprised" by the allegations of human rights restrictions in Latvia, voiced during the Moscow summit. Latvia needs to prompt the adoption of a citizenship law to stop "philosophizing over these topics," the president said. The National Security Council also supports the stance, said Ulmanis. Ulmanis has not received official information on the Moscow summit yet, he said.
