Ufimtsev, deputy chief of the South Urals Railroad, general director of Yuzhuralzheldorsnab, by A. Loginov, GUDOK special correspondent: "In a Ferment of Bartering"; Chelyabinsk-Moscow; date not given] [Text] Today, when debts and mutual non-payments, amounting to millions and billions of rubles, have become not the best sign of the times, a reasonable question arises: just how, under these conditions, can one solve the problem of material-technical supply for transport as a whole and for its individual mainlines? Our correspondent interviewed B. Ufimtsev, deputy chief of the South Urals Railroad, general director of Yuzhuralzheldorsnab, on this subject [Loginov] Boris Petrovich, in giving a report on supply matters at the road's technical-economic council last year, judging by the notices in the railroad newspaper, you noted that difficulties are arising today, not in obtaining resources, but in obtaining the funds to acquire and pay for them. [Ufimtsev] Well here, let us agree, I didn't say anything new. Many countries of the world, including the United States and Japan, are making wide use of barter deals and mutual debt clearing. Indeed, our country practiced this even earlier, in the days of centralized supply, except that this was done "at the top," whereas now, with the transition to the market, one has to do it oneself -- on the scale of the roads, divisions and their subdivisions. Remember, the union's MPS [Ministry of Railways] had a Material-Technical Supply Main Administration (GUMTO) with the chief of the main administration holding the rank of deputy minister. Later on, this structure ceased to exist (as did the intersectorial Gossnab [State Committee for Material and Technical Supply], etc.). As far back as 1990 they began to set up a marketing service. At that time I was appointed chief of this service and commercial director of the South Urals Railroad. True, in those days, the tasks were somewhat different: at that time there were not enough resources, and therefore they had to be "procured" through additional road services, leasing railcars, etc. In a word, this experience has come in handy today. A necessary digression. On listening to the tape of the interview, in preparation for publication, I could not help remembering the economic postulates presented to us in our student years: commodity-money-commodity. The classic formula of "Das Kapital" by K. Marx, to which we have, it seems, been cycled today in our commodity-money bedlam. It is as if there is more and more money -- our old wooden stuff and various currencies, but everywhere you hear about the shortage of cash, of "live" money for clearing accounts. For this reason (and other, attendant ones), a real muddle has arisen in the economy. Meanwhile, the author of "Das Kapital," in the section about the cost of circulation, says: "1. One of the main items of circulation costs is the money itself, since it itself has a cost. Money is saved by means of credit in a three-fold way: A. For a considerable number of transactions, money is not necessary at all." We will not dwell on the last two points in the A, B, C triad, although it would be useful for us, and for our economic reformers today to know about those points, which were well known over a century ago. Let us therefore return to the present problems, the solution of which has gone according to the Marxist "recommendation" that money is not needed for a considerable number of transactions between partners. With the vanishing of the system of centralized allotment of funds, unfortunately, no full-valued commodity exchanges that would be capable of satisfying supply and demand have so far appeared, because of the disparity of prices and all possible commercial, tax and other jacked-up demands. Now the railroad workers, particularly their supply structures, have realized: they cannot survive on their own under these conditions, they have to unite. I asked my collocutor about this. [Ufimtsev] The South Urals became a member of the first eight-road association created on the network, which included the Sverdlovsk (initiator), Kemerovo, Moscow, Northern, Gorkiy, Kuybyshev and Volga mainlines. The regions that they serve produce many of the things that they need. Let us say, on the South Urals -- metal, on the Kuybyshev -- petroleum products, the Kemerovo -- coal, etc. Last year our road, through barter operations alone, acquired 1.5 billion rubles' [R] worth of resources. Moreover, on the basis of contracts with other roads and with enterprises of our own region (and not it alone) and by reciprocal offset, we acquired R13.7 billion worth of resources. This naturally eased the financial situation of the road, whose debt to customers was reckoned in tens of billions of rubles. After all, you have to pay people wages -- this should be done in banknotes. [Loginov] But does it turn out that you also pay them with barter? For example, on the Orsk Division, I heard that they are "issued" in both motor units and refrigerators, produced locally. A friend of mine complained: her husband (true, he does not work in transport) had not received his wages for several months, but on the other hand, he regularly gets, as a partial offset for them... sausage. So it is possible, she says, for them to live. "We have this sort of independent market, we have to dodge around in various ways," my collocutor smiled. Later on, after I visited the Orsk Division, I wondered how the barter wages were being accepted, and I heard that things were not all that bad. Let us say, that same motor unit and refrigerator cost the recipient of the "substitute wage" several thousand rubles less (!) than on the trade network, after the price is jacked up in various ways. The railroad workers, in obtaining goods for mutual offset and settlements (essentially at production cost), avoid the money "sticking to" the grasping hands of businessmen, and sell the goods cheaper. I recently read, in the newspaper SELSKAYA ZHIZN, an item with the sensational heading, "Fertilizer from... a Locomotive." Its topic is the fact that many chemical enterprises in the region of the Gorkiy Railroad owe it a tidy sum for transport. The railroad workers, in settlement, began to take the debts in fertilizers, and, in order to have "live money," to sell them to the local kolkhozes, sovkhozes and joint-stock companies. In all, they concluded contracts for the supply of 90,000 tonnes of nitrogen fertilizers. These fertilizers cost the farmers 15-20 percent less. The Nizhegorod Oblast administration contributed its bit to this transaction, when it allotted the peasants R3 billion from its budget to buy fertilizer, and another R1.5 billion to the Nizhegorodselkhozkhimiya Joint-Stock Company. This means that the railroad workers had no particular problem in selling the fertilizer. Not to mention the fact that they did not fail to transfer some of it to their own subsidiary farms. In short, the market has begun to act according to its own particular laws. Zheldorsnab is no weaker because of this, but on the contrary --has become one of the leading services on the railroads. It fulfills, on the one hand, its own basic function -- supply, self-provision of resources for the road, without trusting in, as it used to, help and allotments from above (MPS, Gossnab, etc.). On the other hand -- it carries out clearing accounts and the sale of excess resources. Here there is simply an interweaving of supply (in the traditional meaning) and commerce. I note: my chat with the general director of Yuzhuralzheldorsnab differed somewhat from an ordinary interview, and Boris Petrovich Ufimtsev differed from the class of directors who evade the dry presentation of facts and figures. This is just the result of what has been done, but how can more be achieved, how can tomorrow's result be predicted and planned (!) under the conditions of the market leaps? When industrial production and transport continue to drop, and prices to rise. When today's millions and billions are no match for tomorrow's. All the same, there is always a starting point -- the beginning from which we can and must begin again. Last year, he reflects, his service, as has already been noted, "obtained" resources amounting to a little over one-and-a-half dozen billion rubles. That's quite a good deal. The contents of the road's financial "purse" would not have made it possible (without barter) to allot such funds. He well knows, though, that the mainline's needs are much greater. And they must be satisfied. The divisions and their subdivisions were given the assignment of weighing everything at the sites: the total sum of requests for resources in 1994 was about R78 billion. It is unrealistic to count on funds like this being found in the road's cashbox. It was therefore proposed to that same technical-economic council for the railroad that 60 percent of the material resources be acquired through barter with other railroads. Part of them would go for the needs of our railroad, and part for barter and sale.... This is the basis for planning -- not up-in-the-air planning, but real planning, albeit with market "nuances".... "Last year," said B.P. Ufimtsev, "because of the shortage of rails, ties and other things, we could not cope with the plan for capital repair of the line. Now we must fill in the gaps. How? We have concluded a contract with the metallurgists of the Urals: they will pay for future transport with metal, and we will send R6 billion worth of it to Novokuznetsk, and we will get rails from there." In this way, the railroad workers of the South Urals Railroad and their partners by association will appear in several hypostases: transporters, buyers -- employers, consignees.... Naturally, since I am a journalist, a number of questions occurred to me. [Loginov] Today the price of metal is one thing, tomorrow -- it will leap.... [Ufimtsev] Six billion holds good as the starting price at the moment of concluding the deal, and indexing proceeds at the moment a certain batch of metal or other materials is shipped. [Loginov] But the transport tariffs will also leap -- won't they "eat up" the rails, ties, and the rest? [Ufimtsev] You can't avoid this, the rise in tariffs is caused by the rise in prices for energy resources and for everything that transport needs. It cannot be otherwise. But what goes for the railroad's needs is supplied at favorable rates. [Loginov] Another thing: the huge products list of supplies (about 40,000 item descriptions) and the price leaps -- all this requires rapid, if not instantaneous reaction. How can you succeed in managing it, in handling it? After all, judging by what you have said, your staff is comparatively small. [Ufimtsev] We have begun to form a system. By decision of the technical-economic council, the road's IVTs [computer information center] is gathering data on the goods being produced in the region. With this data bank in the computer memory (it can be lost in paper technology), special computer programs can be worked out which make it possible to obtain the necessary information quickly and to make corrections. This is not only on the scale of the South Urals Railroad administration and the road association administration, but also at the sites -- on the divisions and subdivisions of the mainlines. Having created this computer information network, we can go to a new level of material-technical supply control. [Loginov] Will this approach make it possible to get out of the present market chaos? [Ufimtsev] No doubt about it. It is naive to suppose that the wild, uncontrolled market can put everything in its place by itself. The civilized market is -- and I know how it is organized -- a very strict economy, planned development and discipline in the mutual relations of the partners. These components will not permit the wild burst of non-payments which has reached catastrophic proportions in our country. There is no place for chaos, when 98 percent of the partners are working according to a contract system. This is the plan, clear-cut and mutually coordinated, and deviations from it are severely punished, according to the terms of the contract. Only two percent is so-called economic freedom. The rest is the study of supply and demand, and marketing. Everything is counted out and weighed on the scales of the economy. Not as it is in our country -- on the off-chance, by grabbing, by prodding.... [Loginov] Boris Petrovich, before I talked to you, I heard a flattering reference to the fact that the railroad workers, apparently from your department, were organizing a trade fair of Chinese commodities in Chelyabinsk. Is this also part of the commercial work? [Ufimtsev] This is somewhat different. Actually, in addition to supply, we are also engaging in foreign economic activity. We have a contract of intent, documents for the development of joint ventures, etc. In this case, however, the organized sale of Chinese goods, obtained in barter for our surplus, is the contribution of the Chelyabinsk Division of the road. This is a topic for a separate conversation. We go out on the foreign market when we do not find anything that we have "at home." Or we find it, but -- it is not as good.... For example, the special "Gudok" work clothing for engineers -- jacket and trousers. We buy them at a plant in St. Petersburg. But the Chinese suggested that they make a consignment of this clothing: with natural fur (we use synthetic), made more accurately, and for a cheaper price. The engineers prefer the Chinese "Gudok" -- a market is a market. [Loginov] As far as I know, we are stumbling on the market in our relations with our near abroad, particularly with Kazakhstan. [Ufimtsev] Paradoxical as it may seem. After all, until quite recently we had no border barriers: part of the Orenburg Division was wedged into Kazakhstan, and vice-versa -- the West Kazakhstan Railroad was in Orenburg Oblast. Indeed, even now the Petropavlovsk Division is included in the South Urals Railroad, so as not to break up the Central Siberian mainline. For that reason we sometimes cannot provide "our" division with spare parts, because of customs and other barriers, even though their delivery belongs in the category of technically necessary, duty-free transport. There is an intergovernment statute on this score, but just imagine -- we still stumble. * * * As if "by order," a telephone conversation comes to my mind. It reflects one of the paradoxes of our time.... Railcars loaded with edible salt, extracted at Sol-Iletsk, which is in Orenburg Oblast, arrived for processing and shipment to consignees at the nearby Iletsk Station of the West Kazakhstan Railroad. But they held them up here, demanding that customs duty be paid. Ufimtsev had to explain in simple terms that this was transport necessary for technical reasons, specified by so-and-so.... After all, this is the salt, the whole point of our lack of coordination and woes.
