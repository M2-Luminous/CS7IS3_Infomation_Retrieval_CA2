The hog production and sales situation this winter and next spring will not experience very great fluctuations. According to information supplied by the Ministry of Agriculture, at the end of the third quarter of this year, hog volume reached 388 million head, the number of hogs removed from the inventory was 244 million head, and total pork output reached 24.2 million tons, an increase of 8.6 percent, 6.5 percent, and 9 percent, respectively. Included, the 8.2 percent growth rate of pork and the hog production situation can be considered hopeful. Along with the growth in hog production, in recent months, pork prices also have generally risen nationally. According to State Statistics Bureau statistics of pork prices in 35 large and medium-sized cities in September of this year, pork prices on average increased by 17.8 percent over the same period last year. Within that, Beijing's 64.4 percent rise, Tianjin's 20.8 percent rise, Chongqing's 34.2 percent rise, and Guiyang's 47.2 percent rise were rather pronounced. The relevant department of the Ministry of Agriculture analyzed this and they believe that brisk consumer demand is an important factor leading to the simultaneous rise in pork production and prices. From January through September, urban and rural resident cost of living expenses increased by 29 percent and 17 percent, respectively. If the price factor is deducted, they are 12 percent and 5 percent, respectively. This cannot be separated from this year's rather rapid growth of state fixed asset investment. Experts in the field estimate that approximately 40 percent of fixed asset investment funds are converted to cost of living funds. So, despite the rise in pork prices, with the exception of epidemic areas, the hog and pork markets have not experienced a "difficulty in selling hogs," and buying and selling have remained brisk. As a result of the spread of hoof and mouth disease, hogs cannot be transferred out of some infected production areas and sales regions must concentrate on transferring meat from those production areas unaffected by the epidemic, such as Sichuan, causing meat prices in these regions to rise further. The state commerce system purchases, sales, and reserves have decreased, and market adjustment capabilities have been reduced, also creating a rise in meat prices. As of the end of September, state commerce system hog purchases were down by 34.3 percent and reserves were down by 44.1 percent. Feed prices rose and the cost of raising hogs increased, another important factor leading to the rise in pork prices. According to Ministry of Agriculture statistics on the cost of raising hogs from 160 points on the information network, in addition to the rather large rise in such feed production costs as water fees, electrical fees, and oil fees, the rural market price of corn rose from 0.64 yuan per kilogram in January of this year to 0.74 yuan per kilogram in September and hog feed prices reached as high as 1.29 yuan per kilogram. Some rather highly intensified hog producing units were rather sensitive to this. Because large-scale pig farms and specialized hog raising households near urban areas were rather greatly affected by the rise in feed prices, pork supplies around large cities correspondingly decreased, directly pulling up urban pork prices. The good consumption of high-quality, high-priced fresh meat and lean meat and meat products by residents of large and medium-sized cities also to a certain extent strengthened the rising trend in pork prices. Despite this, relevant personnel at the Ministry of Agriculture still are rather optimistic about hog production and sales this winter and next spring. They believe that the response from various regions and the level and development of current prices indicate that this year's national hog production growth is settled and current pork supplies are not at all considered too high and hog production and sales this winter and next spring will not experience great fluctuations. According to their analysis, compared to the rate of increase in production costs, pork prices still should not be considered too high. According to the composite indicator of comparative hog and grain prices, current hog and grain comparative prices still have not reached the levels from the beginning of the year and are still in the rebounding stage. September comparative hog and grain prices were 1:5.87; May's were 1:5.4; and at the beginning of the year, they were 1:6.23. Hog raising profits are not great. Precisely because of the rise in pork prices in the last half of the year, the rare situation of a decline in the price of sows and piglets in May and June has been turned around and hog production is tending to stabilize. In addition, in the general background of widespread price increases, current pork prices also are not considered high. According to data provided by the State Statistics Bureau, compared to the same period last year, from January through September cost of living prices of residents of 35 large and medium-sized cities throughout the nation rose 18.9 percent. Within this, non-staple food prices rose by 18.0 percent and among non-staple foods, the prices of aquatic products rose by 29.6 percent; meat, fowl, and egg prices rose by 15.8 percent; and pork prices rose by 14.8 percent. But Ministry of Agriculture officials also point out that if feed prices continue to rise too rapidly or meat prices continue to rise to the point that they restrain the rate of consumption, it could affect hog production in the second half of next year.
