FBIS4-4741 "dreas065_a_94015" FBIS-EAS-94-065 Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Aide Denies Resignation Rumor Aide Denies Resignation Rumor OW0504151794 Tokyo KYODO in English 1502 GMT 5 Apr 94 OW0504151794 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 5 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa expressed his desire Tuesday to quit as head of government after about eight months in office, two lawmakers said. The premier made the remark at a dinner meeting with Kiyoshi Nishikawa and Yasushi Shimomura, both of the Niin Club, a tiny political grouping in the House of Councillors, the two legislators told reporters. However, an aide to Hosokawa denied the reported remark, saying, "the premier is saying he did not state such a thing." During the two-hour meeting Hosokawa remarked with a straight face that he wants to quit as premier, Shimomura said. Shimomura said he told the premier to step down if he wishes to. Nishikawa, however, said he took the remark as a joke. "It is unthinkable for a person in such a responsible position to make such a careless comment," Nishikawa said. Hosokawa's reported resignation remark comes at a time when the Diet's budget negotiations remain paralyzed due to a gulf between the ruling coalition parties and the opposition camp over Hosokawa's questionable personal finances. Dismissing allegations about his 100 million yen loan from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin Co., a scandal-torn delivery firm, Hosokawa has spurned demands by the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to summon a former aide who was in charge of his finances. The LDP, toppled from government last summer after nearly four decades of rule, has refused to participate in Diet deliberations on the budget for fiscal 1994, which started last Friday. While the deposed party suspects the loan was an undeclared political donation, Hosokawa insists he repaid the money in full, with interest, by January 31, 1991. Political sources said the chances for an early start on the key budget debate are slim, predicting the stalemate to last through next week. After returning to his official residence, Hosokawa told reporters his talks with the two legislators were a joy and did not touch on his alleged remark. Hosokawa is scheduled to meet reporters at his official residence at around 12:20 A.M. Wednesday, officials said. The prime minister is expected to deny reports that he expressed his desire Tuesday to quit as prime minister, political sources said.
