The PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution] was skeptical of the magistrate's work and his being able to clarify the murder of the Institutional Revolutionary Party presidential candidate. The PRD has argued Montes is a friend of President Salinas and that does not guarantee the success of his mission. [passage omitted]
