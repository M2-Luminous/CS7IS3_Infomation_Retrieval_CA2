Agreement was reached on the resumption of the Gaza-Jericho talks next Tuesday, and progress was made on most of the issues on the agenda. The Cairo talks ended last night and the Israeli delegation is now on its way home. It will report to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin at noon. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports from our Tel Aviv studio: A short time ago, an Israeli source very involved in the Cairo talks, told us that a breakthrough or at last progress was made in Egypt, which will permit the resumption of the Gaza-Jericho talks next Tuesday. Progress was made on issues which can be grouped under the term Palestinian security problems, which surfaced due to the Hebron massacre, especially on the establishment and deployment of a Palestinian police force in Hebron. The force will be linked to the Palestinian police force to be set up in Gaza and Jericho whose establishment has already been agreed on. It will be associated in some way with the Hebron Municipality, but will be operationally subordinate to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. That was the main problem under discussion this past week and once it has been resolved, the talks can now focus on the resumption of the Gaza-Jericho talks. The police force will be made up of several dozen Palestinian policemen, which as far as is known, will be armed with revolvers for self-defense. They will conduct joint patrols with the IDF and the foreign observers Israel is prepared to have deployed in Hebron. The prime minister said yesterday that the talks between Israel and Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan will resume in late April, unrelated to the talks with the PLO. We can therefore state that the peace talks are making a great stride forward along all tracks.
