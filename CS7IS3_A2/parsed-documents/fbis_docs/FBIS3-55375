This was said at a briefing today by Grigoriy Karasin, director of the department of information and the press of the Russian Foreign Ministry, in connection with the latest statements by some Lithuanian politicians who have called for the "demilitarization" and "deoccupation" of Kaliningrad Oblast, for a review of its international status, and for it to be removed from Russia by forming on its territory "a new Baltic republic integrated into the structures of Northern Europe." In connection with this the Russian diplomat recalled that the decision of the Potsdam Conference on transferring Kaliningrad Oblast to the Soviet Union was final and without any time limit. The territorial possession of the oblast by the Soviet Union and consequently by Russia was subsequently laid down in the treaty on the final settlement in relation to Germany of 12 September 1990 and the treaty on good-neighborliness, partnership, and cooperation between the USSR and the FRG of 9 November 1990. "Thus, juridically and by right of morality and history Kaliningrad Oblast is an inalienable, integral part of Russia, and Russia will not permit a review of the international legal acts establishing and confirming its present status," he stressed.
