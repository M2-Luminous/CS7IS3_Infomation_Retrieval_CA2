The most surprising omission from the list was ANC [African National Congress] Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa who, failing to win the position of deputy president under Mandela, apparently chose to have no post at all, but perhaps the toughest job went to veteran ANC leader Joe Slovo. He is nominated for the housing and welfare portfolio and, therefore, the man who will be expected to deliver on all the ANC's election promises. On the line to Johannesburg, I asked him if he was not troubled by the enormity of the task ahead. [Begin recording] [Slovo] Well, it is certainly a worry I have that we might fail. You can never be absolutely certain of success, but it will not be for want of trying. You know, I would say that for me the 50 years of struggle was the easy part. Now, comes the very difficult, hard part, so we must have no illusions, but at the same time it has its own excitement, without dramatics, without heroics. You just have got to put roofs over people's heads. [Amosu] Some cynics have said that you have been given the hottest potato in the cabinet and while you have got enormously high personal stock with the ANC supporters at the moment, if you fail you will be the one to carry the can. The fact that you are the most prominent white member of the ANC will make it easy to explain it away, if you fail. [Slovo] Not really. In the first place, I have never been a populist. I have never undertaken any aspect of work or policy in order to sound popular, to get applause, and so on. I am grateful for the fact that I am valued by quite a lot of people and I do not believe I have been put into this position just because of that. I think somebody has to do it and I am honored that I have been asked to do it because it is one of the key portfolios. I am very well aware of the risks involved in trying to (?eat) this what you call the hot potato, but it is going to taste all the better for it at the end if I succeed in actually swallowing it. [Amosu] There are some people who have been saying that they are surprised about the line-up of the cabinet as a whole and that it seems to include a great many of what you might call the old guard and that younger, more militant members of the ANC -- the most obvious person who comes to mind is Cyril Ramaphosa -- simply are not represented in the kinds of numbers that people expected. What is your response to that? [Slovo] Well, look, each person in the ANC will have his or her own reaction to the bunch as a whole, but I think on the whole it must be regarded as a first shot. I am sure that, within a short time, when things come out in the (?wash), there will have to be a reshuffle of sorts. The group that President Mandela has appointed I think, for a start, should be able to manage the job. [Amosu] There has been a lot of surprise, though, about the exclusion -- apparently by his own choice -- of Mr. Ramaphosa. Should there be surprise? Were you not yourself expecting him to get opposed? [Slovo] It was an exclusion by Ramaphosa's own choice. I think Ramaphosa could have got any post in that cabinet that he would have opted for. I think he decided...[pauses] Imean, he did, I think, contest the deputy presidency but when that decision was taken, I think he decided that he would best serve the organization and the cause by staying as general secretary and concentrating on maintaining and building the ANC as a political organization. [Amosu] What will your first real hands-on practical measures be toward fulfilling your brief as the housing and welfare minister? [Slovo] Well, I think in the first place I will have to meet the people there. I will have to tell what I feel, which is they are in the most important ministry -- well, every minister is going to say this -- and that, really, if they and I succeed in only half our task in the coming year or two, we will have done more than has been done by 300 years of white regimes that preceded us but, of course, without money, without resources, motivation and inspiration is not enough. [Amosu] Are you confident that when you finally start getting into your battles with Mr. Keys and the Treasury to get the money to do this job, that it will be forthcoming? [Slovo] A whole future, and our past, is premised on being able to deliver up on our reconstruction and development program, and I think all ministries, including the Finance Ministry, will have to fit in with that objective.
