Sources in Beijing said police and hospital authorities had allowed the 35-year-old dissident, who has been staying at the 302 Military Hospital since early last year, more "freedom of movement". Two other dissidents are expected to be released or granted medical bail in the coming fortnight in an apparent effort by Beijing to secure Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trade status from Washington. According to the veteran human rights lobbyist, John Kamm, one of the three will be from outside Beijing. But officials from the Foreign Ministry and Justice Ministry have denied knowledge of any planned releases. Sources in the capital said yesterday that Wang, who had previously been confined to a well-guarded room, could now walk freely around the hospital. Moreover, his rights to visits by family members were now on a par with ordinary patients there. "Food and medical supplies for Wang have generally improved, and the relative freedom of movement recently granted him could be a sign of his impending release," an informed source said in Beijing. The source said that when Wang, who was sentenced to 13 years in 1992 was transferred to the hospital, it was clear he would not be returning to prison. "It is not too big a step from letting Wang serve out the rest of his jail term in a hospital to granting him medical bail on humanitarian grounds," he said. Another candidate for medical bail is Bao Tong, once the principal secretary of the ousted party chief, Zhao Ziyang. Bao, 59, was given a seven-year sentence in 1992 for "counter- revolutionary instigation and propaganda". But since he was detained in May 1989, Bao has already served more than half of his term, which is a ground for magnanimity in the Chinese penal system. Dissident sources said the third candidate for early release might be the student leader, Liu Gang, or the Reverend Pei Zhongxun. Liu, who is serving the last two years of a six-year sentence at a prison in Liaoning province, was a prominent student leader in the 1989 democracy movement. Human rights organisations say Liu, 32, has been tortured in prison. Like Wang, Liu's name has appeared in most lists given by foreign governments to Beijing for consideration for early release. Pei an ethnic-Korean evangelical minister, was arrested in 1985 and given a 15-year term in a Shanghai prison for allegedly "spying for Taiwan". Sources in Shanghai said since he was in his mid-70s, the authorities might grant him medical bail. Western diplomats said of the three, the release of Wang, alleged to be a key organiser of the 1989 demonstrations, would have the most impact on both the American administration and Congress. In his Seattle "summit" with President Jiang Zemin last November, President Bill Clinton mentioned Wang when they discussed human rights. Meanwhile, Mr Kamm said in Hong Kong yesterday the Chinese authorities had told him earlier this month "a few tens" of dissidents were under investigation or awaiting trial.
