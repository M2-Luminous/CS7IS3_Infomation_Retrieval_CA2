Question: What are the main principles and tasks of the Russian president in 1994? Answer: The domineering prerequisite of stability in 1994 is the new Russian Constitution. I would like to point out that the Constitution is reliably protected by the free will of the people and that the president, as a guarantor of the Constitution, has a reliable mechanism for its protection. The main political task of President Boris Yeltsin is the realisation of the new Constitution both in the Russian state system and relying on basic democratic provisions of the Constitution. Question: What will the president's relations with the Federal Assembly rely on? Answer: In its relations with the Federal Assembly the president will act in alliance with all political forces interested in the protection of Russia's interests and the development of its reforms. The character of this interaction will depend on an extent to which political parties and blocs represented in the Federal Assembly show respect for Russia's constitutional will and on what lessons participants in a political dialogue learned from past experience. Rejecting the practice of confrontation, the president is prepared to take advantage of all powers granted to him by the Constitution to defend democracy, reforms, Russia's integrity and stability. Question: What do you believe to be main priorities of Russia's state policy in 1994? Answer: In the economic policy, priority will be given to strengthening factors of financial stability, curbing inflation rates, strengthening the rouble and giving support to a sound industrial base. In the social policy, the emphasis will be laid on the protection of the population from criminals and the creation of fair and worthy conditions for honest and peaceful labour. Undoubtedly, the Russian foreign policy will lay the emphasis on the protection of Russia's national interests, the rights of the Russian and the Russian-speaking population in the framework of international law and proceeding from the idea of national solidarity.
