Meler said: "During the conversations with Lithuanians I have noticed well-grounded doubts about whether the treaty really will change relations between our countries or whether it will merely be a paper. Everything will depend on the "political will". "All the articles of the treaty on the national minorities make a solid background for the normalization of our relations, in the psychological aspect in particular. We managed to avoid formulations in the treaty which could stipulate irritation or show the superiority of one country over the other", Meler said. "The realization of the treaty which will be signed for 15 years and then automaticaly expanded, will depend on the political benevolence of the both states", Meler noted. It is admitted in the article that the preparation of the treaty with Lithuania, the last neighbour with which Poland did not have any document, was long and complicated. It was protracted because Lithuanians demanded that the so-called occupation of Vilnius region in the inter-war period by Poland should be condemned in the treaty.
