FR940826-2-00092 FR940826-2-00055 United States of America, Plaintiff, v. Western Electric Company, Inc. and American Telephone and Telegraph Company, Defendants. Civil Action No. 82&hyph;0192 HHG. Memorandum Of The United States In Response To The Bell Companies Motions For Generic Wireless Waivers Introduction The United States submits this memorandum in response to three motions by the Bell Companies for generic wireless relief: 1. The United States would support, if modified, that portion of the motion, dated June 20, 1994, of the Bell Companies for a waiver of the interexchange line of business restriction of Section II(D)(1) of the Decree 1 in connection with their ``cellular and other wireless services'' (the ``BOCs' Motion''), 2 which seeks the authority to provide interexchange services between cellular exchanges subject to equal access. A proposed order is attached to this memorandum. 1 Modification of Final Judgment, United States v. American Telephone & Tel. Co., 552 F. Supp. 131 (D.D.C. 1982) (``Decree Opinion''), aff'd sub nom. Maryland v. United States, 460 U.S. 1001 (1983). 2 The record before the Department on the Bell Companies' motion was submitted to the Court with the Bell Companies' June 20, 1994, filing. The principal ``wireless'' service here at issue is cellular telephony, sometimes referred to by the Court, Congress or the Federal Communications Commission as ``mobile radio,'' ``land mobile radio'' or, most recently, as ``commercial mobile radio service.'' 47 U.S.C. 332(d)(1), as amended. The term ``cellular,'' describing a radio telephone service in which frequency is reused by dividing a service area into ``cells,'' also describes the technology of services that might come to be offered by potential newcomers to these markets (i.e., licensees of special mobile radio (``SMR'') or personal communications services (``PCS'') spectrum). However, for simplicity, the mobile and portable radio telephone service today provided by two licenses in each geographic area is referred to in this memorandum as ``cellular'' service, as distinguished from SMR or PCS services. Other wireless services, specifically paging and radiolocation, are discussed below at pp. 42&hyph;45. 2. The United States opposes at this time that portion of the BOCs' Motion that seeks to redraw the existing cellular exchange areas to include Rand McNally's Major Trading Area (``MTA''), and adding to those MTAs all prior geographic relief. The United States would support the BOCs' request for certain incidental relief, if clarified, and the attached proposed order contains those clarifications. 3. The United States opposes the motions by BellSouth, dated April 15, 1994, and Southwestern Bell, dated June 20, 1994, to remove Section II(A)'s equal access requirement and Section II(D)(1)'s interexchange prohibition, as applied to their wireless services. All seven BOCs sought that broader relief_the complete removal of the equal access requirement and the interexchange prohibition_in their waiver request filed with the Department on December 13, 1991. The United States opposes this relief because none of the BOCs can make the showing required to remove or modify the decree's equal access requirements. 3 After extensive investigation and analysis, the Department has determined that the removal of equal access would substantially reduce competition in interexchange services from cellular exchanges, but that provision of resold switched interexchange services subject to rigorous equal access conditions would not be likely to reduce competition, and so advised the BOCs by letter dated June 14, 1994 (copy attached as Exh. 1; exhibits separately bound). 3 As the United States has advised the Court, the legal staff of the Antitrust Division advised the BOCs in May 1993 that it would recommend against removal of equal access, and the BOCs then chose to pursue a waiver limited to line-of-business relief. Memorandum of the United States in Opposition to Motion of BellSouth Corporation for Generic Wireless Relief, pp. 4&hyph;5 (Apr. 29, 1994). Thus, there was no request for removal of equal access from BOC cellular exchanges pending when BellSouth or Southerwestern Bell filed their instant motions. Nonetheless, the Department's investigation and analysis of the BOCs' requests has given it ample basis to oppose these motions on the merits, even though these motions are, as the Court has recognized, procedurally improper. Order, July 8, 1994, at 4 & n.2. Summary of Argument Simply put, BellSouth and Southwestern seek to terminate their cellular exchange subscribers' ability to obtain interexchange service from competing interexchange carriers, and to require those subscribers instead to obtain that service from the exchange carrier_subject only to whatever competitive constraint is provided by the existence of a second cellular carrier. The Department concluded that that minimal constraint was insufficient to prevent a reduction of competition in cellular long distance. To the contrary, the market power of each cellular duopolist appears to be sufficient to permit supracompetitive pricing of cellular service; allowing a cellular carrier to provide interexchange service on an exclusive basis would permit that carrier to charge supracompetitive pricing for interexchange services as well. The BOCs' unconstrained ability to abuse control of the local exchange provides additional means to impede competition in interexchange services for cellular customers. See pp. 6&hyph;26 below. If, however, a BOC or its affiliate were to be one of several interexchange carriers available to be chosen by a celluar subscriber, the presence of that additional choice does not appear likely to result in higher prices for long distance_provided that genuine equal access is preserved. If the arrangements under which the exchange carrier provides access were not in fact equal, were discriminatory, or were administered to give the BOCs' own long distance service a significant advantage, the likely effect would be that other interexchange competitors would be excluded unfairly from competing for that business. As a result, absent genuine equal access, the Department is not persuaded that BOC entry into cellular long distance from their cellular exchanges would not reduce competition in the market they seek to enter. Whether genuine equal access can be preserved when a BOC is providing access to itself and to its competitors is probably the most difficult issue presented here. 4 The Department believes that genuine equal access can exist in this situation, and has attempted to define the appropriate equal access arrangements where a Bell Company stands on both sides of the equal access interface. The BOCs have said that certain of these safeguards are acceptable to them, and have asked the Department to explain others. 5 The United States conditions its support for the BOCs' motion on these additional safeguards because, without them, the requested relief does not pass muster under Section VIII(C) of the Decree. See pp. 29&hyph;40 below. 4 The Court has recognized the dangers of allowing a BOC to provide access to itself and to its competitors. E.g., United States v. Western Elec. Co., 1986&hyph;1 Trade Cas. Â¶ 66,987, at 62,061 (D.D.C. 1986) (``once a Regional Company is permitted to offer VSR services that are accessed through its own exchange network, it will have every incentive to design the exchange system in a manner that disadvantages suppliers of competing VSR service''). 5 See Memorandum of the Bell Companies in Support of their Motion for a Modification of Section II of the Decree to Permit Them To Provide Cellular and other Wireless Services Across LATA Boundaries, June 20, 1994 (``BOC Mem.''), at 15&hyph;19.
