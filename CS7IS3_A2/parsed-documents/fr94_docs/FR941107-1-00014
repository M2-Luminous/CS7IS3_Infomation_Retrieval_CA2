FR941107-1-00014 FR941107-1-00006 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;132&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; British Aerospace Model Avro 146&hyph;RJ70A and &hyph;RJ85A Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain British Aerospace Model Avro 146&hyph;RJ70A and &hyph;RJ85A series airplanes. This proposal would require an inspection to identify and remove certain cable terminals on the auxiliary power unit (APU) starter circuit and installation of certain new cable terminals. This proposal is prompted by a report that, during an inspection of the cable terminals on the APU starter circuit, incorrect cable terminals were found installed on these airplanes. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to ensure the installation of correct starter cable terminals in the APU; incorrect cables could lead to the inability of the pilot to start the APU when needed in a situation of loss of other electrical power sources. DATES: Comments must be received by January 4, 1995. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;132&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.
