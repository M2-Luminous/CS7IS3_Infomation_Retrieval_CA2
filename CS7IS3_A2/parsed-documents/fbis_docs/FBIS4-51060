For this reason, the reporter asked a young police officer whether he had ever found such a situation scary? He said with a smile: "When I first came to work here, I felt somewhat tense but now, I am quite used to it." A philosopher once said: "Labor is the most beautiful thing in the world." What does labor mean to criminals who have been deprived of their freedom? Having visited prisons in Shanghai and Shandong, people found that labor has transformed the world and men have transformed themselves through labor; those who used to reap without sowing can see that social wealth does not come easily; those who used to love ease and hate work now experience the joy of "reaping what one has sown"; and those who used to start trouble can see how precious is cooperation in solidarity. The Chinese Government and its law enforcement organizations hold the view that labor is one of the basic means for transforming criminals and has corrected their bad habits through labor. However, China opposes the practice of penalizing criminals by means of labor or torturing and ill-treating them through hard labor. Li Dezhu, now serving his sentence at Shanghai No. 7 Transformation Through Labor Unit, used to work at the Grain Bureau in Shanghai's Jingan District. He told this reporter that labor in the unit was mostly in mechanized operations and it was not at all tiring to work there. If someone overfulfilled his work quota, he would be given a bonus, to a maximum of 50 yuan a month, and the food was not bad either. The Shanghai Administration for Transformation Through Labor requires all prisons to give work assignments to inmates according to their skills when making work arrangements. The inmates enjoy the same treatment as workers and staffers in state-owned enterprises regarding not working festivals and holidays as well as labor protection and allowances for heatstroke prevention are given to them during the hot season. Shandong Provincial Prison is undergoing experiments with the five-day week work system; the inmates must purchase labor protective items at some appointed stores, where products meeting the requirements are supplied. Should an accident take place at work, the case will not be closed until the cause and responsibility have been clarified and problems arising from the accident resolved. Currently, the behavioral points system [ji fen kao he zhi du 6060 0433 5072 2702 0455 1653] is universally implemented in Chinese prisons. The system links the inmate's work accomplishments, attitude in admitting his or her crime, and conditions in transformation to increase or commute the penalty in order to conduct a quantitative assessment. Hence, there has been an increase in the inmates' enthusiasm for labor with competition in labor being developed. Some inmates who are found to be satisfactory in their transformation have been sent outside the prison to work, engage in farming, or to study on a trial basis so that they might be closer to the "outside world." With social and economic development, there has been an increase in the number of economic criminal cases of embezzlement and accepting bribes. Most of the inmates in this category had intermediate or senior professional titles and were staffers in economic management. Aiming at their characteristics of being physically weak, Shanghai Municipal Administration for Transformation Through Labor put forward the principle of "educating and transforming men, nurturing and salvaging qualified people," to exploit the inmates' intelligence and encourage them to participate in invention and creation. In the seventh national "Spark Cup" competition for creations and inventions held in 1993, Shanghai's prisons won seven awards for their projects; six projects, including "Star Wars Chess" and "Automatic Rainproof Clothes Drying Rack" were awarded certificates for patent rights from the State Patent Bureau. The inmates not only enjoy the rights to the inventions but will also receive rewards from the transfer of patents; at the same time, they will be granted commutation of their sentence. "We must open broad avenues for able people and recruit them without overstressing qualifications." This has actually been achieved in Chinese prisons. Quite a few skillful craftsmen can give play to their skills and mental labor is respected; those who have professional titles at and above intermediate levels are given monthly allowances. The inmates are unprecedentedly active in participating in technical training and studies. Shandong Universally has developed assessment through discussion for technical professional titles. One of the inmates received a senior technical professional title while in prison, creating a precedent in China's history of transforming criminals.
