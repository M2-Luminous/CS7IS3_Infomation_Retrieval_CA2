The challenge came at the end of a five-day regional drug control workshop attended by Miss Andrea Bryan, Acting Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Health, Drug Abuse Prevention and Rehabilitation. The workshop, held in Barbados on 21-25 March, was entitled "Master Plan Development and Co-ordination Mechanisms." It was held under the auspices of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP). Miss Bryan attended it in preparation for development of Cayman's plan on drug abuse prevention and control. After the workshop, Miss Bryan said that the main consensus of the 24 participating countries was that production, trafficking, use and abuse of legal and illegal drugs is a growing social problem worldwide. The Caribbean with its scores of islands and cays continued to be vulnerable to intrusions of illegal drug trafficking. "Although the Caribbean itself produces relatively little illicit drugs, we are in the path of suppliers and consumers," she said. Miss Bryan said that the Ministry was optimistic about the impact of the plan being developed. Although drug abuse might be difficult--or even impossible--to eradicate, education and rehabilitation could serve as powerful forces to turn round the situation in Cayman. One of the benefits of the workshop, Miss Bryan said, was the commitment by participants to exchange information and share resources to help each other develop national plans. Inter-sectoral collaboration within each country was deemed critical. Education, Customs, Police, Immigration and other sectors, as well as non-governmental organisations, needed to work together. "Each hand must know what the other is doing," she emphasised. Part of the workshop included role playing by representatives to demonstrate development of a master plan for an imaginary state, "This was a very useful exercise and gave us an idea of what our own country's master plan should cover," Miss Bryan said. Donor agencies gave presentations on sources of funds for drug abuse prevention programmes and presentations on projects being undertaken in the region.
