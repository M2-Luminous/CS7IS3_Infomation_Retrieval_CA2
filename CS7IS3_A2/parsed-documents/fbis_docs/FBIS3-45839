The officials said this figure is 85 percent up from 1992, and represents 60 percent of the province's agricultural and industrial output value in that year. In 1993 the province's village and township industrial enterprises produced an industrial value of 68.7 billion yuan, exported 17 billion yuan-worth of goods and contributed a total of eight billion yuan to the state coffers in taxes, the officials noted. According to the officials, the shareholding system has proved to be especially suitable for rural enterprises. In 1993 the province registered 19,000 rural joint stock companies with a total capital of more than 10 billion yuan. In Zhangzhou city alone over 4,000 stock companies were launched in 1993, representing 80 percent of the newly-formed rural enterprises. They boast a total registered capital of 800 million yuan. Over the past year, while launching 1,800 joint ventures with overseas businesses, rural enterprises in the province also started 31 ventures abroad, the officials said. In 1993 rural enterprises received 800 million U.S. dollars of overseas investment, which accounted for 40 percent of their total capital input in the year. They also gained 3.9 billion yuan in investment from other Chinese regions. In the same period rural enterprises formed 94 group companies and launched 700 industrial development areas. One of them, the Fuxing Development Area on the outskirts of this provincial capital, has 132 projects in operation or under construction. Supported by 300 million U.S. dollars in contracted overseas investment, its production value is expected to reach one billion yuan a year. The officials said rural enterprises have greatly boosted the economies of the rural areas and increased the incomes of farmers. The province now has 69 villages each with an annual production value of 100 million yuan.
