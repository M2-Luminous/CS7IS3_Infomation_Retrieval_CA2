[Ruehe] My precisely formulated proposal has been presented. In it, I concretely mention a reduction to 340,000 men, whose number, however, can be increased to an internationally stipulated maximum strength of 370,000 men in the structures. [Bruessel] Will military service be reduced to 10 months? [Ruehe] We want to differentiate here. For service in the main defense forces, a compact basic military service of 10 months without service compensation time like in France is useful and sufficient. However, for voluntary service in the crisis-reaction forces, at least 12 months are required. [Bruessel] Will the Bundeswehr still be operational in the future? [Ruehe] Only with my approach will we get the financial scope for the strengthening and modernization of the armed forces. [Bruessel] Does Chancellor Kohl approve of your concept? [Ruehe] I discussed my ideas with the chancellor at a very early stage, and we agree on the outlines of the Bundeswehr's further development.
