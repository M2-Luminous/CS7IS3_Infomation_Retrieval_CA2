[Movahedian-'Attar] The Czech Republic and the Islamic Republic of Iran are traditional and amicable partners. As you know, political and economic relations between the two countries began to flourish after 1930 and have continued to grow during the subsequent decades. Many Czech businessmen and enterprises, including Skoda, entered the Iranian market before World War II and gradually acquired a good name and reputation for themselves. The two countries import all sorts of goods and commodities from each other and they have been technical partners for a long time. The Islamic Republic of Iran, which has prepared a number of large and small projects worth almost $0.5 billion, is now considered to be the Czech Republic's most major technical partner. It is to be expected that in the future the volume of these projects could exceed more than $1.0 billion. The largest Czech project in Iran is the construction of an aluminum plant worth more than $300 million. It is also apparent that the Czech Republic -- in view of its current economic circumstances -- would like to be active in the Iranian arms market. I think that a more substantial partnership is rather unlikely in this regard, because Iran -- which is giving priority to its economic strategy -- has, compared with its annual gross domestic product, the smallest military budget of the 15 countries in the Middle East. Moreover, during the past 15 years, my country has managed to establish its own successful military industry, which enables it -- to a certain extent -- to satisfy the army's needs, and we are even capable of exporting some things. We get the other most up-to-date and technologically exacting components -- as previously -- from the "Big Five." In conclusion, Czech weapons are among the obsolete categories of Russian military hardware, which are unable to compete on the current saturated world market. It is obvious that the two countries are determined to follow the path of traditional, good cooperation that existed in the past and to keep in step in their relations. Understandably, the main stress will continue to be placed on the technical and economic character of this cooperation. [passage omitted]
