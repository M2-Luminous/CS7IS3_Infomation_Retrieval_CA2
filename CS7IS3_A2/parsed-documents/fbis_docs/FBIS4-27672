The annual phytosanitary meeting, the fifth of its kind, deals with technical issues like pest control and treatments for agricultural and forestry products whose overseas shipments have been banned because of pests or diseases. At the meeting, the Korean side is expected to ask the United States to issue import permits for four kinds of Korean fruits and seven sorts of vegetables. Among the requested items are apples, unshu oranges (tangerines), persimmons, including sweet ones, and kiwis along with cucumbers, Oriental melons, watermelons and squashes, according to an NPQS official. Under the provision of the International Plant Protection Convention, plants and plant products exported to foreign countries are subject to inspection if there are harmful pests and diseases and then the phytosanitary certificate is issued. The U.S. side is expected to ask for Korea to import American-produced pine lumber, apples and Hawaiian papayas, according to the official. In February this year, the Korean side presented to the United States' Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) plans to control the three kinds of pests and diseases affecting Korean apples that the U.S. side had raised as reasons for banning imports of the fruit from Korea.
