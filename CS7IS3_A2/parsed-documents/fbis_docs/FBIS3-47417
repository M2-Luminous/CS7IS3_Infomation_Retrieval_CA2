He is trying to get in touch with North Korea through a friend outside his party and studying the possibility of meeting with a North Korean representative during a visit to Beijing around Jan. 20, according to people close to him. His announcement on Wednesday morning that he wanted to visit North Korea in the new year was not idle talk, they said, but the manifestation of a strong desire to improve inter-Korean relations by meeting with President Kim Il-song. When the plan is ready for realization, he will consult fully with the government, they added. "I understand that he has not yet discussed his plan with the North Koreans," one source said. Another source said Yi was discussing with the Chinese Government a plan to visit Beijing next week. "The date of the visit may change because the schedule for his meetings with Chinese leaders has not been set," he added. Democratic Party Spokesman Pak Chi-won denied that Yi will visit Beijing around Jan. 20, but said a friend was in Beijing to arrange a trip to China. Commenting on the reactions of some Democratic Liberal Party leaders to Yi's announcement that he wants to visit Pyongyang, Pak said that they did not understand the proper role of an opposition leader in the effort for national unification. "I hope that the government and its party will remember that President Kim Yong-sam made a similar announcement when he was in the opposition," Pak said.
