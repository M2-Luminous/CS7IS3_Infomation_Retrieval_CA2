Our party's line for building a self-reliant national economy is the embodiment of chuche ideology in economic construction and is a policy for building an economy that is not subjugated to others, but marches by itself, serves its people, and develops with its own country's resources and the might of the people. It is not easy to implement the line for building a self-reliant national economy. Our people had to build the economy anew on an empty field where everything was destroyed and have firmly adhered to the line for building a self-reliant national economy even under the circumstance of carrying on socialist construction while constantly facing the imperialists' invasion threat. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is wisely leading us today to firmly maintain the line for building a self-reliant national economy, even while socialist construction is progressing at a high level. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has pointed out: Only when we build a self-reliant economy that marches by itself based on modern technology, can we firmly guarantee an independent and creative working and material lifestyle for the people, achieve chuche in ideology, independence in politics, self-reliance in defense, and strengthen the country's independence. We cannot think of the great results and victory achieved in revolution and construction by our people in recent years without the dear comrade leader's wise leadership in the implementation of the line for building a self-reliant national economy. The line for building a self-reliant national economy is vigorously displaying its correctness and vitality in our country today. The invincible vitality of our party's line for building a self-reliant national economy is represented, above all, by the fact that the country's political independence is firmly defended. Political independence is the very life of a sovereign and independent country. Such important political independence is guaranteed by a self-reliant national economy. A self-reliant economy is a material guarantee for achieving political independence. The serious situation in which socialism was recently frustrated in many countries shows that political independence cannot be achieved without a self-reliant economy. These countries were economically bound to big countries because they failed to build a self-reliant economy earlier, and as a result, they could not establish self-reliance in every aspect, but kept following others' modifications, thus spoiling the revolution. Under the wise leadership of the party and the leader, our people have always firmly defended political independence by building a self-reliant national economy. It is our party and people's firm stance and will that we cannot concede national dignity and interest to anyone and that there is nothing to be afraid of. Thanks to the strong and self-reliant economy, our party and people are able to independently establish a line and policy in conformity with our own demands, implement with our own might, and exercise the rights as an independent country in a dignified manner with complete equality and sovereignty in the international arena. The invincible vitality of our party's line for building a self- reliant national economy lies in the fact that it ceaselessly strengthens the country's material and technological base and accelerates economic development at a high speed. To strengthen the country's material and technological base and to guarantee a high speed in the country's economic development is to build a self- reliant national economy. Only when we build a self-reliant economy can we develop a stable economy at a high speed and ceaselessly strengthen the country's material and technological base under all circumstances. Because the South Korean economy is a colonial subordination economy heavily relying on outside technology and resources, its base is weak and it is deteriorating into a bubble economy that is empty inside. By contrast, our economy is a powerful economy that enables us to live by our own efforts under all circumstances. The material and technological base of a self-reliant national economy built with our people's own power is very superior and continues to be consolidated. Modern plants and complexes are being built, and numerous monumental creations, such as the magnificent and splendid Sohae Lock Gate and Kwangbok and Tongil Streets, are being set up in our country. This clearly proves the superiority of our self-reliant economy. Thanks to powerful self-reliant economy, our party and our people, under all circumstances, are rapidly developing an economy based on a self-reliant economy. The imperialists and reactionaries are now persistently resorting to the political, military pressure and economic blockade to isolate and stifle our Republic, which is advancing under the uplifted banner of socialism. With the collapse of the socialist market of the world, we are faced with a new obstacle in external economic relations. Because there is a firm self-reliant national economy built with our own efforts, our people are developing an economy with initiative. Industrial output increased 50 percent and the average annual growth of industrial output reached 5.6 percent during the Third Seven-Year Plan. This clearly shows how rapidly our self-reliant economy continues to develop. The invincible vitality of our party's line for building a self-reliant national economy lies in the fact that it consistently promotes the people's standard of living and fully displays the superiority of socialism of our style. The basic purpose of socialist economic construction is to promote the people's standard of living. In order to fulfill this purpose, socialist construction should be done on the basis of self-reliance. Only a self-reliant economy can satisfactorily guarantee the people's increasing demand for goods and culture and can highly display the superiority of the socialist system. It is a matter of course that the people are not ensured with basic goods and cultural conditions in capitalist countries where economic activities only benefit the few of the privileged class, and in the countries where economic life is thoroughly dependent on monopolistic foreign capitalists. In our country, all the people choose occupations according to ability and propensity and enjoy life and happiness, free from any worries over clothes, food, and shelter. Our people are enjoying goods and cultural life under the benevolence of communism, such as free medical care and free compulsory education given by the party and the state. This is the true aspect of our society. In this way, in our country, the people's standard of living is getting higher as days go by and the superiority of socialism is fully displayed. These are unthinkable apart from our firm self-reliant national economy. Thanks to our country's superior self-reliant economy, the party and the state ensure happy life for the people. All of these facts clearly show the superiority of socialism of our own style to capitalism and are a proud reality brought forth by a self-reliant national economy. Today we are faced with the honorable, yet heavy, task to thoroughly carry out the revolutionary economic strategy set forth by the party. Only when the party's economic strategy is brilliantly implemented can the superiority of a self-reliant national economy be further strengthened and a new upturn be registered in the people's standard of living and socialist construction. All party members and working people, under the wise leadership of the party and the leader [suryong], should firmly adhere to the line for building a self-reliant national economy and thoroughly carry out the revolutionary economic strategy set forth by the party.
