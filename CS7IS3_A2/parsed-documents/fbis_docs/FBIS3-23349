Mario Aburto Martinez fired two shots, one directly at the head and the other at the abdomen. The first shot was fatal. Both bullets exited the body. The shots were fired with a special Brazilian-made, .38-caliber Taurus revolver. According to the expert's report, the weapon contained two unspent bullets and two spent caps. Mario Aburto Martinez was arrested at the scene of the incident and brought to Attorney General's Office [PGR] installations in Tijuana to make his first statements. He admitted being the perpetrator of this crime, which has shaken the Mexican republic. His statements were made before the Federal District Attorney General's Office in the presence of Lawyer Xavier Carbajal, president of the Emilio Orra Baja Bar Association of Tijuana, and before Jose Luis Perez Canchola, human rights ombudsman of Baja California State, in compliance with the provisions of the republic's Federal Constitution, thereby preserving the rights of the person responsible for this heinous crime. Aburto Martinez' health condition was also certified upon entering the judicial installations because he had already been beaten by people near him after he carried out the attack. This may be confirmed by the various media that witnessed the incident. The attack was carried out following a political event at the Lomas Taurinas Neighborhood in this border city. Also turned over to the Attorney General's Office were Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela and Jorge Antonio Sanchez Ortega, who may be released with legal conditions unless new elements arise that change their legal status. The assassin will be remanded in the next few hours and taken to a maximum-security location. I came to this city on the express orders of President Carlos Salinas and I have directly coordinated the investigation. I was accompanied by Rene Gonzalez de la Vega and Alfonso Cabrera Morales, assistant prosecutors for preliminary investigations, and by other officials and experts dedicated to the investigation and the complete clarification of this regrettable crime. Also working on the investigations was (Mario Fabio Beltrones), governor of Sonora State, where Colosio was born. The incidents occurred as follows: At the conclusion of the public rally that was part of his election campaign, Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, candidate for the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI], at 1710 stepped off the stage that had been constructed for the event in Lomas Taurinas and mingled with the people in attendance. He subsequently headed for his vehicle. After Colosio walked approximately 10 meters, Mario Aburto Martinez emerged from the crowd on Colosio's right-hand side. Martinez drew a revolver, placed it a few centimeters from Colosio's right temple, and pulled the trigger, causing the injury that took his life. After the bullet entered the right temple and exited through the left side, the victim spun around counterclockwise. As he was falling, the attacker fired his weapon again to produce a second wound in the abdominal region. The bullet entered [words indistinct] and left a wound on its way out near the right hypochondrium. This account of the events was duly and completely confirmed by eyewitness testimonies, by the results of the autopsy and a forensic histology, and by a ballistic study that established the position of the victim and the attacker and the trajectory of the projectiles. Mario Aburto Martinez was subdued by people who were around the victim, immediately arrested, and placed at the disposal of the Federal District Attorney General's Office. Based on this, it can undoubtedly be concluded that the two shots were fired by one person from one weapon whose cylinder contained two spent and two unspent cartridges. The former were next to each other. Aburto Martinez underwent the sodium [word indistinct] test to determine whether he had fired a firearm. This test proved positive. In his initial statement, Aburto Martinez confessed to firing the two shots at Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta. He did so, as we said, in the circumstances already described in the presence of two people who represented him, local lawyers, and the president of the Human Rights Commission. Mario Aburto Martinez, the 23- year-old perpetrator, is from Zamora, Michoacan. He has a primary school education and is an industrial mechanic. He said he has lived in Tijuana since he was 15 and has dedicated himself to working since that time. He confirmed that he was employed by Cameros Magneticos in Mesa de Otai and was domiciled in this city of Baja California. As for the weapon he used, he admitted acquiring it several weeks ago with the intention of using it for the incidents under investigation. He was arrested in the act and confessed to the crime with all the evidence against him. He will be remanded to the competent judicial authorities within the legally established time. The case is not fully closed. There are still questions which, according to the law, must be taken to their final answers. [passage omitted on coordination in justice process]
