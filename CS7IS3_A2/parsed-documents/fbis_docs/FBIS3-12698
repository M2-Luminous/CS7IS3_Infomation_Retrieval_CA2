His Majesty King Hassan II, may God render him victorious, has sent a cable of condolences to the Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat. The cable says: His Excellency and dear brother Mr. Yasir 'Arafat, head of the fraternal State of Palestine; We were taken aback by the news of the savage, terrible massacre, whose victims were a large number of our innocent Palestinian brothers in the occupied territories while they were performing the Dawn Prayers in the safe sanctuary of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque and on this Friday of the blessed month of Ramadan at the hands of criminals who were made by virtue of hatred and racism to commit the most ugliest of crimes and take mankind back to the dark ages. We strongly deplore this abominable and terrible massacre and strongly condemn its perpetrators and all those who participated in carrying it out by not taking the necessary precautions to avoid it. We beseech God Almighty to extend His mercy to the righteous martyrs and to grant you and their folks patience and condolences. We also request you to be the best interpreter of our feelings to their families and relatives. Signed: Your brother Hassan II, King of Morocco. In the same context the official spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation has stated that the Moroccan Kingdom has learned with deep sorrow the news of the Hebron massacre, which resulted in the death of scores of innocent Palestinians while they were performing their religious duties during the blessed month of Ramadan and at a place which is holy to all heavenly religions. The spokesman added that Morocco, while bowing with respect before the souls of the martyrs -- the victims of blind extremism -- strongly condemns this abominable crime carried out at a time when the international community was hoping to establish peace soon in the region and was devoting special attention to the recent Palestinian- Israeli agreement. The spokesman concluded by saying that Morocco, while appealing for the severe and resolute punishment of the perpetrators of this abominable crime and for putting an end to the escalation of violence, is of the opinion that such acts should be an incentive for the international community to mobilize to secure peace and security and the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.
