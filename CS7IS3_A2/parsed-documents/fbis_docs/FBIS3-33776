Our settlement affairs correspondent Gil Litman reports that the settlers go on to tell the prime minister: Do not force settlers who merely want to farm to turn into warriors fighting for their homes and lives. The settlers say they will not put up with such lethal blows and will not allow the establishment of a Palestinian corridor anywhere in the Jordan Valley.
