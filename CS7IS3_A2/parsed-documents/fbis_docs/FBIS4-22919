Lokteva; place and date of interview not given: ``Biolakt With an Emblem of Quality''] [Text] What pediatrician doesn't know today what Biolakt is? This baby food product has long been popular among both physicians and mothers. But its recognition at the state level occurred only today. The results of 30 years of work were finally noted, and a group of Kyrgyz scientists was awarded the republic's 1992 State Prize in science and engineering on the anniversary of the Kyrgyz Republic's establishment ``for creating children's dairy products of high biological value, for developing the production process, for their production and introduction into public health practice.'' Today we talk with one of the recipients of the prize--professor, Doctor of Medical Sciences Anatoliy Aleksandrovich Ilin. [Lokteva] To begin, in behalf of the newspaper I would like to congratulate you and your fellow workers--P. Fedorov, D. Kudayarov, V. Babich, V. Pavlinov, A. Knyazev, K. Sarzhanov and M. Kadyrov--on earning the award. And second, it would be interesting to hear from you that there is room for creative work in our long-suffering land. [Ilin] Of course. The health of children, after all, is a special problem. It is directly associated with the society's standard of living. Unfortunately over 1 million children being born today in all of the former USSR are being raised on formula. The number of women experiencing insufficient lactation is increasing. There are also those who are unable to lactate at all. Therefore providing children with complete nutrition is an important social task. As for us, the medical scientists, our specific task in science is to make children's dairy formulas as close as possible in their biological indicators to mother's milk. This problem was in fact the initial motivation for creating the product we are discussing here. [Lokteva] Let's remind the readers what Biolakt is. [Ilin] A cultured milk product made from specially selected physiological strains of lactic acid bacteria possessing pronounced antibacterial and proteolytic properties, and low acidity. Proteins, fats and carbohydrates in milk are broken down in the course of the vital activities of these bacteria. Vitamins, enzymes, antibacterial substances and free amino acids accumulate in the food product. It is the presence of such an intricate complex of biologically active substance that raises the food value of Biolakt, and makes it resemble mother's milk. The product has a positive effect on nonspecific and specific immunity, and it normalizes gastrointestinal activity. Biolakt is also recommend for children over 1 year old, and as a therapeutic diet for patients with intestinal infections. It can be used for therapeutic purposes in the presence of gastritis, gastric ulcers, colitis and hepatocholecystitis. [Lokteva] As I understand it, studies were conducted on Biolakt with the purpose of enriching it with vitamins and microelements lacking in mother's milk. [Ilin]Yes, the choice of microelement compounds was important in this sense as well. Readily dissociating compounds were the most suitable from our point of view. Enriching the cultured milk product with lysozyme, which not only preserves mother's milk but is also compatible in qualitative composition with microflora of the child's intestine, is also useful. [Lokteva]Are different varieties of Biolakt now being produced in this connection? [Ilin]We have developed four varieties of the product. Adapted Biolakt and adapted Biolakt with lysozyme, intended for children in the first months of life; they are especially recommended for children who are weak and often sick. Plain Biolakt and enriched Biolakt are products for children in the second half-year of life. And in general, Biolakt products have therapeutic and preventive value when given to sick children over 1 year old. Especially when anemia, gastrointestinal and septic diseases, dysbacteriosis and lactase deficiency are present. [Lokteva]Let's get back to the prize. Were you able to earn it just by doing scientific research? [Ilin]Not only that. The most important thing was that we developed the technical conditions and parameters of producing the cultured milk product. For example we were able to establish that when copper sulfate and ascorbic acid are added to the solution simultaneously, the concentration of the latter in the food product decreases by 30 percent. On the other hand, were these substances to be added separately, after chelation of the copper with protein, vitamin C would be retained completely in the product. This is not to mention the fact that production factors affect the energy of acid formation, the mucus-forming ability of lactic acid bacteria, their reproduction, and antibiotic and proteolytic capacity. [Lokteva]Was it these technological developments that permitted you to organize production? [Ilin]All four varieties of Biolakt are now being produced in all cities and rayons of Kyrgyzstan, as well as 12 countries of the former USSR. But most importantly, a biological factory for industrial production of bacterial leaven used to make Biolakt in dairy shops, dairy kitchens and in the home has begun operating in Bishkek. Mass production of Biolakt will make it possible to reduce the shortage of baby foods at all levels. The cultured milk product can now be available to practically every mother in dry form. When necessary, it would be enough to transform the dry leaven into liquid form, according to the instructions of course, and then mix the latter with milk, after which this fabulous baby food is ready. Today. the Bishkek biological factory, which has an easily remembered address--Chuy Prospekt, 304--can satisfy the demand of youngsters in all of the former Union. I am announcing this to you officially.
