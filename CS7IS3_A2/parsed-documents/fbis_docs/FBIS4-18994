This was stated by Yiannis Sakellariou, one of the most important deputies in the European Parliament (EP) from Austria's point of view, in an interview with DER STANDARD on Thursday [7 April]. According to the Bavarian Social Democratic Party of Germany official--who is of Greek descent--"85-90 percent of the deputies welcome the enlargement." In the EP's Foreign Policy Committee, Sakellariou is "rapporteur" on Austria's EU entry -- that is, he is responsible for working out all legal questions. Only two weeks ago, he was rather pessimistic as a result of the EU internal controversy on the blocking minority and the British stalemate on the issue. The EP would "certainly not have supported" a de facto lowering of the veto threshold in the Council, Sakellariou said. Yet now, "the last hurdle" has been overcome. Sakellariou now believes that the only remaining possibility for a failure of the vote on Austrian accession is that there might not be a "quorum" in the EP on 4 May. The quorum requires the presence of more than half of all deputies, at least 260 of the 518. Even if he regards it as unlikely that such an "embarrassing situation" might really occur in view of a decision that is of such significance for the Union, one will have to try very hard to call the European deputies to Strasbourg. "After all, there are insecurities," Sakellariou said. "More than one-third of the deputies will resign from parliament after the 12 June European election." It is hard to anticipate how many of them will meet their political obligation. Moreover, there are differing situations in the various countries. The majority of the Italian Eurodeputies have meanwhile lost their party, "because these parties have ceased to exist." One day before the vote on enlargement, national elections will be held in the Netherlands. There is, of course, great interests for them "among our colleagues from the Netherlands." Regional elections will be held in Britain. Despite many imponderabilities, Sakellariou is optimistic that some 350 deputies will show up. In the EP there are obviously no problems on substance regarding Austria's accession that might point to a negative vote. A motion for a resolution, which has widely been completed by the Foreign Policy Committee, and which should be adopted along with the membership resolution assesses as "absolutely positive" the result of the negotiations in Brussels. Particular mention is made of the "historic effects of the enlargement for Austria and the Union." Austria is expected to be "a faithful partner" in the Union.
