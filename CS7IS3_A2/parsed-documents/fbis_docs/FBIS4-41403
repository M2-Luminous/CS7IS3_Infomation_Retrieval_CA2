For a long time Russia was a force that united the former republics of the USSR, and it has no moral right to disregard their problems now. This was the leitmotiff of the hearings on international cooperation in support of peace in conflict zones on CIS territory organized by a number of State Duma committees, including on CIS affairs, on relations with compatriots abroad, on defence and international affairs. Representatives of CIS member-countries and Western diplomats in Moscow showed keen interest in the conference because of the urgency of its themes. Russian scientists, historians and diplomats who took part in the hearings noted that Russia was the only force capable of resolving armed conflicts in CIS countries. They said international organisations, such as the United Nations and the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe, were not very helpful. Therefore Russia has to move quickly and resolutely to put an end to armed conflicts and arrange for peaceful negotiations between the warring parties.
