FR940114-1-00072 FR940114-1-00016 (4) Provide for different management in the jurisdictional areas of the two councils. (5) Permits: a. provide for a Federal permit for wild live rock harvest and possession; b. provide for a Federal permit for possession and harvest of live rock from aquaculture; and c. provide for a Federal permit to take prohibited live rock for scientific and educational purposes. The South Atlantic Council's Habitat and Environmental Protection Committee prefers a prohibition on harvest and possession of live rock on implementation of Amendment 2, possibly as early as 1994. The Gulf Council prefers to allow three years of continued harvest after implementation of Amendment 2 to allow additional time for harvesters to convert to aquaculture; subsequently, harvest and possession of live rock would be limited to persons with aquaculture permits. Timetable for SEIS Preparation and Decisionmaking Schedule The South Atlantic Council is holding public hearings on live rock management on January 5, 1994, in Savannah, Georgia, on January 6 in Duck Key, Florida, and on January 13 in Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina. The Gulf Council will hold hearings on January 11, in Pensacola, Florida, and on January 19, in Clearwater Beach, Florida. Specific times and locations are available from the Gulf Council listed above. The Gulf Council is scheduled to take action on the draft amendment and a draft SEIS at its January 19 meeting in Clearwater Beach, Florida. The South Atlantic Council is scheduled to take action on these draft documents at its February 7&hyph;11 meeting in St. Augustine, Florida. The draft SEIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection agency in February or March 1994 for public review and comment. Following a 45-day public comment period, a final SEIS will be prepared in support of the final Amendment 2 to be submitted by the Councils to the Secretary of Commerce for review and approval (expected by 1994). Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. Dated: January 10, 1994. Richard H. Schaefer, Director of Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
