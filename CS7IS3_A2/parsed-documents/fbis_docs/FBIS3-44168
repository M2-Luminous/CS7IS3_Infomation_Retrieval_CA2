An official who wished to remain unidentified said about 30 members had occupied the office's reception area by 3PM but "more are on the way". The ANC's northern Natal region has been riddled with division among the leadership, particularly after last year's elections in which former regional chairman Aaron Ndlovu was ousted and a number of trade unionists were installed in top positions. Among them is the new regional chairman Bheki Ntuli who, when telephoned about the sit-in on Tuesday, said: "Yes, there are problems, but let us handle them first." He could barely be heard above the noise from protesters in the office. The protesters' primary grievance was the "irregular" appointment of the new regional executive committee, said the official. He said there was a number of discrepancies in the November elections, including unfair lobbying and voting by unauthorized delegates. "The people here want fresh elections and are unhappy with the way elections were conducted last year," he said. Other demands included greater security for ANC members in the region and a halt to negotiations with the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP]. The new regional committee is dominated by perceived "moderates" who reportedly favour negotiations with the IFP in a region characterised by bloody political conflict. Internal tensions in northern Natal led to a commission of inquiry last year and intervention by ANC National Deputy Secretary Walter Sisulu earlier this year. The inquiry examined grievances about last year's regional elections and recommended they be declared null and void and the election be held again, according to a confidential ANC letter in SAPA's possession. However, the letter states that a "self-centred" and "malicious" member of the ANC's national working committee, had with "unbridled" ambition manipulated the recommendations and the newly elected committee remained intact. When Mr Sisulu stepped in it was agreed that a "reconciliation" committee, comprising three members of each of the opposing groups, oversee the running of the region and attempt to resolve the dispute, said SAPA's informant. "But the current regional committee is taking unilateral decisions and people are unhappy," he added. He said Tuesday's sit-in would continue until "our demands have been attended to".
