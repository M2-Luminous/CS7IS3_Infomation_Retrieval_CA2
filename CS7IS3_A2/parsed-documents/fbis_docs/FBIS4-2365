This was recently stated by Cheng Bulin, director of the Statistics Bureau of the Shanghai Municipal Government. Statistics show that the value of goods and service produced in Shanghai during the first quarter totalled 42 billion yuan (about five billion U.S. dollars according to current exchange rates) with a growth of 13.1 percent over the same period last year calculated in terms of comparable prices. The Pudong New Area has continued its high development speed with all of its economic quotas clearly higher than the city's average. As the pillar of the local economy, Shanghai's industry has seen overall sales topping 81 billion yuan and the rate of sales against production reaching 94 percent during the period. Cheng Bulin also said that local exports, once the burden of Shanghai's economic development, have made a fresh start this year with the export trade volume soaring to 1.7 billion U.S. dollars worth, a rise of 22.3 percent over the same period last year. The scale of foreign investment and the fields involved in it in Shanghai have both been expanded. Meanwhile, more overseas capital has poured into industrial and high-tech projects. State investment in fixed assets all over the city during the last three months was 7 billion yuan, a growth of 60 percent over the same period in 1993. Major infrastructural projects are going smoothly. Price-control measures implemented by the municipal government has effectively checked inflation and made shanghai's margin of increase of prices one of the lowest in the country's 35 large and medium-sized cities. Sound development of the local economy at the beginning of this year can be largely attributed to the firm foundation laid during economic flourishing in recent years and high demand for local investment. According to Cheng Bulin, deepening of reform in fields including finance, banking, housing and social insurance is expected to further invigorate the local economy. But Shanghai is also facing problems such as scarcity of floating funds, high prices of some key raw materials, increasing of loss- making enterprises and marketing snags with certain consumer products, the director said.
