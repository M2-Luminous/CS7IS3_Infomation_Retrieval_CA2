FR940513-0-00011 FR940513-0-00003 The FCA believes there is a greater potential for conflict for employees in having these types of relationships with borrowers because employees are in a position to have a more direct influence on the institution's dealings with the borrower. Also, since directors (except outside directors) are statutorily required to be borrower/stockholders, such a restriction could constitute an inappropriate restraint on the ability of directors to pursue their primary occupation. However, in light of the greater flexibility granted in the final regulation to define an exception to the prohibition on lending transactions, the Board believes that the institution can make appropriate distinctions in its policies to reflect the greater potential for conflict among employees and the impact of the prohibition on the ability of the director to pursue his or her primary occupation. Therefore, the final regulations make the prohibition for directors congruent with the employee prohibition by including ``financially obligated with'' transactions within the scope of the prohibition. See §612.2150 for discussion of the comments on this prohibition for employees. In addition, the final regulation expands the family loan transaction exception to include any person residing in the director's household and relies on recusal to prevent conflicts of interest. Accordingly, the recusal provision in §612.2140(a) is expanded to include any person residing in the director's household and to include a specific reference to business partners. Section 612.2145_Director Reporting The FCC believes the requirement to disclose the name of any relative or entity controlled by a relative that transacts business with the institution or an institution supervised by the institution is overly broad. The FCC suggested that the definition of ``relative,'' for purposes of disclosure under §§612.2145(b)(1) and 612.2155(b)(1), be limited to immediate family members as defined in part 620 of this chapter. Section 620.1(e) of this chapter defines ``immediate family member'' to mean spouse, parents, siblings, children, mothers- and fathers-in-law, brothers- and sisters-in-law, and sons- and daughters-in-law. In addition, the FCC commented that it is extremely difficult for a director to disclose a list of borrowers with whom the director or the director's entity transacts business, since if the director is not involved in the day-to-day operations of the business, he or she will have little or no knowledge of the people who conduct business with the director's entity. Also, a director may not know that the individual or entity is a borrower. The FCC assumed that this was not the intention of §612.2145 and that the requirement to disclose ``to the best of his or her knowledge after reasonable inquiry'' was designed to address this problem. However, the FCC recommended that the requirement of ``reasonable inquiry'' be deleted, noting that it is difficult to know what reasonable inquiry is in any particular case. The FCC also suggested that directors be required to disclose only those business relationships with borrowers that are other than ordinary course of business relationships, unusually large transactions, ongoing contractual relationships, or transactions with nonstandard terms and conditions, or terms other than those arrived at through arm's-length negotiations. The FCC argued that any appearance of conflict would be eliminated by the knowledge that neither the director nor the borrower received special terms. The FCC also recommended that each institution be allowed the opportunity to define transactions other than in the ordinary course of business within the above parameters. The FCC also commented that it is difficult to understand how a director's position can be compromised by the mere fact that a borrower does business with the director or an entity owned by the director. Some of the FCC's comments appear to reflect a misunderstanding of the requirements of both proposed and existing regulations. Neither the proposed regulations nor existing regulations require the reporting of transactions with borrowers. The proposed regulations merely require the disclosure of the name of any relative or any entity in which the director has a financial interest if the relative or entity transacts business with borrowers. Transacting business with borrowers is the standard that narrows the class of persons or entities a director must report. An institution could, for instance, require instead the reporting of the names of all entities in which a director or employee has a financial interest, irrespective of whether such entities transact business with borrowers. Such a requirement would require more reporting, but might be easier for the individuals required to report. The regulatory requirement is a minimum requirement. The FCA encourages boards to require sufficient reporting to permit adequate monitoring of potential conflicts. After considering the comments on the reporting requirements, the final regulations have been modified in several ways in response to revisions to the prohibited conduct sections and in an effort to ease any unnecessary burden the proposed regulations might have entailed. The final regulations permit the institution greater flexibility to determine the applicability of the prohibition on lending transactions among directors, employees, and borrowers and relies more heavily on recusal as a means of resolving conflicts of interest than the existing regulations or the proposed regulations. Since the FCA believes that the reporting requirements should provide the institution sufficient information for the institution to determine when recusal rather than prohibition is appropriate, an effort has been made to make the reporting requirements parallel the recusal provisions.
