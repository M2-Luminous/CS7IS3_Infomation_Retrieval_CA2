Speaking to reporters after meeting with his Spanish counterpart Javier Solana at Shangri-La hotel here tonight, Abdullah said Spain wanted to have an increased presence in ASEAN due to the region's rapid economic growth and peaceful situation. He said the commission would carry out activities towards improving bilateral ties with the signing of several agreements on economic and technological cooperation later this year. Abdullah said during the one-and-a-half-hour meeting, several agreements on investment agreement guarantee, culture, partial abolition of visa and air service were discussed. Solana who was accompanied by four senior officials, arrived here today for a one-day visit on the invitation of the Malaysian Government. Abdullah said Solana was also receptive to his idea that Spain organise a Spain Week here to showcase its products and to provide information to further boost two-way ties. "Spain plans to organise the event sometime this year in conjunction with Visit Malaysia Year '94. This is good because there would be many tourists here." Abdullah said he would also like to see other countries wishing to establish bilateral ties with Malaysia to organise similar events.
