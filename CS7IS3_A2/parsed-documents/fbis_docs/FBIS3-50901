For that reason, I have an open telephone line with the delegation, because I am directly responsible for the peace process," President Ramiro De Leon Carpio said in San Gaspar Chajul at the end of the inauguration of various projects and the presentation of a contribution to the Chajul Val Bak Cuyol Association. "For the past seven months this responsibility was delegated to Hector Rosada, and I maintained direct participation. Now I will be responsible for the agreements that -- God willing -- will lead to the signing of a comprehensive social and economic peace," he added. De Leon Carpio said that this was his first statement on the topic of talks with the URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity]. He also said the governmental delegation in Mexico has a specific mission: to establish contacts for a future dialogue. "We hope the established objective will be achieved; in other words, the establishment of the procedures and mechanisms for a future dialogue. They will not undertake an in-depth analysis of a specific topic or of the peace plan that the government has begun with the national reconciliation," he said.
