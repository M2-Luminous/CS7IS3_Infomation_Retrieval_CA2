The poll, conducted by the Beijing Institute of Social Psychology, shows that classical works like The Dream of Red , Besieged City, Family, Jane Eyre, and Gone With the Wind are still the favorite books of Beijing readers. The poll received replies from 720 Beijing citizens, among whom are factory workers, government employees, students, teachers, researchers and company employees. Of them, 89.7 percent received high school and university educations. The poll shows that Qian Zhongshu, Liang Shiqiu and Lu Xun are the preferred writers for younger readers, followed by San Mao of Taiwan, Wang Shuo, the native Beijing writer, and Liang Yusheng and Jin Yong, both writers of Gongfu novels. Beijing's middle-aged and older readers, however, like Lao She, Ba Jin and Lu Xun the most, followed by Ding Ling, Bing Xin and Zhou Zuoren. All of them are native writers. The poll also sought out people's attitudes towards the increasing descriptions of sex in newly published literary books. The poll found that nearly half of the Beijing readers hold a noncommittal attitude -- "not good, not bad" -- toward lengthy sex descriptions, while one-third of the readers marked it as "a bad thing," and 18 percent as "a good thing." Among those against sex descriptions, 32.6 percent said that it is pandering to bad tastes, 30.2 percent said it does not conform to the Chinese way of expression, and 11.2 percent said it will lead to precocity in love affairs and even sexual assaults. Among the surveyed readers in favor of more sex descriptions gave different reasons, 33.3 percent saying sex is a normal human need, another 20.5 percent saying sex is one of the beautiful things in human life, and 5.3 percent saying sex can make people forget unpleasant things. When asked of the relations between their purchasing behavior and the purpose of their reading, 44.6 percent of the readers said they buy books according to their interest, and 34.7 percent said their first consideration is practical use, while only 3.6 percent said they select books according to popularity. Whereas popularity has for a time seemed to become the sole standard for publishers in making choices, organizers of the poll said their investigation is aimed at providing a more realistic guide for the publishers.
