ANC spokesman Carl Niehaus said that the rumors were triggering off a psychosis of fear. Reports at the weekend said that many whites have been stockpiling non-perishable supplies in anticipation of trouble. The fears were reportedly spurred by the carnage in Johannesburg last week, and an anonymous panic list distributed to businesses warning about water supplies being cut off and power pylons blown up. Mr. Niehaus said that the ANC did not believe that there would be more violence after the election and that there was no need for concern.
