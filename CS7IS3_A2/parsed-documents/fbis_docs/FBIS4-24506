Jordan asked Taipei to cut some U.S.$1 million from its debt after Taipei agreed to cancel 75 percent of Nicaragua's U.S.$22.84 million in loans with the island. According to Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials, Jordan is not likely to be given the same treatment as Nicaragua. They said that Jordan's lack of diplomatic ties with Taiwan was the main reason which would prevent the foreign debt reduction. Jordan received several loans from the ROC in the 1970s, but has been unable to repay the debt as planned because of financial difficulties. News that Taipei agreed to cancel 75 percent of the debt owned it by Nicaragua during ROC President Li Teng-hui's visit to the Central American country early this month fueled a spate of inquiries from several debtor countries for similar treatment, the officials said. About 30 countries owe money to the ROC. The "Paris Club" or G10, was established in 1962 by then 10 international monetary fund member countries. It aims to unify loan terms and accords for international debtor nations. Club members reduce the foreign debts for nations which are plagued with anemic foreign exchange reserves but have started economic reforms that would secure future loan payments.
