We know that several days ago the so-called contact group for Bosnia was formed, consisting of representatives of the United States, Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations. After the first meeting that was held in London, this group will try -- if we understood it correctly -- to regain the dynamics of the peace process on the ground, of course, with the involvement of the warring sides. Is this the path toward peace in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, and what does the involvement of this contact group mean in practice for the FRY? This evening we are asking FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic about these issues. [Jovanovic] Every shift toward peace certainly represents an alternative to the worst that had been our everyday life until a few days ago, especially in the Gorazde region. In this sense the contact group with the plan of contacts that it will have in the period ahead is in a way contributing to the recovery of the atmosphere and the creation of the necessary preconditions for the renewal and strengthening of the negotiating process. However, what is more important than the instruments themselves, than the structure of negotiations, which also include the contact group, should be the refreshing of the approach to the Yugoslav crisis. The approach hitherto, the one-sided, partial, selective approach, not only has it been unjust, but it also became to a great extent the generator of the crisis itself. This was the case during the denouement of the latest developments, when we saw the demonstration of partiality, which was prevented at the last moment from resulting in an escalation, an even worse situation. Therefore, now that we are at the fresh start of renewing the negotiating process, everyone should make a sufficient self-critical review and everyone should on his part try to remove from his way of thinking, his approach, and from his stands everything that has so far been hindering the negotiating process, leading to its failure. As for the foreign factors that have so far been involved in solving or not solving the Yugoslav crisis -- depending on their individual attitude -- there are certainly very serious and very sound reasons for everyone to carry out the necessary revision of the current approach to the crisis, and to introduce in these approaches and stands the necessary corrections. If this does not happen we would run the risk of the negotiating process not only being unnecessarily prolonged and perhaps being made more complicated, but also something worse, namely instead of being food for peace, the process would become food for maintaining the crisis and even renewing the military conflicts. I say this because one side, at least one side in this civil war, the Muslim side, will always find a reason to believe, to be encouraged, or to be under the illusion that -- by further complicating the procedure of negotiating, and occasionally resorting to combat activities -- it will gain more than through the negotiations. The negotiating process has, thus far, been burdened by this very negative factor, and all our warnings that the inequitable approach of the leading components creates not only an inequitable final result but also makes it impossible for the negotiating momentum to follow its logical course toward a prompt conclusion. [sentence as heard] We would like to see the contact group adopt, in the new cycle of involvement, a fresh approach and cleansed views when it comes to the question of how to get out of this crisis, and how to make all the elements, the three warring sides, equally responsible for the negotiating efforts and the final result. In that sense we are ready to be as active, open, and constructive as always, when it comes to solving the Bosnian crisis, with the contact group and the other participants in the negotiating process, which will most probably be resumed. [Ostojic-Pusara] As has happened before, it is possible that one of the warring sides -- and I am referring to the Muslims here -- will ask for some kind of a retreat. We have been reading recently that Mr. Izetbegovic, leader of the Bosnian Muslims, has asked, that is, has sent a letter to the king of Saudi Arabia, asking for the Organization of Islamic Conference to be the fifth and equal member of the contact group. [Jovanovic] This is one of the continuous efforts of the Muslim leadership to complicate the procedure, making the negotiating process more complex, and helping those elements in the process whose natural interests are not in ending this crisis as soon as possible, but rather in gaining maximum advantage from it. The advantage is not equal for all the participants in the war or the peoples of the Balkans in comparison to the advantage that the non-Balkan factors -- not all but some -- expect to gain from this crisis. We know that the Islamic bloc of countries is fully engaged in a very biased, one-sided, and aggressively provocative way. Everything they have undertaken so far has been aimed at deepening antagonism between the warring sides, and not at narrowing their differences. Everything has been done to facilitate the creation of conditions for the internationalization of the military conflict, for unimpeded outside involvement with impunity. The participation of Saudi Arabia -- which, by the way, does not have diplomatic relations with any other country except Muslim Bosnia -- could not be interpreted as a constructive contribution to efforts made by the contact group and other countries that are positively oriented toward peace, for the revival of the negotiating process. [Ostojic-Pusara] It seems that this is, according to you -- and I suppose also the federal government -- a path toward peace. There is talk now of a four-month cease-fire. Do you believe that it would be possible within that period of time to come to an overall peace solution, if the favoritism is eliminated, of course? [Jovanovic] It would be best to put a final complete stop to that unfortunate war, and -- with the feeling of safety that the war will not deepen or be renewed -- to make relaxed but rapid efforts to find a final just and lasting political solution. That is the view of the FRY and the Bosnian Serbs. That is also the view of many other participants in the negotiating process. However, the view of the Muslim leadership is different. They want to have a fixed-term cease-fire, which is reason enough for one to wonder why they are doing this. [Ostojic-Pusara] Anything can happen in that time, right? [Jovanovic] First of all, they are doing this because they want to keep the option of renewing and extending the war. Second, it is possible that they see this cease-fire as a lull for arming and new provocations for renewing the war from even better starting positions. It is also possible that they are doing this in the expectation that they can materialize the support that they are getting from their friends from abroad, that they can turn this support into victory for themselves. [Ostojic-Pusara] This could then be a preparation for war, rather than a preparation for peace. [Jovanovic] It could be a preparation for the continuation of the political war, or part of the preparation for the continuation of the armed conflict. In any case, the fact that Saudi Arabia is singled out indicates that the Muslim leadership could use this period of relative peace to turn to escalating political pressure on the Serbs in Bosnia, in Yugoslavia, and on the Serbian people in general, which would have a negative effect on the negotiating atmosphere and perhaps even affect the final outcome. In any case, in the absence of the best solution, even the not-so-good solution is better than no solution at all. Therefore, even though the cease-fire would be a fixed-term cease-fire, that in itself would not represent the failure of the peace efforts if it is accompanied by a sufficient number of guarantees given by relevant international bodies that this period would not be abused for the preparation for war, or that it would not be used as an opportunity to obstruct the negotiating process. These are things that can be negotiated, and -- without wishing to prejudice the stand that the leadership of the Bosnian Serbs will take on this issue -- I think that this is not a question that can be put down as unsolvable. On the contrary. [Ostojic-Pusara] In your view, is it clear what actual means this group has available to reach peace? How likely are abuses here? [Jovanovic] The contact group.... [Ostojic-Pusara, interruptsing It proposes things that will later go to the conference.... [Jovanovic, interrupting] It first has to revive the contacts that were severed or frozen due to the escalation in tensions, and to create conditions for the start of the real negotiating process in which the warring sides will -- with the help of peace-loving countries from elsewhere -- try this time, I hope successfully, to agree on a final political solution. It is hard to predict what this solution will be like. It will come as a result from the contacts and the first stages of the negotiating process. The basic question is whether all the participants in the process have an equal desire for peace, whether someone still has a desire for war, and whether the foreign participants are all equally interested in reaching peace quickly and in a way that is equal for all. The establishment of equality in the treatment of the participants in the peace process is something that is implied. So far there has been no equality because one side, the Serbian side, has constantly been in an inferior position. It was under multiple pressure, media pressure, economic pressure through the sanctions, and political pressure through isolation and satanization. These things cannot be a contribution to the negotiating process, but rather, on the contrary, they serve as a warning that this imbalance must be urgently removed in order to make the process a real conversation among equals. Then the result of the talks can be based on consensus and freely expressed will. Therefore, parallel to the cease-fire, which we hope will take place in the near future -- the sooner the better -- parallel to that, work has to be done on the cessation, or at least the suspension of the other forms of hostilities that have been very obviously and aggressively expressed toward the Bosnian Serb side, and Yugoslavia. The sanctions are one form of these hostilities. They are affecting equitability, they are making the negotiations more difficult, and are preventing any political solution that is reached from being turned into reality. We also have this media war that is still going on; it is also a form of hostility. It is making the psychological basis for negotiations more difficult and it is giving credibility to the illusions, particularly on the Muslim side, that -- with the assistance of these hostilities and those expressed through sanctions -- they can obstruct negotiations, something that, at the moment, it would appear they would not be able to achieve with arms. [Ostojic-Pusara] Are there any indications, Mr. Jovanovic, that the peace process will include the principle of alleviating the sanctions, or gradually lifting them? [Jovanovic] I have already said that the sanctions are a form of hostility directed toward one side alone, and this in a direct way stops dialogue and negotiations from being a two-way process, a process in which all the participants have equal starting positions and equal reasons to expect that the positive result of their talks will benefit everyone. The most principled thing to do would be to eliminate this form of hostility along with eliminating the armed form of hostility, and the third form I have mentioned. If this cannot be done immediately, it is certainly necessary to start lifting the absurd sanctions as soon as the agreement on the cease-fire is reached. The absurdity of the sanctions is becoming an eyesore even to those who imposed them, not to mention how much they create negative points for everyone, including those who imposed them. [Ostojic-Pusara] And those who called for them first, who lost a lot because of them. [Jovanovic] I was just about to say that. [Ostojic-Pusina] The decision to call for a ministerial conference -- which should be held at the beginning of next week -- depends on the political success, that is, the negotiations, on things that the contact group, as they call it, will find on the ground, and on the dialogue with the two warring sides. [Jovanovic] It is important that the contact group has an equitable approach toward all the participants in the civil war. This means if it has to exert pressure, then that pressure has to be exerted at the same time and equally on all the sides. If it is supposed to stimulate more successful negotiations, this, too, has to be done equally for all. If this selective attitude is maintained, when one side is constantly disfavored while the other two sides are constantly favored, then it is clear that this is a recipe for failure, not success. [Ostojic-Pusina] We have been reading in the daily press that the group has several initiatives -- everything in London was behind closed doors -- and there is talk that the final stage should again be the much talked about drawing of the borders. Abuse is, of course, possible here. [Jovanovic] You see, the demarcation of territories is effectively the basic issue -- since the civil war is being waged because every side believes or feels that it is endangered on its ethnic territory by the other side or sides. The question is merely whether the territorial demarcation should be done before, after, or at the same time. All three methods have already been tried. Not one of them has produced a conclusive result even though the method used last summer and autumn was the most successful so far. Were it not for the hesitation, not to say obstruction, on the side of the Muslims at the last minute, we would already have had peace in Bosnia for six or seven months now. However, whichever way you solve or try to solve this question, it cannot be resolved by pressuring one side and supporting the other sides. This has to be the result of agreement, of consensus of all three sides, and the other participants in the process have to offer only so-called positive support to make the negotiations easier and help out with useful ideas if there is a halt in the negotiations. [Ostojic-Pusina] If possible, could you comment at the end of this interview on Russia's role in the peace process? We have witnessed some vacillations in certain statements and views of the Russian administration. Some analysts say that the West is involving Russia in the peace process only when the decision has already been made. Others say that this is because Russia does not want to defy the West over Bosnia or a place like Gorazde. Can you tell us something about that? [Jovanovic] You see, relations between Russia and the West are very complex, sometimes contradictory, sometimes delicate. In any case, we do not have enough data for a final determination. It is possible that relations will exist in this immature and fluid form until the elements of the new balance of power are crystallized, which are at the moment being established painstakingly, very controversially, and desperately before our very eyes. We, as the Balkans, as Yugoslavia, are only one weight on the scales, sometimes heavier, sometimes lighter -- depending on how either side wants to use the weight to improve or establish the balance in its favor. What has been coming from Russia -- regardless of the reasons, which can be understood and explained, and perhaps even justified -- is something that characterizes one great power in its relations with another great power, and shows that the interests of a great power and a smaller country are not always in concord and uniform, and can even be in contradiction. This is not news to us. We have had evidence of such behavior in the past in relations with other great powers, including Russia -- both Red and Blue. The last time it happened was when Russia voted for the imposition of sanctions, and now giving approval for the engagement of NATO against the Serbs in Bosnia is a similar moment, which will be food for thought not only for us, for this generation, but for generations yet to come. All great powers try to avoid such acts as much as possible, and if possible not have anything to do with them. However, the nature of our relations with Russia is such that all such events nevertheless end as episodes, and they do not influence in a more essential and more permanent way the constants in the closeness of our interests in various spheres. So, despite everything, Russia continues to play a positive and constructive role in the settlement of the Yugoslav crisis because, out of all foreign participants, Russia is still by far the most objective and as such a necessary element for correcting and balancing the one- sided policy of the majority of other parties. [Ostojic-Pusara] And finally, in summary, do you think that this is a path toward peace, with the understanding of course that the contact group must treat both warring sides equally, and not as has been the case so far. This would mean a lot in practice for the FRY. [Jovanovic] Of course it is important for the warring sides, but it is also important for the sides that are not at war. We are not a country at war, but we are a very interested country, we are very interested in having this war end in a just and lasting way. However, we are nevertheless in an unequal position for reasons that I have already mentioned, even though we are expected to continue in our active and dominant partnership role to build peace, to find the final political solution. This partnership, this cooperation has to be based on mutual respect and equal status, and not on the basis of subordination, which is just another word for sanctions and the punishment of one partner. [Ostojic-Pusara] Thank you very much.
