He stressed that the state is looking with every possible care at its communities abroad. [Begin Zeroual recording] In the Name of God the Merciful and Most Compassionate. Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me pleasure to thank you for the good expressions of welcome which you addressed to me. [passage omitted] The Algerian communities abroad will be the subject of special in all our decisions for the service of our country and people. More than at any time in the past, Algeria today needs all its children to contribute to correcting the current situation, promoting its development, and strengthening its true position among the nations to enable every citizen inside or outside our borders to show the sense of honor which characterizes the Algerian people. As you know, our country currently exists in a difficult condition characterized by the phenomena of violence and terrorism which are alien to our values and traditions. It also lives in a critical economic crisis. You all know these problems and the ways and means defined by the Algerian people to overcome them. These ways and means stemmed from the national conference which was held in January. I am committed to making things concrete in order to emphasize the unity of the Algerian people, ensure civil peace and calm, and to provide the conditions for the free choice by the nation within the framework of sovereignty and stability. This endeavor will also encompass all the necessary actions aimed at consolidating and activating the national economy. [end recording] The head of state's address also touched on the course Algeria is following, on democracy, and the transitional period and on far-reaching reforms which would satisfy the citizen's needs and open the door for creative initiatives. In short, he talked before everyone on the need for a break with the past. [Begin Zeroual recording] It is a break which calls for eliminating the spirit of monopoly in the different spheres. The democracy which the transitional period would strengthen would open the field for individual and collective freedoms. The far-reaching reforms of our national economy would not only satisfy the needs of the citizen, but would also open the field for creative initiatives. These are the new goals which would be confirmed before our expatriate community and before the whole of our Algerian people to enable everyone of us to offer his contributions to invigorate the national development effort in all spheres.
