Heavy Burden Falls to Lot of Russian Servicemen Still in Estonia"] [Text] In 1990 there were 90,000 Soviet Army servicemen on Estonian territory. Now all that is left of the once mighty military grouping which Russia has taken under its jurisdiction is something in the order of 2,500 men and, as the Estonian press notes ironically, nowadays there is one Russian officer for every three soldiers. Surely not a single army in the world has such a ratio. Nonetheless the Russian military units, which are concentrated in only a few garrisons, are still being clamorously called "occupying" units, and Estonia regards their presence as a direct threat to the country's sovereignty. Special concern is apparently being caused by the two nuclear reactors at the naval base in Paldiski and the 144th Motorized Rifle Division, which has weapons and armored personnel carriers as well as around 30 tanks. In the republic capital itself an ammunition dump which originally contained 7,000 items in storage is under the constant attention of the Estonian military. True, now there are considerably fewer of them, since ammunition is being continuously taken off to Russia. The Baltic Fleet has already withdrawn its ships, but something like around 12 half-sunken old "tubs" have been left at piers in Tallinn and Paldiski. Citing these figures to Moscow journalists, the Estonian military observed that, besides the "purely military aspect," they are concerned by the fact that the Russian garrisons pose a danger "as a hotbed of crime and of weapons and metal smuggling." Something similar has already been voiced in a RIA report cited by Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar, so when given the opportunity to talk to the Estonian premier personally in Tallin, I asked him to clarify the facts cited. "The Estonian police did indeed recently arrest a group of Russian servicemen trading in weapons and metals," Laar replied. "Incidentally, the Russian Prosecutor's Office is also working on these cases. But we are especially concerned by the trade in radioactive metals. According to our information the Baltic Fleet recently sold and exported from Estonia several ships containing a considerable dose of radioactive contamination." I think the thesis regarding the "criminalization" of the remnants of Russian troops in Estonia is no accident, especially as certain incidents "have occurred." But by the way, it is relevant to recall that our servicemen are permitted to sell some metals and surplus property locally. All the funds earned, Colonel General Leonid Mayorov, commander of the Northwestern Group of Forces, stressed in a conversation with me, are going on the construction of housing for military pensioners in Russia. But in my view the issue here is that, by raising a delicate subject, officials in Tallinn are thereby trying to exert pressure on Moscow and to mold public opinion in a certain way. The aim is well known -- to get Russia to withdraw its troops before 31 August 1994. But the point is that, following Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's visit to Tallinn, when the signing of the appropriate troop withdrawal treaty started to look more certain, Estonia itself has been holding up the troop withdrawal willy-nilly. "The Russian side is making active preparations for the transportation of nuclear reactors, fuel, and radioactive waste from Paldiski," Anatoliy Chizhikov, military attache at the Russian Embassy in Estonia, related. "Containers are being delivered and the necessary equipment and specialists are arriving: Unique work lies ahead! But instead of helping us in this the Estonian side is delaying the matter in every way possible." It turned out that originally in order for the specialists to enter Estonia promptly they needed merely to put in a claim at the Estonian Foreign Ministry, which would the be transmitted to the border.... But visas were soon introduced, but for some time the Estonian border services did not even "know about it." "Estonia is trying to hasten the Baltic Fleet's final departure," Vice Admiral Anatoliy Gavrilov, commander of the Tallin Naval Base, said. "We reached agreement with a Norwegian firm to help us raise four cutters that sank in Paldiski and it would acquire them as scrap. Three cutters were raised, but then Estonian representatives intervened. They protested the deal and, as a result, we had to...scuttle the cutters that had already been raised." Vice Adm. Gavrilov categorically denied the Estonian side's suggestions that the Baltic Fleet is selling "contaminated" ships. According to him, before any trade deals go ahead the ships are "cleaned" of radioactive waste, if there is any. This process is strictly monitored. It seems as though problems will even arise at the final stage of the troop withdrawal. Anatoliy Ivanov, minister-counselor at the Russian Embassy in Tallin, explained that we will have to hand over our military camps and their property under formal instruments [akty], and there is no doubt that the meticulous Estonians will count every last item. What, for instance, was the commander of a military unit near Tallin meant to do? In April the "Kaitseliit" (armed militiamen), which are structurally part of the republic's Defense Ministry, removed three 24-meter masts from the antenna field under the threat of force. And, despite a protest from the embassy, no apology was forthcoming and the antennas have not been returned. Our military have long since disappeared from the streets of Estonian cities -- officers and NCO's switched to civilian dress a few years ago so as "not to traumatize" the local population too much. But within the garrison of the 144th Division, based on the outskirts of Tallin, everything is like a "normal" military unit -- uniforms and meticulous garrison duty at checkpoints, in the staff, and in the military subunits. "Although there has been no political solution to the troop withdrawal, we are preparing to redeploy," the chief of staff, Guards Colonel Yevgeniy Lazebin, noted. "People's morale is good. An operational group is at work at the new site. The question of rented accommodations for officers' families is being resolved, and South Korea's Samsung has promised to build us residential quarters by August of next year. The first five blocks will be built by the end of the year." But not everything has been so smooth -- combat subunits are having to be temporarily billeted in the field. In the absence of any accommodations in Russia, officers' families have been forced to send their personal effects and furniture to their relatives' apartments. "And, incidentally, 30 percent of families have nowhere at all to put their things," Guards Lieutenant Colonel Gennadiy Kaverda, the division's psychologist, explained. "This means that some things will have to be sold off, and there is no need to mention how hard officers' families are taking it." In conclusion, I would like to say the following. For a long time Russian troops were an important factor in the difficult dialogue between Estonia and Russia. Relying on this, Russia tried to solve the problems of social protection for military pensioners and the civil rights of the Russian-speaking population in Estonia. This tactic did not meet with any particular success. The negotiating process is deadlocked.... Meanwhile, the troops have been leaving for Russia and are being cut back locally. Some people in Estonia have gotten the idea that it is possible not only to insist on an immediate Russian troop withdrawal, but also, if necessary, on "making Russian servicemen withdraw by force." That was the sense of statements made by General Aleksandr Einseln, commander of the Estonian Defense Forces. Fortunately, sober-minded trends have prevailed at top political level in Estonia of late. The fruitful meetings in Tallin between the Estonian leadership and Russian Federation Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and his deputy Vitaliy Churkin inspire hope that the disputes between the two countries -- disputes at the focus of which Russian servicemen have found themselves -- will be resolved in a civilized fashion.
