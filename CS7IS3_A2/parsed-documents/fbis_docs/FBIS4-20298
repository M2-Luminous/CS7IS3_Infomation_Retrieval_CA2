The Clinton government believes that the future of the United States lies in broader, deeper and more focused participation in the affairs of the Pacific rim region and that there is a need for a "community based on a foundation of shared strength, shared prosperity and joint responsibility for democratic values." Ultimately, this community would include all the members of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum [APEC] and of NAFTA. The strong U.S. support for the informal meeting of APEC leaders in Seattle was one step in the pursuit of this plan. What is the ultimate motivation behind the U.S. enthusiasm for a new Pacific Community? 1. Hitting Two Targets With One Arrow on the Economic Front. The two economic goals considered by the U.S. in promoting a New Pacific Community are obtaining economic advantages and exerting influence. The concept of a New Pacific Community is an important strategic step in the implementation of an adjustment in U.S. policy towards the Asian Pacific. From the point of view of obtaining economic advantages: 1) It could rejuvenate the domestic economy. The United States has a large trade deficit, and economic recovery has been slow. Clinton entered the White House on the banner of solving domestic economic problems. He feels that one method of solving this thorny problem is to increase foreign exports, because American prosperity depends to a large degree on international trade which constitutes one fourth of the U.S. GNP. Stagnated export markets increase the difficulty of domestic economic recovery, and it is the Asian Pacific region which can expand the scope of American foreign trade. Clinton says that the Asian Pacific region is "an unlimited source of employment, income, partner relationships, and economic growth." The Asian Pacific region has rapid economic growth and great development potential. Maintaining and expanding relations with this region can open new markets for American products and capital and provide hope for U.S. employment opportunities and labor exports and thus allow the U.S. to cast off these economic difficulties. 2) It can create a foundation for entering the Pacific century. U.S. leaders and experts recognize that the 21st century will be the "Pacific century." It will be more challenging and more prosperous than the Atlantic century. If the U.S. clings to "Eurocentrism," it will be excluded from the tide of development in the Asian Pacific. Christopher said, "As we approach the next century, the U.S. must keep its sights turned to Asia, on the future of the Pacific." The Asian Pacific has 40 percent of the world's population and a 70 billion U.S. dollar GNP, or 25 percent of the world GNP, and a 7 percent annual growth rate. U.S. trade with this region is up to 344 billion U.S. dollars, or one third of U.S. foreign trade. Every one percent increase in exports from the U.S. to the Asian Pacific region adds 53,300 job opportunities to the U.S. economy. Five of the United States' ten most important trading partners are members of APEC. The proposal to establish a new Pacific Community is an important step for the U.S. in entering the Asian Pacific market. An essay by the U.S. Heritage Foundation said that Clinton's concept of a Community would, after 30 years, allow for APEC and NAFTA to combine into a unified, broad-based, Asia-America free trade alliance which would be the largest free trade zone in the world. The task to be done at this phase is to transform APEC into an economically integrated regional framework which would establish a foundation for links between the U.S. and Asia. 3) It could facilitate the signing of a Pacific free trade agreement. Beginning with the Bush administration, an important strategic concept underlying the U.S. proposals for a Pacific community, later expanded to the New Pacific Community, has been the eventual signing of a Pacific free trade agreement. The Asia Pacific economic community proposal suggested by Clinton at the Seattle meeting is a specific step towards a New Pacific Community, the goal being to transform APEC into a regional organization for multilateral trade negotiations. With this as a lever to promote liberalized investment, eliminate trade barriers, and use liberalized trade to expand investment opportunities for U.S. enterprise, the Asian Pacific region is to be transformed into a free market with strong U.S. involvement. With trade barriers eliminated, the United States will then use every means possible, leading with aircraft, electronic communications, finance and other areas where the United States has competitive confidence, to allow U.S. enterprise to penetrate the Pacific market. By strengthening close economic ties with Asian Pacific countries within the scope of a community, the United States can then rely on its own superiorities and the standards and systems of multilateral structures to exert influence on other countries. The United States is accustomed to using relevant legal provisions to exert pressure on other countries. The United States is attempting to use APEC as a springboard to reaffirm the influence of the United States in this region. Another aspect is that, after the end of the cold war, U.S. influence in the Asian Pacific declined. The economic power of Japan, the ASEAN countries, and other Asian Pacific countries strengthened. The United States is concerned that Japan will use economic methods to establish the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" that military methods failed earlier to achieve. To maintain the leadership role and influence of the United States in the Asian Pacific region after the end of the cold war, the United States has emphasized the need to create a new mechanism for cooperation and to develop a new policy towards the Asian Pacific region which is consistent with the new reality and has "coalescing power." The U.S. Assistant Trade Negotiator stated, "if we are to continue to have competitive leadership in the Asian Pacific region, we must bring together a constructive alliance with the Asian Pacific countries." 2. Killing Two Birds With One Stone on the Security Front The two security goals of the United States in promoting a New Pacific Community are to maintain stability in the Asian Pacific region, thus protecting the security of the United States, and to urge other countries to share some of the defense burden. The U.S. view is that, after the end of the cold war, the factors most contributing to instabaility in Asia have been the widespread military buildup in many Asian Pacific countries, the suspicion that North Korea and other countries have developed nulear weapons, and the possibility of regional conflict among the coastal countries due to the lack of clearly defined borders and economic waters. Of the five remaining Communist-controlled countries in the world, four are in Asia. In order to establish a stable situation in the Asian Pacific region, the New Pacific Community should perform a security function, the focal points of which would be to continue stationing troops in Asia to project a threat and achieve victory in any conflict; prevent nuclear proliferation, and conduct new regional dialogue. The United States believes that maintaining appropriate military strength in the Asian Pacific region will contribute to stability and economic growth in the region. The United States will continue to maintain military alliances with Japan, South Korea, Singapore, the Phillipines, and Australia and strengthen strategic relations with ASEAN so that the U.S. can use Southeast Asian military facilities at any time. Decreases in the U.S. defense budget will be mainly in Europe rather than in Asia. The United States continues to maintain 15 percent of its military strength in Asia to prevent the emergence of a power vacuum and a new hegemonist force. The U.S. military believes that the establishment of a multilateral military framework in the Asian Pacific is still a matter for the rather distant future, because this can only be brought about after the "process of establishing a community" is carried out. Currently only APEC can exercise a security function. The United States will be able to perform a positive function in an organization for multilateral dialogue like APEC. The United States sees the discussion of a joint approach to the challenges of defense in the region as a priority issue, because the Americans feel that it is a difficult burden to maintain the region's stability single-handed. President Clinton has called for cooperation in establishing joint defense, joint prosperity and democratic values in the Pacific region. The United States intends to link the provision of a security function in the Asian Pacific market with the bilateral security treaties maintained between the United States and Pacific region countries. With regard to security strategy in the Asian Pacific region, the United States will no longer put its efforts into seeking new military bases but on conducting regional security dialogue. Utilizing the forum of a community and establishing bilateral and multilateral dialoque mechanisms will cause more countries to be concerned and share the responsibility for regional defense. U.S. defense authorities have indicated clearly that Japan should assume greater responsibility in the joint defense of the Asian Pacific region and has also urged South Korea to make greater contributions to defense. 3. Two for One on the Political Front The political motives behind the U.S. enthusiasm for a New Pacific Community are to promote American values and also to provide for the strategic containment of certain countries. The countries of Southeast Asia and some other countries in Asia still have differences with the United States on Western democracy and human rights concepts . The United States has always wanted to conduct "open dialogue" with Asian countries on the issue of human rights but also does not want the human rights issue to damage relations with the countries of this region. The establishment of a type of community would create an ideal forum for carrying out this task. The United States also wants to use APEC to exert pressure on North Korea on the nuclear issue. Another important motive for the U.S. promotion of a New Pacific Community is the containment of Asian countries especially China as well as to make the activities of APEC serve U.S. strategy. The U.S. view is that China presents the greatest current and future threat to the United States in the Asian Pacific region. Hence the Clinton government wants to adopt a more subtle policy towards China than that of the Bush government. They wish to use the context of a community to bind the hands and feet of China and eliminate this potential "threat." Their method is to urge China to develop towards a free market economy and get China to participate in an integrated economic and security mechanism to prevent the possibility of China conducting "outward expansion." The U.S. also hopes to use the Asia Pacific community to contain the divergent tendencies of Japan and the ASEAN countries. 4. Future Prospects The U.S. plans to implement the New Pacific Community in three phases. The first phase is to sign a communique promoting the elimination of trade barriers. The second phase will be to discuss and delineate long-term goals at a summit meeting. The third phase will be to establish a community. The U.S. thinking is to first make APEC into an organization for multilateral negotiations and then, in one set of successful negotiations, make APEC and NAFTA into one combined unit. Although the United States has spared no effort in promoting the New Pacific Community, the future prospects are not optimistic. There are differences in values between the U.S. and Asian countries. There are serious gaps in economic, security and human rights issues. Several Asian countries, especially the ASEAN countries, have expressed unhappiness with U.S. attempts to control APEC and do not approve of making APEC into a negotiating organization. The Malaysian premier did not participate in the Seattle meeting because of this. Thus it will be very difficult for the United States to manifest its concept. A New Pacific Community will not emerge in the Asian Pacific in the near future. The United States will, however, become more and more agressive surrounding the question of a New Pacific Community as well as in protecting U.S. national interests and grasping for leadership in the economic development of the Asian Pacific region.
