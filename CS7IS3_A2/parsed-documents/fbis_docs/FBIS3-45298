Jiang made the remarks at a meeting with a visiting U.S. six-member delegation from the House of Representatives, led by majority leader Richard Gephardt. The U.S. Congress has a unique role to play in the making of U.S. domestic and foreign policies, Jiang said, adding that it can exert its influence in promoting the development of Sino-U.S. ties. Since last year, more than 100 U.S. congressmen have visited China. Jiang said that the visits would help them to learn about China's real situation and to make right decisions regarding Sino-U.S. ties. The past few years have witnessed fruitful Sino-U.S. economic and trade cooperation, he said, and it has been proved that China and the U.S. are highly complementary to each other in the economic and trade fields and they have wide spheres of cooperation. Gephardt said that the U.S. and China are two great nations. It is of great significance for leaders of the two countries to maintain their contacts. He added that active relations looking to the future should be developed between the two countries. Gephardt said he learned a lot about China during the current trip and saw major positive changes in the country's economic sphere. The U.S. is looking forward to developing more successful and closer ties with China, he said. Among those taking part in the meeting were Liu Shuqing, president of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu and U.S. Ambassador to China Stapleton Roy. This morning, Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji also met Gephardt and the other U.S. congressmen.
