FBIS4-8112 "dreeu069_k_94009" FBIS-EEU-94-069 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 CROATIA Local Commander Refuses To Withdraw Local Commander Refuses To Withdraw LD0804213994 Zagreb Radio Croatia Network in Serbo-Croatian 2000 GMT 8 Apr 94 LD0804213994 Zagreb Radio Croatia Network Serbo-Croatian BFN [Text] Joint Croatian and Serb Krajina commissions on withdrawal held talks today again at a UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] checkpoint near Sarvas in UNPROFOR's sector in eastern Slavonia. Reporter Verica Madjar has more on the results of the talks: [Begin recording] [Madjar] It has been agreed that the Croatian army will control the village of Brijest, which is south of Osijek, and the Faculty of Agriculture in order to have uninterrupted work and life. In return, certain concessions have been made to the Serb side concerning a part of Nova Tenja and Ostrvo. According to Major General Djuro Decak, the commander of the Osijek operational area, the Croatian and Serb sides were to start withdrawing their units as early as this morning and to complete the withdrawal by 0900 [0700 GMT] on Sunday 10 April. He stressed that many issues remain unresolved. [Decak] There are two disputed elements: Vinkovci and Mirkovci. The Croatian side explicitly refuses to withdraw even a single millimeter because Vinkovci is the most urban center on this line of separation. At the same time, the Serbs demand that we withdraw 300 to 500 meters. I refused to do that. UNPROFOR General Vandick tried to find a compromise. He will come here to examine the situation. The stance of the Croatian side--my stance--is beyond discussion. The Croatian army will not withdraw one millimeter from the line of separation. I also demanded that a local cemetery in the Nustar area, which is about 300 meters out of the line of separation, be included in Croatian area. That is the other disputed element because from the military point of view the cemetery is a strategic location, and the other side is afraid of it. [Madjar] Because they failed to reach an agreement, the two sides agreed to hold next round of talks on Tuesday 12 April. [end recording]
