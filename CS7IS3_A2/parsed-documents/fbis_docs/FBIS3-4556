Mieno gave the hint at a news conference held upon returning home from Frankfurt where he represented Japan at a meeting of top financial officials from the Group of Seven industrialized countries on Saturday, along with Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii. The central bank cut its discount rate to a record low 1.75 percent per annum last September. Mieno said the central bank will "keep a close eye on the effect of past rate cuts" for the time being. Mieno said exchange rates had not loomed large at the G-7 gathering but he quickly added the G-7 countries had reconfirmed the need for continued cooperation in currency and other questions. The yen has soared against the dollar in the wake of the collapse of a February 11 summit between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton on trade issues. The current yen-dollar levels had not been taken up at a meeting of Fujii and his U.S. counterpart Lloyd Bentsen, which took place just before the G-7 meeting, Mieno said. "The currency levels should be determined by market force and should not be manipulated," Mieno said. Asked about press reports that Fujii had told the G-7 meeting that the yen's rapid appreciation in value puts a damper on Japan's economic recovery, Mieno said the view seems to have been understood by financial officials from other industrialized countries although no clear-cut responses had been expressed. He also said other G-7 countries had expressed strong hope for Japan's economic comeback but had not sought any change in its monetary policy.
