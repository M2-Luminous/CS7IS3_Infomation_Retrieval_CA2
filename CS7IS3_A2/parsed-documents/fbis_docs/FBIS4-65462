Will you do the same for France? [Alphandery] We should indeed exceed our initial 1.4-percent growth rate forecast. Three indicators are encouraging. First of all, there is the European Commission's decision to raise its projected growth rate for France. The Commission had only credited us with a mere 1 percent this year. Today, it anticipates a 1.6- percent increase in France's GDP. According to this forecast, we should do better than our German and Italian neighbors this year, and reach a 2.8-percent growth rate in 1995, a performance better than Great Britain's. Mention must also be made of the manufacturing industry's index, which rose by 2.2 percent in the first two months of the year. To be sure, measures taken last January have given a boost to the car industry. But things have improved in all other sectors as well. Last, the third encouraging indicator is the fact that the economy as a whole has started creating new jobs: 20,000 in the first quarter, which is more than expected. We had only expected such results to occur during this years's second quarter. Furthermore, the service sector has created 53,000 jobs. And this is the sector in which progress is likely to be the strongest. [Potriquet] So will you revise official figures soon? [Alphandery] We do not change our figures on a daily basis. Our new projections will be elaborated this summer as part of the 1995 budget exercise. [Potriquet] Economists did not expect a very moderate growth to have any positive impact on employment. However, recent figures show an improvement. What is it that has changed in the French economy? [Alphandery] A major factor early this year were the measures taken by Edouard Balladur in favor of the car industry, which were based on our proposals. We achieved our objective as those measures had the intended impact. Should we be satisfied with this in a country that still has 3.5 million unemployed? Obviously not. All we have achieved so far is two out of three goals. The first one is a substantial decline in the rate of increase in unemployment. Currently, the average monthly increase is only 4,000 to 5,000. The second goal is getting the economy to start creating jobs again. This is where we now stand. However, we shall only reach our objective when the curve reverses, that is when net new job figures are enough to absorb the natural increase of the active population, an increase estimated to be 120,000 persons this year. What is encouraging is that activity is likely to increase while cyclical unemployment should decline. Moreover, we note that structural measures taken in the spring of 1993 have begun producing their intended impact: qualification contracts, employer-supported apprenticeship contracts, lower charges on unskilled labor, etc. [Potriquet] Will such evidence of recovery make you abandon any further support measure this year? [Alphandery] The government remains highly attentive to economic activity. Again, we are headed in the right direction. We need to look at this performance in the European context. Two days ago, for example, the Bundesbank lowered its discount rate to 4.5 percent. Pressure is being decreased with care being taken not to harm monetary stability, which is all in our economies' interest. But is not this also a consequence of a "French-style," recovery-oriented economic policy, initiated by Edouard Balladur? This policy consists of three components. First, renewed confidence through gradual restoration of economic and social equilibrium. Second, savings consolidation, which funds economic recovery through increased short-term savings. This was the goal of the various measures taken to redirect funds invested in monetary open-end funds toward private housing, and to support economic activity through the bond issues and privatization, which have already brought in 95 billion francs over 10 months. The third component is a series of temporary measures meant to stimulate the real estate market last year, and the car industry in January 1994. [Potriquet] Will there be more stimulating measures this year? [Alphandery] In the current situation, we have every reason to be confident that the French economy's outlook is good. However, we remain pragmatic and attentive. When you have had your head under the hood every day in order to get the economic engine running again, it is quite stimulating when first results begin to appear.
