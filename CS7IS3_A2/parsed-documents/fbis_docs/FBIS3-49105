Under the draft budget, the amount allocated for subsidies to agricultural credits is to be increased by nearly 70 percent as compared with 1993. Cheap credits are to be granted to farmers for the purchase of fertilizers, pesticides, seeds and for other expenses facilitating the reconstruction of agricultural production. The upgrading of farms and the food processing sector is to be supported by the agency for the restructuring and modernization of agriculture in line with a law adopted by the Sejm. Funds at the agency's disposal are to come from budget subsidies, interests on bank reserves and repayments of credits granted by the agency's predecessor -- the fund for agricultural restructuring and debt-rescheduling. Some 1.2 trillion zlotys (47 million USd) from a World Bank loan are to be earmarked for the development of countryside infrastructure.
