Speaking before the House of Councillors' Committee on Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Hata said there will not be any "quantitative problem" because the government has secured rice to meet needs until August. Hata was replying to a question by an opposition lawmaker about the mounting public outrage as Japanese rice has disappeared from store shelves and many consumers shun imported rice. Hata said a total of three million tons of rice is needed for consumption until August and the need will be fulfilled by some 1.2 million tons of domestically grown rice left in stock, 1.7 million tons in imports and 100,000 tons of early crop rice from this year's harvest. The government will step up efforts to import more rice, he said.
