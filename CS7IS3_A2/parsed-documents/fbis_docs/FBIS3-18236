FBIS3-18236 "drweu040__a94015" FBIS-WEU-94-040-A Document Type:Daily Report 1 March 1994 ANNEX Italy Major Election Candidates Reviewed BR2302124994 Rome ANSAMAIL Database in English 1504 GMT 22 Feb 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY BR2302124994 Rome ANSAMAIL Database Language: English Article Type:BFN [Unattributed article: "Names New, Old And Famous at the Elections"] [Text] Rome, 22 Feb (ANSA) -- A television quiz show champion; actors; ex-soccer stars; relatives of famous magistrates, industrialists and sports figures; a polemical art critic and a controversial photographer; journalists and army officers; judges and stylists; discredited members of traditional parties striking out on their own: these are some of the faces new and old that Italians will see lined up in the race for the March 27-28 elections. The first vote to take place under new first-past-the-post majority rules, which will assign 75 percent of parliamentary seats, last night officially got off to a start when the deadline expired for the presentation of candidates. The leading contenders -- the Progressive caucus on the left, National Alliance on the far right and the ephemeral alliances forged by Forza Italia claiming a stake to the center -- will be fighting tooth and nail not only against other "big guns" but also against a variety of smaller parties not everywhere allied in the same fashion, including former Christian Democrats (now called People's Party), Pact for Italy, Democratic Alliance, secessionists in northern autonomous regions, one-man single-issue parties, Communists and Greens, Catholics, populists, hard-line Fascists and disguised members of the old order. Forza Italia, created by media mogul Silvio Berlusconi, has forged an alliance in the north with the League and, in the center and south, with National Alliance, both with the goal of defeating progressive candidates. But the toughest battles will be fought in a few major cities considered strategically important for the nation's political chess-board: Bologna, Rome, Naples, Milan, Genoa, Venice, Florence, Bari, Palermo. Bologna, for decades the power base of the left, has attracted all the high-power names attempting to wrest control away from the Left Democrats and Communist Refoundation. The majority system candidates' list in Constituency 14 in fact includes Left Democrat Secretary Achille Occhetto, Ferdinando Casini (League-Forza Italia, together with conservative Christian Democrats) and the highly controversial advertizing wizard and photographer of the Benetton clothing maker, Oliviero Toscani (running under the party of former Radical Party leader Marco Pannella). Running for votes under the proportional system (for the remaining 25 percent of votes) in Bologna will be Socialist Party Secretary Ottaviano Del Turco and former Anti-Mafia magistrate Giuseppe Ayala (both Progressives). In Bologna's Emilia Romagna region the Progressives will run Libero Gualtieri, former chairman of the parliamentary investigative commission on the Ustica case, while proportional voting will see renowned actor Paolo Villaggio (with Pannella), Green MP Gianni Mattioli, Nando Dalla Chiesa (son of the police chief murdered by the Mafia in 1982), Northern League leader Umberto Bossi, National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini, trade union leader Giorgio Benvenuto. Rome, too, has attracted big guns: Budget Minister Luigi Spaventa is running with the Progressives against Go Italy creator Silvio Berlusconi himself and against Alberto Michelini of the so-called Center Pole. Another constituency in the capital will see Fini again, against Costanza Pera of the Center and Eduardo Missoni of the Progressives. Progressives running under proportional rules in Rome include Chiara Ingrao, daughter of the former Communist veteran Pietro Ingrao, again Giorgio Benvenuto and Social Catholic Alfredo Carlo Moro, younger brother of Aldo Moro, the ex-prime minister and Christian Democrat leader kidnapped and murdered by the Red Brigades in 1978. In Milan, home of the Northern League, Bossi will face off against Franco Bassanini of the Left Democrats and former soccer champion Gianni Rivera (Pact for Italy). The proportional constituencies in neighboring Mantova include former anticorruption pool investigating magistrate Tiziana Parenti (Forza Italia) and actress Ilaria Occhini (Pannella). Fourteen parties are running for the Senate in Milan, including the Party of Natural Law, the Popular Democrats and the Robin Hood Justice Movement. Moving down to Naples, where 300 candidates are running under 19 tickets, Lower House Speaker Giorgio Napolitano will try for reelection and Franca Chiaromonte, daughter of the Left Democrat MP who died last year, will try for election under the proportional system. Among the proportional list candidates are Education Minister Rosa Russo Jervolino, National Alliance MP Alessandra Mussolini (granddaughter of the Fascist dictator), Silvio Berlusconi, Ottaviano Del Turco and Marco Pannella. In Sicily, Palermo was the only city to elect Network candidate Leoluca Orlando mayor on the first ballot in November. There, two former Christian Democrats, Calogero Mannino and Rino Nicolosi, are running for the Senate in nearby Agrigento and Catania, respectively. In western Sicily Anti-Mafia judge Antonino Caponnetto and Alfredo Galasso of the Network will be running, while in eastern Sicily former Defense Minister Salvo Ando' has announced he will not seek reelection. Two curiosities in Sicily: film director Franco Zeffirelli is a candidate for Go Italy in Catania, while National Alliance has Enzo Majorca, who for decades held the water depth world record for unassisted diving. Actor Paolo Villaggio is running under the majority system for the Lower House in Genoa, where other candidates vying for proportional seats include Lower House deputy speaker Alfredo Biondi, former army chief of staff Eugenio Rambaldi (Pact for Italy) and the former champion of the television quiz show, Rischiatutto, Enzo Bottesini, running as expected with Go Italy. In Tuscany a large number of candidates are journalists but include Vittorio Cecchi Gori, president of the Fiorentina soccer club (Pact for Italy), the Siena University rector, Luigi Berlinguer, Environment Minister Valdo Spini and again Bossi and Villaggio. Turin will see among its candidates Mariella Scirea, widow of the famed soccer star, running with Go Italy, but will also include Transport Minister Raffele Costa, Labor Minister Gino Giugni, former Environment Minister Carlo Ripa Di Meana and the chairman of the Anti-Mafia Commission, Luciano Violante. Then there will also be former Defense Minister Valerio Zanone, Franco De Benedetti (Progressives), brother of Olivetti Chairman Carlo De Benedetti and the president of Azione Cattolica, Alberto Monticone. Bari, too, will have a former soccer star, Gianni Rivera (Pact for Italy), on its list of candidates, along with Massimo D'Alema of the Left Democrat Party and Vittorio Sgarbi (Forza Italia), the art critic-turned-political commentator who everybody apparently loves to hate. The former Carabinieri Police chief Antonio Viesti is also running with the Pact. The southern Puglia region will list several members of traditional parties who decided to run on their own after the onslaught of kickbacks scandals: Socialist Costantino Dell'Osso, former Christian Democrat Industry Undersecretary Luigi Farace, former Social Democratic Defense Undersecretary Antonio Bruno and former Christian Democratic MP Giuseppe Caroli. Roman Prince Francesco Sforza Ruspoli is running with a party called Southern Wind -- Viva Zapata for a post in the Puglia regional council. Venice will have Christian Democrat Rosy Bindi, Left Democrat Walter Veltroni (chief editor of the daily L'UNITA'), Elisabetta Gardini, former Republican minister Bruno Visentini all facing off under the majority system, along with journalist Lucio Manisco (Communist Refoundation). The president of the Northern League, Franco Rocchetta, is running under a ticket called Pact for Freedom, created by the League, Forza Italia and the conservative Christian Democratic Center. In Catanzaro, Calabria, art critic Sgarbi and former Communist Tiziana Maiolo are both running with Forza Italia, which is also supporting Gerardo Sacco, nicknamed "the goldsmith of the divas," in Crotone. The Pact for Italy and the People's Party together are backing the candidature of Arturo De Felice, head of the Calabria Criminapol, in Lamezia Terme, while the Progressives are supporting Simona Dalla Chiesa, daughter of Nando Dalla Chiesa.
