The Christian Democratic Union politician called on Brussels to no longer grant import permits for the ``ozone killers'' as of 1995, even if this is legal. According to Toepfer, imports of up to 26,000 tonnes of chlorofluorocarbons to the European Uniomn are again permitted this year, but only if the material is reprocessed or used. However, with this import permit, the European Union is exposing itself to the suspicion that ``in practice'' it is not taking its commitment to the protection of the ozone layer ``seriously,'' Toepfer complained. While Germany will abandon chlorofluorocarbons in 1994, Brussels is opening ``the door to imports.'' The Commission should discontinue the allotment of quotas, as soon as the production of chlorofluorocarbons is terminated all over the European Union at the end of 1994, he said. Moreover, guarantees from industry that all substances used in the meantime ``do not endanger the ozone layer'' are necessary. Behind the scolding are investigations regarding illegal chlorofluorocarbon imports from Eastern Europe to France via Germany.
