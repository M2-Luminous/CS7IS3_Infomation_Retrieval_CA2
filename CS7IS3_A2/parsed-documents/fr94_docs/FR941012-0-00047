The WIR survey also contained information on whether employees had received safety training prior to their accidents. Table 13 indicates that over one-third of the injured employees had never received training on safe work practices or in the operation of machines and vehicles used in logging operations. Only 40 percent of employees injured said they had received training from the employer. In fact, 19 percent of those injured said that whatever training they had received had come from a relative.

Table 14 shows the conditions or factors that the injured worker felt contributed to his/her accident. With regard to natural conditions, more than 30 percent said the sloping terrain and heavy brush had been a factor. In addition, 15 percent of the injured employees said that a danger tree had contributed to the accident. Human factors also contributed to accidents, according to the injured employees. More than 20 percent said that the fast speed at which they had been working contributed to their accident. OSHA notes that 10 percent of those injured were unaware of the hazards when they were injured.
