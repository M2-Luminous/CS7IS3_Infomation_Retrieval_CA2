Molusi] [Text] Johannesburg March 10 SAPA--African National Congress [ANC] Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa on Thursday [10 March] called for immediate South African Government intervention in Bophuthatswana to protect lives. Mr Ramaphosa would not be drawn on the form of intervention. ANC President Nelson Mandela would speak to State President F.W. de Klerk on Thursday about the crisis in Bophuthatswana and impress on him the urgency of taking decisive steps against the homeland, Mr Ramaphosa added. He said the crisis in Bophuthatswana was such that it could not wait for a Transitional Executive Council meeting on Monday. Mr Ramaphosa said an emergency session of the executive council might be called, but the South African Government was fully entitled to give protection to its citizens in Bophuthtastwana -- in consultation with the ANC. "We are concerned that unless action is taken immediately, we might be facing a situation which could be worse than Bisho," he said, alluding to a massacre in Ciskei in 1992. "All indications are now that it is quite possible that the security forces in Bophuthatswana will start panicking and open fire at randonm at people who are protesting legitimately for their human rights." Mr Ramaphosa said: "It is quite clear to us that (President) Lucas Mangope has put himself on a collision course with the people of South Africa as whole." The executive council had been approached by the Civil Servants Association of Bophuthatswana for talks on rationalisation, job prospects, salaries and pensions. Mr Ramaphosa said Bophuthatswana would cease to exist after April 27 and it was important that administration and government services in that area should continue.
