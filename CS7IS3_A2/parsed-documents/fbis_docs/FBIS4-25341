He said the central authorities hold that since the serious case occurred in the Qiandao Lake area, the relevant leaders there, of course, are to be held responsible to a certain degree. This person said the mainland currently practices the "one-vote negation system for comprehensive management of public order," that is to say, the performance of the leaders of a particular place is weighed against the public order of that place or against problems occurring there and their performance can be judged accordingly. It is learned that the "serious robbery, arson, and murder case at Qiandao Lake" is due to be tried by the Hangzhou City Intermediate People's Court from 10 June onward. In the incident, three suspects killed 32 people by extremely cruel means, most of whom were Taiwan tourists.
