"There have been many informal contacts with the two delegations, with Tanzanian authorities and different ambassadors who came to Arusha", said in Tanzania Moctar Gueye, spokesman for the United Nations Mission for Assistance to Rwanda (MINUAR). Booh-Booh is to travel Wednesday to Kampala to meet Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, and return the same day to Arusha, Gueye said. The interim Rwandan Government accuses Uganda of aiding the Rwandan Tutsi rebels, the Rwandan Patriotic Front. Gueye said the United Nations remained "optimistic" there might be a formal meeting of the delegations (FPR). [sentence as received] The Rwandan Government delegation is led by Transport Minister Andre Ntagerura while the rebels, who are mainly Tutsi, are led by a member of the Hutu ethnic group, Alexis Kanyarengwe. The rebels have refused to meet with the government, which they do not recognize. Jacques Bihozagara, the rebels' foreign affairs representative, reiterated this stand Tuesday saying that a ceasefire "would protect the killers."
