FR940207-1-00061 FR940207-1-00013 If a licensee requests an extension of the final compliance date based upon cost, technology may not be used as a basis for granting the extension unless the costs are grossly excessive, as measured by normal practice within the industry. EPA recognizes that the emissions from the pile may exceed the 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard pending final compliance, but believes these increases will be minimal and of limited duration. Further, a lifetime individual risk of approximately 1 in 10,000 is considered safe under the benzene policy based on 70 years of exposure. 54 FR 38044 (September 14, 1989). EPA does not anticipate the short extensions in the time to complete the radon barrier contemplated in subpart D and the proposed NRC conforming amendments to increase the maximum lifetime individual risk beyond 1 in 10,000, the level which EPA found to protect the public health with an ample margin of safety in promulgating subpart T. 54 FR 51656 (December 15, 1989). EPA believes this is consistent with the reality of short-term risks from radon emissions during the period of delay, and consistent with the risks associated with negotiated compliance agreements when non-operational sites fail to close within the two year period required by subpart T. EPA believes these emissions should not exceed those emissions which could occur under subpart T if compliance agreements had been negotiated. Extensions based upon cost will only be granted if NRC or an Agreement State finds, after providing an opportunity for public participation, that the emissions caused by the delay will not cause significant incremental risk to the public health. Additionally, a site requesting an extension based upon cost must demonstrate that it is making a good faith effort to emplace the permanent radon barrier. In many situations, where an interim cover is in place, radon emissions are significantly reduced and tailings which are wet or ponded emit no significant levels of radon. EPA would also evaluate extensions under the proposed section 61.226(c) provisions to determine whether the Agency should reconsider the rescission and seek reinstatement of subpart T, on either a programmatic or site-specific basis. Thus, under the circumstances, EPA believes affording authority for extensions of the final compliance date based upon cost is not inconsistent with protecting the public health and today's proposal. Additionally, NRC or an Agreement State may extend the date for emplacement of the radon barrier based on ``factors beyond the control of the licensee,'' as that term is implicit in the definition of ``as expeditiously as practicable.'' EPA understands that under subpart D's provisions there is no bar to NRC or an Agreement State reconsidering a prior decision establishing a date for emplacement of the radon barrier that meets the standard of ``as expeditiously as possible.'' Such reconsideration could, for example, be based on the existence of factors beyond the control of the licensee, or on a change in any of the various factors that must be considered in establishing a date that meets the ``as expeditious as practicable'' standard of §192.32(a)(3)(i). However EPA stresses that such a change in circumstances would not automatically lead to an extension. It would be incumbent on NRC or an Agreement State to evaluate all the factors relevant under §192.32(a)(3)(i) before it could change a previously established milestone or date for emplacement of the final barrier, and any new date would have to meet the standard set out in §192.32(a)(3)(i). Finally, NRC's and Agreement States' authority to reconsider previously established milestones or dates would include authority to shorten or speed up such dates, as well as extend them. EPA also expects that public participation consistent with that level of participation provided in the MOU and the settlement agreement will be afforded the public by NRC and the Agreement States in amending the licenses due to ``factors beyond the control of the licensee,'' or for any other basis. 3. NRC's Proposed Conforming Regulations As discussed previously, NRC has proposed regulations to conform appendix A of 10 CFR part 40 to EPA's general standards promulgated under UMTRCA; the proposed rule is currently in the public comment stage 58 FR 58657 (November 3, 1993). Because the public process may alter the final rule, especially since an alternative for Criterion 6A paragraph 2 was proposed, EPA believes that the adequacy of the NRC conforming regulations can only be determined after the NRC conforming regulations are finalized. In making this determination, EPA's decision will be based upon the Commission's final rule which must implement 40 CFR part 192, subpart D. EPA will determine whether NRC's regulations support rescission in its final rule to rescind subpart T. EPA is inviting comments as to whether NRC's proposed conforming regulations support EPA's proposal(s) to rescind subpart T by either adequately and appropriately implementing EPA's amendments to 40 CFR part 192, subpart D, or may reasonably be expected to do so prior to rescission of subpart T. 4. License Amendments to Date Table 1 illustrates that all NRC and affected Agreement State licenses, except one, have been modified pursuant to the MOU. Attachment A to the MOU, developed in conjunction with each site and considering the particular circumstances of that site, lists target dates for emplacement of the permanent radon barrier with ``a guiding objective that this occur to all current disposal sites by the end of 1997, and within seven years of when the existing operating and standby sites cease operation.'' 56 FR 67568 (December 31, 1991). The MOU requires NRC and the Agreement States to ``ensure .␣.␣. that cover emplacement on the tailings impoundments occurs as expeditiously as practicable considering both short-term reductions in radon releases and long-term stability of the uranium mill tailings.'' Id. The compliance schedules are to be developed consistent with the MOU targets as reasonably applied to the specific circumstances of each site with a goal that final closure occur by December 31, 1997, for those non-operational uranium mill tailings piles listed in the MOU.
