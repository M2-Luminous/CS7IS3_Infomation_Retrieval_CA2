The stress is put on the importance of CFD as an aerodynamic design tool to drastically reduce both cost and period of development. Prior to the application of CFD to practical design problem, the existing CFD codes must be verified with the reliable experimental data. A demonstrative example of CFD validation is presented to show the state of the arts of CFD by comparing the Navier-Stokes simulation results with the transonic wind tunnel test data for a NACA0012 airfoil at several angles of attack. The importance of application of CFD to inverse design problem is also discussed. 1. Role of CFD in Aircraft Development It is no exaggeration to say that the wind-tunnel test used to be the only design tool available for aerodynamic design work. We create an artificial air flow inside the wind tunnel at the same velocity as during flight, we insert a small model of analogous shape to the actual craft, and we measure the pressures on the surface of the model and the other aerodynamic forces which operate on the model as a whole, thus obtaining the data necessary for the design. However, wind-tunnel tests have to be repeated time and time again until an airfoil shape is obtained which satisfies the desired performance figures. This requires the expenditure of enormous amounts of time and money. Furthermore, due to the interference caused by the wind-tunnel walls and model supports, and to the Reynolds number effect, it is very difficult to create the same conditions of air flow inside a wind tunnel as occur in actual flight. As was pointed out early on, the influence of the Reynolds number becomes increasingly problematic in aerodynamic design as aircraft become larger and faster. But things have changed dramatically in the field of aerodynamic design in recent years with the advent of the supercomputer and the amazing developments in CFD (computational fluid dynamics). By leaving to CFD many of the things that previously had to be done in wind-tunnel tests in the aerodynamic design process, the cost and time required for model fabrication and wind-tunnel operations can now be drastically reduced. CFD is particularly well suited to parametric studies involving shape variation and the like. CFD is expected to play an increasingly large role, as compared to wind-tunnel testing, in the conceptual and preliminary design phases. At the current time, however, due to the computing times involved, almost all of the computer code used in design work that is three-dimensional is potential flow analysis code.[.sup]1[/] As a consequence, it is very difficult to evaluate aerodynamic characteristics at off-design points where viscous effects are prominent. So wind-tunnel tests are also required in the preliminary design stage. In order for Navier-Stokes code to be used freely as the design code in actual design work settings, the entire operation -- beginning with airframe shape definition, including grid generation and numerical computation of flows, and ending with the derivation of the final aerodynamic coefficients -- must be concluded within a single dat,[.sup]2[/] plus the computation time for each case for the same shape must be on the order of several minutes. Essential to achieving this will be the development of a numerical wind tunnel having functions for the automatic generation of airframe surface grids and space grids, and a computer with the power to process at 100 GFLOPS or faster. At the stage of the main design or detailed design, after the preliminary design work has been done, CFD still has a large role to play. Ordinary high-subsonic-speed transport aircraft, such as the Boeing 747 Jumbojet, are different from fighter aircraft or space planes in that the surrounding flow is in a relatively simple condition, with either little or no separation. It is in this field of aerodynamic design for airliner airframes that CFD really shows its power. 2. Wind-Tunnel Tests and CFD Reliability In Figure 1 we have a single diagram that summarizes the results of testing the NACA0012 wing shape in a typical two-dimensional wind tunnel.[.sup]3,4[/] The shock wave position (distance from leading edge taking wing chord length as 1) is plotted on the vertical axis, and the Reynolds numbers based on chord length on the horizontal axis. Despite the fact that this is a relatively simple flow under conditions of Mach 0.8, 0� angle of attack, and wing symmetry, the position of the shock wave is greatly different from wind tunnel to wind tunnel. A number of factors may cause these differences, including interference between the top and bottom and left and right wind tunnel walls, air flow bending, error in Mach number setting, model fabrication errors, and measurement errors. By looking only at this diagram there is no way in the world for us to determine which data are more correct, but McCrosky[.sup]3[/] analyzed these wind-tunnel test data and predicted that the true shock wave position must be somewhere between the two dotted lines that are parallel to the horizontal axis (i.e. between 44% and 48% of the chord length). The data of Harris (NASA) -- which is considered the most reliable wind-tunnel data and is widely cited to demonstrate CFD precision -- comes in on the upper dotted line (48% line, corrected [square] marks), while the data from the NAL two-dimensional transonic wind tunnel ([bullet] marks, corrected for wind-tunnel wall interference)[.sup]4[/] fall in between the dotted lines, even though showing some variation. (Note that when no corrections are made ([circle], [triangle] marks), the shock wave is positioned considerably upstream.) Figure 1. Shock Wave Position vs. Reynolds Number As seen in the foregoing, it is possible to considerably reduce the variation between different wind tunnels by correcting for the wind tunnel walls, but it is utterly impossible to make all the data agree. Each wind tunnel has its own peculiarities, and it is next to impossible to eliminate these. Not only this, but when the same model is retested on a different day, there is usually some disparity between the two sets of data. The problem is so-called reproducibility. What then about CFD in this respect? The situation is absolutely the same. There will be as many answers as there are people making the computations, as there are schemes used, and as there are grids. The designer does not know which data can be relied upon. Well, at least this was the situation in the early days of CFD development. But CFD has developed rapidly since those early days, and its effectiveness is now as widely recognized as its limitations. When there is either very little or no separation in the flow, so long as we use schemes and turbulence models that are reliable in the foregoing examples, for instance, almost all of the solutions are nearly the same if the number of grid points is large enough. And when it comes to reproducibility, CFD is perfect. We next turn our attention to a comparative study of CFD generated numerical solutions and wind-tunnel data on the NACA0012 airfoil. The basic equations used in the computations were the thin-layer-approximation Reynolds-average Navier-Stokes equations and, for the turbulence model, the Baldwin-Lomax algebraic model.[.sup]5[/] The scheme employed was the TVD difference method[.sup]6[/] with the Roe flux separation method modified for high precision by the MUSCL method. The computation grid adopted was the C-type grid that excels in wake resolution. In order to eliminate the grid point number dependence for the numerical solutions, when the number of grid points in the flow direction and in the direction perpendicular to the wing plane, respectively, were increased in multiples, as soon as the drag coefficient ceased to vary that was determined as the optimum grid (approximately 25,000 total grid points with this solver), and this was used in all of the computations. Moreover, unless otherwise noted, the entire flow region was considered to be turbulent. We begin with the comparison of shock wave positions. In Figure 1 are noted both the computed shock wave positions for Re = 2.1 x 10[.sup]7[/] and 1.2 x 10[.sup]6[/] ([diamond] marks). The shock waves are positioned at 48.5% for high Re numbers and at 47% for low Re numbers. From these results, we think that the true position of the shock wave is somewhat downstream of McCrosky's prediction. We next compare the NAL two-dimensional wind-tunnel data, Harris data, and McDevitt data with the computed pressure distribution at Mach = 0.8 and Alpha = 0� (cf. Figure 2). The McDevitt results agree roughly with the computations, the Harris results have the shock wave position slightly shifted, and the NAL wind-tunnel data not only have the shock wave pushed quite a bit to the fore but exhibit disagreement in terms of the pressure distribution immediately forward of the shock wave. We believe this is either due to the wind-tunnel model being made incorrectly or a failure to completely eliminate the side-wall effects. In actuality, as is indicated in Figure 3, when the model fabrication precision was enhanced, and the tests were run again with the model's aspect ratio changed to 2.0, the results ([triangle] marks) agree well indeed with the computation results. If this be so, it would seem well to do all the tests with the 2.0 aspect ratio, but a high volume of air becomes necessary when the Reynolds number becomes high, and data productivity becomes extremely poor, so this cannot always be done. Figure 2. Computed Pressure Distribution and Test Pressure Figure 3. Computed Pressure Distribution and Test Pressure The comparisons so far have had to do with such localized phenomena on the model surface as shock wave position and pressure distribution. Next let us look at the drag values where a higher order of precision is required. In Figure 4 we have plotted both the NAL and the Harris test data with the Mach number on the horizontal axis and the coefficient of drag on the vertical axis. The Harris drag is large because the Reynolds number is low, while the drag values from the NAL wind-tunnel tests are lower than the values calculated with the assumption that there is a transition at the leading edge, but agree well with the values computed when the transition point is fixed at 5%. The NAL tests were conducted with natural transitions. Figure 4. Mach Number vs. Drag Coefficient Next we take up the issue of the reliability of the results given by CFD when lift is involved. In Figure 5 we compare the theory and the experiments for Mach = 0.777 and Alpha = 1.536�. Both agree well overall, including agreement in shock wave position and intensity. (In this test we used a model having an aspect ratio of 1.5, and the computations were done with the transition point fixed at 5% of the wing chord.) However, upon closer examination, we see that there is a discrepancy between the two at the root of the shock wave. (We have already discussed the cause of the difference in pressure immediately forward of the shock wave.) This is because the shock wave and the boundary layer interfere, so that the boundary layer separates at that point and forms a small bubble above the wing surface. The Baldwin-Lomax is said to not function well for separation flows such as this, and that turns out to be the truth, but if the flow again adheres to the wing surface, then the agreement between theory and experiment again becomes good, as is evident from Figure 5. This indicates that, even if there is separation, the Baldwin-Lomax model produces good flow approximations so long as that separation is localized at the root of the shock wave. Figure 5. Computed Pressure Distribution and Test Pressure Next let us return to the comparison of aerodynamic coefficients. As can be seen from the drag polar curve in Figure 6, good agreement is indicated between experiment and theory. In particular, the values calculated with the transition point fixed 5% from the leading edge coincide perfectly with the test data. We do see some variation in the vicinity of where the lift becomes zero, but this gives us a certain index of the reproducibility of the experiment or test. Every time the test is conducted symbol-sized differences appear, but this cannot be helped. We also included the Harris data ([triangle] marks) here, but these data are not all that pertinent because the Reynolds number is different and the data have not been corrected. Figure 6. Drag Coefficient vs. Lift Coefficient Curve The foregoing has been a comparison between CFD and wind-tunnel tests with a two-dimensional airfoil. The next step naturally would be to do the comparison for a three-dimensional airfoil. Unfortunately, however, for the three-dimensional case, we have no available precision data which can be trusted or backed up by multiple wind-tunnel tests. Some of the data may provide surface pressure distributions but no drag or lift information, or if it does provide such information it is often very difficult to predict correct drag values due to the influence of model-support stings or side-wall effects. If we look only at the pressure distributions, it has already been demonstrated that the CFD results agree very well with the wind-tunnel tests so long as separation is small, as in the two-dimensional case. Next, Japan also needs to quickly play special three-dimensional experiments and tests for obtaining precision data not only on pressure distributions, but also of course on force data, on parasitic drag distributions and velocity distributions inside the boundary layer, and on wake structures, etc., all with the objective of verifying the CFD code. We would also like to see international wind-tunnel tests conducted in the interest of enhancing data reliability if this be possible. 3. CFD Application to Inverse Solution Method The discussion thus far has focused entirely on comparisons of CFD and wind tunnel test data. It should be noted that there is no difference whatever between these two methods insofar as they both simulate flows around given objects. Using CFD in this way is, of course, very important. But it should be even more important to employ CFD in trying to solve problems that are difficult or impossible with wind tunnel tests. One example of this is the inverse problem solving method that plays such a major role in wing design. An inverse problem would be to derive the cross-sectional shape of a wing from a given pressure or velocity distribution. Wind tunnels are not very amenable to such problems. Inverse solution methods are used in a wide variety of ways. They can be used, for example, 1) to pass isobars over a three-dimensional wing, 2) to designate lift distributions or moments, 3) to suppress undesirable leading edge peaks, 4) to weaken shock waves, 5) to prevent trailing-edge separation, 6) to achieve wide layer flow regions, etc., etc. Many different procedures have been proposed to date for resolving such inverse problems, but they can be roughly divided into the following three categories: 1) Direct methods in which, in principle, pressure distributions (or velocity distributions) are designated on boundaries, and then solutions that satisfy these are obtained from potential equations or from the Eulerian equations so as to derive the desired airfoil cross-sections. 2) Optimizing methods, which constitute one type of indirect method, in which the flow analysis code and optimum value problem solving code are combined, and these are used alternately and repeatedly, sequentially correcting the cross-sectional shape of the airfoil until the pressure remainder (difference between desired and calculated pressure distributions) is minimized. 3) Remainder correcting methods, which also constitute a type of indirect method, but in which an airfoil-surface correction code that is based on a shape approximated by means of fluid dynamic equations is used instead of the optimum value problem solving code. This author has already developed one inverse solution method[.sup]7[/] that belongs to this third category and which is being widely used in many quarters.[.sup]8,9[/] 4.
