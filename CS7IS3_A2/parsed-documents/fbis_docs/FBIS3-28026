Hailing the January 31 statement of a spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry in connection with the fact that the process of a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is facing a grave challenge owing to the base perfidy of the United States, the analyst says: The DPRK's stand stems from the unshakable will and faith of the Korean people who defend national dignity and sovereignty to the end, regarding it as their life and soul and do not yield to any pressure and blackmail. If the United States intend to go back on its promise to us, we will no longer be bound by the promise we made to the United States. It is a gangster-like logic that one side may reverse the promise between the two sides and the other side must keep it. We cannot sit back and watch the manoeuvers of the United States to isolate and stifle us. If the United States stick to its attitude as today, we cannot but reconsider our promises to the United States such as the unilateral suspension of the effectuation of the withdrawal from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, freeze of all the nuclear activities and renunciation of the graphite-moderated reactor system. We have never considered that the DPRK-U.S. talks is a present of the United States to us. Neither have we wanted something from it. And we are not ignorant of its ulterior intention. We have only wanted that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula would be resolved in a peaceful way as the Korean people and the world peaceloving people hoped for. This is why we have consistently insisted on negotiations with the United States. If the United States is unwilling to settle the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through talks, we have no intention to have talks. We are not indebted to the United States for anything and will be able to get on without its favor. The United States is too ridiculous, if it considers that we will beg for talks. It is not the United States alone that has the expedient and the option is not open only for a big power. We have an expedient to counter any other option of the United States. We do not like to utter empty words. It is our invariable will to mean what we say. It is the unshakable determination of the Korean people and the People's Army to defend the sovereignty of the country and the dignity of the nation to the end and we are fully prepared politically and ideologically, militarily and materially to cope with any event of contingency. The United States must not miscalculate our will and determination nor underestimate our might. It had better behave with discretion, knowing well of our people and People's Army.
