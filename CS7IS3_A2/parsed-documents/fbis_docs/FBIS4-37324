Brahimi said the meeting is part of the efforts being made to establish a cease-fire and set up the necessary mechanism for its verification. Al-Asnaj said that Egypt's position is continuing to be that of a big brother concerned about the stability of the Arab region and eager to protect pan-Arab security. He noted that President Husni Mubarak has repeatedly tried to achieve peace and end the fighting in Yemen. Al-Asnaj said: We are responding, but Sanaa is not, to the voice of reason and the virtuous call made by President Mubarak, underlined by Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan of the United Arab Emirates, and expressed by the Saudi Government. He added: If a delegation from Sanaa comes here committed to the requirements of peace, Security Council Resolution 924, and the call of conscience that prohibits a Muslim from killing his Muslim brother, it will find a full response from us. Al-Asnaj expressed hope that the Sanaa delegation will arrive and be able to make a decision that will be binding on officials in Sanaa. He said that the Aden delegation will maintain its contacts with Brahimi. We are anxious to assist his mission and make it successful, he said. He said the "Democratic Republic of Yemen" will remain in constant touch with the envoy of the UN secretary general to advise him on developments. He added: It was natural for us to come to Cairo to continue the talks to restore peace in Yemen and to observe Security Council Resolution 924, which calls on the concerned parties to stop firing immediately. We have expressed readiness to implement the resolution as soon as possible, but the government in Sanaa keeps evading the resolution and refrains from complying with it. Al-Asnaj said Sanaa has to abide by the requirements of the Security Council resolution, respond to the world community's will, and end the ongoing aggression against defenseless Yemenis. He noted that more than a month ago Sanaa said that it was a few kilometers away from Aden and that it would enter the city. He said that Sanaa will find in Aden strong resistance, valiance, and steadfastness because the entire south rejects invasion and occupation and views Sanaa troops as an occupation force that lacks any legitimate justification for its genocidal war. He said that Aden's separation announcement reflected the people's right to self-determination. If Arab political recognition has not yet been announced, he said, it is because the fraternal countries are evaluating the situation. I do not think this will take long, he said. Meanwhile, Lakhdar Brahimi said that if a delegation from Sanaa arrives in Cairo today, he will meet with it separately. A meeting between the northern and southern delegations, he said, will depend on the results of the talks with each side individually.
