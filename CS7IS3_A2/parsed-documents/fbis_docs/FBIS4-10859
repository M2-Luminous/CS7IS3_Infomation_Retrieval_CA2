Therefore, the population that lived in uncertainty and panic for many years due to the daily murder of government officials by the Shining Path is returning to tranquillity and security. Commander Jorge Fernandez, chief of the Mechanized Infantry Battalion, told EXPRESO that the pacification process in this part of the country is in progress through the fulfillment of all the plans established by the government to dismantle the small Shining Path groups that still are operating in different parts of the nation. He added that the Armed Forces -- National Police and Army -- were successful in dismantling the different Shining Path groups that were operating in the area because of the participation of the population that, far from feeling fear, reported the subversives and gave information that led to their capture. Fernandez added that another factor that led to finding out the whereabouts of top Shining Path military leaders was the delicate intelligence operation carried out for a long time with the participation of highly qualified and trained personnel to face any situation. During the last two years, the Army has dealt hard blows to subversion. According to statistics, the Army broke up 53 military and logistical commands operating in different areas, mainly in Chiquian and Callejon de los Conchucos, areas that were under Shining Path control for many years. Fernandez said: "The cooperation of the population and the peasant defense patrols was a key element in breaking up the important military commands that were operating in the different settlements of Huaraz. And now we are seeing the results." He said that in contrast with other departments in the country, in Huaraz only a small group of subversives -- seven all together -- decided to abide by the Repentance Law, because they realized that their so-called "armed struggle" failed after the capture of their highest leader, Abimael Guzman Reinoso. He added that the Army is protecting them and is fulfilling the orders given by the president through the Repentance Law. Many of those who repented have given valuable information that contributed to the capture of the main subversive leaders. Regarding the possibility that Shining Path leader Julio Cesar Mezzich may be operating in Huaraz, Fernandez said there are many reports about his presence in the area but they have not been confirmed yet. He did not discard, however, the possibility that Mezzich may be hiding in the high area of Huaraz under another name, and that this is why patrol operations are carried out in all the peasant settlements.
