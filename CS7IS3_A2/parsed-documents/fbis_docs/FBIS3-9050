Jeszenszky said the agreement was "witness to the reconciliation and alliance of two nations." It lets them rebuild a centuries-old cultural tie, helping ethnic Croats in Hungary and Hungarians in Croatia, he added. Granic stressed how Croatian Hungarians had helped Croatian freedom struggles. Jeszenszky also met President Franjo Tudjman and Prime Minister Nikica Valentic. Jeszenszky welcomed the Muslim-Croat agreement. He said Serb promises during his January Belgrade visit still remained promises, with no major gains for Hungarians in Vojvodina. "But, it may be because measures justly expected by the Hungarian minority depend on a new Serb government forming," he added. Jeszenszky later visited the aid-consignment store in Jankomir, and presented HUF [Hungarian forints] 6 million relief from the Hungarian Government. Much of the medicine and food will go to Bosnian Muslims. Jeszenszky went to a March 15 celebration of Croatia's Hungarian Democratic Community. He goes to Sarajevo on Thursday morning.
