Votes against it were cast only by 14 deputies from the Crimean Tatars," ITAR-TASS has learned by telephone from Petr Chernyakevich, the Crimean president's aide for military affairs. [no opening quotation marks as received] Chernyakevich described the parliament's decision to restore the 1992 Constitution as a correct step. "If this decision had been blackballed," Chernyakevich said, "the Ukrainian president would have obtained additional means to influence the situation on the peninsula." Speaking about the current situation in the Crimea, Chernyakevich noted that it was on the whole tranquil. In his opinion, this was largely due to the mass media, which drew public attention to Ukraine's recent steps, which could have destabilised the situation in the Crimea. At the same time, Chernyakevich noted that movements and redeployment of Ukrainian troops were spotted on the border with the Crimean republic. It is reported that the Ukrainians are setting up field hospitals and are trying to place Crimean defence units under the control of the Ukrainian National Guard. Chernyakevich also expressed anxiety about the Ukrainian president's decree to reorganise the Crimean ministries for internal affairs, security and justice into departments subordinated to the central Ukrainian ministries.
