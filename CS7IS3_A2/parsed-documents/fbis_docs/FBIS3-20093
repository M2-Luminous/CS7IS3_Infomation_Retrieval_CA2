According to the poll, 61 percent of Germans think that the SPD will win the Bundestag elections in October. In February this was the opinion of only 49 percent. Only 23 percent still think that the government coalition will win -- six percentage points less than a month before. According to the poll, approval for a potential red-green coalition at the federal level has also increased. It rose by 9 percentage points to 31 percent most recently. Another picture resulted from the question about voting behavior if elections were held next Sunday. The SPD got 39 percent -- just as much as in February. The Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union lost 1 percentage point and went down to 36 percent. The Free Democratic Party of Germany remained unchanged at 6 percent and the Alliance 90/Greens at 9 percent. The right-wing extremist Republikaner received 4 percent and the Party of Democratic Socialism, the successor of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, 3 percent.
