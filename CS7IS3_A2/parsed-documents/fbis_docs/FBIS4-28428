THE NEW YORK TIMES on June 4 wrote that as long as the spent fuel is kept in a special storage, it is possible to restore the records of how much plutonium North Korea extracted in 1989. According to a recent issue of the U.S. weekly DEFENSE NEWS, John Wolfsthal, senior associate of the Nuclear Control Association in Washington, held that the method proposed by North Korea preserves the possibility of verifying later how long fuel rods stayed in the nuclear reactor and whether Pyongyang diverted fuel to the manufacture of nuclear weapons, or not. He was quoted as saying the IAEA seems to have gone too far and concern is expressed that the agency is negatively viewing a possible solution of the issue. Core refueling itself does not mean the impossibility of the recovery of historical information, he said. NHK June 2 said the Japanese Government considers that the technical check-up of fuel rods is possible by the method proposed by North Korea.
