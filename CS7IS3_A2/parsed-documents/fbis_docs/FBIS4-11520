Could you tell us what was signed? [Aspe] Today at the U.S. Treasury Department, we signed an agreement that has, basically, three components. In the first, the reciprocal $6-billion line of support [linea de apoyo] between the United States and Mexico was ratified. In the second, Canada, forming part of a trilateral effort involving the United States, Canada, and Mexico, joins the U.S. and Mexican effort with an additional financial line of support for 1 billion Canadian dollars. The third component creates a consultation group called the Financial Group of North America [Grupo Financiero de America del Norte]. [Zabludovsky] Could you please explain the importance of these agreements? [Aspe] Regarding the reciprocal line of support, I have two comments. The first one is that the reciprocal line of support with the United States was ratified, and now it has been made permanent; this is what is important. These lines of support existed before, but they were temporary and had fixed deadlines. Now, fortunately, within the framework of an atmosphere of cooperation as equals, we have been able to make this $6-billion line of support permanent. Second, Canada's participation, also on a permanent basis, represents big support. Previously, we had a 200-million Canadian dollar line of support with Canada; this has been multiplied by five and now amounts to more than 1 billion Canadian dollars. The third component, and perhaps the most important, is that this financial group, called the Financial Group of North America, has been created. The three finance secretaries and the three directors of the central banks of these three countries will meet periodically to coordinate macroeconomic policies and to make economic and financial consultations. This is a most important step in this era of global and interrelated markets. [Zabludovsky] Has Mexico used the U.S. $6-billion line of support? [Aspe] No. Fortunately, we have not had to use it. We could have been using it since 25 March, but we have an adequate level of reserves, and for this reason we have not drawn from this line. [Zabludovsky] The creation of this group, which goes into effect today, reminds me of what was done in Europe with the creation of a credit and monetary unit. Is there any similarity? [Aspe] Yes. A financial group similar to the one the United States, Canada, and our country created today was created by the European countries some time ago. During the first phase, which is the only one to which we have committed ourselves so far, we will exchange information and make consultations on macroeconomic matters. In Europe, this eventually resulted, as we all know, in the European central banks' offering each other total support. We are in the first phase that involves more interrelation and periodic meetings. The deputy directors of the central banks and the under secretaries of the three treasury departments will meet four or five times a year. The heads of the central banks and the finance secretariats, or treasury departments, will meet at least once a year to coordinate our policies. This is very important for Mexico because in this way we will have access to key information, considering that both the United States and Canada are members of the Group of Seven, and, therefore, we can secure a lot of information within the framework of this new relation between the two countries. [Zabludovsky] I want to take advantage of my conversation with you to broach a Mexican domestic problem. As a result of the tragic and cruel death of Luis Donaldo Colosio, financial markets have been upset; how has this affected Mexico? [Aspe] Domestic markets were obviously negatively affected as a result of the brutal and unfair assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio. Furthermore, two virtually concurrent events took place abroad, which I would like to comment on later to explain how the Salinas administration handled the situation. The two negative events that took place abroad are that during the first few months of 1994, interest rates in the United States increased considerably. You may recall that long-term interest rates in the United States were approximately 5 to 5.5 percent only three months ago, and at present they are well above 7 percent, meaning interest rates have increased in the United States, and this has had negative repercussions throughout the world and, of course, in Mexico. The second negative international occurrence we have encountered is that the stock markets of all the emergent economies -- the word emergent has been used to describe countries such as Chile, Thailand, Malaysia, Argentina and, of course, Mexico -- suffered considerable reductions during the first few months of the year. This was due in part to the fact that many of the investment funds that purchase shares on the emergent international markets did so -- to use the jargon of economists -- through connections [apalancados]; in other words, they did so with loans to purchase shares. When shares increase in value there is no problem, but when they lose value these international funds have to sell shares to maintain their collateral and guarantees, intensifying the downward trend. This is why markets in Thailand dropped 30 percent, 25 percent in Malaysia, and the same happened in Argentina, Chile, and Mexico. There can be no question, however, the hardest blow to the economy was the tragic death of Luis Donaldo Colosio. [Zabludovsky] What has the government done to deal with these three events: the increased interest rates, the problems on the emergent markets in general, and the dramatic domestic situation. [Aspe] The Salinas administration has done the following: First, it allowed markets to adjust themselves; by this I mean the stock market first made a downward adjustment in an orderly manner. Suffice it to say there were no irregularities in this considerable adjustment of the first few months of the year; instead, it was a mature and orderly adjustment. Second, interest rates were allowed to increase on money markets, thus raising the interest rates, which had gradually dropped over the past few months until they were below 9 percent, and then they increased and doubled until they reached 18 percent. Third, the exchange rate within the range of the agreement depreciated to the very lowest point of that range, to approximately 8.5 percent. Fourth, we activated the so-called lines of reciprocal support between the central banks of the United States and Mexico and between the two countries' treasuries for the amount of $6 billion. Fifth and sixth, and quite importantly, firm fiscal policies were maintained. We have a nonfiscal deficit mandate from Congress and we have held firm to guarantee that in 1994 we will not have any fiscal deficit whatsoever. To conclude, the central bank, the now autonomous Bank of Mexico, has observed a cautious monetary policy; in other words, it has not resorted to the easy way out. We know how easy and painful it was in the past to mint bills and to attempt to say there was no problem. We have handled the situation with a cautious monetary policy. It is obvious markets can be adjusted, and that has been our economic policy. The initial effect is that we have been able to absorb most of the uncertainty with measures such as these. As the days go by, we obtain more information and because the instruments of economic policy are already at work, we can begin to reverse these phenomena. Thus, the Mexican stock market hit bottom and then gradually began to rise, with market decisions and without state intervention. Interest rates, which had doubled, as I said earlier, are decreasing gradually yet consistently. We have thus dealt with such negative effects with an economic policy which exhibits vision, direction, control and which expresses President Salinas' economic policy. [Zabludovsky] Will the dollar exchange rate remain within range, or might there be some trauma? [Aspe] What we have observed over the past few days is that the exchange rate went from the lower levels of the range to the higher levels with a depreciation of approximately 8.5 percent and remained there for several days. What I have observed over the past few days is that there has been a slight (?reevaluation) of the exchange rate. Why? Because we are distributing the adjustment so that it will not focus solely on the exchange rate. Partial adjustments must be conducted on interest rates, fiscal policy, monetary policy, and the exchange rate; this is why, over the past few days, we have seen an initial reversal of the trends we observed a week ago. [Zabludovsky] Do you believe the goals of the agreement pertaining to inflation and the recovery of Mexico's development and progress can be maintained? There was talk of 5-percent inflation. Do you believe that is still a feasible goal? [Aspe] Of course. Last year, between December 1992 and December 1993, we had 8-percent inflation. In the agreement, in fact, we set a goal of 5-percent inflation for this year. I have already been informed that during the first three months of 1994 -- you, in fact, have disclosed the figures for March -- we have had an annual inflation rate between March 1993 and March 1994 of 7 percent. This means that we have gone from 8 percent to 7 percent and that it is obvious that to the extent to which we adhere to our economic policy, inflation will continue to decrease, and we will virtually achieve the goal we set for ourselves in the agreement. Meanwhile, from the economic recovery standpoint, recovery began once NAFTA was signed last November. We have seen a gradual increase in industrial production; it has been gradual, nothing spectacular, but it has been consistent in December, January, and February. We must acknowledge these things. When all the events I described earlier took place and interest rates jumped, our recovery could have been affected, but to the extent fiscal and monetary policies are maintained, to the extent we are able to distribute these negative effects among various instruments as we have done, to that extent the increase in interest rates will be temporary, and, therefore, its effects on our recovery will be passing. Once interest rates return to their normal level, recovery will continue. I believe we have seen negative effects, an active economic policy, firmness, direction and temporary effects, but I believe we will be able to prevent this from having a permanent effect on recovery. [Zabludovsky] Can you speak with full confidence in Mexico's financial and economic future? [Aspe] The word confidence is something that is obtained gradually over a span of years. It is obtained by persistence and consistency. I especially believe confidence is earned not only during easy times when everything is going well. I believe President Salinas' economic policy has succeeded at times when things were not going our way, when there were such negative, sad, and painful events, such as those at the end of the first quarter. Nevertheless, the fact we have not made violent changes, that we have stayed on our course and displayed consistency and perseverance will earn us the people's confidence, and in the end will allow the markets to play their roles and prevent these incidents from doing permanent damage to the country.
