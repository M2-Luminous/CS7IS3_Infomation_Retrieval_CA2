FBIS3-38687 "drweu025_h_94023" FBIS-WEU-94-025 Document Type:Daily Report 7 Feb 1994 GERMANY Federal Office Watches Republikaner in Lower Saxony AU0702123494 Hamburg DER SPIEGEL in German 7 Feb 94 p 53 AU0702123494 Hamburg DER SPIEGEL Language: German Article Type:BFN [Unattributed report: "Watchers From Cologne"] [Text] Lower Saxony's Republikaner are now being watched by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV). This is the BfV's reaction to a court ruling that prohibited colleagues from the Lower Saxony Office for the Protection of the Constitution to watch Franz Schoenhuber's rightist-populist party. The background: The red-green Lower Saxony has a particularly restrictive constitutional protection law. According to the ruling, the Land Office may use intelligence service means against political parties only if these parties struggle against the Basic Law in a "militant and aggressive manner." The BfV is affected neither by the land law nor by the negative ruling.
