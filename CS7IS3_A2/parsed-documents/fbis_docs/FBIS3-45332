Under the agreement, signed here during the summit meeting between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and U.S. President Bill Clinton, the U.S. will buy 500 tons of highly enriched uranium from dismantled nuclear warheads. As many as 20,000 nuclear warheads would have to be dismantled in Russia and Ukraine to provide the agreed amount of enriched uranium to the United States, which plans to distribute it for use among its 15 nuclear reactors. Russia will receive foreign currency from the transaction, and Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan will share in the profits. "The agreement means a real move toward genuine nuclear disarmament," Russian Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov said, while the U.S. pointed out that this will be the first time in history that disarmament brings profit to some countries. Announcement of the uranium sale followed the nuclear disarmament agreement between the United States, Russia, and Ukraine signed by Clinton, Yeltsin and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk earlier today.
