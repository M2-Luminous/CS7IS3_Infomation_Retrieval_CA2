Shops were closed in these camps and black flags were raised to mourn the righteous Palestinian martyrs. The factions affiliated with the Alliance of the Palestinian Forces in Syria decided to receive condolences for three days, as of today, Saturday, in the al-Yarmuk branch of the Palestinian Youths. Palestinian popular organizations and masses today staged sit-ins at the offices of the International Red Cross, the United Nations, the Arab League, and the PLO in Damascus. They handed protest memorandums to the representatives of these organizations on this terrible massacre. The memorandums urged the international organizations and community to move swiftly to stop the massacres against the Palestinian people, to carry out their duties and safeguard the lives of innocent people, and to implement the international resolutions which call for protecting people under occupation. The Palestinian organizations' memorandums stressed that the new massacre will not prevent the Palestinian people from continuing their just struggle until they achieve all their objectives.
