It notes that the IAEA has left a disgraceful stain on its name by launching an anti-DPRK campaign, contrary to its competence and mission. The article entitled "Indelible Stain and Disgrace" cites facts to prove that some officials of the IAEA Secretariat took a threatening posture from the very beginning in a bid to overwhelm the DPRK and stubbornly demanded an unreasonable "special inspection" and worked for an international "pressure and sanctions", serving specific forces as their spy. It says: The IAEA made six ad hoc inspections of the DPRK from May 1992 to early February 1993. At the time of the fourth ad hoc inspection in November 1992 some officials of the IAEA Secretariat urged the DPRK to "declare more" of the inventory of nuclear material, threatening that "it is the last chance of correcting the initial inventory", "if the chance were missed, tragic consequences would follow." They behaved very insolently during the inspections, threatening the DPRK over the "principal inconsistency" even before hearing a scientific explanation from experts. All this tells that they have sought from the very beginning to overpower the DPRK with a threatening attitude. Some officials of the IAEA Secretariat also served specific forces as their spy. The IAEA Secretariat, complying with the demand of specific forces, tried to send as its inspectors those whom we considered as personae non gratae. The agency's inspectors in the DPRK also acted on orders from those behind the scene, making inquiries into this or that in an effort to pry out secrets. All the more exasperating was that they handed inspection results over to the United States, South Korea and others in violation of Article 5 of the safeguards agreement that provides for protection of the data obtained in inspections. This was a grave encroachment upon the interests of the DPRK. IAEA's inspections of the DPRK are characterized from a to z by partiality. On December 22, 1992, the IAEA general director requested being allowed to "revisit" some military sites. The DPRK was not obligated to show them the sites and facilities which were no more objects of safeguards, but showed them, taking various aspects into consideration. Nevertheless, some dishonest officials worked hard to attain their sinister aim by abusing the sincere cooperation offered by the DPRK. The DPRK rejected it decisively. On February 25, the IAEA general director convened a meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors, which adopted a "resolution on special inspection" of ordinary military sites of the DPRK. This was something unprecedented in the history of inspections by the agency. And the IAEA Board of Governors adopted an unjustifiable "resolution" against the DPRK on June 10 when reactor core refueling was under way at the DPRK's five megawatt experimental atomic power plant. The dishonest officials of the IAEA Secretariat took the DPRK's "nuclear issue" even to the United Nations in an effort to gratify their wicked aim by "internationalizing" it and imposing collective "pressure and sanctions" on the DPRK. The IAEA Board of Governors last year adopted one "resolution" after another to transfer the DPRK's "nuclear issue" to the UN and submitted even "an annual report" to the UN General Assembly. They went the length of faking a "letter" of the UN secretary-general. Who can trust the IAEA which is behaving like this? We will never tolerate any act of infringing upon our national sovereignty and supreme interests of our country. The IAEA must know clearly that whatever intrigue it may hatch up to stifle the DPRK, it will only bring a stain and disgrace to itself.
