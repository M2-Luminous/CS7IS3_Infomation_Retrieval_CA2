FBIS3-46929 "dreas003__a94001" FBIS-EAS-94-003-A Document Type:Daily Report 5 January 1994 ANNEX Japan U.S. Firm Wins Contract To Build Satellite OW3012222793 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 25 Dec 93 Morning Edition p 8 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW3012222793 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] On 24 December, the Broadcast Satellite System Corporation [BSSC] (based in Shibuya, Tokyo, with Toshio Kataoka as president), announced that it awarded a contract to U.S. Hughes Corporation to build the BS-4, Japan's next-in-line broadcast satellite. The BSSC, which has been set up for the purchase of broadcast satellites, is funded by the Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK) and other investors. Originally, the cost of one such satellite was thought to be around 10 billion yen. Although the contracted purchase price was not disclosed, it is believed to be considerably below this figure. This is the first time the Hughes Corporation has won a contract for building a Japanese broadcast satellite. A consortium consisting of the U.S. Martin Marietta Corporation, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, and NEC Corporation was initially considered the likely winner of the procurement bid, but wound up losing. In addition to the Hughes Corporation and the Martin Marietta consortium, the U.S. Space Systems Loral (SSL) Corporation was another participant in the bid for procurement of the BS-4. Japanese firms had given up on entering the bid as main contractors due to such problems as cost and the length of lead time for delivery. Among major Japanese satellite makers, however, Mitsubishi and NEC entered the bid in a consortium with Martin Marietta, and the Toshiba Corporation similarly entered the bid in a consortium with the SSL. Since the Hughes Corporation entered the bid alone, Japanese firms have been completely cut off from the project to build the BS-4. The new broadcast satellite will replace the BS-3, which is currently utilized by NHK and the Japan Satellite Broadcasting Incorporated (operator of the WOWOW channel). It is the third satellite the procurement of which became subject to international tender since Japan and the United States concluded an agreement in 1990 to open the satellite market. The main satellite and a backup spare unit are scheduled to be launched in the summer of 1997 and the summer of 1998, respectively. They are said to be designed with an expected lifespan of over 10 years. Originally, the general consensus was that the Martin-Mitsubishi-NEC consortium would be the likely winner of the procurement contract for the BS-4, since Martin Marietta has taken over the aerospace department of the General Electric Company (GE), which has so far monopolized the Japanese broadcast satellite market. Concerning reasons for Hughes Corporation's advance into the Japanese market, a majority of sources concerned believe "the fact that Hughes was able to offer a much better price than Martin Marietta was the decisive factor in the former's emerging victorious in the bid."
