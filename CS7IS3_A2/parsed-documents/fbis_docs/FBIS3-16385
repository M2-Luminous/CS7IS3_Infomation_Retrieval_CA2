Between 1991 and 1993, 25 percent of all weapons -- 531 tanks, 422 infantry vehicles, and 140 aircraft -- had to be eliminated. In 1993, the total export of weapons abroad stood at $29 million, while the total export of goods -- at $5.508 billion [as published]. The specific proportion of weapons exported as part of total exports is 25 percent. As for Ukraine, it sold tanks to Slovakia and Russia for the sum of $575,000; aircraft, including satellites and missile-carriers, for $5,199,000, and radio guidance equipment for $3,651,000. In addition, military and rescue vessels were sold to Russia and Greece for a total of $721,000. Bombs, grenades, torpedoes, missiles, and cartridges made up the greatest portion of military exports ($9,772,000). Ukraine sold ships as scrap-iron to Turkey, Russia, and Britain for $579,000. It is difficult to comment on the benefits of this trade for Ukraine, because there is no official data on the total amount of weapons traded. We learned from sources close to the president that Ukraine sold 80 tanks. We know that the latest model T-80T, which is being produced in Kharkov, costs more than $2 million. The cost of this tank as scrap-iron is $4,000 (one tonne of scrap-iron sells for $100). We would like to add that in 1992, the Commercial Center within the Ukrainian Defense Ministry traded 13 military vessels as scrap-iron. The Ukrainian state coffers received only 5 percent from the sale of this scrap-iron. The Commercial Center was later disbanded.
