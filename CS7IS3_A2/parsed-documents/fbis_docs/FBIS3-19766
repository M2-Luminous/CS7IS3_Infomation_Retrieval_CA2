This was learned from reports by the people affected and by the German Embassy in Istanbul on Monday. Turkey had previously declared "observers" from Germany "unwanted." In Cizre, in southeastern Turkey, one of the main sites of the fights between the militant Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK) and the security forces, about 20 Germans were stuck in their hotel on Monday. According to them, their passports had been confiscated and would be returned only if they agree to leave the region. Angelika Langehl-Weyrer of the North Rhine-Westphalian land association of the Greens said they are permitted to move around freely and have not been arrested, but the streets are "full with military and police" and it has been "recommended" that they stay in the hotel. Another group of 17 Germans, who were taken from Igdir in eastern Turkey to Erzurum on Sunday, were on their way back to Igdir on Monday afternoon, according to information provided by German diplomatic circles. They, too, had had their passports taken away. It was unclear on Monday how many German groups, including politicians of the Social Democratic Party and Greens, trade union representatives, and employees of relief organizations and human rights groups, are in the region. "However, the situation is calm and we do not have any reports that the Germans are in danger," a spokesman of the German Embassy in Ankara said. A group of 52 Germans who had been sent back from Van in eastern Turkey to Istanbul over the weekend did not rule out another attempt to go to the region of unrest. A spokesman for the group said the three Kurdish interpreters, who had accompanied them from Germany and whom the Turkish police wanted to arrest, have "disappeared without trace." "The three have not been arrested; they said good-bye to us voluntarily, after the German Embassy did not guarantee that they could return to Germany with us." [sentence as received]
