Jointly with the Information Service, the BMFT is devising a "program - implementation of assistance - founders of firms" sequence. It is by means of the TOU model experiment that the Federal Ministry of Research and Technology (BMFT) aims to have technological enterprises established in the new Federal States. The assistance extends over the length of time it takes an enterprise to develop its eventually profitable product and thus over the lean initial period of its existence. Not only funds for product development but also advice on organizing an enterprise and raising private capital for product marketing are made available at that time. By last August 183 such innovative enterprises have thus been assisted with a total sum of about 123 million DM. New top-notch workshops have been built. The results of earlier research done in the GDR (German Democratic Republic) are being successfully converted into novel products. So far most projects originate in measurement, medical, and processing practice. Next in numbers are projects in the fields of microelectronics, software tools, environmental engineering, optics, and biotechnology. What has been learned from the model experiment is that the enterprise founders are by far highly qualified persons (see diagram). The distribution of enterprises among the new Federal States duplicates the distribution of previous research and industrial sites among them. At the top is Saxony, followed by East Berlin, and Thuringia. Database Diagram (Pie Chart): 377 enterprise founders in second phase of approved projects: 1. no data available (8.2%) 2. others (no education, some study completed, military training) (5.0%) 3. professional education (technical, manual trade, business) (3.7%) 4. technician (1.9%) 5. graduate economist or industrial management specialist (1.1%) 6. graduate engineer, physicist, chemist, et al. (41.4%) 7. other degrees (2.1%) 8. engineering degree (36.6%) Not surprisingly, there remain gaps in knowledge of and experience in industrial management and marketing techniques. The enterprise founders try to close these gaps by continuing their education or by measuring up to Western partners endowed with relevant skills. They are aided here by consultations with TOU-Project carriers and by seminars organized by them. In the meantime, a great many thus assisted enterprises have completed their development stage and have begun marketing their products. A quite encouraging picture emerges here: The first firms among them are slowly gaining a foothold on the German market and on the international market as well.
