Co-op farmers across the country have grown sturdy maize seedlings for reaping a bumper maize harvest again this year. They do farming on a scientific and technical basis on the principle of the right crop in the right time and the right crop on the right soil. This year, too, they began transplanting humus-potted maize seedlings all at once as the right time came. Rural communities now are overfulfilling daily quotas by use of various highly-efficient machines including tractors and fertilizer-spraying machines. The transplanting of humus-potted maize seedlings is one of the important farming processes in Korea.
