French European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure said there was "one chance in two" that the two sides would meet their March 1 deadline for completing the negotiations so that the candidates can join the Union next January 1. Austria refused to accept EU demands that it shorten an 11-year accord which restricts polluting truck traffic across the Austrian Alps and would contravene the Union's regulations on free movement. The candidate countries gave a cool reception to a Brussels compromise whereby European Community funds would boost development in sparsely-populated Arctic areas but to a lesser extent than in poor areas in existing EC countries. Finland and Norway protested that this was not good enough, since these areas would get 10 percent less than struggling regions of existing EC members despite the special problems of Arctic farmers. "We are not pleased with the EC position on Nordic agriculture," Norway's Trade and Shipping Minister Grete Knudsen, told journalists. Some EC countries, particularly Spain, opposed the applicants' pleading for special treatment and exemptions from the Union's trade and aid regulations. The EC countries could not agree on demands from Spain and Portugal for access to Norway's fish-rich waters. France and Ireland insisted on curbs against imports of cheap Norwegian fish. "Fish will occupy us right up to the end of negotiations unless the god of the sea, Poseidon, helps us and that would be a miracle," said Greek European Affairs Minister Theodoros Pangalos, who is chairing the negotiations. Brussels turned down Sweden's demand that it be allowed to gradually phase in annual payments of around 857 million dollars a year to the EU budget over five years, instead of being liable immediately on entering the Union. All sides are pushing for maximum advantage as the year-long negotiations approach their climax at a marathon negotiating session next weekend, with the hardest issues still unresolved. Finnish Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen was upbeat. "We have moved forward today quite considerably," he said. But Austrian Transport Minister Viktor Klima warned that the talks could collapse if the EC insisted on loosening restrictions on trans-Alpine truck traffic through Austria in accordance with its rules on free movement. He said the Austrian position had been strengthened by a referendum in Switzerland last Sunday where a majority of voters decided that all foreign truck traffic should be put on trains after 2004. Pangalos suggested that the two sides might find a compromise date to terminate the trans-Alpine accord some time after 1997, the date suggested by the EC, but before it expires officially on December 31, 2003. Austria, Finland and Norway all objected to Brussels' insistence that they lower their heavily-subsidised agricultural prices to EC levels in one fell swoop upon entering the Union. The applicant countries are asking that the high prices, necessary to subsidise farmers in icy and low-yielding Arctic and Alpine regions, be phased out gradually, and that the EC help to compensate farmers for the change. Austria and Finland announced one major concession. They agreed that any local restrictions on the purchase of holiday homes would have to be non-discriminatory, so that they apply to locals as well as foreigners.
