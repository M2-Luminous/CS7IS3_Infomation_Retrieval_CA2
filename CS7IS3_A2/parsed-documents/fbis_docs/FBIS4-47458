Putin, Chemistry SRI, Tambov, Chemical Machine Building Institute, Tambov; UDC614.894] [Abstract] In a previous work, a mathematical model was presented for an individual respiratory device having a reciprocating type system of air movement. Another group of individual respirators employs a cyclic system, where the exhaled air passes through a layer of regenerative product into a breathing bag; on inhalation, the air passes from the breathing bag to the face mask. The advantage of the cyclic system over that of the reciprocating system lies in a lower temperature of the inhaled air and less respiratory resistance, thereby improving the ergonomic characteristics of the device. Due to the two-way passage of air through the regenerative product in the reciprocating devices, the regeneration process is intensified, and for this reason these devices received greater dissemination. However, this advantage holds only for relatively small devices. The proposed model may thus be used to determine which system of air movement is most effective in any given case. In the present work the model was expanded to include devices designed to the cyclic system of air movement and used to compare the two systems. Figures 2; references 2 (Russian).
