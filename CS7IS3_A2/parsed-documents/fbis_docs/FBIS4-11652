Addressing a joint press conference in New Delhi today, the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, said representatives of the leaders of the group will meet to formulate their stand. Replying to a question on putting up of new conditions on trade outside the framework of GATT, the Malaysian prime minister, Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, said that the developing countries have to adopt a common stand on such extraneous issues. He deplored the tendency of the rich countries to impose restrictive practices, including quota system and Super 301. Referring to the problem of quorum at G-15 summit, Mr. Narasimha Rao said a proposal was discussed to make it more flexible. Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said the absence of some leaders of the summit should not be interpreted as loss of interest in the forum. He said it is difficult to get all the heads of state at one place at a particular time. The Argentinian president, Dr. Carlos Menem, expressing total support for the meet, said commerce and trade should be made much more transparent. Mr. Rao described the three-day summit as successful. The joint communique issued at the end of the summit has called for setting up a monitoring mechanism to protect the interest of the developing countries while carrying out the new GATT accord. It also called for expansion of both the permanent and nonpermanent membership of the UN Security Council on democratic lines to give representation to the developing countries. Describing terrorism as one of the most dangerous threats to human rights, it urged the international community to cooperate in effectively combating the menace. The seven-page communique welcomed the conclusion of the Uruguay Round and expressed the hope that it will lead to the creation of a nondiscriminatory multilateral trading system and expansion of trade, especially for the developing countries. Expressing concern over moves to bring in new issues like label standards and trade negotiations, the G-15 leaders urged the developed countries to refrain from actions which will affect the balance in the global trading system. On restructuring the UN, the communique said a stable formula should be devised to establish appropriate and dynamic interaction between the Security Council and the General Assembly. The summit called for revitalization of the dialogue with the G-7 advanced nations to find meaningful solutions to acute problems like poverty, population growth, environment, and development. Referring to South-South cooperation, the communique said impressive progress made by some developing countries reinforces its rationale. The summit called for a comprehensive approach to solve the debt problem faced by some developing countries. Argentina will host the fifth summit next year, while Zimbabwe will host the sixth.
