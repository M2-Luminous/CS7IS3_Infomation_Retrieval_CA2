Nine months ago, President Yeltsin and I met in Vancouver and there we laid the foundation for the new partnership of the United States and Russia, a partnership based on mutual respect. We have just concluded an excellent and productive summit in which we took important steps to strengthen this partnership. I thank President Yeltsin and all his team for hosting us and for making these days so productive. Throughout our discussions I reaffirmed U.S. firm support of Russia's commitment to democracy and transition to market economy. I informed President Yeltsin that the United States has prepared specific projects worth $1.6 billion of aid, and I announced in Vancouver that we had already expended 70 percent of that sum. The president and I also discussed an additional $2.5 billion in aid for Russia and for other independent states that my administration offered in Tokyo in April, and that the Congress fully funded in September. The president gave me strong assurances of his intention to continue the reform process, and we discussed a number of ways in which the United States and the international community can help in promoting the reforms, and at the same time to assist Russia in cushioning the social hardships which the reform has brought to many people in Russia. Concrete expression of the assistance of the United States to the reforms is that the United States is opening the doors this year to the Russian small enterprise fund. It has established a fund supporting large enterprises entering the private sector. This fund will be chaired by the former secretary of treasury Michael Blumenthal. We also signed a contract to purchase $12 billion worth of enriched uranium within the next 20 years, and I have asked the Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown to lead a very high-level trade mission to Russia in March, including presidents of major companies who will be in position to promote trade and investment in Russia. We issued today also a joint statement on human rights, in which we express our common goal to combat discrimination and all forms of racial intolerance, including anti-Semitism. Today I also had an opportunity to describe further the results of the successful NATO summit this week, and President Yeltsin assured me that Russia will be a full participant in Partnership for Peace. We took several historic steps to make sure that the fear of nuclear confrontation be in the realm of the past. Presidents Yeltsin and Kravchuk and I signed an agreement which commits Ukraine to scrap approximately 1,500 nuclear warheads, all the most modern and dangerous missiles in Ukraine, the SS-24. The warheads will be removed from those over a period of 10 months. President Yeltsin and I agreed that as of 30 May, the nuclear missiles of Russia and the United States would not be targetted against any country. Third we signed an agreement to work closely in those areas where the danger of nuclear weapons proliferation is the greatest, including the Middle East. We also agreed that the sovereignty and the independence of Russia's neighbors must be respected. I expressed my hope that Russia's talks with Estonia and Latvia would lead to the withdrawal of troops in 1994. As President Yeltsin has said, I agreed that it should be stressed that the rights of the Russian-speaking population should be respected in all areas. Let me close by reminding you that President Yeltsin and I agreed to meet at the NATO summit in Naples in July, and I am pleased that he accepted my invitation to make a state visit to the United States this fall. I'm looking forward to the meetings. I came to Europe with the hope of starting to build a new security founded upon a common commitment to democracy, free economics and mutual respect for security and territorial borders. I came with a dream that with the end of the cold war we might all be able to work together to make a Europe that would be integrated politically, economically and in terms of security. A Europe that for the first time since the establishment of nation states would not be divided by the present conflicts or lingering animosities. I now believe we have a better chance to create that kind of security, a security in which great nations would be able to treat each other as genuine partners, and chart their own futures, without being dictated to by others. A future in which, I believe, greatness would be defined fundamentally by our capacity to enable the men, women and children who live within our borders to live up to the full extent of their capacities. I thank President Yeltsin for his partnership and endeavor, and I assure you that we will continue to work as hard as we can towards this vision.
