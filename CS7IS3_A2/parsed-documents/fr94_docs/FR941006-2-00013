PEGI is under the purview of the Committee on the Environment and Natural Resources Research (CENR) which is under the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC). On November 23, 1993, President Clinton established by executive order the cabinet-level NSTC to coordinate science, space, and technology policies throughout the Federal Government. An important objective of the NSTC is to establish clear national goals for Federal science and technology investments and to ensure that science, space, and technology policies and programs are developed and implemented to effectively contribute to those national goals. CENR will advise and assist the NSTC to increase the overall effectiveness and productivity of Federal R&D efforts in the area of the environment and natural resources improving the coordination of all Federal environmental and natural resource research and development and the link between science and policy. PEGI's purpose is to foster and facilitate earth and natural resource research interactions and collaborative efforts between the private sector and Federal Government. dates: Applications will be accepted until December 9, 1994. addresses: Please send applications by either mail or Federal Express to: Dr. William S.
