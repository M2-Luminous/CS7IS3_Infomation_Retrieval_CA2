Turkmen gas supplies are said to have reached a daily average of 53 million cu. m. According to Bogdan Babiy, chief engineer of Ukrgazprom's dispatching service, Turkmen gas supplies during the early days since their resumption exceeded 75 to 80 million cu. m. a day, but presently have been temporarily reduced to 20 to 25 million cu. m. a day. According to the Ukrgazprom spokesperson, within the 13 through 20 May period Turkmenistan piped 377.5 million cu. m. of natural gas to Ukraine, which was by 160.8 million cu. m. less than the agreed figure. The issue of Ukrainian indebtedness extinguishment remains unsettled with charges for gas transit across Russia's territory posing as a major problem. The latter was supposed to be negotiated by the two interested parties on 19 May, but the talks were postponed to 24 May. However, on 19 May the Ukrainian side did have talks with Russia's Gazprom officers, which focused on progress made in extinguishing Ukraine's fuel indebtedness to Russia following a scheme, which was adopted on 12 April 1994. As of 22 May 1994, Ukraine's debt to Gazprom stood at about 600 million US dollars. According to Mikhail Kovalko, chairman of the State Committee for oil and gas, non-payment by Ukrainian gas consumer enterprises resulted in their aggregate debt to the tune of 15 trillion krb. (or about 300 million USD). Enterprises under the Ministries of industry, engineering, MIC [military industrial complex] and conversion, and the State Committee for communal services and public utilities, are among major fuel debtors, which the Ukrainian government has repeatedly admonished for failing to repay their gas debts as prescribed. Speaking at a recent Cabinet session acting premier Yukhym Zvyahilskyy threatened to apply extremely harsh measure to the non-payer enterprises including terminated gas supplies, bringing them to court of arbitration, etc. The government's earlier resolution said, in particular, that responsibility for any consequences, which might ensue from these measures, would rest entirely with culprit enterprise managers. According to Mr. Kovalko, on 19 May gas supplies were either drastically curtailed or altogether suspended to as many as 1,300 state-run enterprises. However, as Mr. Kovalko maintains, the enterprises are supposed to cope with the gas debt repayment problem in a matter of days, which will allow the State Committee for oil and gas to significantly reduce its own indebtedness to Russia's Gazprom. Incidentally, Mr. Kovalko is expected to top the VR Committee for Ukraine's fuel and power complex. In the meantime, Russian natural gas flow to Ukraine has not subsided with daily natural gas piping averaging over 585 million cu. m., according to Ukrgazprom, which is within the agreed supply amounts. Over the 13 May through 20 period, 4,095.2 million cu. m. of Russian natural gas were piped to Ukraine. As Mr. Kovalko disclosed, stable Russian natural gas supplies and resumed Turkmen gas piping allowed Ukragazprom to start piping the planned natural gas amounts to Ukraine's underground storages to pool reserve stocks, since Ukraine's domestic consumption of natural gas within the same period was 1,310.9 million cu. m. only with averaged daily consumption of about 187.27 million cu. m. According to Mr. Kovalko, as of 20 May, about 2 b. cu. m. of natural gas were piped into underground storaging facilities. However, this is a meager fraction of the required 30 b. cu. m. stock. Moreover, Ukrgazprom's action was belated in view of lacking means to pay for imports, whereas the unsettled issue of payment with both Russian and Turkmen natural gas exporters makes the situation a shaky one and fraught with the danger of gas supply discontinuance, maybe, without further notice.
