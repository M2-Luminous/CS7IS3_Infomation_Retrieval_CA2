Four were killed in incidents with IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers and one by fire directed by a settler whose vehicle was stoned. Over 40 people were wounded in the incidents in the territories throughout the day. Also, 13 soldiers and border policemen were lightly wounded in the incidents. An IDF officer was injured in his head during a stoning incident in Halhul. The team from a Palestinian ambulance treated the wounded. Moods on Temple Mount have calmed after large police forces curbed the stone throwers with gas grenades and rubber bullets. Our correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that several hundreds of the Muslim worshipers who were at the Temple Mount at noon remain, but they are not rioting. Stones were thrown at the Western Wall plaza during the riots, and Border Police jeeps evacuated the Jewish worshipers there. About a dozen Jews are praying there now. Thirteen policemen were lightly injured in the clashes on Temple Mount.
