Briefing newsmen in Moscow on Thursday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigoriy Karasin suggested that this step reflected the sentiments of "certain political forces which regard alignment with military and political unions as the key to national security." He called "for giving more thought to what is of prime importance for guaranteed stability in Europe." Moscow, in his words, favors "a genuinely European security system for all states, collective actions to meet any challenge today, and efforts to boost the CSCE potential." "Equal security for each and everyone and cooperation rather than new dividing lines between states - that's what Europe requires today," Karasin declared. In his words, such an approach prevails in CSCE, in the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, and in NATO itself. No wonder, the concept "Partnership for Peace" has been devised to strengthen security across Europe rather than within blocs. The concept has drawn much response.
