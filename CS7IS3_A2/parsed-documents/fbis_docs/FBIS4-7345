FBIS4-7345 "dreas083_c_94016" FBIS-EAS-94-083 Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 North Korea Chongnyon Offices in Osaka Raided by Police Chongnyon Offices in Osaka Raided by Police Anti-Chongnyon `Campaign' Condemned SK2804115594 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1108 GMT 28 Apr 94 SK2804115594 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, April 28 (KCNA) -- We who regard the dignity of the country and the nation as our life and soul demand that the Japanese authorities immediately stop the repressive campaign against Koreans in Japan and the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) and warn that their indiscreet acts may cause grave unpardonable consequences against history and the times. This is stressed in a statement issued today by the Korea-Japan Friendship Association. The police authorities in Osaka Prefecture, Japan, some time ago surrounded the Osaka prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon with the mobilization of 1,300 police before forcibly searching the hall of the headquarters and its four branches in Osaka. And members of the "Kanto Council of the Union of Patriots of Great Japan" staged an anti-Chongnyon, anti-DPRK campaign in front of the headquarters of Chongnyon and organs under its affiliation. This hostile campaign came at a time when the United States, Japan and the South Korean authorities were rendering the situation on the Korean peninsula extremely strained over the "nuclear issue" and the Japanese Government authorities were openly calling for setting in-motion an "international cooperation system" to stifle the DPRK, says the statement, bitterly denouncing it as an intolerable provocation against the DPRK as well as Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan. The statement continues: The Japanese authorities' repressive campaign against Chongnyon is a mockery of and an insult to the far-sighted and conscience-minded personages and people of Japan who are making all sincere efforts to establish relations of good neighbourhood with the DPRK and live on good terms with it. We expect that the Dietmen's League for the Promotion of Japan-Korea Friendship and conscience-minded personages and other people of Japan will pay deep attention to the grave situation and take resolute measures lest the DPRK-Japan relations should deteriorate and lead to an unpredictable misfortune.
