FBIS4-21052 "jptdd015__l94013" JPRS-TDD-94-015-L JPRS Narcotics 11 April 1994 LATIN AMERICA BOLIVIA Media Warns of Possibility of Chiapas-Style Rebellion in Media Warns of Possibility of Chiapas-Style Rebellion in Chapare 94P20621 94P20621 CSO [Editorial Report] The Bolivian press has been warning that a Chiapas-style rebellion could erupt in the country because of similar socioeconomic conditions affecting a large portion of the population. On 20 February, La Paz PRESENCIA, a Catholic Church-owned center-left daily, published a special report entitled "The Chiapas Syndrome, Vaccine Sought Urgently," which reviewed the Indian uprising in Mexico and commented on the possibility of it occurring in Bolivia. The report included interviews with Bolivian Vice President Hugo Cardenas, sociologist Javier Hurtado, and Free Bolivia Movement (MBL) deputy Miguel Urioste. All three expressed sympathy for Indian and peasant demands and urged that they be addressed through democratic processes, not armed struggle. To this end they are promoting the government's current reform programs. In the PRESENCIA interview Vice President Hugo Cardenas, Bolivia's first Indian official at that level, described the recent events in Mexico as "worrisome" for Bolivia the "lack of solidarity with the poor could pave the way for a Chiapas-style guerrilla uprising." "We Indians have shed the most blood in the struggle against injustice," he explained, "and we are fed up." He also pointed out that "the arrival of an Indian to the vice presidency doesn't mean that prejudice and injustice have ceased to exist." Cardenas argued that the problems resulting from "political and social exclusion"--lack of education and health services, low salaries, unequal land distribution, migration to the cities, and poverty in general--"should have been solved by now" and that these topics "should be the most important issues on the continent's political agenda." Instead, he noted, the first steps are just being taken, after 169 years, to incorporate the "approximately 42 percent of Bolivian society," previously excluded from the decisionmaking processes of the state, into the political system. Cardenas expressed confidence that the "mentality of commitment" now prevailing among the power elites in Bolivia would lead the way for the transformation of Bolivia from a "democracy of minorities" into a "multiethnic and pluricultural democracy." These steps must be taken, he insisted, "so that a Chiapas does not occur here." Miguel Urioste, leader of Free Bolivia Movement (MBL) that is part of the government coalition, and director of TIERRA (Workshop for Initiatives in Rural Research and Agrarian Reform), agreed with Vice President Cardenas that Indians and peasants in Chiapas and Bolivia experienced similar conditions. However, Urioste told PRESENCIA that, although Bolivian Indian and peasant groups are now "awakening," they are not opting for radical or destructive measures but are increasingly proposing "constructive solutions" to their problems. Urioste mentioned that among the solutions sought by the government, the most essential are a redistribution of public investment and a more equitable reallocation of resources toward rural areas to give the people more say in political and administrative decison making. In addition, with the goal of eliminating unproductive large estates (latifundios), his party has also been promoting a second agrarian reform, more aggressive than that which was carried out under the first Agrarian Reform Act of 1953. These solutions are embodied in the draft Popular Participation Law, a complex and controversial law which is part of President Sanchez de Lozada's reform package. Urioste felt optimistic that the law would "substantially modify society's representational structures." For example, he explained, 300 rural municipalities would be created, comprising 12,145 peasant and Indian communities. "For the first time in Bolivia's history," these communities would have legal jurisdiction and their elected traditional authorities would also be legally recognized. The newly created municipalities "would receive 19 percent of Treasury tax revenues" to directly administer and manage the communities' education and health centers, as well as the irrigation systems, construction projects, and road networks. He stressed that an important provision of the law would require that resources be allocated to regions according to number of inhabitants, thereby eliminating previous "imbalances." Urioste said that "although centuries of poverty could not be eliminated in one or four years," he was confident that "we are still in time to correct the mistakes and prevent a rude awakening of Bolivia's Indian people." Bolivian sociologist Javier Hurtado, in his comments to PRESENCIA, observed that in Bolivia despite the reforms brought about by the 1952 Revolution, things have changed little for the peasants. "The struggle for land remains a central theme," he explained, and "racial discrimination is still strongly rooted." He also believes that the present economic system has only served to "accentuate the polarization of poverty versus opulence" in the country, and that this could lead to a Chiapas-like situation. "To alleviate this tension," he said, Bolivians should "start thinking about repeating an April 1952 Revolution with significant reforms," as well as "correcting the technical errors of the first Agrarian Reform of 1953." Concern that the Chiapas uprising could be repeated in Bolivia, especially in the Chapare region of Cochabamba Department, was expressed in various issues of the Cochabamba daily LOS TIEMPOS. The government there had been carrying out a program of limited forced coca eradication in compliance with "Law 1008," which requires the eradication of one hectare of coca for every cocaine maceration pit found in the area. These actions, opposed by coca growers, led to violence in early March between the growers and special eradication forces. According to the 3 March issue of LOS TIEMPOS, Evo Morales, leader of the coca growers' confederation, issued an "official" statement on 2 March threatening violent resistance similar to the Chiapas uprising if "the government does not cease its forced eradication of these crops." The 9 March LOS TIEMPOS reported that President Sanchez de Lozada admitted that the country was a "time bomb," and, according to the same daily, the Bishop of La Paz, Monsignor Luis Sainz, said that the Church sided with the peasants in opposing the forced destruction of coca crops, and that "before eradicating coca, the government should eradicate poverty." A 20 February commentary in LOS TIEMPOS by Jose Luis Roca, entitled "Symptoms of Social Instability in the Chapare," observed that "in Bolivia, the Chapare area could become the epicenter of serious social conflict." The Chapare, he continued, "is like a boiling cauldron that hasn't yet exploded only because of its pressure valves, which are the relative freedom to grow and market coca leaf." The commentator noted that the situation in the Chapare is potentially more volatile than that in Mexico because in Chiapas, at least, "a trained people's army conducts negotiations on an equal basis with its government (which raises hope for a negotiated solution)." In the Chapare, he continued, "there is the risk of collective suicide because the peasants' reactions are totally irrational, motivated only by desperation and hunger." The author feared that drug traffickers could exploit any unrest to perpetrate "horrible actions in our country," like the ones which "have plunged Peru and Colombia into a bloodbath." A 1 March editorial in LOS TIEMPOS entitled "Violence in the Chapare" echoes previously expressed concerns and asserts that "eradication of coca bushes is only carried out when it is necessary to make a gesture to obtain economic aid from foreign governments." The Chapare, noted the editorial, could become a chronic area of conflict," as long as the government is incapable of formulating a "general policy on coca and drug trafficking that truly meets long-term national interests rather than short-term party interests." According to La Paz Television Nacional Network on 26 March, an agreement was finally reached in which the government promised to desist from any forced eradication. The coca growers believe this agreement represents a victory for them, and the government believes the agreement "will ensure peace and the implementation of alternative development in the coca-producing regions."
