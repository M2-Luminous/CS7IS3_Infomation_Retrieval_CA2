Now they have been somehow pushed into a corner. Naturally, they are not all made of one skin. They are not all Barukh Goldstein. Many of them have a different world view. Do you intend at any stage to resume a dialogue with them, hold a closer and more frequent dialogue with them? [Rabin] In a democratic state, it is legitimate to support or oppose the government policies. Staging legal demonstrations is legitimate. It is not legitimate to make threats, warn use of force. Certainly it is not legitimate to issue halakic decrees urging soldiers to disobey orders. To me, this is most grave. It is inconceivable to call on soldiers of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] -- which, as the military, is subject to the democratically and legally elected government which issues legitimate orders -- to disobey an order. Had we accepted the principle that anyone may decide for himself what is right and what is not -- whether he is a rabbi or a public figure -- hundreds and thousands of soldiers would have refused to serve in Lebanon, and hundreds, if not thousands, would have refused to serve in the territories. I believe the Jewish nation has a right to settle in Eretz Yisra'el, but according to a concept. When I was prime minister between 1974 and 1977, I prevented the establishment of a Jewish quarter in Hebron. I believed it was a mistake. This is what Qiryat Arba' is for. I opposed setting up Jewish settlement in areas densely populated by Palestinians. I agreed to the establishment of settlements in the 'Etzyon Bloc, in Qiryat Arba', in the Jordan Rift Valley, and on the outskirts of Netanya, such as Alfe Menashe, and Elqana. I never wanted settlement in the heart of the Palestinian population in Judaea and Samaria, between Ramallah and Nabulus. Jewish history mentions Nabulus but, for example, Ashqelon, Qiryat Gat, and Ashdod are situated on historic Philistine land. Today they are rightfully part of the State of Israel. I do not suggest that we view the Bible as the book of maps of the Jewish state. To me, the Bible is the book of religion, real values, real codes, tradition, and history of the Jewish nation. This is how I studied it. Not as the book of the precise maps of the Jewish state. [passage omitted]
