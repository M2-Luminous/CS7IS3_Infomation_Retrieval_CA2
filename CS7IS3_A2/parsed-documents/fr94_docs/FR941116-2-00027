Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 1. NorAm Gas Transmission Co. [Docket No. CP95&hyph;42&hyph;000] Take notice that on October 31, 1994, NorAm Gas Transmission Company (NGT), 1600 Smith Street, Houston, Texas 77002, filed in Docket No. CP95&hyph;42&hyph;000 a request pursuant to §§157.205, 157.208 and 157.216 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.208, 157.216) for authorization to construct and operate facilities and to abandon facilities under NGT's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;384&hyph;000, et al ., pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. NGT proposes to replace and rearrange certain marketing lateral segments located in Stephens County, Oklahoma. NGT describes the pipe segments as generally being old and deteriorated. 1 NGT advises that delivery points for two of Arkla's domestic customers and one 6-inch check meter on Line 10 would be relocated to the new Line 10 segment. 1 NGT states that Lines 10, 10&hyph;1, and 11&hyph;3 were acquired through a merger with Consolidated Gas Utilities Corporation (24 FPC 91 (1960)), and deliver gas to townborder stations served by Arkla, a division of NorAm Energy Corp (Arkla). NGT states that the project would involve the installation of approximately 5,050 feet of 10-inch pipe (replacement Line 10 segment) and 20 feet of 8-inch pipe (to connect Line ADT&hyph;8 to Line 11&hyph;3 at pipeline station no. 611+20). NGT states that it would abandon in place the following: (1) Two segments of Line 10, totaling 5,034 feet of 6-inch pipe, (2) Two segments of Line 10&hyph;1, totaling 2,035 feet of 8-inch pipe, (3) A segment of Line 11&hyph;3, totaling 2,980 feet of 10-inch pipe, except for the Hell Creek crossing which would be used as part of replacement Line 10, 2 and 2 NGT advises that the Hell Creek crossing on Line 11&hyph;3 was replaced in 1990. (4) A segment of Line ADT&hyph;8, totaling 610 feet of 8-inch pipe. NGT explains that the project would permit it to consolidate the operations of the abandoned segments to continue service within the existing certificated entitlement to Arkla, through the new 10-inch segment of Line 10. NGT estimates that the total cost of the replacement facilities would be $244,743. Comment date: December 23, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice. 2. Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. [Docket No. CP95&hyph;49&hyph;000] Take notice that on November 3, 1994, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee) P.O. Box 2511, Houston, Texas 77252, filed in Docket No. CP95&hyph;49&hyph;000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205(b) and 157.212 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205(b) and 157.212) for authorization to operate three existing delivery point facilities that were initially constructed under Section 311(a) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA), all as more fully set forth in the request on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. The request for authorization states that Tennessee has constructed a number of delivery points under Section 311(a) of the NGA for use in the transportation of natural gas under Subpart B of Part 284 of the Commission's Regulations. Since Tennessee now renders significant transportation of natural gas under its Subpart G blanket certificate, it states it is imperative that maximum flexibility be attained so that its facilities can be used for the benefit of all customers on Tennessee's system. Tennessee states that the location of the delivery points are in Tuscarawas County, Ohio, Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana and Albany County, New York. It is stated that delivery volumes through the existing delivery points would not impact Tennessee's peak day and annual deliveries; that the proposed activity is not prohibited by its existing tariff; and that it has sufficient capacity to accommodate the changes proposed herein without detriment or disadvantage to Tennessee's other customers. Comment date: December 23, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice.
