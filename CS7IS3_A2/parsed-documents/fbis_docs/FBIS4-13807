After the cabinet meeting, Environment Minister Sarid asserted that there was no disagreement between the prime minister and the foreign minister. Sarid said that if accelerated, the negotiations could be concluded within two weeks. Sarid stressed that it had been agreed that no Palestinian prisoners with blood on their hands would be released. Finance Minister Avraham Shohat told the cabinet of progress in narrowing the differences between Israel and the PLO at the economic talks in Paris. He stressed that Israel was opposed to the Palestinian demand that every time a closure was imposed, Israel must fund busy work projects in the territories in order to compensate the workers subsequently left unemployed. [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1130 GMT on 24 April reports that "Israel agrees to permit three Palestinian police battalions to enter the Gaza Strip and Jericho 24 hours after the signing of the autonomy agreement. These battalions comprise 1,050 policemen. This was reported by our political correspondent Udi Segal." Our correspondent adds that "at today's cabinet session, Police Minister Moshe Shahal criticized the Army for not including the police in the discussions on security arrangements with the Palestinians. Acting Prime Minister Shim'on Peres expressed fears that 'Arafat's arrival in the territories would not be felt sufficiently and fail to herald a change in the eyes of the residents of the territories." The report notes that "Peres stressed the need to conclude the negotiations rapidly. Several ministers reported that the prime minister was adamant in his refusal to make any concessions on issues pertaining to the symbols of sovereignty sought by the Palestinians, such as stamps, Palestinian currency, and passports."
