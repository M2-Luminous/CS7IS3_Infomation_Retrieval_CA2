According to its researchers, this undertaking has proven its viability by showing itself to be a program that treats drugs systematically, technically, and effectively. Inasmuch as the parameters of the project are still evolving, it is likely to propagate itself. This has led to the establishment of training courses in primary prevention of drug use among young people who are serving their obligatory military service in the barracks, the principal universe of their activities. This year, provided authorization is obtained from the higher echelons of the Army, the project will be introduced at the Army's Cadet Preparatory School, the gateway for young men who want to enter the Agulhas Negras Academy. In the last half of 1993, professors and psychologists from the CEP held a practicum for officers from different units of the Military Command of the East, in Rio de Janeiro. The purpose was to standardize the application of the program in all military units of the Army and homogenize the knowledge, procedures, and techniques used in primary prevention. This is the first step to making a reality of the CEP's proposal as regards its details and the positive repercussions leading to its extension into the military environment. According to CEP leaders, the primary objectives of the project in Rio de Janeiro are: to promote a change in young people's attitudes toward drugs, to boost feelings of self-esteem, to strengthen the ability to resist social pressures, and to help adolescents organize their scale of values. The young people in the units where the project has functioned have left the barracks armed with information against drug abuse. This year, the Army hopes to extend the project to other area commands and to the schools that are subordinate to the Directorate of Specialization and Extension. The studies that formed that basis for Project Hope, now a reality, began in 1987 and ended in 1990, the year when it was introduced on an experimental basis, starting with units in Rio de Janeiro and at the Agulhas Negras Military Academy, an officer training school. The Army Center for Personnel Studies, one of the most important of its type in South America, annually receives dozens of officers from other countries, who take specialized courses in communications and other subjects of military interest.
