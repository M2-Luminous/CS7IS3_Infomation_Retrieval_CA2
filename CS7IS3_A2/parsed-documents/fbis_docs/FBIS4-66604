Narasimha Rao, today told the representatives of foreign and Indian companies collaborating in joint venture projects that the country required higher and quicker investment flows particularly in the critical infrastructure sector. While assuring them that the government was committed to continuing the process of economic reforms started in 1991, Mr Rao sought to allay any misgivings about problems arising due to red tape or procedures. "The government will effect the necessary changes with regard to procedural matters in the quickest practicable time," he observed. Mr Rao did not think that the problems and irritants coming in the way of speedy implementation of the joint venture projects were not of an insurmountable nature and said the suggestions made would be considered on merits. He said he attached importance to a proper feedback from business, industry and trade pertaining to their experiences in undertaking economic activities in the new environment in this country. He felt this meeting provided a good opportunity for a frank exchange of views and said such dialogues would be held at regular intervals by the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB). After giving a patient hearing to specific problems raised by the foreign and Indian companies, the Prime Minister said some adjustments would have to be made to streamline the functioning of several authorities including customs and excise and making investment procedures simple. At the end of the meeting lasting more than 90 minutes, Mr Rao said his impression was that those who had already made substantial investment in this country encountered fewer problems. At the same time, those who were now keen or contemplating investing in this country seemed to be conjuring problems in their minds, he remarked. He reiterated that economic liberalisation was here to stay and said the response to the new policies both within and outside the country were very encouraging. The representatives of the Indian and foreign companies acknowledged that India had emerged as a major player on the global economic firmament in the wake of the economic reforms over the last 30 months. Some of them whose projects were in an advanced stage of completion said the Centre's help of providing counter guarantee had turned the climate for financial assistance in India's favour. They expressed satisfaction that investment procedures had been streamlined especially the FIPB route and agreed to keep the FIPB posted about the progress achieved in the implementation of their projects. Stating that they would seek the FIPB's assistance in resolving difficulties faced by them during the period of implementation of their projects, the company representatives drew the government's pointed attention to cumbersome details sought in the financial statements. The government explained that it was proposed to amend the Company Law and an indepth exercise was already on to overhaul some of these provisions. It also promised to look into the problems of varied interpretation of the Urban Land Ceiling Act by the state government in transferring land to the companies for starting joint ventures. The minister of state for industry, Mrs Krishna Shahi, responded saying there was already a mechanism for monitoring this aspect and officials of her ministry were interacting closely with the state government to sort out the difficulties at the implementation stage. These representatives of foreign and Indian companies further spoke of problems in securing financial packages because of the norms and procedures of the Reserve Bank of India and financial institutions and varying rates of duty and taxes for a Non-resident Indians (NRI) compared to others. What these companies found worrisome was the implementation of the Customs and excise laws and underlined the need for greater transparency. They wanted to know if the structure of Customs and excise levies could be simplified and the existing list reduced.
