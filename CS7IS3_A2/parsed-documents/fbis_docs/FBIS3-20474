The British Government on one hand took a hard-line stand with the Chinese Government, breaking off contacts between senior Chinese and British officials, as well as refusing to participate in the routine meetings of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group. On the other, it promoted, along with other social forces with which it had ties, political-system plans, such as the "two-council consensus plan," attempting to speed up the pace of democracy, by putting pressure on the Chinese, while vying for public influence with the radical democracy faction, to limit its continued expansion. Teng Lien-ju [6772 5571 1172, then chief member of the Executive Council [EXCO], stated publicly that "whether the two councils [EXCO and LEGCO] could reach a consensus (on shaping plans), would be affected to a certain degree by the Beijing student movement of the time, as well as the actions taken by Hong Kong residents in support of it." The radical democracy faction reproposed a new "190" plan, recommending that the legislature in 1991 should have one-half directly elected members, with all being directly elected by 1995. And they maintained their original proposal that the Chief Executive be directly elected by the whole people in 1997. They claimed that if Hong Kong could not establish a democratic political system before 1997, it would be impossible to practice democracy afterwards. Even those in the industrial and business world and the "middle-of-the-roaders," who had previously endorsed orderly and gradual political-system development, changed to endorsing a faster pace of democracy. This situation sharpened the possibility that, as political parties of all strata had not yet formed and the radical democracy faction's forces were growing unprecedentedly, the future legislature might be slanted toward the middle and lower strata, or even toward the radical democracy faction. At the time, Shao Shan-po [6730 0810 3134], deputy secretary general of the Advisory Committee, suggested a "one legislature in two bodies" plan, which Mao Junnian, deputy director of the Hong Kong Office of the NCNA, delivered to me, noting that this plan might be considered by the Working Committee. This plan divided the legislature into two bodies, a "district electoral body," and a "functional electoral body." The "district electoral body" would use mixed elections, with more than one-half of its members for the first two sessions being directly elected, while the "functional electoral body" would have its members elected by all functional circles, similar to the Western upper and lower houses or two-body senate and house. If a bill was passed by both bodies, there would naturally be no problem. But if a bill was not passed by the body with the directly elected legislators, but was passed by the other body, creating a legislative impasse, then it would be decided by the Chief Executive, or the two bodies would choose delegates to study amendments, in an attempt to get it passed by both bodies. And if this did not work, it could be decided by a two-thirds majority of the whole legislature. Shao Shan-po's plan at the time was merely a general outline, with the details yet to be considered. So I took this plan to Beijing to be studied by the Hong Kong and Macao Working Committee chaired by Ji Pengfei, where all supported it, holding it to be a way out under the new situation since 4 June. But after I returned to Hong Kong, while we were just studying how to promote it and had not yet made specific plans, Lo Te-ch'eng [5012 1795 0015] suddenly publicized it. I was very surprised. How could Lo Te-ch'eng have known about this plan? And how could he have gotten hold of it? I investigated this carefully but to no avail. Once Lo Te-ch'eng had presented the "one legislature in two bodies" plan, the political-system controversy sharpened immediately, with the various public forces that had been promoting their respective plans now all directing their spearheads at the "one legislature in two bodies," holding that it was supported by the Chinese, which Lo Te-ch'eng had asserted, and which was true. And certain coordination movements also went into action in an attempt to join forces in opposition to the "one legislature in two bodies." As the "one legislature in two bodies" plan was not consistent with the them climate of public demand for a faster pace of democracy, we considered appropriately adapting to the public tide, while keeping the legislative body from becoming too slanted, to prevent an immediate sharp change in the SAR political situation after 1997. In light of the over-emotional public climate, in which it would be hard to keep this plan from being criticized once it was out, we had planned to release it step by step, to reduce the resistance to it. But who would have guessed that Lo Te-ch'eng would rush it out ahead of us. Lo Te-ch'eng's public image was not too good at the time, as he had publicly stated his opposition to a faster pace of democracy due to the 4 June incident, which had aroused an even stronger public outcry. So the "one legislature in two bodies" plan being put out by him made him a target "of attack" for a time. [16 Sep p 2] [Text] A Second Set of Sharpening Political-System Controversies (Part Two of Two) -- The "One Legislature in Two Bodies" and "4:4:2" Plans Become Points of Controversy; the Chinese Side Recommends the "New Comprehensive Plan"; Results Unclear Before long, figures from industrial and business circles, such as Lo K'ang-jui [5012 1660 3843], and middle-of-the-roaders, such as Ch'eng Chieh-nan [4453 0094 0589], also put forth a new balanced "4:4:2" plan, for the Hong Kong SAR's first legislative-body members to be 40 percent directly elected, 40 percent from functional groups, and 20 percent through general elections. They emphasized that this plan was coordinated by Hongkongers, being one that all could accept. Lo K'ang-jui and Lo Te-ch'eng were originally both members of the 89-person Industrial and Business Advisory Committee, but were now each putting forth respective plans, which were publicly called the "elder Lo" and "younger Lo" plans, coexisting around the time of the "dual-Cha" plan, with the "elder Lo" and "younger Lo" plans being originally two parts of a confederation that were now diametrically opposed to each other. But the radical democracy faction held that these plans made too many concessions, so continued to stick to its new "190" plan. By this time, we had received the news that the British Hong Kong Government was also supporting the "4:4:2" plan, with other sources claiming that this plan had come from the British Hong Kong Government. We considered this second possibility unlikely, with the greater likelihood being that British Hong Kong had "received" and then supported it. The British Hong Kong Government had probably considered the "two-council consensus" plan to have too much of a British flavor, with very little possibility of being accepted by the Chinese, so had tried to have this [4:4:2] plan accepted by the Chinese through a so-called three-faction coordination--of the industrial and business world, the democracy faction, and the middle-of-the-roaders. When [then Hong Kong Governor] Wilson later clearly "recommended" the "4:4:2" plan to the Chinese, this confirmed our guess. Through contacts with certain senior British businessmen, we indirectly confirmed this information, as they bluntly "suggested" that they hoped that the Chinese would accept Lo K'ang-jui's plan. Many of my colleagues at the Hong Kong Office of the NCNA knew Lo K'ang-jui, mostly having a good impression of him. It was said that Lo K'ang-jui had built on the $100,000 HK that he had received from his father, doing very well in business, as well as taking unique political stands and views, being a rare talent, about which I had the same impression. In order to sell his "4:4:2" plan, Lo K'ang-jui asked for a special meeting with me. While I listened to his briefing, saying that we would consider his views, I also explained that I really did not agree much with his stand, whereupon he shook my hand in parting with a disappointed expresson on his face. And when middle-of-the-roaders Chang Chia-min [1728 1367 2404] and Ch'eng Chieh-nan also asked to see me to brief me on the "4:4:2" plan, I gave them the same response as I had to Lo K'ang-jui. In the debate over the many plans, public opinion sharpened, focused mainly in areas, such as the "4:4:2," "one legislature in two bodies," and "new 109" plans, with the "one legislature in two bodies" and "4:4:2" plans becoming the points at issue. At this time, some of the members of the 89-person Advisory Committee from industrial and commercial circles proposed synthesizing the two plans into a "new comprehensive plan," by dividing the composition of LEGCO members into three groups--functional, directly elected, and generally elected; and changing the two bodies in the "one legislature in two bodies" plan to a counting of votes by category. This was taken to Beijing by Advisory Committee Deputy Director Kuo Chih-ch'uan [6753 1807 2938], who introduced it to the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, winning real support. After they returned to Hong Kong, they publicly recommended it to the public. A working meeting on Hong Kong and Macao chaired by Ji Pengfei discussed the matter of the political-system plans, with all endorsing Li Hou's proposal to take the "new comprehensive plan" as the base, and to synthesize it with the views of all parties, in order to draw up a plan to be voted on at the last meeting of the Drafting Committee. As to the number of directly-elected legislative seats, while the British had proposed 24 for 1995 and 20 for 1991, this meeting set the "bottom line" at 20 for 1995 and 18 for 1991. This was the basis on which we had to not only work with the Hong Kong public, but also consult with the British. In order to coordinate the setting forth of the "new comprehensive plan," I gave a speech at a meeting of the Hong Kong Preparatory Committee on the occasion of the 1989 National Day [1 October], calling on all parties to cooperate harmoniously, naturally hoping not only to ease the political-system controversy, but also to alleviate somewhat the antagonistic mindset of Hongkongers toward China after the 4 June incident. I originally guessed that this would have a limited impact, and that the debate over the political-system plans would not stop.
