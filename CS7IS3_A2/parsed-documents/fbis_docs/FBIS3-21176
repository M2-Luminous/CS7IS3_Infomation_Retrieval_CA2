This project is a search for a three-terminal device using high-temperature superconductivity of oxides. The goal is to use superconductivity to realize transistor operations that are the foundation of electronic devices in use today. Hitachi Ltd., Toshiba Corporation and Sumitomo Electric Industries are individually doing research on devices with compositions similar to field effective transistors (FET), which control current by voltage applied at the gates. Hitachi and Toshiba are considering devices with a structure of a semiconductor or other normal conductor sandwiched between superconductors. When joined together, the surface of the normal conducting layer also becomes superconducting to some degree, and superconductive current is exuded. This is called a proximity effect. This effect is controlled by gate voltage or charge input, and switching is carried out. Research is at the stage of joining superconductor and normal conductor, then doing a detailed study of the resulting performance. Hitachi is using a holmium-barium-copper oxide superconductor and a praseodymium-barium-copper oxide (PBCO) normal conductor, and is taking measurements at very low temperatures. It learned that the travel distance between the electron pair that carries superconducting current changes with voltage or temperature, and is conducting theoretical studies to explain this. Toshiba is using yttrium-barium-copper oxide (YBCO) to sandwich a PBCO layer. It is measuring performance when the thickness of the PBCO layer is changed. It also is accumulating techniques for joining the layers, such as lining up crystalline orientation to make thin film. Neither Hitachi nor Toshiba has realized operation of a three-terminal device. It is difficult to make high quality thin film from superconducting oxides, and, furthermore, fundamental points such as how thick the film should be to make a good device need to be discovered. On the other hand, Sumitomo Electric Industries is not studying the proximity effect; it is researching a device that uses the superconductor itself as a channel (path for passing current). It is looking for optimum design conditions based on using YBCO for the superconductor, strontium titanic acid for the substrate and insulation, and gold for electrodes. The three terminal device was produced experimentally, and experiments at extremely low temperatures confirmed that gate voltage transforms superconducting current. Degree of transformation is still too weak, but it is thought that improvements can be made by raising the quality of the film or making it thinner. [5 Nov 93 p 4] A bipolar transistor is composed of three layers -- emitter, base and collector. The center part, the base, holds the key to performance. If resistance in this part is small, electrons flow rapidly and high-speed operations are possible. A team from Oki Electric's device technology laboratory produced an experimental model of a transistor using a superconductor for the base layer, and succeeded in amplifying current. Superconductivity On top of a crystalline substrate of strontium titanate (STO) to which 0.1% niobium had been added, a thin film of barium-rubidium-bismuth oxide was layered, and then covered with a film of indium. the STO substrate is the emitter, the BRBO is the base and the indium is the collector. BRBO beomes superconducting at absolute temperature 28� (-245�C), so it was cooled slightly below that, to 20� (-253�C) and then tested for operation. The current amplification factor was 0.94 (the closer to 1 the better) at base grounding and 10 (the bigger the better) at emitter grounding, the first time that practical levels were achieved by a superconducting transistor. The thickness of the base layer was under 50 nanometers (1 nanometer is one-billionth of a meter). Although it is not easy to make flat thin film with oxide superconductors, this was achieved by free use of control technology in which the molecular beam epitaxy method was used to vaporize simultaneously four types of elements. Also, when indium was layered onto BRBO, a thin oxide film formed on the boundary surface, and it was found that this acted as a good link between the base layer and the collector layer. measurement and evaluation of performance, such as operating speed and power consumption, are still to come. It is estimated that operating frequency of the experimental model is about 10,000 hertz, but the goal is the high-speed operation of 1 billion hertz. It would not be worth using superconductors if this performance level could not be achieved. The smaller the base the better for high-speed operation, and the device structure must be reduced from its present size of 0.5 millimeters (mm) square to 5 microns (1 micron is .001mm) square in order to achieve this goal. On the other hand, the Sanyo Electric Company also is doing research on the same type of device. The difference with the Oki Electric device is that a superconductor is used for the emitter layer as well and an insulator is set up as a barrier between this and the base layer to bring out sharpness. A barium-potassium-bismuth oxide (BKBO) superconductor and gold are layered onto a substrate of STO to which neodymium has been added, and this is being used to confirm the basic operation of a three-terminal device. The important point is the insulation film between the BKBO and the gold. In the past, the oxide film which forms naturally was used, but Sanyo is trying to improve performance by artificially creating a thin film of magnesium oxide. [8 Nov 93 p 5] Research also is proceeding on combining superconductivity with tunnels and other quantum effects. The ``dielectric base transistor'' proposed by Fujitsu, Ltd. is one of those. As expressed by the name, this uses the superconductor STO for the base layer. The emitter and collector layers are YBCO superconductors. Instead of simply layering these three, thin interlayers made of other superconductors are sandwiched between the emitter and base, and the base and collector. The purpose of adding interlayers is to create conditions for the resonant tunnel effect to occur and to bring out negative resistance and other special qualities. Normally, quantum devices have layers of compound semiconductor thin film, but in this case, the same kind of device will be designed with oxide thin film. Both the superconductor's very high-speed operation and low power consumption and the quantum effect's multi functionality are being sought, a very ambitious undertaking. So far, a clear cut quantum effect has not been brought out, but a transistor with neodymium-gallium oxide interlayers was produced experimentally in FY90, and the basic operation of transformation of the current flowing from the emitter to the collector caused by the base layer's potential was confirmed at extremely low temperatures. However, only a small current flowed between the emitter and the collector, even when strong voltage was applied, and the change in current also was slight. Of course, this is only natural since a dielectric, which does not pass electricity, is being used, but dielectric interlayers are essential in order to elicit the quantum effect. To solve this dilemma, the search has continued for materials that facilitate electron permeation and are compatible with YBCO. Thin films of various types of oxides, such as lanthanum-aluminum oxide and cerium oxide, were sandwiched between STO and YBCO and tested for performance. It was found that the same voltage increased current by 2-3 digits when magnesium oxide was used. With the latest test model, which has magnesium oxide thin film interlayers that are 1 nanometer thick (a billionth of a meter), current nearly at the practical level flowed when about 10 volts were applied at extremely low temperatures. It has a long way to go when compared with a conventional transistor that operates with millivolt-level voltage, but it can be said that the shape of a usable device finally has come into view. Whether the main goal of quantum effect can be elicited is a problem for the future. Oxides are even more difficult than compound semiconductors to laminate into thin film, and there is also little research history on this subject. The process of trial and error probably will continue in order to achieve the goal of developing a peerless new device. [9 Nov 93 p 5] In an effort to combine superconductivity and quantum effect, the NEC basic research laboratory is proposing to make a single electron transistor (SET) with superconductors. SET is a transistor that operates by controlling each electron individually. It is one of the devices of the future on which active research has intensified in recent years. When extremely tiny ``islands'' are made with semiconductors, a quantum effect called the coulomb blockade occurs, in which electrons jump individually, not in groups, from one island to the next. If memory or calculation functions are carried out with the movement of one electron, the device can be extremely small and consume almost no power. What would be the advantage to combining this with superconductors? It is believed that this would improve operating speed, increase stability, etc., although there are no definite prospects for realizing these. With superconductors, two electrons form a pair to carry current. It would be extremely difficult to handle electrons individually, but a ``single electron pair transistor,'' in which groups of electron pairs are controlled, may increase stability. Of course, even the regular SET still is in the basic research stage, and it would not do to skip ahead to a superconducting SET. A team from NEC has made a tunnel junction of aluminum and alumina (aluminum oxide) and its first goal was to control a single electron in a normal conducting state. A microstructure with 100 nanometer line width and 50 nanometer square junction area was cooled to extremely low temperatures. One side was made the gate and electrons were fed into the electrode on the opposite side. The team was able to observe the change in potential that showed when each electron entered the electrode. In the future, the group plans to raise slightly the temperature at which experiments are conducted, make a junction with superconductors and accumulate basic data. On the other hand, Mitsubishi Electric's basic semiconductor research laboratory is pursuing the possibility of a micro-vacuum tube that uses superconductivity. Thanks to advances in microprocessing technology, it has become possible to use semiconductors to make small structures resembling vacuum tubes. Although large-scale vacuum tubes are anachronistic, micro-vacuum tubes are being looked at with renewed interest because it is thought that operating functions different from those of solid state components might be obtained if electrons are released from the surface of a semiconductor into a vacuum. Mitsubishi Electric's goal is to make a tunnel junction with superconductor and insulator layers so that vitality-filled electrons are released sharply. As of now, basic studies are being carried out, such as on the conditions needed to produce high-quality, bismuth-based superconducting thin film surfaces and on the characteristics of the experimentally produced junctions. In the future, a micro-vacuum tube with the capability of large current switching may be produced.
