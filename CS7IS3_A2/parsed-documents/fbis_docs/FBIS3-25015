The two sides discussed many issues affecting the situation in Somalia and how to find a just solution to them. Speaking on the occasion, Mohamed Farah Aidid referred to the problems brought upon the Somali people by the UN Operation in Somalia [UNOSOM]. He said there is a need to create another agency which will perform humanitarian work, given the fact that UNOSOM-II has lost the Somali people's confidence. Chairman Aidid added that fighting would not break out in Somalia when the foreign troops leave. He stressed that all the foreign troops should withdraw from Somalia since they are not required at the moment. Speaking on the reconciliation efforts, Aidid said the SNA is still having talks and consultations with other parties in light of the failed consultations in Addis Ababa. He said the Addis Ababa consultation meeting collapsed because of UNOSOM-II, foreign interference, and because of a few individuals serving their colonial masters. On the subject of peace, the chairman said the American troops have deliberately massacred 78 Somalis since the cease-fire was declared. The chairman warned the foreign troops concerning the continued massacres and violation of the cease-fire. Robert Oakley spoke about the importance for the Somali people of working for peace among themselves and embarking on the reconstruction of the country. He made it clear that UNOSOM-II's responsibility is to assist the Somali people, adding that his government will not give preferential support to one region of the country over another when it comes to reconstruction and development. Mr. Oakley said that America will provide millions of dollars for the country's reconstruction and rehabilitation if a stable political situation is reached. The talks took place in an atmosphere of understanding. [passage omitted]
