ACTION: Closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is closing the directed fishery for pollock in Statistical Area 61 (between 159 and 170 W. long.) in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the second quarterly allowance of the total allowable catch (TAC) for pollock in this area. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), June 2, 1994, until 12 noon, A.l.t., July 1, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michael L. Sloan, 907&hyph;586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the GOA (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672. The second quarterly allowance of pollock TAC in Statistical Area 61 is 5,037 metric tons (mt), as established by the 1994 final specifications (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994) and modified in accordance with ยง672.20(a)(2)(iv). The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), has determined, in accordance with ยง672.20(c)(2)(ii), that the 1994 second quarterly allowance of pollock TAC in Statistical Area 61 soon will be reached. The Regional Director established a directed fishing allowance of 4,400 mt, and has set aside the remaining 637 mt as bycatch to support other anticipated groundfish fisheries. The Regional Director has determined that the directed fishing allowance has been reached. Consequently, directed fishing for pollock in Statistical Area 61 is prohibited, effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., June 2, 1994, until 12 noon, A.l.t., July 1, 1994. Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at ยง672.20(g). Classification This action is taken under 50 CFR 672.20 and is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . Dated: June 1, 1994. Richard H.
