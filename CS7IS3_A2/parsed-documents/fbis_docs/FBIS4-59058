I had been intending to spend some time here, resting, and undergoing some routine medical examinations, but the start of fighting in the brotherly Yemen, and due to what I have been watching and hearing from the media channels, my heart bleeds with sorrow and sadness because of my acquaintance with the Yemeni leadership, people, and clans, and because of old friendship bonds. I personally served Yemen and worked for its' development and encouraged its' leaderships, morally and financially, to advance the Yemeni people. In front of this painful event that is sweeping Yemen, my personal comfort has diminished and I have decided to return to my headquarters to be at the disposal of the custodian of the two holy mosques and his crown prince, who are in constant and serious contact with their brethren kings, princes, and presidents of Arab countries in order to save Yemen from this painful fate, from the abyss it is sliding into. In particular, the Yemeni people, who have worked to build this unity between the two parts, which was blessed by Saudi Arabia when it was established with a positive spirit and in anticipation of a better future. When disputes surfaced we were not surprised because brothers and friends disagree. But when the language of dialogue stops between brothers and the brothers resort to bloodshed, killing, wasting energies, and destroying the achievements -- which the Yemeni people attained with great difficulties -- to settle their differences, it then becomes a matter that brings sadness for every Arab and Muslim and bleeds the hearts that love Yemen, the country that we all love and appreciate. I beseech God from the bottom of my heart to enlighten the brothers in Yemen to solve their differences by resorting to reason, logic, and dialogue aimed at serving Yemen's interests and sons. [passage omitted] He said Yemen had high hopes in the Kingdom under the leadership of King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, as well as in Egypt under the leadership of President Husni Mubarak and all Arab leaders to find an urgent solution to stop the bloodshed and restore purity to Yemen.
