I am convinced that we will overcome the economic carnage, but it will be more difficult to overcome the aftermath of the Chernobyl accident. I have invited Natalia Masherova, chairman of Public Fund for Chernobyl Issues, to comment on this problem. [Begin Masherova recording, in Russian] [passage omitted] Belarusian children are the ones who have suffered most from the Chernobyl catastrophe. I am addressing the Belarusian legislature: It is easier to convince the international community than our state financial structures that we are going through a critical period. In Belarus, we have witnessed a dramatic increase in (?aggressive) thyroid cancer among children. Currently, Ukraine and Russia are lagging behind in these statistics. These statistics demonstrate that currently 0.1 percent out of one million children suffer from thyroid cancer. In Belarus, in Gomel Oblast in particular, this figure is 13 percent. Why do we keep silent about these tragic figures? In my opinion, all the work of our legislature and the government should stem from the addressing of Chernobyl issues. [end recording]
