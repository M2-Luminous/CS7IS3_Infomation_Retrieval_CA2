"After thorough investigations and numerous interviews, we officially declare that neither our leadership nor individual member-clubs of the Legion have ever commented on the president's letter to the commanders of the Armed Forces' branches, or on the relations between the president's Military Office and the Army's General Staff. "We are convinced that the aforementioned report has cited the Legion in a deliberately distorted fashion, prompted by evidently biased political intentions. "Similar `operations' are likely to provoke tension among our members. They are contributing to a politicization of the soldiers' life which is counterproductive to the consolidation of the Bulgarian Army's fighting ability."
