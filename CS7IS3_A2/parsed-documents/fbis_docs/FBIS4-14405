It is being attended by representatives of the Russian Government and business circles and a U.S. delegation led by Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown. "Voiced during the past two months, including in the United States, were doubts about the Russian Government's readiness to continue the course of reforms," Shokhin said. "I think nobody has such doubts now." "The rates of inflation in February and March," he noted, "were the lowest as compared to 1992 and 1993. The January upsurge of inflation can be largely explained by heightened inflationary expectations, provoked for purely political reasons. They were in no way linked with the government's economic efforts." "The orientation of the Russian Government's reformist efforts," Shokhin stressed, "are confirmed by the recently reached agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which is to grant Russia the second part of the envisaged system credit. The agreement with the IMF is important for us not only because a decision is to be adopted this April on granting Russia a 1.5 billion dollars credit. This sum, frankly speaking, is not decisive for our national economy's financial development and investment process," Shokhin noted. "It is important for us as proof of the international economic and financial community's readiness to back the Russian reforms." On the other hand, according to Shokhin, the reached agreements should pave the way for an IMF decision to grant Russia a reserve credit, to an agreement with the Paris Club on the postponement of payments for the debts of the former USSR, which are to be made in 1994. Moreover, the World Bank is expected to pass a decision not later than June to grant the second rehabilitation credit to Russia, amounting to 600 million dollars. The visit of the delegation of the U.S. Department of Commerce is proceeding at a time when trade exchange between the two countries is expanding. According to data received from the Russian Foreign Ministry (the Department for Economic Cooperation between the United States and Russia) Russia had a deficit of 2.2 billion dollars in trade with the United States in 1992. The export of Russian goods to the United States trebled in 1993, growing from 693.9 millions to 2.05 billion U.S. Dollars. But a slight deficit remained, because Russia imported 2.2 billion dollars worth of goods from the United States that year. According to a reference note, released by the U.S. Department of Commerce before Ronald Brown's visit, American exports to Russia reached three billion dollars in 1993, which is 40 per cent more than in 1992. American imports from Russia grew by 262 per cent and amounted to 1.7 billion dollars in 1993. Nevertheless, the sum total of American investments in Russia is still very small and amounts, according to some estimates, to only one billion dollars, which were invested by American companies based in Western Europe. Nevertheless, the United States believes there are great potentialities for capital investments in Russia, especially in the oil and gas industry.
