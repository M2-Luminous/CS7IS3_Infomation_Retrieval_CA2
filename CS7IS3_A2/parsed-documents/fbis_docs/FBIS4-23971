[passage omitted] Philippe Rochot takes stock of the situation: [Rochot] [passage omitted] The RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] men believe that they themselves can rescue the Tutsis and that they do not need French troops to return to Rwanda, which may jeopardize their military victory. Paris means to show good will toward these RPF troops by saving Tutsis--the majority ethnic group within their movement--first of all. However, a few hours away from the Security Council meeting, the RPF was displaying a very harsh position: [Begin Claude Dusaidi, RPF envoy to the United Nations, recording, in English, with superimposed French translation] We have no contact with the French, and this morning we declared that the French ambassador in Kigali will be persona non grata. If he comes, we will arrest him and send him back to France. We will accept any peacekeeping force, even if it includes troops from France or its allies, but we do not want a force of aggression and we will treat it accordingly. [end recording] [passage omitted] [Masure] Our special correspondent in Kigali, Laurent Boussie, is live on the telephone. He arrived in the Rwandan capital this morning from Uganda. Laurent, can you hear me? [Boussie] Yes, indeed, Bruno, I can hear you. [Masure] Can you tell us in a nutshell what the situation is like in Kigali this evening from a military viewpoint? [Boussie] In Kigali, after 48 hours of shelling and fighting, today was a rather calm day. This precarious truce allowed the humanitarian organizations and UN soldiers to evacuate hundreds of wounded people. [Masure] You had the privilege--the journalistic luck--to meet the president of the Rwandan Patriotic Front in Kigali this morning. He confirmed the hostility of the Rwandan rebels toward any French military presence. [Boussie] You know, you know, he is called Alexis Kanyarengwe. He is the president of the Rwandan Patriotic Front, which has a majority of Tutsis, but he himself is a Hutu. He expressed extremely harsh words and his determination seems to be very strong. I am going to read to you a sentence he uttered this morning: French soldiers are coming here in order to protect the torturers. As soon as they set foot in Rwanda, we will consider them as enemies and do our utmost to fight them. As you can see, he is very determined and his men on the ground seem to be, too. [Masure] Thank you, Laurent Boussie, for this report live from Kigali.
