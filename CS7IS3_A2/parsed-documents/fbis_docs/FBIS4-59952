He said: By implementing monetary, foreign exchange, and commercial policies the government intends to steer the foreign exchange market toward stable exchange rates. Our correspondent reports that Central Bank Governor 'Adeli said: Goods importers are the main applicants for foreign currency. He referred to the shock prices on international oil markets in recent months and its effect in creating an imbalance in the country's balance of trade. He said: Using the two levers of foreign exchange and foreign trade policies, particularly in the import of goods, in the short term, to restore balance to foreign payments is unavoidable. He emphasised the beneficial effects of those policies in the long run to stabilize exchange rates.
