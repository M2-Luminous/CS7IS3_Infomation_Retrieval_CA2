ACTION: Interim rule with request for comments. SUMMARY: The Office of Personnel Management is issuing interim regulations to provide employees with additional time in which to use restored annual leave that was forfeited as a result of employment at a Department of Defense installation undergoing closure or realignment. DATES: The interim regulations are effective on December 7, 1994. Comments must be received on or before February 6, 1995. ADDRESSES: Comments may be sent or delivered to Donald J. Winstead, Acting Assistant Director for Compensation Policy, Office of Personnel Management, Room 6H31, 1900 E Street NW., Washington, DC 20415. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jo Ann Perrini, (202) 606&hyph;2858. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 4434 of Public Law 102&hyph;484, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1993, amended section 6304(d) of title 5, United States Code, to consider the closure of an installation of the Department of Defense (DOD), during the period from October 1, 1992, through December 31, 1997, as ``an exigency of the public business'' for the purpose of restoring annual leave accumulated in excess of the maximum permitted by law. This amendment also provides that any annual leave in excess of the annual maximum limitation under 5 U.S.C. 6304(a) accrued by an employee at a closing DOD installation must be restored and credited to the employee in a separate leave account. This provision enables installations to keep their already reduced staffs at work while permitting employees to avoid forfeiture of leave. In addition, it reduces the administrative time that would have been spent by employees and managers in scheduling, canceling, and restoring ``use or lose'' annual leave each leave year. Sections 341 and 2816 of Public Law 103&hyph;337, October 5, 1994, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1995, expanded 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) to cover employees of DOD installations identified as ``realigning locations'' under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (BRAC) and eliminated the time period for application of 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) if the closure or realignment action is under BRAC. The October 1, 1992, through December 31, 1997, time frame in 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) continues to apply to the closure of DOD installations not covered by BRAC.
