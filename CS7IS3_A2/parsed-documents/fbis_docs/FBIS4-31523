For the first time, the Bosnian forces have broken through several Serb defense lines following several weeks of preparation, UN sources said. In the north and west of the ex-Yugoslav republic, the army is poised to capture one strategic road, are advancing toward another, and are closing in on the town of Dornji Vakuf, which the Serbs captured at the start of the war, UN military observers in the field said. With the offensives underway, the Bosnian military command has barred foreign reporters from combat zones and tightened control on local media. It refuses to confirm reports of territorial gains and has sealed off entire sectors to UN peacekeepers and observers. Analysts say the Bosnian army drive was made possible by the end of fighting between the Moslems and Croats, who have recently agreed to form a federation on territory under their control. "At many points along the front, (the government forces) are no longer the underdog or in a position of obvious inferiority thanks to troops released under an agreement with the Croats," a western military observer said. "They take the initiative and have learned, after two years of war, the importance of controlling information," he added. UN peacekeepers rely on estimates, helped by satellite pictures, to judge the success of the Bosnian army's first widescale offensive. In the past few days, the fiercest fighting has been waged for control of what the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) call "route Duck," a strategic road linking two mainly Moslem regions in the northwest of the country and running through the Serb enclave of Ozren. If captured, it would enable the Moslems to link up the towns of Maglaj and Tesanj to Tuzla, Bosnia's second city, reducing the time needed to travel between them to two hours instead of the 12 it currently takes by a more circuitous route. By Thursday, after several days of coordinated infantry offensives to the west and east, the army had conquered several of the seven kilometers of the road from Serb forces, UN military experts estimated. "A victory on route Duck would have little military significance but an enormous psychological effect," a senior UNPROFOR officer in the region said. Large contingents of Moslem troops have also been mobilized for the past two weeks fighting for control of another road -- running from the town of Teslic, south to the western front. Army shells have pummeled the road from surrounding crests for several days and an offensive to descend into the valley is probably underway. "We may well see a big effort by the Bosnian army over the next 48 hours to make the most of its winning hand before the ceasefire signed in Geneva comes into force -- that is if they intend to respect it," a UN officer told AFP. The Serbs, Moslems and Croats agreed Wednesday in Geneva to observe a month-long ceasefire from Friday, under strong pressure from the United Nations. Like Teslic, Dornji Vakuf, also on the western front, appears on a list of seven towns that army chief General Rasim Delic says he will be able to "liberate" soon. On Wednesday the army had broken through Serb front lines and clashes were underway in villages outside the town. Here in the nearby town of Travnik, a spokesman for headquarters of the army's 3rd corps denied Dornji Vakuf had fallen as troops just back from the front, carrying assault rifles and dressed in chemical- and germ-warfare resistant combat gear sat in groups on the sidewalks. In Sarajevo, UNPROFOR spokesman Captain Eric Chaperon said fighting died down somewhat along the main fronts in Bosnia as the truce agreement was signed in Geneva Wednesday. The Gradacac and Ribnica fronts in the north and Sapna, in the northeast, remained the most active in Bosnia but "compared to last week, these areas have shown a substantial decrease in the level of fighting," he said.
