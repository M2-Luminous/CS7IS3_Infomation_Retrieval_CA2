Zlenko, in particular, said the development of relations between the two countries has deep roots. "To many sons and daughters of the Jewish people, Ukraine has become a homeland encouraging the evolution of their talent. We regret that some of the best and most highly qualified professionals are leaving Ukraine. Our country does not object to the natural process of Jewish emigration as long as it proceeds in a civilized manner," Anatoliy Zlenko said. The Ukrainian foreign minister underscored his country's readiness to contribute to ending confrontation in the Middle East region on a multilateral basis within the framework of the United Nations. Shim'on Peres said this was his first visit to Ukraine and he could see differences between the situation in Ukraine and the way it is described by some of the mass media. He expressed the opinion that cooperation in the sphere of culture and business could be particularly fruitful. As for Ukraine's role in settling Middle East issues, Shim'on Peres emphasized that Israel would welcome Ukraine's possible participation in the peace process in the Middle East region. As far the Crimean issue is concerned, the Israeli foreign affairs minister underscored that Israel has already expressed its support for the Ukrainian Government's policy and that position remains unchanged. Shim'on Peres also said that he will stay in Ukraine for one more day and on 17 June will visit Odessa where, he said, Israel's consulate is to open in the very near future.
