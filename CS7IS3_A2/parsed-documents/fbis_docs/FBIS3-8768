Such a political move complies with the requirements of the Council of Europe and NATO regarding the control that should be exerted by civilian society over the armed forces; however, the move was made in the context of a domestic political situation marked by the issue of replacing certain persons in the government team. What were the foreign and domestic factors that led to the appointment of the "civilian" Gheorghe Tinca as head of the National Defense Ministry? [Tinca] In other countries it is not unusual to have civilians lead their defense ministries. However, in our country, according to our traditions -- and history confirms it is a tradition -- we have always had a military person run our defense. But why did they appoint a civilian as head of the Ministry of National Defense now? Of course, we should not overlook the need for our country to adjust to international standards; however, that adjustment is not done automatically and in an unconditioned way, but rather by observing our national characteristics and interests. Besides the need to adjust to international standards, the appointment of a civilian as minister of national defense is even more important for the evolution, in a broader sense, of Romanian society. This evolution presupposes a different kind of harmonization of Romania's state institutions, among which the armed forces, as a fundamental pillar, play an important role. Constitutional states presuppose the existence of open societies; of course, the opening of society does not mean leaving the state to be blown away by the wind, or doing away with the borders, state institutions, and so on. That opening means -- in contrast to our former state ideology, which was active but stiff, and this finally led to its blocking -- that a new framework ought to be set up, in accordance with certain criteria elaborated on the basis of pluralism, to support that evolution. In a word, I am talking about the efforts made to modernize Romania, the Romanian state, and this is the context within which the appointment of a civilian as head of the armed forces should be viewed. Our integration within the Euro-Atlantic structures is not taking place because the wind is now blowing from a difference direction, but rather because it offers real chances to modernize our country and return to normality in our economic, social, and political life. Despite the difficulties caused by transition, the Ministry of National Defense has achieved important things on the road of reform and those efforts will be continued within the framework of the Partnership for Peace concluded with NATO. Personally, I intend to continue the process of modernizing our armed forces and harmonizing them with our other institutions, and, if I can, to contribute to the furthering of that process. As a matter of fact I believe that under the current circumstances it serves the interests of the army to have a civilian as defense minister. Being a fundamental institution of the Romanian state -- a law-governed country, in which the separation of powers is precisely established by our Constitution -- the ministry of defense has to participate in the dialogue that is specific for pluralistic states. At the same time the armed forces ought to concentrate on their specific mission. The presence of a civilian at the leadership of the ministry makes it possible for the military to concentrate on their profession and relieves them from having to deal with a number of things, in which the army -- as it turned out -- should not be involved. In this way civilian ministers can better defend and maintain the prestige of the army in the eyes of public opinion. [Petrean] You have taken over the leadership of the National Defense Ministry in a dynamic, but also difficult international context, and that also goes for our national security. What are your "tactical" priorities? [Tinca] When talking about national security, many people think solely of the army. There are times, when the army really plays the leading role; however, there are other times, when diplomacy does. In my opinion, the decisive role is always belongs to economy. In the current context, besides the importance of the economy, I think we are witnessing times when diplomacy and defense policy should merge in a singular effort to ensure the security of the country; both the armed forces and diplomacy ought to be in a vigilant state. [Petrean] How do you assess the process of Romania's Euro- Atlantic integration? What trump cards do you think we are holding in view of the implementation of the ideas of our partnership with NATO, which presupposes a certain degree of compatibility both in the structure and the equipment of the armed forces? [Tinca] Our trump cards are numerous and important. The first is our country's geographic position, which is a fundamental asset; that position is not merely important for us and this region, but also for the whole of Europe, and in a broader approach, even for the non-European areas neighboring the continent. Our second trump is economic, and I am referring especially to Romania's industry. It is true, our industry was conceived in a way that later proved to be mistaken; it also needs to be re-equipped. But the existence of our industry is a fact. Well before 1969 Romania was already covering the largest part of its needs in defense equipment from its own sources and -- from this point of view -- it was greatly independent. There is yet another trump card, about which we talk a lot, although we do not seem to be much convinced about its value: the human factor. There are 23 million Romanians -- not to mention the ones living outside our borders -- who can read and write; there are 23 million Romanians who were involved in immense efforts, even if some of those efforts were made to achieve projects that later proved to be lacking viability. Let us not forget that all those projects were completed by experts and those experts still exist. [Petrean] Our Euro-Atlantic integration is one of the very few issues regarding which there is almost complete consensus among our political forces. How do you assess your future cooperation with the political parties? [Tinca] I believe that the phase we have already gone through was more simple than the one that follows, because both the country's integration within the European Union, and the one within Euro-Atlantic structures will now enter the phase of deeds. Declarations, manifestations of political will are very important and serious things, and quite often it is not very easy to adopt them. However, in the coming stage we will have to take a great number of practical measures which may demand certain sacrifice on behalf of one part of society in order to achieve progress in another. There will be political interests that probably will not always coincide. That is why in the future stage, on the basis of the existing consensus regarding our country's Euro-Atlantic integration, it is very important that the bearers of various political interests -- the parties -- should continue their dialogue and cooperation. It will be a process of permanent negotiations, in which all will have to set out from one principle, namely that when all is said and done we all desire the same thing: the modernization of Romania. I dare assume that the needs of the armed forces will be given special attention, as this is an issue of national interest. [Petrean] You are a career diplomat, directly experienced in issues such as relations with various international bodies, problems of international security, arms control, and disarmament. What are the advantages and, if any, the disadvantages of your experience as a diplomat who has now become minister of defense? [Tinca] My 28-year experience in diplomacy means a plus in certain domains: First, diplomacy is the science of knowing how to conduct negotiations, and that is a "school" that we politicians should all have graduated from. Diplomacy teaches one how to be flexible, but not in a gratuitous way, but rather as a method to achieve a general goal, such as, in my case now, the security of our country. Besides this, diplomacy is an experience that also lends one the ability to really "feel" one's partners, and a profession that furthers one's ability to behave calmly, tactfully, and wisely. Common sense, honesty, and loyalty are other such positive traits that may be added the ones I mentioned before. On the other hand, I believe that it is also a handicap for me. The nature of my diplomatic experience (in security and disarmament issues) makes me able to perceive the entire volume of the things I ought to achieve, and, considering the dimensions of those tasks, I feel overwhelmed to a certain extent. On top of that, I am the sort of person who always tries to achieve perfection. I am certain that I will be well understood -- even if not right away, but very soon, I hope -- by our officers' and command corps. I am also convinced that my good intentions, good faith, and sense of responsibility for the fundamental interests of our country will be fully perceived, and that our work relations will be based on my respect for the armed forces, on perfect sincerity, and honesty. It is to my real satisfaction and it makes me optimistic that -- having to deal with the army -- these relations will be definitely manly ones, which I have always liked.
