FR940119-0-00022 FR940119-0-00005 For the Kentucky, West Virginia, and Utah provisions, the Director exercised his authority as the Secretary's designee to consider these distinct differences between surface and underground mines and approved them. The Director reasoned that the provisions provided equitable treatment for pre-SMCRA mines that have operated continuously since before the effective date of SMCRA. They also afforded the same variance from AOC requirements as is provided in 30 CFR 817.106 for remining sites where operation of a pre-SMCRA mine has been interrupted and mining was begun again at the sites after the â€™ effective date of SMCRA. For the same reasons discussed above for the Kentucky, West Virginia, and Utah proposed regulations, the Director finds that Colorado's proposed Rules 4.14.1(2)(f) (i) through (v) are not inconsistent with the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 817.106 (a), (b), and (b)(1) or any other requirements of the Federal regulations or SMCRA, insofar as they apply to underground mining operations that operated prior to August 3, 1977, and have continuously operated since that time. The Director wishes to emphasize that any exception to SMCRA's requirement to completely eliminate all highwalls, including the exception for continuously mined areas, must be construed and implemented in a carefully limited manner and should ensure that the highwall is removed to the maximum extent technically practical (48 FR 41720, 41729, September 16, 1983). Thus, for example, where an underground mining operation has been continuously mined since before the effective date of SMCRA (August 3, 1977) and contains both pre- and post-SMCRA face-up or portal areas, this exception must be understood as applying only to the pre-SMCRA face-up areas. Any post-SMCRA portal areas within the same mining operation must comply with the requirement to completely eliminate all highwalls. Colorado has confirmed that the exception proposed at Rule 4.14.1(2)(f) would apply only to those face-up areas or highwalls that were created prior to August 3, 1977, and that any face-up area or highwall initially formed after August 3, 1977, at an underground mining operation would be subject to the requirements for complete highwall elimination under the approved Colorado program (administrative record No. CO&hyph;538). For the reasons discussed above, the Director approves Colorado's proposed Rules 4.14.1(2)(f) (i) through (v). 4. Rule 4.14.1(2)(g), Exception From the Requirement for Complete Highwall Elimination for Remining Sites Mined and Abandoned Prior to August 3, 1977 Colorado proposed to add Rule 4.14.1(2)(g), which allows for an exception to the requirement for complete highway elimination at remining operations initiated after August 3, 1977, on sites that were mined and abandoned prior to August 3, 1977, and contain a preexisting highwall, when the operator demonstrates in writing to the Division that the volume of all reasonably available spoil is insufficient to completely backfill the reaffected or enlarged highwall so as to achieve a static safety factor of 1.3. In such instances, the highwall must be eliminated to the maximum extent technically practical and must comply with criteria proposed at Rules 4.14.1(2)(g) (i) through (v), which are addressed in finding No. 3. Colorado's proposed rules are substantively identical to the requirements of the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.106(b) (1) through (4), 817.106(b) (1) through (4), 816.102 (a)(3) and (f), and 817.102(a)(3) and (f). For this reason, the Director finds that Colorado's proposed Rules 4.14.1(2)(g) (i) through (v) are no less effective than the counterpart Federal regulations and approves them. 5. Revisions to Colorado's Approved Program to Incorporate Both Existing and Proposed Exemptions to the Requirement to Achieve AOC and Proposed Exceptions to the Requirement to Completely Eliminate all Highwalls (A) Rule 4.14.1(2)(a) (1) Colorado's proposed references to both existing and proposed exemptions to the requirement to achieve AOC. Existing Colorado Rule 4.14.1(2)(a), which has been previously approved by OSM, provides that the AOC of an area disturbed by surface mining must be restored ``[e]xcept as specifically exempted in these Rules.'' Colorado proposed to eliminate the general phrase ``[i]n these Rules'' and replace it with specific references to all of the provisions of the Colorado program that provide exemptions from the requirement to restore AOC. The referenced exemptions include proposed Rules 4.14.1(2)(f) and 4.14.1(2)(g) and existing Rules 2.06.5, 4.14.1(2)(e), and 4.27.4.
