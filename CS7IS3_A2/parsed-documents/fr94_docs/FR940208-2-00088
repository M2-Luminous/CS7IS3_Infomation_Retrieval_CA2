Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The Regional Exchanges propose to extend their respective pilot programs relating to price protection of limit orders until April 30, 1994. The rule changes provide primary market protection to certain limit orders trading at the limit price in a primary market's after-hours trading session. 4 4 On June 13, 1991, the Commission approved, on a pilot basis File Nos. SR&hyph;MSE&hyph;91&hyph;11 ( in 1991, the CHX was named the Midwest Stock Exchange or MSE), SR&hyph;BSE&hyph;91&hyph;04, SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;91&hyph;21, and SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;91&hyph;26, which amended the Exchange's respective Rules relating to price protection of limit orders. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29297 (June 13, 1991), 56 FR 28191 (June 19, 1991) (order approving File No. SR&hyph;MSE&hyph;91&hyph;11)(MSE Approval Order); Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29301 (June 13, 1991), 56 FR 28182 (June 19, 1991) (BSE Approval Order); Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29305 (June 13, 1991), 56 FR 28208 (June 19, 1991) (PSE Approval Order); and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29300 (June 13, 1991), 56 FR 28212 (June 19, 1991) (Phlx Approval Order). At that time, the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') had initiated its Off-Hours trading (``OHT'') sessions. The NYSE OHT facility extends the NYSE's trading hours beyond the 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. trading session to establish two trading sessions: Crossing Session I and Crossing Session II. Crossing Session I permits the execution of single-stock single-sided closing price orders and crosses of single-stock closing price buy and sell orders. Crossing Session II allows the execution of crosses of multiple-stock aggregate-price buy and sell orders. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29237 (May 24, 1991), 56 FR 24853 (May 31, 1991) (approving File Nos. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;90&hyph;52 and NYSE&hyph;90&hyph;53). On August 2, 1991, The Commission approved a proposed rule change by the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'') to establish a pilot extending its trading hours to establish an after-hours trading facility that would permit the execution of: (1) Single-sided closing-price orders; and (2) crosses of closing-price buy and sell orders. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29515 (August 2, 1991), 56 FR 37736 (August 8, 1991) (approving File No. SR&hyph;AMEX&hyph;91&hyph;15).

The Commission approved extensions of the NYSE, Amex and CHX pilots, as well as pilots by the PSE, Phlx and BSE until January 31, 1994.
