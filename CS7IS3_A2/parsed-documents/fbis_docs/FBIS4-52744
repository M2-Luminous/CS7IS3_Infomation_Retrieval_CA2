The sources said the ships, including a destroyer and a frigate, are expected to pass through the Tsushima Straits into the Sea of Japan early Saturday. It is believed to be the first time in the postwar period for Chinese naval ships to enter the Sea of Japan. Russia's ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY reported earlier this month that three Chinese Navy ships, led by Chinese Northern Fleet Commander Wang Jing and including the destroyer Zhuhai, escort ship Huainan and rescue ship Anxindao, will arrive in Vladivostok on May 17. The sources said Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) P-3C aircraft spotted a 3,250-ton Luda-class destroyer, a supply ship, and a submarine support and rescue ship. Also sighted by the MSDF, but not mentioned in the report, was a 2,250-ton frigate equipped with antiaircraft missiles. The ships are returning a visit paid to the Chinese port city of Qingdao last August by a group of three Russian Navy ships.
