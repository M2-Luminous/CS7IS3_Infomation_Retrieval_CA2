Praised be God who said: And fear the trial which affecteth not in particular only those of you who do wrong. [koranic verse] God's peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad and all his family and companions. Our people were celebrating the first anniversary of the 27 April 1993 elections -- which were viewed by all as a solution to the crises and problems witnessed by our country throughout the transitional period and as the beginning of a new stage of stability and development -- when evil elements that feed on crises and problems, that do not wish our country and people well, and that do not want security and stability moved to sow sedition among the sons of the one Yemeni people, triggering violent clashes among the comrades-in-arms in the 'Imran camp. As a result, a large number of our sons and brothers -- officers and soldiers of the Armed Forces and innocent citizens -- were martyred or wounded and military vehicles and hardware were destroyed for no reason except the desire of certain party leaders to escalate the political crisis that has been going on for about nine months. This crisis has adversely affected all the political, economic, and security aspects of life. It harmed the citizens and gravely affected their lives for the sake of realizing parochial partisan interests devoid of any sense of national responsibility or care for the homeland's unity, sovereignty, and stability. While expressing its extreme regret, sorrow, and condemnation of what happened at the 'Imran camp, the Higher Committee of the Yemeni Reform Grouping would like to extend its sincere condolences to the families of the martyrs who fell in this criminal incident, and to all members of the patient Yemeni people everywhere who lost brave sons whom they prepared to defend Yemen and its sovereignty and independence and not to realize parochial wishes and interests. It also beseeches Almighty God to encompass them with His grace, grant their relatives and families patience and consolation, and ensure the speedy recovery of the wounded. Out of its religious and national responsibility, out of its care for the blood of the sons of the one unified Yemen, and out of its desire to maintain unity, the Higher Committee of the Yemeni Reform Grouping would like to emphasize what it has already announced and demanded: The Armed Forces must be away from party conflicts and the neutrality of this national institution must be maintained. It must be considers the property of the entire Yemeni people and not a single party. The Armed Forces should not be used to achieve partisan aims and purposes. The Reform Grouping also stresses the need to rebuild, unite, and merge the Armed Forces according to national principles so that they become the forces of the one united Yemeni people and be loyal to God only. Their task should be that of protecting the homeland and defending its sovereignty, independence, security, and stability. The Reform Grouping also calls on the competent quarters to expedite investigations into what happened, identify those responsible, and send those parties to the judiciary for judgment. The results should be announced to the people so that the truth will be known and the public can be reassured about the situation. It also calls on every individual and group to rise up to the level of their responsibility, exercise self-restraint, resort to reason, spare the Yemeni people's blood everywhere, adopt dialogue, and avoid the use of force to resolve conflicts. It appeals to the sons of the Armed Forces in particular and the Yemeni people in general to be alert and cautious, not to be dragged in by those who want to implicate them in armed conflict for personal gains, and to confront anyone who tries to harm Yemen or threaten its unity. The Higher Committee of the Yemeni Reform Grouping extends its thanks and appreciation to the honorable tribesmen for their sense of responsibility and their rejection of oneupmanship and calls aimed at disrupting their unity. Even those whose difficult circumstances forced them to adopt some wrong positions soon discovered the plans aimed at embroiling them into actions in which neither they nor their homeland had any interest. Proceeding from its sense of responsibility before God and out of its loyalty to the people and its concern for Yemeni unity, and in an effort to spare the blood of the Yemeni people, the Higher Committee of the Yemeni Reform Grouping calls on the coalition leadership to meet as soon as possible to examine the situation, avert further deterioration, achieve security and stability, maintain the new democratic experiment, respect the nation's will, and end the suffering of the citizens. It considers the coalition government leadership primarily responsible for the implementation of the provisions of the coalition document and the coalition government program, which was approved by the House of Representatives. It is also responsible for the implementation of the pledge and accord document, which was approved by the Political Forces Dialogue Committee and signed on 10 Ramadan, 20 February 1994, in Amman. May God keep Yemen united, ward off any harm to its people, unite hearts along the path of good and right, and grant us success. He has power over all things. [Signed] The Higher Committee of the Yemeni Reform Grouping
