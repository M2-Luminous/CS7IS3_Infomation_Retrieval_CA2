Russia Thinks it Already Has Peacekeeping Mandate"] [Text] Commenting on his rumored appointment as Russian ambassador to the United Nations, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was concise: rumors are there, the decision is not. Even so, his contacts with the United Nations remain close, and Mr. Lavrov agreed yesterday to present to KOMMERSANT-DAILY his view of Russia's relationship with this organization. The deputy minister began by denying mass media reports about Russia's soliciting UN permission for peacekeeping missions in the CIS. According to Mr. Lavrov, being a foreign policy tool, the United Nations cannot be important in itself. UN decisions are always a compromise, hence proposals, in particular from Russia, do not go through every time. Making use of the United Nations, Lavrov said, is important for Russia for two reasons. First, because Russia's interests are recognized on an international scale; second, because countries elaborating a decision are invited for joint actions. By way of examples where Moscow's stance is recognized and implemented, Mr. Lavrov referred to UN resolutions on the human rights situation in Latvia and Estonia, and on the withdrawal of troops from there, as well as the decision to create the position of high commissioner for human rights. Touching on peacekeeping in the CIS, Mr. Lavrov stated that protecting its interests, Russia needs no UN or CSCE permission for such an activity because it does not contravene international law and the UN Charter (which contains no corresponding provisions). Saying this, Sergey Lavrov pointed out that the United Nations should be more active in the zones of conflicts and share the burden of Russia's expenses. Mr. Lavrov sees no sensation in Shevardnadze's call for bringing UN forces into Georgia -- Kozyrev and Aleksandr Chikvaidze, head of the Georgian Foreign Ministry, came forward with such a call last summer. But the United Nations is dragging its feet on the decision, which is why the responsibility for disrupting the Sochi accords rests on it, Mr. Lavrov thinks. The deputy minister announced that this problem will be discussed during a visit by Butros Butros-Ghali. On the problem of sanctions, Mr. Lavrov said that in Moscow's opinion there is no longer any need to press them against Yugoslavia because Belgrade has meet all the conditions imposed on it. But Moscow's proposals on humanitarian supplies, Lavrov said, are being blocked by the United States. This is also true about Iraq -- the United Nations is now discussing the question of revising the sanctions. Baghdad, Lavrov thinks, has also met the UN demand for disarmament and opening its defense program to monitoring which is, incidentally, the condition for lifting the embargo on exports of its oil. Mr. Lavrov detailed the opinion of the Foreign Ministry, where they think that a six-month monitoring period could be imposed following which the oil-export embargo could be lifted (Paris agrees with Moscow on that). Libya is a more difficult case. Al-Qadhdhafi has not so far extradited the terrorists, and Russia will have to work on that yet, Mr. Lavrov concluded. [International Life Desk commentary] The most striking thing in the deputy foreign minister's interview is that his words on peacekeeping in the CIS echo the provisions in Boris Yeltsin's message to the Federal Assembly. As many people know, the United Nations and the CSCE still will not recognize the Russian troops' status as peacekeeping forces, or finance their part in settling conflicts in the CIS. Now Moscow states straight out that it is not going to solicit permission for protecting its own interests. Yet another point -- the deputy minister's words about sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Iraq having lost their usefulness. It is not for nothing that the United States opposes their lifting, having in mind the presence of Russian interests in these countries. Moscow's stance in regard to the sanctions (despite its support by a number of European countries) may spark tension in its relations with the United States and the West as a whole.
