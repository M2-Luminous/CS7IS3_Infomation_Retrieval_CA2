Sailors Remind Presidents of Their Problems"] [Text] Disputes about nuclear arms on Ukrainian territory have relegated the Black Sea Fleet problem to the back burner. The situation there remains tense, however, which was confirmed by an appeal signed by officers of a Black Sea Fleet submarine formation to the chiefs of Russia, Ukraine, and Crimea, calling for the status of the fleet and Sevastopol as its main base to be determined as soon as possible. The 1992 Russian-Ukrainian agreements called for a joint command of the Black Sea Fleet during the transitional period until 1995. In June 1993, the presidents of Russia and Ukraine decided to split the Black Sea Fleet equally, and at the September meeting in Crimea Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk agreed to hand the Ukrainian part of the fleet over to Russia toward repaying Ukraine's debts for energy deliveries. The appeal points out that uncertainty over the Black Sea Fleet's political future may lead to a situation where Russia will simply be left without a fleet in the Black Sea. Given this, the authors of the appeal called on the leaders of Russia and Ukraine to determine as soon as possible the status of Black Sea Fleet servicemen and the city of Sevastopol as the fleet's main base, and also to speed up the solution of the question of dual citizenship for Black Sea Fleet sailors and their family members. The appeal also suggests that Black Sea Fleet sailors be allowed to receive pay on Russian territory if Ukraine is unable to provide Black Sea Fleet servicemen with money. Meanwhile, a lack of a definitive solution to the problem of the Black Sea Fleet's status leads to a further heightening of tensions. On Tuesday, the Black Sea Fleet press service denounced attempts by the command of the Ukrainian Navy and the authorities of the city of Izmail to establish control of the Black Sea Fleet's naval engineering service units deployed in far-flung garrisons. The statement says that the blackmail and threats to which the Ukrainian authorities have subjected the sailors may lead to unpredictable consequences. Some crews are even ready to stop navigating the Danube as a protest.
