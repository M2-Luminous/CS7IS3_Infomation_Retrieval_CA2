"The only appropriate way that parties directly involved will resolve the issue constructively is with patience," said Jiang, concurrently general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party. Jiang was speaking to the Korean reporters for some 20 minutes after summit talks with South Korean President Kim Yong-sam. The Chinese leader was quoted as saying there is a limit to what China can do. He expressed hope that the nuclear problem would be solved through existing channels of dialogue among Seoul, Pyongyang, Washington and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the journalists said. "I discussed the nuclear issue frankly with the South Korean side and agreed that a solution through dialogue is the proper way," Jiang said. The IAEA referred North Korea's nuclear issue to the U.N. Security Council after Pyongyang hampered full inspections of its suspected nuclear facilities to verify whether it had diverted materials for the development of nuclear weapons. The U.S. has proposed a Security Council resolution urging North Korea to agree to follow-up inspections of its nuclear facilities within one month. But China, which is eager to keep open the door for dialogue with North Korea, has suggested that the Security Council issue a nonbinding statement in the name of its president, Jaen-Bernard Merimee of France. Jiang also told the Korean reporters that if tensions mount on the peninsula, the Korean people will suffer most and the situation will not be good for Northeast Asia. In talks with Kim on Monday, Jiang reiterated the need for patience on all sides and added that pressure should not be used, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said. Kim, who flew into Shanghai from Tokyo on Saturday, arrived in Beijing late Sunday to meet Chinese leaders to discuss the North's suspected nuclear development program and expand Seoul's trade ties with Beijing. He will return home Wednesday.
