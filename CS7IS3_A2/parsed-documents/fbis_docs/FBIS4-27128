The conference is organized by governmental figures and organizations under the patronage of Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamed. Abdul Ghani bin Othman, the Malaysian minister of youth and sports and representative of the Malaysian prime minister, delivered a speech at the conference. He asserted that there are no longer any justifications for the blockade, noting the need for the international community and the United Nations to work honestly to end the injustice done to Iraq. The Malaysian prime minister's representative also conveyed the prime minister's greetings to the leadership and patient, steadfast people of Iraq. Latif Nusayyif Jasim, the chairman of the [Iraqi] Friendship, Peace, and Solidarity Organization, gave a speech in which he said that Iraq was chosen as a target of aggression for many reasons, primarily because it represents the impregnable eastern gate of the Arab nation. He added that Iraq enjoys significant political, economic, and military weight and has a policy that is independent from the Western octopus. This is in addition to the fact that it champions the causes and aspirations of Third World nations, and all other nations that care about their independence and sovereignty. He added that the reasons cited by the influential states at the Security Council to maintain the unjust blockade against our people are gone. Iraq has fulfilled all its obligations toward these resolutions, particularly Resolution 687, Paragraph 22, which stipulates that Iraq is free to export its oil and have trade and commercial transactions and exchange goods with the world. Latif Nusayyif Jasim added that the UN Special Commission has corroborated the fact that Iraq has fulfilled its obligations. He added that after Iraq implemented its commitments per Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 and in view of its cooperation with UN committees, some permanent members of the Security Council are now highlighting the need to lift this inhuman blockade. In addition, there are thousands of governmental and nongovernmental figures and organizations that call for ending the suffering of the people of Iraq as a result of the blockade that has persisted for far too long, since there are no longer any justifications for it.
