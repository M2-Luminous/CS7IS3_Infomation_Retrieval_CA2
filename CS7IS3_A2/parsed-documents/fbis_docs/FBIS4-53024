The farmers enthusiastically welcomed them upon their arrival in the farm. [Officer Hwang Myong-chin, identified by caption] The 10 comrade party members, who completed service at our unit, have advanced in a group to Pongnae Cooperative Farm, Pyonggang County located along the demarcation line bearing the deep trust and love of the respected and beloved comrade supreme commander General Kim Chong-il. During their entire military service, the officers showed examples in carrying out revolutionary duties better than any others. After the service, these comrades could have entered colleges, returned to their beloved hometowns, or deployed to important revolutionary outposts where they could display feats. But they ran to the fields of the cooperative farm with the single will of displaying feats of youth in the construction of socialist cultural farms, which is our party's first wish at present. [Discharged soldier Hwang Won-kun] Blessed by tens of thousands of people, the hearts of every one of us who ran to Pongnae Cooperative Farm located along the demarcation line, are burning with new hope. Fields of socialist cooperative farms. What a rewarding work site! [Discharged soldier Hyon Myong-kwan] That's right. From today, we the 10 discharged soldier-party members will settle down in this cooperative field forever and unsparingly dedicate our sweats of loyalty. We are not simply discharged soldiers. Upholding the far-seeing plan of the respected and beloved comrade supreme commander, we are the brilliant soldiers of the entire country, who are running to new front lines and new outposts . Therefore, every one of us will become a cell party member here at a unit of Pongnae Cooperative Farm. As did the revolutionary party members of Nagwon in the past days of the fatherland liberation war, we will become 10 party members of socialist farms, and add luster to our lives as reliable masters and persons truly in charge of the construction of socialist cultural farms, which are better places to live in. [Village party secretary Kim Ho-kyu] How reliable and presentable are they? We thank the respected and beloved comrade supreme commander and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who fostered the excellent discharged soldier-party members. We will help the 10 valuable discharged soldier-party members so that they become true heroes and reliable persons in charge of the construction of socialist cultural farms.
