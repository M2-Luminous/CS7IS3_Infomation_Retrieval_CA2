Moscow Military District Military Council Examines State of Military Discipline in District"] [Text] A report at the military council meeting was delivered by Lieutenant General Leonid Zolotov, the district's chief of staff. The figures and facts which he quoted can hardly be called reassuring. Over the past two years the number of people sentenced in the district for various military crimes has increased by 13 percent. Over the past year 82 servicemen have been killed, along with another 19 in the first two months of this year. Twenty-five of them died while not on duty, and another 18 died in car crashes in personal transport. Nor has there been any reduction in the number of those who have embarked on the path of embezzling military property, weapons, and munitions. Last year 20 firearms and more than 5,000 rounds of ammunition -- most of which have not been recovered -- were stolen. The district chief of staff noted that the main pernicious influences on the state of military discipline and law and order include the acute shortage of platoon and company commanders and their deputy commanders for work with the personnel. The district is currently 50 percent short of these categories of junior officers, and in certain units this figure is considerably higher. At the same time more than 500 mostly more senior officers have been in uniform for a long time now and are to all intents and purposes dealing with matters far removed from the service. There are also problems with the discipline of contract servicemen. The command has been forced to cancel the contracts of 1,266 of the 7,360 soldiers and warrant officers serving in district units under contract. The reasons for this are indiscipline and low moral qualities. Colonel General Leontiy Kuznetsov, commander of the Moscow Military District, called on commanders and oblast military commissariat workers to be more discriminating in their selection of people for contract service.
