With the proclamation of the historic law on agrarian reform in Korea on March 5, 1946, the farmers became the masters of the land. Korea observes this day as day of agricultural working people. The agricultural working people are greeting this day with successful preparations for farming in spring to bring a bumper harvest this year, too. They are directing efforts to increasing the fertility of paddy and non-paddy fields. According to data available, more compost than planned had been carried out to the paddy and non-paddy fields of South Hwanghae Province and other western areas of the country by March 1. Carpeting fields with humus soil is in full swing. In the first two months of this year, 50,000 hectares of fields were carpeted with humus soil, taking the country as a whole. Cooperative farms are making substantial preparations for sowing seed rice on cold-frame beds. Notably, co-op farms in Sinchon and Anak Counties, South Hwanghae Province, Pongsan County, North Hwanghae Province, and Hamju County, South Hamgyong Province, had prepared windbreak fences, vinyl sheets and other materials for cold-frame beds by the end of February, earlier than the set time. The rural communities in the west coast have filled reservoirs with water and completed the cleaning of waterways and checkup and repair of pumping facilities. County farm machine stations and repair bases of cooperative farms across the country have completed the repair and readjustment of tractors and trailing farm machines. And industrial establishments related to the agricultural sector are supplying farming materials and chemical fertilizers to cooperative farms in time.
