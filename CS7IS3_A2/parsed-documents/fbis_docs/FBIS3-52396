The reason which led to this drastic measure is that in recent days well over 40,000 Afghans, including men, women and children, had crossed over to Pakistan. There were serious apprehensions that their number might further increase if effective precautionary measures were not taken. According to well informed official sources the government has conveyed to Rabbani-led Afghan government the reasons for such a drastic action. However, the response of Kabul regime is not known. Pakistan embassy in Kabul has also been apprised of the new policy and directed to follow a certain procedure before granting visas to intending Afghan nationals visiting Pakistan. In view of the federal government's decision the administration in the Frontier province [North-West Frontier Province -- NWFP] has been directed to keep an eye on illegal arrivals from Afghanistan and "maintain the sanctity of the border". It was also requested that a record of Afghan nationals crossing the border every day should also be maintained. The sudden increase in the number of Afghans crossing over to Pakistan is due to heavy fighting in Kabul and its surroundings. A recent report of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees indicated that a large number of those Afghan refugees who were repatriated under the UN umbrella have also started returning to Pakistan and are desperately trying to reoccupy their houses in different refugee camps in the NWFP. Pakistan played a host to well over three million Afghan refugees during the Mujahideen's Jehad against the Soviet forces and Dr Najibollah-led Kabul regime. [passage omitted]
