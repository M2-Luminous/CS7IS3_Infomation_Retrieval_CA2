A PHA may not establish a limit on the number of elderly families or disabled families who may be accepted for occupancy in a mixed population project. (b) The PHA must follow its policies and procedures for applying the Federal preferences contained in subpart B of this part when selecting applicants for admission from among elderly families and disabled families. (c) Elderly families and disabled families who do not qualify for a Federal preference contained in subpart B of this part, and who are given preference for admission under paragraph (a) of this section over non-elderly families and non-disabled families that qualify for such a Federal preference, are not subject to the statutory 10 percent limitation on admission of families without a Federal preference over families with such a Federal preference that may initially receive assistance in any one-year period, as provided in 24 CFR 960.211(b)(2)(ii). (d) If an elderly or disabled applicant is a single person, as this term is defined in 24 CFR part 945, the elderly single person or the disabled single person shall be given a preference for admission to mixed population projects over single persons who are neither elderly nor disabled. (e) In offering available units to elderly families and disabled families in mixed population projects, units with accessible features should first be offered to persons with disabilities who require the accessibility features of the unit in accordance with the requirements of 24 CFR 8.27 and 24 CFR 100.202(c)(3).
