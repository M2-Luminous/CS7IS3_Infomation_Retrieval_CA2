Speaking after his meeting with the chairman of the Japan-Poland Economic Committee, Toshikuni Yahiro, he said that "Poland's good economic results will contribute to ensuring that it is based on partnership and will be beneficial to both sides." Pawlak emphasised that Polish-Japanese trade was increasing. He recalled the important speech of Eijiro Hato, Japan's minister for international trade and industry, concerning the readiness of the Japanese Government to remove the barriers to short term trade loan and long term investment loan guarantees for Poland. Toshikuni Yahiro said that the fifteenth session of the Polish-Japanese economic committees which had taken place after an almost four year break had opened up a new stage in cooperation between the two countries. He added that on his return to Japan he would urge his government to increase economic contacts with Poland. Toshikuni Yahiro said that 1994 was a good year for strengthening economic links since Japan was beginning to recover from a three year recession and Poland had the best ecnomic results of all the central and east European countries.
