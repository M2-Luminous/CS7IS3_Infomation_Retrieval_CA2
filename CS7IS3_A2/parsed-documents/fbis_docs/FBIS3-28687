The report handed to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa also features tax breaks to encourage housing purchases, the correction of unfair tax treatments and liquor tax hikes. The Tax Commission, an advisory panel to the prime minister, considers the income tax cut as "unavoidable for a limited one-year period...As an emergency escape to find a way out of the economic slump." But it calls for "appropriate measures over financial burdens caused by the temporary income tax cuts," and stresses that the tax plan is against the panel's November "medium-term" report that recommends a "single dealing" of an income tax cut and a hike in the consumption tax. Speaking at a press meeting after handing over the report, panel chairman Kan Kato said he expressed his "regret" to Hosokawa that the panel was not given sufficient time to discuss its proposals thoroughly. The government and ruling coalition parties decided Tuesday on the 20 percent income tax cut, totaling 5.47 trillion yen, but left aside the funding issue by setting up a forum to discuss it for enactment as law by the end of the year. The tax plan was included in a record 15.25 billion yen economic stimulus package unveiled later Tuesday. Kato urged the forum to promptly decide on tax reform bills based on the November report, and said his panel would also continue studying the issue to win public support. But he also noted that the government and coalition debate over the tax issue helped raise public interest, and repeated that the funding problems should be settled in "six months" while that interest remains high. The report spells out that the panel "recognizes (the tax plan) as a bridge toward realizing the tax reform" for a balanced tax system among income, consumption and assets to cope with the aging of the population. Meanwhile, the panel also supports the government's planned inheritance tax cuts, and the abolition of special corporate tax, and a higher consumption tax rate on passenger cars. The report endorses "appropriate" tax incentives to spur housing and other effective use of land, but notes that the basic framework decided in fiscal 1993 tax reforms to prevent a revival of speculation and a land price boom must be maintained. On unfair tax treatment, the panel recommends raising the special low tax rate or lowering the tax exemption amount, currently at 30 percent, on donations to religious and other nonprofit organizations. As for entertainment expenses which are seen to be used by companies to evade corporate tax, the panel wants the government to levy a given proportion of the current amount of tax exemption at smaller businesses. Concerning the punitive heavy tax on unexplained expenses proposed earlier by the coalition parties, the panel thinks it should be "temporary" because the effects on corporate activities and tax enforcement are unpredictable. The panel also calls for reviewing special tax treatments on mass media and six other designated businesses and rewards to medical practitioners under the social security program. The report approves the tax hikes on beer and other liquor decided earlier by the government.
