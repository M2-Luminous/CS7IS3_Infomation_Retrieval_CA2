He made this remark while opening a meeting of the so-called Cairns Group, made up of 14 countries exporting unsubsidized agricultural products. The discussions will be held until tomorrow at the ALADI [Latin American Integration Association] headquarters in Montevideo. Following are Dr. Pedro Saravia's remarks: [Begin Saravia recording] The negligible reductions in export subsidies make us believe that this practice, which particularly misrepresents the trade of agricultural and livestock products, will continue limiting the development possibilities of agriculture in our countries, at least the mid-term development possibilities. In our opinion, it is clear that the Cairns Group did not achieve all the goals set when it was established. Nevertheless, based on the fact that we did not fully achieve our goals, it is necessary for the group to continue operating in the pursuit of a freer and fairer international trade in agricultural and livestock products. Bearing this goal in mind, the group must remain alert and active in order to secure full compliance with Article 20 of the agricultural agreement on the pursuit of the reform process. We must add the necessity of strengthening the advancements achieved thus far to this mid-term necessity of substantially reducing agricultural protectionism and subsidies. Therefore, we now believe the Cairns Group must play an active role in monitoring compliance with the commitments entered during the Uruguay Round, in keeping alive the issue of agricultural trade on the international agenda, and preventing the surfacing of new forms of protectionism. Dear colleagues, we understand that the Cairns Group played an important role during the Uruguay Round, served national interests, and in the future it must continue playing such a significant role -- as it has been playing so far -- for the benefit of the member states and the multilateral regulation of agricultural trade. [end recording] These were the words of Agriculture Minister Pedro Saravia.
