People inside and outside the government are expected to make brisk moves towards a parliamentary majority. How then should voters respond to the interim government? There is no other way but to establish a concrete criteria for judging whether the interim government is acceptable, taking Japan's world position into consideration. My criteria for such judgment is based on the following two points. First, Japan should be involved in East Asian security. Japan should continue to study how to dissuade North Korea from developing nuclear weapons and how to specifically apply Japan-U.S. security arrangements to the East Asian situation on the premise that Japan takes such initiatives within the framework of the Constitution. The Diet should clarify Japanese involvement in the use of U.S. military bases and supply depots in Japan. Nuclear weapons must be loathed. If the democratic system proves its solidity in blocking North Korea from developing nuclear weapons, this would create a dramatic condition for the security of East Asia. It goes without saying that blocking North Korea from developing nuclear weapons would clear up unfounded concerns over a rise of militarism in Japan. Second, Japan should create a climate for expanding private investment by abolishing economic regulations. The abolishment of such economic regulations will inevitably spark fierce competition among enterprises, and some will suffer defeat. However, goods and services provided by competitive enterprises will greatly benefit consumers and users. This logic has never been tested. Abolishing government regulations will turn the public sector around. But will the Hata government take the lead in abolishing such regulations? The aforementioned points are my criteria for assessing the Hata government.
