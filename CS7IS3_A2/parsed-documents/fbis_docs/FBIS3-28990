Contrary to the agreement between the DPRK and the United States, the United States openly defended the Secretariat of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], which demands that we accept an unjust inspection tantamount to full-scope inspection [chonmyon sachal], and U.S. political figures went off into undisguised war hysterics [nogol chogin chonjaeng kwangjung] against us. All this was a clear manifestation of the policy of crushing [apsal] the Republic. When the United States and the IAEA Secretariat were resorting to base intrigues to crush [apsal] our Republic, openly reversing the spirit of the DPRK-U.S. agreement like this, we could no longer pin hope on the DPRK-U.S. talks and, accordingly, made a resolute decision to walk our own way [chegalkillo nagalsupake optanun tanhohan kyolsimul naerige], not bound to any promise. This decision of ours was immediately conveyed to the U.S. side through a relevant channel. In this regard the U.S. side made clear that the inspection by the IAEA should be one purely for the continuity of safeguards [sunsu tamboui yonsoksong pojangul wihan sachallo] and officially notified our side that there was no change in its position to continue DPRK-U.S. talks and that it was willing to discuss the nuclear issue and the improvement of the relations between the DPRK and the United States as a whole if the third round of talks were held. Timed to coincide with this, the IAEA Secretariat suggested [sisa] that it would renounce its absurd former claim for full- scope inspection and seek an inspection purely for the continuity of safeguards. It is a fortunate thing, if this position of the United States and the IAEA Secretariat were true. However, the pressure commotions against the Republic, which the U.S. hard-line conservatives are continuously kicking up, make us deeply doubt whether this position of the United States is true or not. The U.S. Senate reportedly passed a resolution on sanctions against us some time ago, and the U.S. representative [taepyo] in the United Nations reportedly convened a consultative meeting of the permanent members of the UN Security Council and discussed the feasibility of the sanctions. The United States and the South Korean authorities are even showing an undisguised movement to stage the Team Spirit joint military exercises. The United States resorts to such pressure commotions even before the end of the negotiations between the DPRK and the IAEA Secretariat for defining the scope of inspection for the continuity of safeguards. This obviously contradicts [myongbaekhui mosundoenda] a position to continue talks. If the United States is truly willing to have a dialogue, it must prove this by action and it must, first of all, stop the present pressure commotions against the Republic. Our position to resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue has not changed. If the United States really wants to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, it should no longer seek to isolate and crush [korip apsal] us with double-dealing tactics as now but clearly indicate its correct position toward the talks first of all. If the United States thinks it can get something by frightening us with strength, regarding pressure as an almighty solution, it is a mistake. The heavier the pressure on us, the firmer our determination. We will watch the future action of the United States with concern [kwansimul kajigo].
