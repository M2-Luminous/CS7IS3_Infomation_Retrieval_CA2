While a mere 1,000 characters long, it demonstrates the style of Wei Jingsheng of the Beijing Spring era, lucid and lively, bursting with a sense of righteousness. His message to the people of Hong Kong: Learn from the lessons written in blood on the mainland and spare yourselves a good deal of pain. Has a verdict been returned on Mao Zedong as a historical figure? No. Because he is still playing a role in real life. To put it bluntly, there are still some people who seek to hatch all sorts of plots and conspiracies in his name. What kind of person really was Mao Zedong? Most people answered that question a long time ago. He dragged practically the entire China onto the road of brutality, treachery, and poverty, indirectly causing a hundred million people to starve to death and forcing another hundred million to leave home and wander about as beggars. Because of Mao Zedong, as many as a hundred million people were persecuted politically and tortured physically and mentally for years on end. Mao Zedong's crimes were too numerous to mention. He outdid the worst despots in the world, Chinese and foreign. In this sense, he was indeed a "giant," "the first since time immemorial," "unique." To be fair, though, while Mao Zedong must be held primarily responsible for the profound suffering inflicted upon the Chinese people for over 40 years and for China's poverty and backwardness, he was not the only culprit. There were other accomplices who followed him and helped him concoct all manner of schemes and plots, bringing calamity to the country and the people. They too should be held accountable in a big way. Then there were the masses who tolerated their crimes, who revered them as gods and encouraged them to commit all kinds of outrages. Can they absolve themselves of their culpability? In my youth, I was myself an admirer of Mao Zedong. After I woke up from my dream, I was filled with remorse and self-blame. Then I realized that remorse and self-blame would not do any good. Instead we must see Mao Zedong and the bunch of hooligans under him in their true colors and stand up to them. That was the only way to save ourselves and countless other fellow victims. We could not look to the Savior or some upright magistrate to save us. Nor can we depend entirely on friends. Only when we exert ourselves to save ourselves would others be willing or able to help us. Nobody wants to or is able to help weaklings who self-destruct or abandon themselves to vice. We Chinese must keep this lesson, so personal and so profound, close to our hearts. Otherwise, people who are adept at using violence and ready to do so would inevitably ride roughshod over us. Like Mao Zedong, they would torment us practically to death, while still demanding that we revere them as gods. In a certain sense, it is the people's timidity and bullyability that brings out the brutality in a ruler. When people have the courage to stand up for their rights, it is impossible for the ruler not to back down. This lesson, written in blood, the Chinese people will never ever forget. I hope the people of Hong Kong learn from it and spare themselves a good deal of pain. 3 November 1993
