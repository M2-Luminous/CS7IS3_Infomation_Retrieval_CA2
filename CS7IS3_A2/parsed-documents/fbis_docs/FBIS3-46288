The source, who asked to remain anonymous, said "It is inevitable that Paraguay will establish trade links with the mainland under pressure from its business sector." The South American country, however, will definitely not sever its official ties with Taiwan. Paraguay Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner Tuesday made clear his government's stand to a visiting Beijing trade mission, the source said. Minister Ramirez last month also explained his government's China policy to a parliamentary mission which is scheduled to visit Beijing next month. While briefing a group of ranking Paraguay military officials on his country's foreign policy last week, Ramirez reaffirmed Paraguay's diplomatic relations with Taiwan and expressed the hope that Taiwan would increase investments in Paraguay. Beijing has recently launched a series of diplomatic offensives towards Paraguay, starting with visits to Asuncion by a National People's Congress delegation last October and then by a trade mission, which is currently in town, in addition to inviting the Paraguay mission to visit the mainland. The head of the Beijing trade mission in a closed-door meeting with Ramirez said, according to a source present at the meeting, that Beijing would increase its purchase of cotton from Paraguay and diplomatic ties should eventually be established between Beijing and Asuncion. Minister Ramirez told local journalists after the meeting that "It is impossible for Paraguay to simultaneously recognize two Chinas and it should study how to make a choice in the future".
