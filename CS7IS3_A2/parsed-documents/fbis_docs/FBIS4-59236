The sources told AL-HAYAH that the U.S. decision, which opens the door to Jordan's resumption of negotiations with Israel, came in a message sent by Secretary of State Warren Christopher the evening of the day before yesterday. [passage omitted] Official sources have said that the U.S. decision to end sea inspection operations by U.S. ships in the Strait of Tiran "removes a major obstacle to an effective Jordanian role in reactivating the peace process in the future." King Husayn had made it conditional that the blockade be lifted before his country can resume peace negotiations with Israel. [passage omitted]
