The trend is towards universally applicable neurocomputers made of special hard and software. Siemens researchers have developed such a high-power computer. The modern broker no longer depends only on his nose. Nor must he rely on the supernatural. The computer forecasts stock trends for him with greater probability. Conventionally structured computers must suffice for such tasks. Complex interrelations of this sort cannot be completely described mathematically. The usual devices with von Neumann architecture can only process given algorithms sequentially, and then only if the input information is complete. It is precisely this handicap which is overcome by specific software which imitates the functions of the human brain, the neural network. The brain, working together with nerve fibers and sensory organs, can comprehend and classify things, even if the input information is incomplete. The information is stored associatively, i.e. in specific interrelations. This makes the brain capable of learning. Since it builds up its connecting structures itself in accordance with actual conditions, it is also self-organizing. Millions of neurons work as active processors, linked by nerve fibers (axons) terminating in contact points which are connected in parallel to each other. In the brain of an adult human, there are approximately 10[.sup]13[/] such synapses. A neural network imitates brain function in a greatly simplified fashion using mathematical algorithms. Like its human counterpart, it is capable of learning and can thus be trained to recognize specific patterns. Numerous models were developed for this, from the simple algorithm with hardwired neurons to models in which the connections are formed by self-organization. First generation applications like the stock market forecaster mentioned in the introduction run on powerful workstations or other conventional computers. However, real time processing of language, processing of moving images and complex controls can no longer be carried out in this way. Therefore the trend in hardware is towards special components and chips (ASICS), which are significantly faster. Heretofore, solutions have been tailor-made for special uses and have not been universally applicable. Therefore, at the Central Research Department of Siemens AG in Munich they have gone one step further with a two-year project on the SYNAPSE-1 neurocomputer. "Our goal," says the director of the development team, Dr. Ulrich Ramacher, "was to build a neural special computer on which the simulation of any desired neural networks and learning algorithms is possible." The Munich researchers have used a new system architecture for the neurocomputer, developed the MA-16 signal processor, and created their own software. Prior to this, various network models were analyzed. Dr. Ramacher: "The analysis showed that there are 25 different compute-bound basic operations for which it is worth developing a special chip. That is what we have done." The result is the largest pure logic chip developed at Siemens. It has 610,000 transistors on an area two centimeters square. Its more than 200 connections and clock frequency of 50 MHz allow an input-output rate of 10.9 gigabits per second. At the same time, the architecture of SYNAPSE-1 was so designed from the beginning that processor performance and memory size can be adapted to specific applications. Dr. Ramacher is proud that SYNAPSE-1 is at least 8,000 times faster than conventional solutions. One hour of computing time on the neurocomputer corresponds to 8,000 hours on the latest SUN-Workstation. At this year's CeBIT in Hannover, Siemens researchers showed a sample application in which eight incomplete images were reconstructed in 62 milliseconds. For one such image, a workstation would have taken longer than two minutes.
