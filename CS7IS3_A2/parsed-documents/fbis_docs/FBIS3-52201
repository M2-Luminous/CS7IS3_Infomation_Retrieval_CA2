The Israeli deputy foreign minister, Yosi Beilin, and his Vatican counterpart, Bishop Claudio Celli, signed this documents which has 15 articles. This said agreement will become official after its ratification by the parliament of the Zionist regime and pope, the leader of the world Catholics. The two sides will then exchange ambassadors. The signing of this agreement between Vatican and the Zionist regime is considered by political analysts as an important development in Vatican's policy toward Israel. Following the end of the war of oil in the Persian Gulf and the beginning of Middle East peace talks, Vatican started extensive efforts to have presence in these talks. However, the Zionist regime had set establishment of official relations as a condition for Vatican's presence in the talks. Nevertheless the establishment of the diplomatic relations between the two sides was an obstacle in view of Vatican's policy toward the Zionist regime. Vatican, too, considered the implementation of the 1947 UN resolution in which the international administration of Bayt al-Muqaddas [Jerusalem] had been envisaged as the prerequisite for establishing relations with Israel. However, international conditions over the past couple of years have been such that Vatican seems to have withdrawn from its position. In the document signed by Vatican and the Zionist regime, no reference has been made to Bayt al-Muqaddas, while Vatican has rejected the issue of Jesus Christ's betrayal by the Jews. In this relation the spokesman of Vatican, while referring to the unnecessary nature of the implementation of the UN resolution, stressed that the Catholic Church no longer supports UN resolutions on Bayt al-Muqaddas. In the meantime, in the document signed by Vatican and Israel, the question of freedom of religion in harmony with the laws of the Jewish state has been envisaged. Nevertheless this issue has not reduced worries that the Jewish state may treat Christian sects from a superior position. On this basis, recognition of Israel by Vatican has caused a negative reaction among Christian sects with the retreat of Vatican policy toward the issue. In the meantime, although the White House has welcomed Vatican's recognition of the Zionist regime, this issue has been condemned by the opposition Palestinian organizations and parties. The two Popular and Democratic Fronts for the Liberation of Palestine in a joint statement have announced that under the conditions that the suppression of the Palestinian nation still continues, this recognition will not help to end Palestinian and Arab territories' occupation by the Zionist regime. Political analysts believe that in the view of the nature of the Zionist regime and the Jewish state's performance since the occupation of Palestine, which are based on superiority of Jews, religious discrimination, and rejection of other religious minorities and faiths, recognition of Israel by Vatican is considered as a mere political move and one can not conceive any worthy role for Vatican in this connection.
