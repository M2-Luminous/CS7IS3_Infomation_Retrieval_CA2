Autonomous Okrug Intends To Secede from Arkhangelsk Oblast"] [Text] Arkhangelsk -- Nenets Autonomous Okrug has scheduled a referendum on secession from Arkhangelsk Oblast for 20 March. Okrug Governor Yuriy Komarovskiy has officially informed Oblast Administration Head Pavel Balakshin of this event. The Nenets Autonomous Okrug (capital -- the city of Naryan-mar on the Pechora River near its mouth at the Barents Sea) was formed 64 years ago. Today it has 55,000 inhabitants -- the overwhelming majority of the people are newcomers who came to open up the north. Arkhangelsk geologists discovered a major oil deposit on the territory of the okrug in the tundra, called Ardalinskoye, which is being developed jointly with the U.S. firm "Conoco." The Russian Constitution, adopted 12 December last year, equated Arkhangelsk Oblast with the Nenets Autonomous Okrug within it -- they are now equal components of the Federation. Proceeding from this legal base, the okrug leaders have prepared a draft edict of the Russian president "On Measures of State Support for the Socioeconomic Development of Nenets Autonomous Okrug." The key point in this document is the okrug's right to export 10 percent of all of the oil extracted on its territory. The draft edict, which has acquired the necessary agreement by ministries and departments, has already reached the president's reception room, but its subsequent progress has been stopped in connection with an appeal by Oblast Administration Head Pavel Balakshin. "We do not interfere in political, financial, social, or administrative decisions by the okrug's leaders," Pavel Balakshin said. "But even according to the new Constitution, Nenets Okrug is part of Arkhangelsk Oblast as a constituent of a single economic area. And our economic ties should not be broken if we are really thinking about the good of the people living on our territories." However, this dispute about petrodollars has pushed Neneth Okrug's leadership toward separatism. Initially, it was only elections to the okrug parliament that were scheduled for 20 March. But now the referendum on the secession of Nenets Okrug from Arkhangelsk Oblast has been urgently added.
