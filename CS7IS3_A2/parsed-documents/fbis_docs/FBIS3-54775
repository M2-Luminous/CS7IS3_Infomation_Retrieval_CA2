CIS Executive Secretary Ivan Korotchenya told INTERFAX Shushkevich had done so since, as he said in a note to Korotchenya, Belarus's previous form of joining the treaty had been given "ambiguous interpretations." Several months ago, Shushkevich sent out letters to the Commonwealth heads of state saying that the legislature had instructed him to sign the treaty. He told parliament he considered the letters to be a formalization of Belarus's membership in the CIS collective security system.
