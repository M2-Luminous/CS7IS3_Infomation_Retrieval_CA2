Shahin, JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] [Text] Amman--an Islamist/leftist coalition Monday [28 March] marked the one-month anniversary of the Hebron massacre by calling on Arab and Muslim governments to pull out of peace negotiations with Israel. "We, together with the Arab masses, must continue to exert pressure on the Arab regimes and the Palestine Liberation Organisation to give up the policy of surrender and stop their negotiations with the Zionist entity," read a joint statement issued by the two Jordanian political parties, the Islamic Action Front (IAF) and the National Action Front (NAF). "Our conflict with the Zionist enemy is the struggle over existence not over borders," said the statement. The coalition leaders, which include IAF Secretary General Ishaq al-Farhan and former leftist radicals Muhammad al-Zu'bi, Naji Allush and Breik Hadid, asked the "Arab nation to resist all attempts of normalisation with the Zionist enemy," during a joint press conference." "We warn the Arab regimes and the Arab League of the dangers inherent in lifting the boycott of the Zionist entity," read their joint statement. To lift the boycott, said the group, would constitute the imposition of further "Zionist domination and occupation." The coalition, also known as the United Front, said it held the media partially responsibly for supporting the peace process. "We call on the free and honest press to shoulder its responsibilities in highlighting the plight of Palestine and to actively counter normalisation policies in all their forms as well as to expose the cheap writers promoting normalisation with the Zionist enemy," said the statement. The IAF, recognised as Jordan's most powerful political party, and NAF a relatively new political party, announced that they were "coalition partners" in early March. Their declared aim is to "resist Zionist designs and new world order strategies to disrupt the Middle East region," according to IAF Secretary General Ishaq al-Farhan. The NAF, which only received official political party licence in January, is composed mostly of hardline pan-Arab nationalist parties and groups, many of whom were outlawed in Jordan before democratic reforms were introduced in 1989. The coalition between the two parties was formed after the February killing of worshippers at the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron and the subsequent attack on a Maronite church in Lebanon. The two parties declared that they had an "historic responsibility" to work together to actively oppose the normalisation of Arab countries with Israel.
