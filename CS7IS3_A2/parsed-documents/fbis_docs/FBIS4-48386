The announcement in a Government Gazette this week has nothing to do with the possible amnesty for political offenders mentioned by president Nelson Mandela in his inauguration speech on Tuesday last week. Exiles who committed politically-motivated crimes before October 8, 1990 were granted temporary indemnity from prosecution for a one-year period and this has been extended every year by a year at a time. The provision is understood to embrace cabinet ministers, among them Housing Minister Joe Slovo who is a former chief of staff of the African National Congress' armed Wing Umkhonto We Sizwe [Spear of the Nation], and Umkhonto commander and now Defence Minister Joe Modise. As the indemnity act of 1990 now stands, people who committed offences before October 8, 1990 may apply for indemnity from prosecution for politically-motivated offences. The constitution provides for this cut-off date to be extended until December 6, 1993. Mr Mandela has indicated that the cabinet will soon take a final decision on the matter.
