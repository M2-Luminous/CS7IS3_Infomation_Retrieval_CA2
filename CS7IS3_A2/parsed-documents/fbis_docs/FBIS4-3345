According to Vice-President Li Qin of the Beijing Legend Computer Group Corporation, the corporation sold a total of more than 27,000 microcomputers, or seven percent of the Chinese market, to rank top among the country's computer enterprises and companies. He said that his corporation will strive to raise its sales volume to 45,000 to 50,000 sets, or some ten percent of the domestic market. Almost all of the world's well-known computer manufacturers and companies are betting on the Chinese market, the potentially largest single market of the world. They have virtually ignited a battle for a share of the China market, Li said. He added that many Chinese computer undertakings have been forced out of business as their foreign counterparts keep encroaching. His Legend group has to outpace or at least follow closely the development tempo of the home market, if it is to survive the ever tougher market competition, the vice-president stressed. Official statistics show that the sales volume of computers in China last year was up 80 percent over 1992, but the market share for Chinese-made computers declined, standing at 37.8 percent of the total. Li disclosed that his corporation will undertake drastic changes this year, as it has laid down a package of bold reform measures designed to help institute an operating set-up that will reflect market fluctuations. The corporation will, to the fullest extent, bank on high-tech advantages to renew its product models as fast as the world market alters. Meanwhile, it will tap both the visible and invisible resources brought in by its brand-name products and the credible image that the company enjoys, according to Li. To respond to the market more promptly, the corporation will this year improve its purchasing and selling channels as well as the form of credits and loans. It will also cut down the delivery time from more than three months to less than a month. The vice-president said that his company expects to bring 10 percent off the cost of computers by speeding up working capital turnover and reducing expenditure, so as to make Legend brands more competitive in terms of pricing. To cater to the diversifying needs of the domestic market, the Legend group has been engaged in developing high-quality and inexpensive new models while promoting its already first-class brand names. Li said that his company will spare no efforts to improve the current agency system. At least some 200 agents will be added this year to help form a national distributing and marketing network characterized by branch companies, occupational agents and regionally-stationed agents. Meanwhile, the legend group will spend five million yuan to raise the number of maintenance centers from 31 to 70, scattered across the country. The guarantee period will also be extended from one year to three years so as to provide better after-sale service for all customers. The vice-president said that the corporation will earmark a further 10 million yuan for publicity to make both the company and its brands better known. According to him, the corporation has reformed its management regime and re-organized its leadership, giving all departments autonomy in personnel matters, budgeting and policy-making. He said that nine out of ten general managers of the corporation's 43 branches are in their thirties. According to Yang Yuanqing, a branch manager, Legend brand computers have outplayed their national cousins in sales volume for two years running. The corporation now produces one tenth of the world's total output of major computer components. The assets of the Legend group has grown from a mere 200,000 yuan in 1984, when it was established, to more than 400 million yuan, and it has set up -- at home and abroad -- 20 branch companies, two research and development centers, one experimental factory, two production bases and one training center, Yang said. A poll last year showed that the Legend group was among the five microcomputer manufacturers best received by Chinese customers, the only one from China. Vice-President Li Qin said that the Legend group, joined by the country's other big computer businesses, has vowed to develop a series of "Chinese" computers in an attempt to vitalize China's fledgling computer industry. "The banner of China's computer industry shall after all be held up high by the Chinese, and the development track of China's computer industry will eventually be opened up by the Chinese too," Li noted.
