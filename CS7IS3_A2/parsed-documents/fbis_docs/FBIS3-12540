Rabin explained to Kucan that Israel will continue to abide by the international arms embargo on the former Yugoslav republics and will not sell weapons to Slovenia at this stage. The Slovenian president told Rabin his country is experiencing great difficulties due to the war in neighboring Bosnia, as well as the sanctions and the embargo on the region, and asked him to enhance security relations between Slovenia and Israel. The prime minister told Kucan that Israel understands and supports the desire of small nations to conduct an independent life. Israel will be prepared to hold contacts on security-related issues and examine various proposals for cooperation with Slovenia, but will under no circumstances whatsoever violate the sanctions and the embargo, Rabin said. "Once the embargo and the sanctions are lifted, we can definitely discuss the strengthening of security relations," the prime minister promised the visitor. I hope our two countries will strengthen their relations and will soon be able to sign cooperation agreements on economic issues, investment protection, and tourism. Slovenia has over the last few months been in contact with Israeli elements to buy antiaircraft systems. [passage omitted]
