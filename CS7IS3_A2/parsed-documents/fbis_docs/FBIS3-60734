This is a huge stake because Exocet, produced by Aerospatiale from 1972, has reached sales of 3,000 missiles, and more than 2,500 exported to 32 countries, bringing in orders worth 40 billion francs [Fr]. There is no question of the public authorities not taking advantage of this legacy with a new missile. But nor is there any question of reviving the ANS, the supersonic antiship missile--a product which emerged from cooperation between Aerospatiale and the German DASA (Deutsche Aerospace). This missile, which was to replace the Exocet, was halted in 1992 by the public authorities, which had funded part of its development, for budgetary reasons and because of a production price which was deemed to be too high. The official departments then asked the industrialists to resubmit proposals between now and spring 1994. Three options have emerged. First, it is possible to continue to optimize the Exocet. The sea-to-sea [MM] 38 type missile of the seventies was thus followed by the MM-40 around 1980 and then the MM-40 ``bloc 2'' for the nineties which, faced with the American Harpoon (McDonnell Douglas), won the last six export competitions, notably in Malaysia, Oman, the Philippines, and Qatar. But a mere modernization of the Exocet would not prevent this subsonic missile--it attacks at Mach 0.89, in other words at around 980 km per hour--from being outclassed in the year 2000 by naval defenses. Hence the idea of enabling the Exocet to take a technological leap forward, for instance by equipping it with a new radar. Dassault Electronique could then offer the automatic guidance system of the ANS missile which is ready now. But this would not make the Exocet either more rapid or more agile. Aerospatiale is therefore to suggest building a new missile but with very much reduced costs and timetable. A new missile usually takes 10 to 12 years to develop at a cost of Fr10 billion. The company could put forward a tender for less than Fr2 billion and the product could be ready by the year 2000. It would be a supersonic missile--``absolutely vital'' according to Louis Gallois, Aerospatiale's chairman and chief executive--with a speed of around 2,500 km per hour, equipped with the ramjet of the medium-range air-to-surface missile--a technology which the French alone have mastered in the West. The automatic guidance, the military payload (the explosive), and the computer would also be readily available. This combination of a naval medium-range air-to-surface missile with an ANS--achieved by off-the-shelf purchases--would be carried out by Aerospatiale and its ally DASA which are planning the rapprochement of their tactical missile activities for 1994. The 12 frigates planned by France, Britain, and Italy in 2002, those planned by Germany with the Netherlands and perhaps Spain by around 2007, and then the modernization--halfway through their life--of existing European naval armaments already represents a potential market of around 1,000 missiles.
