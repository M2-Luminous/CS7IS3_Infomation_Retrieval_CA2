A decision to this effect has been made by the Central Council of the sectoral trade union in support of the initiative of "defense workers" of Novosibirsk, Vladimir, Kirov, Moscow, and a number of other oblasts. "We hope to impress the government, which continues to ignore the needs of the sector's working people," said the union leader Sergey Shuklin. Simultaneously, he intimated, it was suggested that work collectives discuss at the rallies, meetings, and conferences whether it is wise to go over to the extreme form of protest -- a strike. In Shuklin's words, military-industrial complex working people "do not demand any subsidies or privileges, and only insist on the most essential thing -- to be paid on time and to keep their jobs."
