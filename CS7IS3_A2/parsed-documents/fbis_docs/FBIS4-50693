The notice stressed that with immediate effect, no localities and departments have the authority to draft preferential enterprise tax policies. Those preferential policies which remain in force and have been newly defined mainly benefit: -- Enterprises based in State Council-approved high and new technological development and production zones and recognized by the concerned departments as being involved in high and new technology. These enterprises may enjoy a 15 percent reduction in tax. High and new technology enterprises located in State Council-approved high and new technology development and production zones may enjoy a two-year tax moratorium beginning with the year the enterprise starts production. -- Scientific research units and colleges, which may be provisionally exempted from tax on income earned from technological transfers, technical training programs, technical consultation and services, and contracted technical services commissioned by or provided to industries. -- Newly founded, independently audited firms or units involved in consultancy (including consultancy on science and technology, law, accounting, auditing, taxation), information industry, and technical services. These firms and units may be exempted from tax for two years, beginning with the first day they open for business. Newly founded and independently audited firms or units involved in transport and post and telecommunications industries may be exempted from tax in the first year, beginning with the first day they open for business, and may enjoy a 50 percent tax reduction in the second year. Newly founded and independently audited firms or units involved in public utilities, commerce, material supply, foreign trade, tourism, warehousing, residents' services, catering services, and educational, cultural, and public health services may, subject to approval by the responsible tax authorities, be exempted from tax in their first year, beginning on the first day of business. Tax reduction calculations for newly founded tertiary-production enterprises with diversified trading are based on their main line of business. -- Enterprises and non-profitmaking institutions. Income earned from technological transfers and technical consultancy, services, and training arising in the course of technological transfers by these bodies is provisionally exempt from tax if the net annual amount is less than 300,000 yuan. Any portion above the 300,000-yuan limit is taxed according to relevant laws. -- Enterprises hit by typhoons, fires, floods, earthquakes, and other natural disasters. With approval from the responsible tax authorities, these enterprises may have their taxes reduced or waived for one year. Township and town enterprises thus afflicted may get a 10 percent reduction in taxable income, and the money thus saved can then be spent on social relief; in this case, the method of levying 10 percent of taxable income in advance will be suspended. The policy of waiving tax on income earned from outside the borders by newly founded companies working on overseas contracts will continue to be in force until the end of 1995. The above preferential policies came into effect on 1 April 1994. Enterprises may continue to enjoy tax reductions previously granted by the now revoked preferential policies until the end of their terms.
