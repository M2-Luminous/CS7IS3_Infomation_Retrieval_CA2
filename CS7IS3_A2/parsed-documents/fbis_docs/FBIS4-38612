Experience shows that diverse problems may occur in the absence of the country's leader. That is why a state of heightened combat readiness is introduced in South Korea when the head of state goes abroad. This is particularly understandable now, when there are no signs of any easing of tension in the situation on the Korean Peninsula. And I think that this fact cannot but affect Kim Yong-sam's upcoming talks with Boris Yeltsin. Needless to say, our bilateral relations do not revolve around problems of security. However, one is bound to see that the problems of trade links and economic cooperation are in principle no different from those that Russia has with other developed states. There is also the question of Russia's debt to South Korea and the difficulties standing in the way of South Korean investors owing to our imperfect Russian legislation and Western businessmen's fears due to the vagueness of our reforms. There is no doubt that attention will be paid to all this during the talks. However, the special feature of these summit-level contacts between Moscow and Seoul is that South Korea now seems extremely interested in cooperating with Russia on the problem of nuclear security on the peninsula. Kim Yong-sam's visit is taking place at a time when relations between the DPRK and the world community have deteriorated again owing to suspicions regarding Pyongyang's nuclear program. North Korea's leaders have once again upped the stakes in their game of nuclear poker. Judging by statements by representatives of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], the DPRK is replacing the fuel rods at the Yongbyon nuclear reactor without allowing this international organization's inspectors to monitor this operation as they would like. It is a question of an opportunity to find out what plutonium stocks the DPRK has and consequently to determine whether or not it has the capability of manufacturing nuclear munitions. The UN Security Council urged the DPRK in a special statement to meet the IAEA's demands. This elicited an abrupt reproof from Pyongyang. In this situation the wave of hypotheses regarding possible tough measures against the DPRK is growing. In particular, people are saying that the question of these measures will be one of the main ones to be discussed at the coming G-7 meeting in Naples (the Russian president will also take part in it). At the same time military measures are also being rehearsed. Thus, during the Rimpac-94 maneuvers a joint grouping of U.S., Japanese, and South Korean ships will be formed for the first time. Some experts regard this as a rehearsal for joint actions in the event of the situation on the Korean Peninsula worsening. I will not venture to judge whether this pressure will have any effect on the DPRK. But South Korea seems to be afraid of further fueling tension. In particular, President Kim Yong-sam stressed in an interview with NEWSWEEK that he considers the reports exaggerated. Thus Moscow's and Seoul's positions may be close in a desire to find real solutions to the situation and give the DPRK a chance to meet the IAEA's demands and "save face." That is precisely the purpose of the Russian proposal to hold an international conference on the problems of nuclear security on the Korean Peninsula. Seoul is also worried about the way Moscow interprets the treaty concluded between the USSR and the DPRK in 1961. In one way or another life itself is pointing to Russia as an extremely important player in resolving both the peninsula's nuclear problem and other problems of Asian security.
