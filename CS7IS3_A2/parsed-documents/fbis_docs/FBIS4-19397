FBIS4-19397 "drweu074_o_94001" FBIS-WEU-94-074 Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 CYPRUS Ulucevik Outlines Turkey's `Intensive' Efforts Ulucevik Outlines Turkey's `Intensive' Efforts TA1504162894 Nicosia Bayrak Radio in Turkish 1530 GMT 15 Apr 94 TA1504162894 Nicosia Bayrak Radio Turkish BFN [Text] Tugay Ulucevik, Turkish Foreign Ministry deputy under secretary, has said that if the confidence-building measures [CBM's] package is restored to its initial content and if a balanced agreement is reached, this will grant benefits to the Turkish Cypriot people -- benefits they do not have at the moment. Ulucevik stressed that everything should not be assessed from the economic angle and that the Cyprus problem should not be seen as an economic problem only. He added that if the holes in the package are mended, the Turkish Cypriots will gain political benefits that are not easily discernible and that cannot be felt immediately. Ulucevik met with Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's deputy special envoy in Cyprus, at the Turkish Embassy in Lefkosa [Nicosia] for three hours today. Turkish Ambassador Cahit Bayar was also present at the meeting. In a long statement to the press after the meeting, Ulucevik said that there is nothing to fear or panic about and that the Turkish Cypriots have a strong position in the negotiation process -- a position they did not have for years. Be aware of this, he said, and rest assured; do not panic. Ulucevik stressed that nobody can force the Turkish Cypriot people or Turkey to accept a solution, be it in the form of the CBM's or in the form of a comprehensive solution. He pointed out that in diplomacy, as in everyday life, no one can force someone else to accept something. A package or solution not accepted by the two sides will not be implemented, he said, adding that pressure will lead nowhere. Ulucevik said: If the Turkish Cypriot people continue to defend their just cause at the negotiating table with wisdom, faith, and patience as they do now, there is nothing for them to worry about. Ulucevik pointed out that government officials are working uninterruptedly in Ankara in connection with this issue. He said: Our aim is to help you and to reach the diplomatic circles you cannot reach. Ulucevik stated that the Turkish Foreign Ministry was one of the first to point out that the present form of the CBM's is not the same as the initial package the UN secretary general asked the two sides to accept. With our intensive diplomatic efforts, he said, we want the just position of the Turkish Cypriots to be understood and not to force the Turkish Cypriots to compromise. The Turkish Foreign Ministry official said that he discussed the CBM's in detail with Feissel for three hours. He went on to say that he told Feissel what the holes in the package were one by one and that he pointed out the differences between what is being said now and what was said before. Ulucevik said that if an agreement is not reached by the end of April, that will not be the end of everything. In the course of the diplomacy, he said, an expectation was expressed in terms of a date, but that does not mean that the package will be forcibly imposed and implemented on that day. He said: You say it here; we say it in Ankara. If the holes in the package are mended, an agreement can be reached. If they are not mended, then everyone must stop and think. Those who made the holes in the package will have to be held responsible at that time. Ulucevik said that there is nothing to panic about and that diplomacy is following its normal course. Nobody can force either the Turkish Cypriots or Turkey, he said, adding: Turkey in particular will not allow anyone to pressure you. Replying to a question, Feissel said that he held a beneficial meeting with Ulucevik on the details of the CBM's. He said that it is possible that an agreement can be reached by the end of April but that he does not know if that will be the case. Asked if the long meeting with Ulucevik on the details of the package means Denktas has been sidelined, Feissel said that this is not the case and that he will continue to meet with Denktas as well.
