FBIS4-52416 "dreas090_c_94013" FBIS-EAS-94-090 Daily Report 7 May 1994 North Korea Daily Condemns Remarks by Japanese Minister Daily Condemns Remarks by Japanese Minister SK0705104194 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1028 GMT 7 May 94 SK0705104194 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Anachronistic Jargon"--KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 7 (KCNA) -- The new justice minister of the Japanese Government, Shigeto Nagano, contended that "it is wrong to say the Pacific War was a war of aggression" and the purpose of the war lay in "liberating colonies and establishing the greater East Asia coprosperity sphere." Commenting on his remarks, NODONG SINMUN today brands this as a crude distortion of history and an intolerable insult to the Asian peoples who underwent terrible misfortunes and sufferings due to the aggression by the Japanese imperialists. The analyst says: Nagano's remarks represent the view of the Hata cabinet on the war of aggression in the past and reveal the reactionary and aggressive nature of the Japanese Government. And this tells us that the Japanese Government has wholly taken over the mode of thinking of the predecessors who started the war of aggression in the past and it is standing on the extention line of the war cabinet of imperialism of the bygone days ideologically and mentally. Openly crying for the institution of "A Law on the Case of Emergency" almost everyday, the Hata cabinet is trying to easily mobilize manpower and material resources in a war of aggression by establishing "an emergency system" and a "wartime mobilisation system". By attempting to justify the past war of aggression as "a war of liberation" Nagano sought to establish an ideological and political logic favorable for the policy of the militarists staging a comeback to Asia. His description of the past war of aggression as "a war of justice" for "the greater East Asia coprosperity sphere" discloses the wild design of the militarist reactionaries to revive the old order of colonial domination in which Japan behaved like the master in Asia. It is a shame of the Japanese people that such a fellow as Nagano is holding an important post in the Japanese cabinet. If Japan again take the road of aggression and war, failing to draw a lesson from its defeat in the past, it will suffer a more miserable defeat.
