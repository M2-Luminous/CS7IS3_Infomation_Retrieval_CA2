The publication of these documents would not necessarily cast a good light on the president's moral qualities and his credibility," Peter Sokol, adviser to the SNS chairman, said at an SNS briefing in Bratislava yesterday. He added that, within the framework of his election campaign, one day before his election, Michal Kovac had signed certain agreements, in which he pledged to the SNS to execute the office of the president in a certain way if he gained its support. According to Peter Sokol, in recalling former Minister of Foreign Affairs Milan Knazko, the president acted completely at variance with this pledge. "I have the justified suspicion that Mr. Cernak's possession of these documents may have a certain influence on the president's conduct," Peter Sokol said.
