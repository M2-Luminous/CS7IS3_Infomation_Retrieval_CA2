Jakarta police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Latief Rabar said the students were freed late Tuesday after being questioned for several hours over their involvement in a rally in front of the Supreme Advisory Council (DPA) building earlier in the day. The students were among some 40 others involved in a rally against the banking scam, which allegedly involved collusion between high officials and businessmen. Rabar said police confiscated 43 posters the students used during the protest to back their calls for quick government handling of the "Bapindo" case, so called because the state-owned Bank Pembanungan Indonesia (Bapindo) provided what turned out to be bad loans totalling 430 million dollars to an ethnic Chinese businessman.
