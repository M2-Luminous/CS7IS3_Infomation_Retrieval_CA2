He will meet Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias at 1930 today. Nimetz said he is not bringing any specific new proposals on the issue of Skopje, but he appeared optimistic about the mediation to smooth Greek-Skopjean relations. He left open the possibility of meeting Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, adding that such a meeting would depend on his talks with the foreign minister this afternoon. In a major article yesterday, THE WASHINGTON POST predicted a Greek-Skopjean compromise, stressing that Skopje had wrongly exceeded beyond its authority in adopting historical and nationalistic symbols. The article says that with its relaxed diplomacy, the United States allowed the fire to spread, thus forcing Athens to harden its stance in the dispute with Skopje. According to the report, Washington's role is considered strained due to the stationing of 600 peacekeepers in Skopje, who could be the cause of confrontations throughout the Balkans.
