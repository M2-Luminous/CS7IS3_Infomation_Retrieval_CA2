FBIS4-66788 "jpnea027___94029" JPRS-NEA-94-027 JPRS Near East & South Asia 21 March 1994 SOUTH ASIA INDIA F-16s for Pakistan Threaten Security F-16s for Pakistan Threaten Security 94AS0268I Calcutta THE STATESMAN in English 21 Mar 94 p 11 94AS0268I Calcutta THE STATESMAN English CSO [Text] New Delhi, March 20--The imminent induction of 71 frontline and nuclear-capable F-16 fighters by Pakistan, loaded with a variety of electronic countermeasures, poses a threat to India's security and will tilt the air strike power in Islamabad's favour, defence analysts say, reports PTI. At a time when the Indian Air Force is facing a serious resource crunch with no major expansion plans in the offing, the induction of fighters of such magnitude by Pakistan, which has admitted that it had acquired a "certain capability" in the nuclear field, would force the Indian defence planners to re-think its defence policy, they said. Apart from the F-16 fighter, another threat to India may come in the form of at least three U.S.-made P3C Orion maritime surveillance aircraft which are capable of attacking India's maritime and sea coast assets. These aircraft, built and kept in hangars in the United States, could also be delivered to Pakistan using the same loophole in the Pressler Amendment, analysts say. Even though the IAF [Indian Air Force] can boast of being a top class Air Force in the world, with over 700 combat aircraft and a well-trained force, the fact remains that over 50 percent of its aircraft of Russian origin are in a "bad shape" and requires urgent overhauling upgradation and replacement, analysts at the IDSA [Institute of Defense Studies and Analysis] said. If the U.S. Government goes ahead with the deal, India has no other option but to go shopping for fighters to correct the "asymmetry," the analysts say. However, they said India had only limited options on this front. While the cost of frontliner fighters has shot up, the United States may put pressure on countries like Russia, France and the U.K. which are willing to sell fighters to India, they felt. Further, the disintegration of the Soviet Union has left India in deep trouble for the spares of the existing Soviet origin fighter plane. The analysts at the IDSA said the addition of 71 warplanes to Pakistan would mean that it would have 108 F-16A/B aircraft, with a range of nearly 1,400 km. This would tilt the balance in Pakistan's favour since India had only about 45 Mirage-2000 fighters, which can match the capability of the U.S. fighter. Another point to be noted here was the availability of AWACS [Airborne Warning and Control System], a force multiplier to Pakistan from Saudi Arabia, a close ally, in case of a conflict. The total effect of a combination of F-16s and AWACS would be "deadly," they said. However, the reported statement of the Prime Minister, who said that any U.S. attempt to modify the Pressler Amendment to renew aid to Pakistan would "force India to reassess its defence policy," was a welcome sign, they said.
