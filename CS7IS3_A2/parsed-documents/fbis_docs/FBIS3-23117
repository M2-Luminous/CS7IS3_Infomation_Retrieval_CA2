These are the conclusions of a preliminary investigation carried out by the police investigators. Our correspondent Aviv Bushinsky was informed by the Judaea District Police that Goldstein's skull was crushed by blows; there were no gunshots to his body. The Police therefore rule out the possibility that Goldstein was shot or that he committed suicide, and apparently there will be no need to carry out an autopsy.
