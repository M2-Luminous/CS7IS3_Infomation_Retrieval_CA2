Not that much money has so far been allocated to implementing it over the next two years -- 2.6 billion rubles. The program's scientific and technical council is headed by B. Nikolskiy, first deputy mayor of Moscow. The last time the piercing alarm sirens were sounded in Moscow was more than half a century ago, signaling enemy air raids. Today there are over 800 of these devices located throughout the city -- may fate spare every one of us from hearing that alarm. Leading scientists and practical experts headed by N. Makhutov, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, have spent more than six months substantiating possible actions in emergency situations: First, what to do when it has all happened and, second, what to do to prevent a tragedy. The program is of a scientific-organizational nature. Its purpose is to "reduce the risk of emergency situations, lessen their consequences, ensure efficient actions to eliminate them, and create conditions for accident-free work at industrial enterprises and municipal service installations." Given our talent for closing the stable door after the horse has bolted, this is a serious psychological step. Having cast off the decrepit clothes of the old principles of civil defense, society must work out and inwardly adopt the principles of mutual collective safety. Because not only malicious but also negligent actions by just one person can pose a threat to the lives of millions of people, and so man-made [tekhnogennyy] accidents come to the fore in terms of the gravity of their consequences. In Moscow today there are 66 dangerous installations, but do not think that the nine nuclear reactors head this list. Extremely toxic poisons (ETP's, as the professionals say) are concentrated at food enterprises, cold combines, and water-purification stations. The scientific and technical program provides for a search for new coolants and a strict regime for servicing those workplaces where it used to be hard to find a sober fitter. The government also expects from the specialists a substantiated list of particularly harmful production processes which it would be less painful to close down than to continue operating. One more important point. Dangerous freight frequently passes through Moscow. The program also provides for a system to license such transit. Epidemics, explosions, accidents, fires, and natural cataclysms, against which it is impossible to insure, demand efficient work by all the city's rescue services. A single control center will very soon be created for all of Moscow's emergency services. It is a pity that today it is still not possible to announce this telephone number. In March, in the article "Revolt in Moscow More Terrible Than Nuclear War," I wrote about the big city's most vulnerable spots. In particular, in the capital today there are more than 8,500 high-rise blocks, but the ladders the firemen have had at their disposal reached only to the 16th floor. If something were to happen higher up, hope would have to be placed in the Highest [as published]. Here is today's comforting news: Creation of a helicopter service in Moscow is vigorously under way, and in an emergency help will come literally from the sky. Also, three extra-length ladders which can reach the 22nd floor have been purchased abroad to fight fires in high-rise buildings. It would, of course, be better for those who live on the 23rd floor not to catch fire.... In 1995, for the first time in the city's history, an annual report "On the Safety of the Population" will be submitted to the Government of Moscow. The recently deceased writer Ales Adamovich liked to repeat: Only one person can save the world, and that person is you.
