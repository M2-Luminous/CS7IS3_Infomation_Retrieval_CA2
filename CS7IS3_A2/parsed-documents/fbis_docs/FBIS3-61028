[Viktorov] Nikolay Nikolayevich, if you do not mind, may we start our discussion by considering a real-life situation, one in which reader Nataliya Ivanovna Shustova finds herself. "A disease of the spinal cord has reduced me to group 2 disability," she writes. "It is difficult for me to move around. There even is no way for me to catch a breath of fresh air, since my apartment is located on the first floor, and, this being the case, there is no balcony. My husband, who is in military service, has submitted a request for exchanging our apartment for a similar one, but with a balcony. The housing commission turned down the request. I find it most unpleasant to face another winter of taking my walks at the window." What kind of advice to give our reader? Her situation is indeed unusual. [Filippenko] Following the letter of the law, based on what she writes, there are really no grounds for an exchange, since Nataliya Ivanovna's family is indeed provided with housing. However, in this case we do not wish to act like formalists. Therefore, in my view, the garrison's military authorities should start looking for some kind of other housing for the Shustovs. This is the humanitarian thing to do. [Viktorov] It is not my place to tell you that there is quite a number of situations similar to the one above throughout the Armed Forces. It may be a case of someone's being transferred to a new duty station, or a matter of a person's health not permitting him to reside in a particular area. And the number of housing exchange problems caused by withdrawal of our troops from neighboring countries! What do you think about the resulting situation? [Filippenko] The exchange situation is extremely difficult. The primary cause is that the Ministry of Defense lacks (and never did have) an agency charged with the mission of exchanging housing for servicemen. This holds true for the CIS, Russia, and even the capital garrison. As a rule, all servicemen effect an exchange independently, via local offices; in Moscow, for example, they turn to Moszhilservis. Nonetheless, reality steps into the picture to force involvement of GlavKEU, especially in the event there is a need for the Russian side to effect a resolution with a neighboring country in this kind of matter. In this case, we communicate our concurrence to the deputy commander or to the chief of the KEU [billeting and maintenance directorate] of the particular military district. Please do not consider this to be something ostentatious on our part; it is simply a case of people's interests transcending everything else. We try to do our part, regardless of how difficult a situation may be. [Viktorov] Nikolay Nikolayevich, is there a legal basis for exchanging servicemen's apartments within the framework of the former USSR? [Filippenko] Yes. In accordance with an agreement reached in February of last year in Minsk, exchange within the framework of the CIS is guided by the same rules in effect prior to the dissolution of the Union. [Viktorov] How does this pertain to persons who have remained in the Baltics? [Filippenko] A special provision covers that. In essence, the Baltics are to be considered distant countries, with whom housing exchange will be generally impossible after the interstate agreements are completed. There actually is no such exchange at present, even though many servicemen and pensioners wish to return to Russia. On the other hand, there are virtually no persons wishing to settle in the Baltic countries. Take the case of Latvia. Even persons of native birth arriving from Russia to take up residence there are not being granted citizenship. Who wants to be a second-class person? That is why no one is settling there. [Viktorov] If exchange of housing is impossible, could there be some other arrangement, such as selling? [Filippov] The last round of negotiations held with the Latvian side on 15-17 October produced a preliminary agreement whereby military pensioners would be granted the right to either sell their housing at auction or receive a guarantee of compensation for their housing. However, information I have in my possession indicates that, for some reason, doubt has been cast over this agreement. We will attempt to clear up this issue in negotiations. The situation is about the same in Estonia. Much simpler is the situation in Lithuania. There it is permitted to privatize housing, and many servicemen in units being withdrawn from the area have taken advantage of the opportunity by privatizing their apartments and then selling them. Some military retirees have acted in the same manner. [Viktorov] Nikolay Nikolayevich, what about the "hot spots"? [Filippov] Let us start with Tajikistan. In essence, we have the 201st Motorized Rifle Division left there. An order issued by the Ministry of Defense has rendered the division's officers and warrant officers eligible for housing in Russian cities. As far as members of the Group of Russian Forces in the Transcaucasus is concerned, construction and acquisition of housing for them and for members of the SKVO [North Caucasus Military District] and other areas of Russia has already been initiated. In 1992 and 1993, 976 apartments for the GRVZ [Group of Russian Forces in the Transcaucasus] were acquired on Russian soil. Plans call for acquiring 150 additional apartments by the end of this year. [Viktorov] That pertains to service personnel. There are quite a few Ministry of Defense retirees, former SA [Soviet Army] laborers and white collar personnel in those "hot spots." What about them? [Filippov] Believe me, we take the problems of that category of person to heart as well. It is difficult to expect a rapid solution to those problems, of course, due to the lean military budget. Nonetheless, we are not running away from a search for solutions to this most difficult situation. [Viktorov] Nikolay Nikolayevich, the mail received by the editors suggests another question we put to you -- that of the so-called closed military installations. What is to happen to those people who have completed their service and have lost contact with the Ministry of Defense but who would like to leave those bases? [Filippov] An order issued way back by the Union government called for their resettlement in housing to be made available by local organs of authority. The process is under way, after a fashion, at a pace that is extremely unsatisfactory. It is sufficient to say that with last year's requirement for 52,700 apartments, local soviets provided the Ministry of Defense with only 144. The figures for this year are, respectively, 59,057 and 332. There is a proposal for permitting exchange of this kind of housing. This is generally not a good solution, since who would wish to take the place vacated by a retiree in a closed military installation? It happens that additional "punishment" is heaped upon persons residing on the above installations, in that an installation is not really closed, but merely enjoying such status by declaration of the base's military authorities. This kind of act on the part of commanders may be easily explained: They fear that new persons will be sent in to occupy the vacated housing. Nonetheless, it should be understood that there is no excuse for violating the law, even though intentions may be good. We maintain a list of closed installations approved for the districts. In the event we receive a complaint regarding illegal acts on the part of officials, such as hindrance of apartment privatization, that is when we step in. Action can be taken at the local level by appealing to the district deputy commander for construction and troop billeting. In the event a serviceman is not satisfied, he can take the case to court. [Viktorov] Do you see a major solution? [Filippov] The problem of housing in closed military installations must be resolved in a fundamentally new manner. Being worked out presently is an in-service, the "regimental," approach. For example, assume that a unit's table of organization is such that 500 apartments are required. They are built, and they belong to the unit and to none other. Further assume that a man completes his active duty and is to depart. To go where? To his own apartment, one a lieutenant starts to build beginning with his first day of duty. To work toward this end, a certain amount of money is deducted from his pay during all the years of his active duty and placed into a bank account. The necessary amount of money is accumulated in 20 to 25 years, with bank interest added. Two or 3 years before leaving the service, the serviceman designates the city in which he wishes to settle. The bank transmits to that city the particular sum of money for application to the housing construction. The military quarters thus vacated now become available for a new person joining the unit. For this purpose, we wish to organize a special bank, with a military insurance company involved. The arrangement is being worked out with the apparatus of First Deputy Minister A. Kokoshin, the Combined Committee of Apartment-Seeking Servicemen of the Moscow Garrison, and the Military Insurance Company. It will require time, of course, to effect a fundamental change, to dispense forever with the housing distribution system; that is, to do the same as the rest of the civilized world. It should be understood that the plan can be possible only in the presence of economic and political stability in society.
