At a minimum, it will cost all French companies operating in black Africa 10 billion French francs [Fr]. These are the estimates Jean-Pierre Prouteau put forward in an interview with LE QUOTIDIEN. [Urbanowicz] Were you surprised by the devaluation of the CFA franc? Do you think it constitutes a turning point in French-African relations? [Prouteau] It is a turning point, because it puts an end to the dogma of fixed monetary parity with the CFA zone. We have to accept this, but we are not pleased with the way it was implemented as it was ordered by the IMF and the World Bank. The IMF director is not the governor of the 15 African heads of state. I would call him an "off-shore [preceding word in English] governor:" He gives orders that have financial implications, but does not assume any political responsibility. The role of the IMF and the World Bank cannot be assumed by anybody else, however, because there is nobody to do so and Europe is sleeping on both ears. The devaluation of the CFA franc is a bet on the future, and the CFA zone is being played heads or tails. Even with a 50-percent devaluation, can one be sure that inflation will not reach the same level within two years? The bet has not yet been won. [Urbanowicz] What problems will arise from the devaluation? [Prouteau] Let us begin with the positive effects: If the World Bank allocates $1 million to an African country today, this is the equivalent of CFA 580 million. Thus, the public accounts of these countries will be swamped. Second, exports will bring in more in terms of CFA francs. However, the devaluation will make imports 50 percent more expensive; it will increase inflation; and it will be a burden on debt servicing. But I do not think that the IMF will compensaye for the effects of this devaluation on debts. [Urbanowicz] What will be the financial consequences of the devaluation for French companies? How much will it cost French investors in Africa? [Prouteau] France accounts for 60 to 75 percent of foreign investments in the CFA zone, and 70 percent of transactions (declared, paying customs duties, and taxes). Some 1,200 French groups and subsidiaries and 1,000 small companies operate in this area, representing sales of Fr100 billion. According to our estimates, the devaluation will cost at least Fr10 billion to the companies of the Committee of French Investors in Black Africa (CIAN) alone, which for 70 years has been the employers' committee specializing in this area. The CIAN represents 80 groups and 1,200 subsidiaries. We have calculated that corporate assets depreciations will equal 50 percent of the abovementioned Fr10 billion. I have to remind you that their headquarters are located there. The second type of problem concerns linkage accounts [comptes de liaison] or current accounts, i.e., all outstanding orders abroad. For instance, if yesterday one of our [expatriate] companies placed an order worth Fr100 million, today it will have to pay double that amount [in CFA francs]. In addition, African states often are one or two months behind on current orders; thus, companies which ordered products in French francs abroad will lose 50 percent. According to our estimates, these losses will amount to Fr5 billion at least. Another problem concerns the 6,000 expatriates employed by CIAN companies. The French-franc value of their salaries will halve, which is quite serious considering that part of their salaries are spent in France, namely on house rents. French companies will have to make up for these wage losses. I want to point out that these estimates do not involve the oil sector, which is far more important and constitutes a special case. [Urbanowicz] What is your analysis with regard to the disinvestment process, primarily by French investors, which has been affecting the CFA zone for several years? [Prouteau] In 1985, large French groups had 1,500 subsidiaries in this area. Between 1985 and 1988, 15 percent, or 200 of these were closed. Since 1989, the wave of closures has stopped; 1,300 subsidiaries remain, including 1,200 in the CFA zone. At present, 65 percent of these make profits while 10 percent are in serious trouble. The devaluation of the CFA franc might lead to the closure of the latter 10 percent within one or two years. I want to insist, however, that there is no risk of all French interests deserting the area. We will have to digest this devaluation, which, in our opinion, is much too brutal.
