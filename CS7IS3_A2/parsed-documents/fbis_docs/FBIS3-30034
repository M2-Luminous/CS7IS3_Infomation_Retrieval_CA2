MITI plans to classify agreements into three categories, according to subject, such as those related to deregulation or improved transparency in procedures. It will then determine what specific action has been taken since the agreements became effective, using as evaluation criteria market share figures and the rate of growth of purchases. MITI wants to then explain the results of this evaluation to the Untied States, even though it is far from certain how much understanding the United States will show. The United States expressed doubt at the economic framework talks that any results have been achieved by the bilateral trade accords reached so far. U.S. President Bill Clinton said at a news conference held after the Japan-U.S. summit: "Over 30 agreements have been concluded with Japan since 1980. But its market is still more closed than that of any of the seven industrialized nations where imports are concerned." Given this situation, MITI has decided to reevaluate the achievements of accords concluded so far to create a favorable atmosphere for the reopening of talks. A senior MITI official explained: "The failure of the past accords is the basis for U.S. arguments on setting numerical targets in the future. All that means is that even if the framework talks resumed now, it would only lead to a repetition of the same kind of confrontation." Specifically, the evaluation will be carried out on 22 agreements between Japan and the United States, plus a further five concluded by NTT [Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation]. To decide how effective those accords have been, MITI will use quantitative results. For example, NTT's procurement of foreign products has increased by 46 percent since 1980; imports of beef almost doubled from 1988 to 1992; the number of foreign lawyers in Japan, which was only 31 in 1988, has increased to 81. The ministry wants to present these as a concrete basis for refuting U.S. claims. Even on the issue of cellular phones, over which the United States is now considering taking sanctions, MITI will ask for U.S. understanding by explaining that the number of the base stations for Motorola-type phones, which was zero when the cellular phone accord was concluded in 1989, will reach 189 by April this year. Some admit that, in terms of numbers, results are scarce for private sector accords, such as those on glass sheets and forest products. But MITI wants to seek U.S. understanding, saying: "Great results have been produced in areas like government procurement where the Japanese and U.S. Governments are involved."
