The conference was attended by representatives from 31 countries. We now provide you with a report on international assistance for Vietnamese repatriated as well our government's stance on this issue: About 55,000 Vietnamese people who illegally emigrated to other countries have in recent years been repatriated to this country -- Vietnam -- and have received assistance for reintegration. Programs funded by the European Community are the vivid example of the effective assistance in this field, which also come from many agencies and other countries. The European Community Integration Program or the Reintegration of Vietnamese Refugees or ECIP has been deployed in Vietnam on the basis of an agreement signed between the European Community and the Vietnamese government. This is the first program of cooperation between Vietnam and the European Community. It started in June 1992 and will last 30 months with the total estimated cost of $130 million. The purpose of the program is to provide jobs and vocational training as well as to create opportunities to find jobs for Vietnamese returnees, thus helping them quickly stabilize their lives and reintegrate into the community. It also aims to contributing to consolidating and improving the lives of other people in Vietnam, especially in those places where the repatriation program is under way. In the past phase, the ECIP's granted loans were $14 million and have been reimbursed $13.5 million. Programs have created 34,000 jobs, 16,000 of these jobs for returnees. About 72 vocational centers throughout the country have received financial assistance from the ECIP. At these centers, more than 50,000 people received training for 44 different jobs and skills. In addition, the ECIP funded 57 small-size projects with a total cost of $2.9 million in order to build and rehabilitate the infrastructure, thus contributing to socioeconomic development of Vietnamese people generally. A number of healthcare projects have been carried out in many provinces in the central and southern Vietnam. The progressive efficiency of the ECIP have meant the number of people who illegally fled Vietnam has been reduced. And the program has also encouraged Vietnamese refugees in Hong Kong and some Southeast Asian countries to return home. The Vietnamese Government is ready to negotiate bilaterally with countries concerned and to cooperate with the High Commissioner for Refugees. This will be done on the framework of the comprehensive program of action in order to receive those who cannot seek asylum in the third countries under the principle of respecting human dignity and insuring security, law, and order and the international financial assistance to help the returnees resettle in their homeland if necessary. Any repatriation of Vietnamese refugees that runs counter to these principles will not receive support from the world community nor from Vietnam.
