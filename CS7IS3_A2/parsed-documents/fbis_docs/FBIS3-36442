Addressing a meeting held in support of Serbia in Moscow on Saturday, Zhirinovskiy said that his party "may come to power for good in the current year". Held in Sokolnikiy, the meeting gathered about one thousand people. Zhirinovskiy accused the Kremlin and the government of conniving with the West which "is testing mechanisms for destroying Russia" in Serbia. According to him, "the third world war waged against the Slavs and the Orthodox Church by the USA, West Germany and the Vatican" is already in progress in Yugoslavia. The West, Zhirinovskiy said, wants to surround Russia with "a green Muslim corridor" by destroying the people of Serbia and populating their land with Muslims, and leave it only one direction for development -- "from Moscow to Vologda and Arkhangelsk". Zhirinovskiy demanded that the economic sanctions imposed by the U.N. against Serbia be lifted, and compared the French President, Francois Mitterrand, who, he said, called for bombing the positions of Bosnian Serbs, with Hitler. Zhirinovskiy condemned Russia's reorganized government for retaining Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, Deputy Premier Anatoliy Chubays and Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, and declared that they "betrayed not only the Russian people, but also all the Slavs". As for the resignation of Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov, the LDP leader qualified it as an action "designed to deceive the populace", and described the Russian Choice faction as "fallout". Had he been Russia's president, Zhirinovskiy said, he would not have signed a treaty on friendship, neighborliness and cooperation between Russia and Georgia, but suggested that Georgia should join Russia as one of its provinces, and cut all contacts with Tbilisi, if it refused. The meeting was addressed by a spokesman for Serbia, who urged the Russian people to save their brethren in Serbia along with the Orthodox Church.
