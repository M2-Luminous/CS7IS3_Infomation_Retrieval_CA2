In an interview with THE WASHINGTON TIMES, Kim, now visiting the United States, said that even if Pyongyang possessed "two or three atomic bombs," it would not be much of a problem compared with the 20,000 nuclear warheads that the U.S. has. Kim's remarks are in sharp contrast with the government's official policy, which was expounded by Deputy Premier-Unification Minister Yi Hong-ku at the Korean Newspapers Editors Association's breakfast meeting on March 12. Yi told the editors, "If North Korea develops even one half of a nuclear bomb, the declaration of a nuclear-free Korean peninsula will be scrapped." DLP officials said Kim's remarks sound like support for North Korea's possession of nuclear weapons, adding that they may jeopardize the ongoing international efforts to stop the dangerous nuclear game. Kim Tae-chung's Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation, meanwhile, argued that Kim's remarks were quoted out of context, saying that Kim made the remarks to stress the futility of North Korea's possession of a few nuclear weapons. In a meeting of DLP key post holders, senior party officials expressed grave worry that Kim's "irresponsible" remarks may embolden North Korea which undoubtedly has nuclear ambitions. DLP spokesman Pak Pom-chin said, "Kim's remarks will confuse the government's North Korean policy and create uneasiness among the people." Chief policymaker Yi Se-ki said that he can hardly understand why Kim made the "unthinkable" remarks at a time when the entire nation and international community are striving to stop the North Korean nuclear program. DLP leaders decided to request that the National Unification Board issue a statement clarifying the government's formal position in connection with Kim's controversial remarks. They also took issue with Kim's remarks at Washington's National Press Club advising U.S. President Bill Clinton to invite Kim Il- song to the United States and to send former president Jimmy Carter to Pyongyang as a special emissary. DLP officials accused Kim of engaging in political activity, reneging on his earlier statement that he had quit politics for good after his presidential election defeat. If he wants to re-enter politics, he should make a formal announcement, they argued. The opposition Democratic Party [DP] and Kim's Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation, meanwhile, tried to cool down the controversy, issuing statements saying that Kim's remarks had been misinterpreted. DP deputy spokesman Sol Hun said that Kim has insisted on North Korea's not having nuclear weapons under any circumstances. "With his latest comments, Kim only wanted to stress that it is foolish for Pyongyang to possess such weapons," he added.
