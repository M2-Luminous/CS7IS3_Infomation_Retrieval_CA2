Shim'on Peres has openly announced his conviction that these talks are useless. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Rabin has stressed the need to initiate collateral negotiations and to hold a referendum on the Golan. He has urged Syria to convince the Israelis of its desire for peace. An observer following Middle East events will find nothing surprising in Rabin's call. It is an Israeli habit to falsify facts and distort events. Anyone who listens to Rabin will come away with the impression that Syria is the aggressor and that Israel is a patient and peaceful lamb subject to repeated attack. Naturally, Rabin ignores the fact of Israel's attacks on Arab countries after 1948, and the fact that the Golan is Syrian territory occupied by Israel in 1967 after the UN Security Council's cease-fire resolution. Rabin ignores the woes, disasters, and catastrophes that befell the Palestinian people at the hands of Israeli forces and as a result of expansionist settlement schemes. Rabin ignores the incessant Israeli attacks on Lebanon. Everything has been distorted. The sinful executioner has been converted into a victim, while the victim is presented with demands to prove its peaceful intentions. Experience unquestionably demonstrates that secret negotiations are just an Israeli technique designed for blackmail. It has always been a futile policy. The Palestinian side, which held secret collateral negotiations with the Israelis in Oslo, has gathered only bitter fruit and disappointment. This side was dragged into positions that are outside international legitimacy and its resolutions; the outcome is an agreement that gives Israel a free hand in all basic Palestinian affairs, while it gives trifles to the the Palestinians. Despite lengthy and complex negotiations in several international capitals and cities in order to interpret this agreement, the results are even worse than many people expected. Israeli officials did not hide their satisfaction with the substantive concessions they have obtained from the Palestinians. Some Israeli officials even expressed sadness over the state of affairs on the Palestinian side. Naturally, this would not have happened if the Palestinian side was committed to the constants of the meetings held in Damascus, Beirut, and Amman, and if it had not stopped the coordination with the Arab brethren. Now that the Israeli rulers have gained a lot from the Palestinian side's violation of the Arab consensus, these rulers want to play the same game with other Arab parties. They are urging them to hold secret negotiations on the pretext that it will speed up the peace process. The Washington talks are the most appropriate framework for promoting the peace process -- if Israel really wants peace and looks forward to a just and comprehensive solution to the vehement conflict in the region. Israel, however, has no intention of withdrawing from occupied Arab territories or of ending the policy of continued settlement building. Israel has mired the Washington talks in futile arguments and problems, avoiding the substance of the peace process. In more than two years, no Arab side has received any answer to the question of whether or not Israel intends to implement Security Council resolutions and withdraw from occupied Arab territories. Instead of translating the land-for-peace principle into a tangible reality, Israel has raised dozens of security problems in order to conceal its expansionist ambitions. Today, Israel demands that the talks be shunted off their track and away from their framework, as it has done with the Palestinian side, and that secret negotiations be held at higher levels. This is intended to ignore the Security Council resolutions that structure the peace process, dragging the Arab sides into positions where they will lose the cover of international legitimacy. The following questions should be posed to the Israeli rulers: Why should secret talks bear fruit? Why can't the Washington talks reach a breakthrough, since we know these talks are held away from media clamor? Why does Israel refuse to announce at the Washington talks what it can announce in secret talks? Or, is it indeed a matter of fostering delusions among Arab parties --delusions which, in the secret talks, will turn into time bombs? Peace cannot be established in vestibules and cellars. It can only be established by serious and objective negotiations under the banner of international legitimacy. If Israel is really serious about achieving peace, the Washington talks are the most appropriate framework, especially because they are held under U.S. and Russian sponsorship, close to the United Nations. These talks will definitely bear fruit and achieve remarkable progress if Israel commits itself to withdrawal from the Golan and southern Lebanon. Instead of casting doubts and creating confusion, it would be better for the Israeli rulers to comply with the principles of the Madrid conference. By so doing, these rulers will see that peace is at hand.
