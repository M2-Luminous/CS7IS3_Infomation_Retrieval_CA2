FR940620-0-00003 FR940620-0-00001 Four written comments were received from field inspection personnel. Two of these comments noted the need to provide guidance on whether product shipped in a bulk bin is to be considered a single package when determining fees under ยง51.38. AMS will issue inspection instructions that state the net weight of product in bulk bins is to be divided by the net weight of the common package for that product to determine the number of packages represented by a bulk bin. The third comment noted that the charge for additional lots reported on an inspection certificate fails to recover the full cost of sampling product inspected in accordance with Florida citrus standards. Florida citrus standards specify a number of samples to be examined for each reported lot that is higher than the number of samples typically used for other standards. AMS believes that a separate charge for additional lots reported for products inspected in accordance with the Florida citrus standards would be confusing and should not be imposed. The fourth comment suggested eliminating the proposed $264 flat rate for inspections of 5 or more products unloaded from land or air transportation, and substituting carlot fees for the first four products, and a $37 fee for each additional product. This suggestion would increase fees for quality and condition inspections another $6 to $33 beyond the increase currently proposed. For this reason, AMS is not adopting this suggestion. The fourth comment also suggested the implementation of a charge for additional lots reported on an inspection certificate for product inspected at dock-side in place of the proposed fee increase in the dock-side package rates. The commenter noted that requests from applicants for dock-side inspections vary significantly not only in the number of packages but also in the number of lots to be separately sampled and reported on an inspection certificate. By implementing a charge for additional lots when performing dock-side inspections, as AMS currently does for inspections of product from land or air conveyances, the commenter believed that dock-side fees charged to each applicant would more accurately reflect AMS's cost of performing the requested inspection. The total revenue to be generated from charges for additional lots would be approximately equal to the total revenue that would have been generated from the proposed increase in package rates. Because this suggestion allows AMS fees at dock-side to more equitably reflect the cost of providing the requested service, and because the suggestion would not raise fees beyond the level initially proposed, this suggestion has been adopted in the final rule. Two written comments were received from the industry. Industry commenters, both wholesale fruit and vegetable receivers, opposed the fee increase as they believe the current fee levels should be sufficient to fund the service. However, AMS projects that, without a fee increase, the program will exhaust its unobligated balance and become insolvent early in Fiscal Year 1996. One commenter further believes that the lack of a competing inspection service may cause the program to operate inefficiently. While this inspection service is the only authorized inspection service under the AMA, nonetheless, the service is not relying solely on fee increases to defray rising costs. Currently, the program is phasing out a third of its permanent billing and collection staff and releasing office space in 11 cities to save an estimated $250,000 annually. Moreover, the service is planning to reorganize its management structure to eliminate one of three management layers to save users of destination market services over $100,000 annually. In light of the continuing need to maintain this AMS grading program on a financially sound basis, the Agency has decided to proceed with the fee increase as set forth in the proposal, with one modification regarding dock-side fees in accordance with a comment received. When product is inspected at dock-side, the number of different lots (i.e. varieties, sizes, brands) present in the product, along with the number of total packages, determines the time required to sample and report inspection results. Therefore, in lieu of increasing the package fees as had been proposed, AMS is implementing a $12 fee for each additional lot reported on an inspection certificate for product inspected at dock-side. This is the same fee that is currently charged for each additional lot reported on an inspection certificate for product unloaded from land or air transportation. Revenue from the additional lot fee is expected to be equivalent to that of the previously proposed package fee increase. By implementing the additional lot fee for dock-side inspections, charges for these inspections will more fairly reflect AMS's cost of providing the requested service, so that inspections of products with few varieties, sizes, or brands reported separately on the inspection certificate will be charged at a lower fee than inspections of products with the same total number of packages but with comparatively more varieties, sizes, or brands reported separately on the inspection certificate. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is found and determined that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register because the fiscal year 1994 reserve balance of the program's trust fund is projected to be less than one month's operating reserve which is well below the four-month level necessary to ensure the program's fiscal viability.
