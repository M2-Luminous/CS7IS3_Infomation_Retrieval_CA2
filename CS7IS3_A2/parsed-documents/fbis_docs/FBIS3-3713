At the crucial moment when tasks for reform, development, and maintaining stability are very heavy today, it is all the more necessary to pay great attention to doing a good job of doing propaganda and ideological work. Comrade Chen Bangzhu said the current provincial conference on propaganda and ideological work is a very important one that has a bearing on the overall situation. At the national work conference on propaganda and ideological work, Comrade Jiang Zemin made profound discussion on the importance of propaganda and ideological work. Comrade Wang Maolin made exhaustive explanations in his theme report delivered on 4 March. This being the case, under the new situation we must pay greater attention to propaganda and ideological work and cannot afford any neglect or carelessness. Work in this domain must be greatly strengthened, and not the least weakened; it must be improved, and not come to a standstill. Comrade Chen Bangzhu stressed that party committees, governments, and various departments at all levels should attach great importance to and support propaganda and ideological work. Primarily, it is imperative to implement the principle of doing two types of work simultaneously, attaching equal importance to both. Second, governments at all level should proceed to provide greater support and help for propaganda and ideological work in hardware and software. Hardware support means to ungrudgingly spending money to equip the propaganda and ideological front with necessary modern means step by step, to further improve conditions for developing propaganda and cultural undertakings, and resolve some practical difficulties of propaganda and ideological departments in a down-to-earth way. Software support means to constantly brief propaganda and ideological departments on the current situation and policies, and help them promptly see conditions and grasp the overall situation. At the same time, leadership at various levels should befriend more propaganda and ideological workers, constantly lend an ear to their opinions and suggestions, and learn to make use of this channel to improve their own work. The task is heavy and the road ahead is a long one for propaganda and ideological work. We believe that a brand new situation will surface in Hunan's propaganda and ideological work in the wake of the current conference, and will play a still greater role in socialist modernization and make still greater contributions. Wang Keying, provincial party committee standing committee member, concurrently governor in charge of routine affairs, presided over the conference yesterday. Attending the conference also were Wen Xuande and Liu Dingying.
