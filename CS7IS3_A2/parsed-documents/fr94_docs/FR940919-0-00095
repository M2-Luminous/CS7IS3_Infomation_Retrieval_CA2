FR940919-0-00095 FR940919-0-00016 Hazardous wastes used in a manner constituting disposal that do not satisfy these conditions are subject to all of the subtitle C standards. See ยง266.23(a). In promulgating this provision in 1985, however, the Agency neglected to mention the then newly-enacted land disposal restriction requirements as among the standards to which the wastes were subject. The Agency obviously was not intending to amend the statute, and cannot override an express statutory requirement by regulation. The Agency only recently noticed this omission, and is using this opportunity to correct the error. Consequently, the Part 268 requirements will be added to the list of requirements in ยง266.23(a) for those hazardous wastes not satisfying the conditions of ยง266.20(b). This amendment is effective 90 days after publication of today's rule. XIV. Capacity Determinations This section presents the data sources, methodology, and results of EPA's capacity analysis for today's rule. Section A summarizes the results of the capacity analysis for the wastes covered by this rule; Section B summarizes the analysis of available capacity; Section C summarizes the capacity analysis for those newly identified and listed wastes that are land disposed in units other than deep injection wells; Section D summarizes the capacity analysis for wastes mixed with radioactive contaminants; Section E summarizes the results of the capacity analysis for high TOC ignitable and TC pesticide wastes and newly listed and identified wastes injected into Class I deep wells; and Section F presents the results of the capacity analysis for hazardous soil and debris contaminated with the newly listed and identified wastes covered in this rule. In general, EPA's capacity analysis methodologies focus on the amount of waste currently land disposed that will require alternative commercial treatment as a result of the LDRs. Land-disposed wastes that do not require alternative commercial treatment (e.g., those that are currently treated using an appropriate treatment technology or that will be treated using an alternative on-site treatment system) are excluded from the quantity estimates. In addition, wastes managed in CWA, SDWA, CWA-equivalent systems are not included in this rule and will be addressed in an upcoming rulemaking. EPA's decisions on whether to grant a national capacity variance are based on the demand for commercial treatment or recovery technologies. Consequently, the methodology focuses on deriving estimates of the quantity of wastes that will require commercial treatment as a result of the LDRs; quantities of waste that will be treated on-site or by facilities owned by the same company as the generator are omitted from the required commercial capacity estimates. The major capacity information collection initiative for this rule was an EPA survey of all land disposal facilities that manage newly identified TC organic wastes (including TC-contaminated soil and debris) in land-based units (TC Survey). The survey, conducted in the spring of 1992, is a census of approximately 140 facilities. EPA identified the universe primarily based on those facilities that had submitted permit modifications or received interim status for managing these wastes. For each facility, EPA requested waste-stream specific data on newly identified TC organic wastes and information on on-site land disposal units and treatment and recovery systems. EPA developed a data set of the information on the TC Survey results. Specifically, the data set contains information on the quantities of newly-identified organic TC wastes that will require commercial treatment capacity as a result of the LDRs. The data collected and the survey used for the required capacity estimates are part of the docket for today's final rule. A. Capacity Analysis Results Summary For the organic TC wastes (D018&hyph;D043), EPA estimates that 220,000 tons of newly identified organic TC sludges and solids will require alternative commercial treatment as a result of today's final rule. EPA estimates that much smaller quantities of the other listed wastes included in today's rule will require alternative commercial treatment. Fewer than 100 tons of chlorinated toluene (K149&hyph;K151) nonwastewaters are currently being land disposed and will require alternative treatment due to the LDRs. Approximately 4,600 tons of coke by-product (K141&hyph;K145, K147 and K148) nonwastewaters are currently being land disposed. However, comments to EPA indicate that the majority of the nonwastewaters are recycled or used for energy recovery and, therefore, alternative treatment may not be required. No K141&hyph;K145, K147 and K148 wastewaters are currently being land disposed. No K149&hyph;K151 wastewaters are currently being land disposed. The quantities of radioactive wastes mixed with wastes included in today's final rule and currently being land disposed are generated primarily by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). EPA estimates that 1,300 m3 of high-level waste, 380 m3 of mixed transuranic waste, and 1,100 m3 of mixed low-level waste containing wastes covered in today's rule will be generated annually by DOE. These estimates exclude mixed wastes currently in storage, environmental restoration wastes, and soil and debris. DOE currently faces treatment capacity shortfalls for some high-level wastes and for all projected mixed transuranic waste generation. In addition, although the annual DOE treatment capacity for mixed low-level wastes exceeds the estimated annual generation, most of this capacity is limited to treatment of wastewaters with less than one percent total suspended solids, and is not readily adaptable for other waste forms. Consequently, DOE also faces a treatment capacity shortfall for mixed low-level nonwastewaters. Furthermore, DOE has indicated that it will generally give treatment priority to mixed wastes that are already restricted under previous LDR rules. With respect to certain wastes being injected into deep wells, EPA has very limited information that differentiates high TOC D001 ignitable wastes from low TOC D001 ignitable wastes, particularly with reference to the type of Class I injection well (i.e., nonhazardous versus hazardous) the wastes are ultimately disposed into. The information the Agency does have indicates that both D001 ignitable wastes and D012&hyph;D017 TC pesticide wastes are deep well injected into Class I hazardous wells with no-migration exemptions. However, several commenters to the proposed rule, and other industries with Class I injection wells, indicated that it would be extremely difficult to identify, segregate, treat, and/or arrange for disposal of these waste streams in a short time frame. Consequently, EPA is granting these wastes a one-year national capacity variance. The Agency also estimates that up to 120,000 tons of hazardous soil and 34,000 tons of hazardous debris contaminated with the newly identified organic TC wastes are expected to require alternative commercial treatment. Table 1 lists each waste code for which EPA is promulgating LDR standards today. For each code, this table indicates whether EPA is granting a national capacity variance for land-disposed wastes. As indicated, EPA is not granting a two-year national capacity variance for the newly identified organic TC wastes, including soil and debris, nor for the listed wastes covered under this rule. Rather, EPA is granting a three-month variance. (This extension does not apply to wastes with a specified longer national capacity variance.) EPA is delaying the effective date because the Agency realizes that even where data indicate that sufficient treatment capacity exists, such capacity may not be immediately available. Additional time may be required to determine what compliance entails, redesign tracking documents, possibly adjust facility operations, and possibly segregate waste streams. EPA believes these legitimate delays can be encompassed within a short-term capacity variance because the ability to get wastes to the treatment capacity in a lawful manner is an inherent part of assessing available capacity. However, the Agency is granting a two-year national capacity variance for mixed radioactive wastes (i.e., radioactive wastes mixed with newly identified TC organic constituents D018&hyph;D043), including soil and debris contaminated with mixed radioactive wastes. EPA also is granting a one-year national capacity variance to allow the Class I injection facilities an appropriate lead time to identify and then manage their high TOC D001 and D012&hyph;D017 waste streams by developing practical and sound treatment and/or disposal options and ultimately to come into compliance with today's rule.
