FR940414-2-00100 FR940414-2-00070 Issuer Delisting; Notice of Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Air Express International Corporation, Common Stock, $.01 Par Value) File No. 1&hyph;8306 April 8, 1994. Air Express International Corporation (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2&hyph;2(d) promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex''). The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following: According to the Company, its Board of Directors (the ``Board'') unanimously approved a resolution on September 10, 1993, to withdraw the Company's Common Stock from listing on the Amex and, instead, list such Common Stock on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations/National Market Systems (``NASDAQ/NMS''). According to the Company, the decision of the Board followed a lengthy study, and was based upon the belief that listing of the Common Stock on NASDAQ/NMS will be more beneficial to its stockholders than continuing the present listing on the Amex. Any interested person may, on or before April 29, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter. For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary.
