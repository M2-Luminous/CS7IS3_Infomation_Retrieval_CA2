"Considerable movement was made in narrowing differences in qualitative criteria," the U.S. side said in a statement. But both sides said they avoided discussing quantitative criteria, which earlier led to wrangling over "numerical targets" for market share in other sectors and scuttled bilateral trade "framework" talks in February. Negotiators also skirted the sticking point of whether Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) should be covered by the talks on government procurement of telecom and medical equipment, Japanese and U.S. officials said. Both sides agreed to continue working-level talks in midmonth, probably in Washington. "Things are moving, so that's good," a U.S. Official said. The Japanese side explained promises it made in a March market- opening package to make its procurement practices clearer and fairer. A Japanese Foreign Ministry official said the U.S. side seemed to "evaluate quite highly" the explanation, while the U.S. statement said the "plan addressed a number of key issues." "But we indicated some major areas where the plan fell short of eliminating our concerns," the U.S. said. The U.S. official said he could not comment further. The Japanese official described the talks as "forward-looking and constructive," giving the impression that "things are moving in a better direction." The U.S. said they were "cordial and conducted in a positive atmosphere." The talks will proceed, the Japanese official said, on the basis of Japan's market-opening package, which includes widening the scope of products subject to agreement, making specifications fairer and simpler, making information available on government tenders, improving the review of bidding complaints and instituting comprehensive bid evaluations. Washington vowed last month in an agreement restarting the talks that it is not seeking targets, and the U.S. made no proposals that contradicted that assurance in the Tokyo talks, the Japanese official said. On NTT, Tokyo insists the telecom giant is a private company that cannot be held to government procurement promises, while the U.S. says the Japanese Government's two-thirds ownership of publicly traded NTT makes it a government entity.
