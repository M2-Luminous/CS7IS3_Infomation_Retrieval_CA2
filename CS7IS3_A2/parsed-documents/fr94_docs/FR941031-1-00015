Subpart A_Related Services §618.8000 Definitions. For the purposes of this subpart, the following definitions shall apply: (a) Program means the method or procedures used to deliver a related service. This distinguishes the particulars of how a related service will be provided from the type of activity or concept. (b) Related service means any service or activity provided by a System bank or association that pertains to the recipient's on-farm, aquatic, or cooperative operations, including control of related financial matters. The term ``related service'' includes, but is not limited to, technical assistance, financial assistance, financially related services and insurance, but does not include lending or leasing activities. (c) System banks and associations means Farm Credit Banks, agricultural credit banks, banks for cooperatives, agricultural credit associations, production credit associations, Federal land bank associations and Federal land credit associations. §618.8005 Eligibility. (a) Farm Credit Banks and associations may offer related services to persons eligible to borrow as defined in §§613.3010, 613.3020(a)(1), (a)(2), (b), and 613.3045 of this chapter. (b) Banks for cooperatives may offer related services to entities eligible to borrow as defined in §§613.3110 and 613.3120 of this chapter. (c) Agricultural credit banks may offer related services appropriate to on-farm and aquatic operations to the persons eligible to borrow specified in paragraph (a) of this section and may offer related services appropriate to cooperative operations of entities eligible to borrow as specified in paragraph (b) of this section. (d) System banks and associations may provide related services to recipients that do not otherwise meet the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section in connection with loan applications, loan servicing, and other transactions between these recipients and persons eligible to borrow as defined in paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of this section, as long as the service provided is a part of or pertains to the transaction between the parties. Such services include, but are not limited to, fee appraisals of agricultural assets performed for the Farmers Home Administration, commercial banks and other lenders. §618.8010 Related services authorization process. (a) Authorities. (1) The Farm Credit Administration (FCA) shall authorize related services that meet the criteria specified in this regulation. System banks and associations may only offer related services that are authorized by the FCA. (b) New service proposals. (1) A System bank or association that wishes to offer a related service that the FCA has not previously authorized must submit to the FCA, in writing, a proposal that includes a description of the service, how it meets the regulatory definition of ``related services'' in §618.8000(b), and the risk analysis cited in §618.8020(b)(3). The FCA will evaluate the proposed service based on the information submitted, and may also consider whether there are extenuating circumstances or other compelling reasons that justify the proposed service or support a determination that the service is not authorized. This evaluation will focus primarily on Systemwide issues rather than on institution or program-specific factors. (2) When authorizing a proposed related service, at its discretion, the FCA may impose special conditions or limitations on any program to offer a related service. (3) At its discretion the FCA may, during its evaluation of a proposed related service, publish the proposed related service in the Federal Register for public comment. (4) Within 60 days of the FCA receiving a completed proposal, including any additional information the FCA may require, the FCA will act on the request. The FCA shall approve the request, deny the request, or notify the requesting institution that the service shall be published for public comment in the Federal Register . For good cause and prior to the expiration of the 60 days, the FCA may extend this period for an additional 60 days. (5) The FCA shall notify all System banks and associations by bookletter or other means each time it determines whether a proposed related service is or is not authorized. (c) Previously authorized services. (1) For related services that have been authorized by the FCA, any System bank or association may develop a program and subsequently offer the related service to eligible recipients, subject to any special conditions or institutional limits placed by the FCA. These programs will be subject to review and evaluation during the examination process. (2) The FCA shall make available to all Farm Credit institutions a list of such related services (``related services list'' or ``list'') and will update it in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section. The list will contain the following: (i) A description of each related service; (ii) Identification of any special conditions on how the related service may be offered; and (iii) The types of institutions authorized to offer each type of related service. (3) Within 30 days of implementing a related service program already on the list, the System bank or association must notify the FCA Office of Examination field office responsible for examining that institution.
