Today's demonstrations, staged by high school students, took place in the neighborhoods of Propatria, Caricuao, and Moran, in the southern and southeastern areas of Caracas. Meanwhile, other demonstrations were reported in the towns of Los Teques and Valles del Tuy, near the Venezuelan capital. According to Radio Rumbos, 15 demonstrators were arrested in Caracas and 50 in Valles del Tuy, where a soda truck was looted and burned. The protesters are demanding preferential student bus fares, which in practice means having to pay half of the regular public transportation fares. There were protests in Caracas yesterday, in which two policemen were injured by stones and bottles hurled by students. Today, in addition to policemen, members of the militarized National Guard intervened in an attempt to stop the demonstrations.
