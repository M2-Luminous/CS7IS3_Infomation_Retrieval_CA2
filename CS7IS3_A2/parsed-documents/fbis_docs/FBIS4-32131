At your last news conference on 29 March, you said that the main threat to national security is the situation of the economy. Would you be so kind as to elaborate on this statement? [Magureanu] I am not the best authorized person to give you an answer to that question and to corroborate the negative impact that the precarious state of the economy can have on our national security. It is more than obvious that there is no sphere of social life that is not affected by the state of the economy. First of all, the state of a country's economy is at the basis of social stability. In its turn, social stability is linked to the living standard, that is, to the well-being or poverty level of certain social strata, which can lead to discontent and tension. Some of these manifestations of discontent and tension can degenerate into extreme outbursts. I believe that you remember the regrettable phenomena in the life of our young democratic society, which were also caused by economic discontent. I would cite the last miners' incursion as an example of such a phenomenon. These are extreme situations. However, there are also other aspects, less visible at first glance, which are also correlated to the state of the economy. When the economy is in crisis, these aspects -- upon which our national security depends to a high degree -- cannot be satisfied, such as the national defense and the working out of a system whereby Romania can assert its interests, as a function of the geopolitical context in which we find ourselves. But then, regardless of what I said, the overall image of a regime is usually linked to the people's living standard, which cannot conceivably be ensured at a reasonable level without a dynamic economy boasting positive growth quotas. [Lucaciu] Within the framework of its obligations, the SRI puts together various assessments and information on certain states of affairs, which it then submits to the authorized bodies: the government, presidency, and the Parliament. Even you confirmed that you have produced such information during certain situations. What was the efficiency of these assessments, as reflected in the concrete actions taken by the respective bodies, which represent the power? [Magureanu] Indeed, we regularly brief the respective bodies, even on a daily basis. You ask me about the efficiency of this information? Well, it varies somewhat. Anyhow, the majority of our briefings have an impact at the executive level, where measures are taken to counter would-be negative phenomena. There are also moments when we make concrete proposals for various negative situations that arise, situations that require urgent measures to solve the problems. [Lucaciu] To give a concrete example, I would recall that you notified the relevant bodies in connection with the Petromin-Forum Maritime contract [irregular sale of Romanian vessels to Greek ship owners]. As a matter of fact, the press has published similar revelations, too. Nevertheless, the contract could only be stopped by the justice bodies. [Magureanu] Generally speaking, we are also concerned, like you are, with the negative situation of our fleet after 1990. We issued various warnings in this respect and, indeed, certain things were subsequently redressed. We cannot judge now whether adequate measures were rapidly taken at the time. However, I believe that our information has had an impact. But what is regrettable is the fact that all the people who could have played a positive role in solving these matters of utmost importance -- such as the aforementioned case -- have failed to act in a concerted manner. Their efforts were disparate at times. On other occasions, the problems were tackled from a partisan political angle. Several sequences of the Petromin-Forum Maritime affair were turned into political accusations against one another, which somewhat distorted the core of the matter. Thus, it became a political dispute, when it actually was a serious national matter, which should have been coherently tackled from the same position by all sides involved. [Lucaciu] In such a situation, one must show some understanding for political passions specific to this period and perhaps to the temperament of some people, even though they may harm the final goal. [Magureanu] In our society's evolution, it is somehow normal that the two of us, for instance, should be situated at different political positions. However, when strategic matters are at stake, which are most important for the national security -- the fleet is also such a matter, since it is directly or indirectly linked to our national security -- we should give up our partisan political attitudes. Political differences should only account for nuances, if they are properly conceived and brought up in the respective case. On the contrary, if the situation is seen from antagonistic positions by the sides involved -- for the sole reason that there are political differences between them -- then the solution to the problem will be further delayed. However, the dispute around the Petromin-Forum Maritime acquired an unprecedented virulence, hence the lower efficiency in solving the case due to the various partisan attitudes that have hampered the solving of a serious affair for our society. [Lucaciu] Partisan positions are currently manifest in the parliamentary commissions, which examine and then submit reports on various matters. As a rule, two reports are drawn up: one for those in power and the other for the opposition. This is now happening in the Anti-Corruption Commission, which cannot submit its report on time, at the scheduled date of 30 May. [Magureanu] My opinion is that when the problem of corruption at various levels is raised -- unfortunately we are often compelled to acknowledge the existence of this phenomenon -- political passions should be set aside and the law should be allowed to have its say. The relevant factors should help the law in this respect. But maybe even we, as an institution, have not been doing a proper job in this respect, to the extent of supplementing the efforts made by others to clarify various cases. Maybe the rather poor correlation between us and the mass-media is also to be blamed for this, since we should really support each other. Caritas -- A Negative Phenomenon of Great Proportions [Lucaciu] You told the press that you notified the relevant authorities some time ago about the danger posed by Caritas and the other so-called mutual assistance games. However, these schemes unfolded at will, until they went bankrupt, thus hurting thousands of poor and naive people, while enriching a few profiteers. [Magureanu] From the beginning, Caritas should have been restrained by special legislation, which would have prevented the game from unfolding. I have stated my opinion on this subject in public on several occasions and I also took up the matter with various officials. Caritas was a negative phenomenon of great proportions, which not only swindled some poor people out of large sums of money, but also extracted huge sums of money from the overall economic circuit. At a certain point, the experts even feared a serious economic blockage -- there was indeed such a possibility -- due to the draining away and piling up of huge sums of money blocked in these games. To all this, one should add the artificial price hikes in the areas whether the Caritas profits had an impact and the dollars taken outside the country, after being bought at absolutely incredible prices, which were three or four times higher than the official rate. All this is the negative and very serious outcome of the Caritas scheme. [Lucaciu] Therefore, you informed the relevant people. Why did nobody take the necessary steps on time? It seems that there is a crack along the three-stage route of information, the power's analysis forum, and the decisionmaking process. An interested or disinterested crack... [Magureanu] There was a delay in the decisionmaking process in this particular case. Here, we may both agree on the implications of the problem. There has been much interference, at various levels. There was local pressure from those who could earn money from such schemes. There was pressure from certain people at various levels of power, who were given priority in receiving money from the game. Then, there was also pressure from the public at large. At a time of economic crisis -- here we return to the issue of the economic crisis, a problem that burdens us all -- people believe in miracles. There is a paradox with regard to miracles, namely that the less likely they are, the more people tend to believe in them and the greater their resonance. We witnessed the functioning of the miracle of general prosperity, at a time of crisis, when hopes in a better life could no longer be perceived in a normal way. To all this, one has to add the slow pace at which the legal bodies moved in this matter. We do not yet have a settled legislative system. In a healthy economy, the games of chance are strictly regulated and are not allowed to acquire such scope and what a newspaper called "such caricature-like proportions," as occurred in our country. [Lucaciu] I asked you this question about the route of your information and its efficiency, because I could find no stipulation in Law No. 14 that you can legally notify someone -- the justice bodies, for instance -- to rapidly intervene in such a serious case unearthed by the SRI. [Magureanu] Indeed, the law does not specify that. However, we are entitled to legally intervene whenever we can perceive a major attempt to undermine our economic life. We not only have the right, but also the specific duty to intervene in such situations. [Lucaciu] What form does your intervention take? [Magureanu] We issue warnings about the major danger posed by certain actions. [Lucaciu] Who are you warning, the justice or the General Magistracy? [Magureanu] Yes. [Lucaciu] What if the Magistracy or the law do not take any measures? [Magureanu] Well, you had better address this question to the respective institutions. However, I believe that we should also be more efficient in issuing appropriate warnings in such cases. [Lucaciu] The SRI is an institution that is subordinated to Parliament and its activity is organized and coordinated by the Supreme Defense Council of the Country, which is headed by President Ion Iliescu. In what way are you subordinated to the aforementioned council? [Magureanu] All our principal domains of activity are controlled by Parliament. However, as far as the day-to-day executive aspect of our activity is concerned, as well as the way in which we integrate ourselves within the framework of other institutions that by law are part of our security system, we are subordinated to the Supreme Council. We are to periodically report our activity to the council. Summarizing the whole thing, fundamentally we are under the control of Parliament, but in our current activity we are subordinated to the Supreme Council. [Lucaciu] Besides the SRI, which other services work parallel to you in Romania? [Magureanu] There have been a great number of allegations about those services. They have been enumerated and everyone considered that there are too many of them. However, the services operating outside the SRI are actually branch services [servicii sectoriale]. For instance, there is a counterintelligence protection unit functioning within the Ministry of Interior (UM 0215). Or the Guard and Protocol Service of the dignitaries (SPP) [Serviciul de Protectie si Paza], which for its current information has set up a so-called Center for Operational Information. And, as in all countries of the world, the Armed Forces have their own military counterespionage and information protection service. The competence of all these services is limited to their specific field of activity. And as you may know, there is also the Foreign Intelligence Service (SIE). [Lucaciu] Does the SRI cooperate with these services? [Magureanu] Yes, we do. Our day-to-day activity presupposes our cooperation with those services, in a way that is strictly regulated by law. [Lucaciu] Under whose control are those services? [Magureanu] Here there is a special situation. Whereas we are effectively under the control of Parliament, they are subordinated, as stipulated by law and other precise regulations, to the institutions to which they belong: To the respective ministries, or, in other cases, such as the SPP, to the corresponding institution. [Lucaciu] The law stipulates that one of your duties is to protect state secrets and prevent the leaking of information. [Magureanu] In every intelligence service the protection of secrets features within the spectrum of its activity. Since our work in this area can be characterized as general, it is only natural that we should also have broad responsibilities regarding the protection of state secrets. [Lucaciu] You have personally admitted that there have been some cases of information being leaked to the press from the SRI itself. What steps have you taken to curb that phenomenon? [Magureanu] I did not exclude the possibility of information being leaked to the press. But not just "to a certain part of the press" [reference to alleged leak of information about a number of opposition leaders and other politicians to the Greater Romania Party weekly ROMANIA MARE]. Some leaking of information did occur, it is true, but it was not deliberate in all cases. Sometimes it happened because some of our employees did not act correctly; we immediately took measures against them. [Lucaciu] I understand that the SRI has reached the third phase in its reorganization, which has been done by restructuring in the name of the professionalism required by the specific exigency in such services. There has been a great deal of speculation in the press on this issue. In some cases even linking the restructuring to the areas where they took place [reference to replacement of SRI heads in various counties]. [Magureanu] Restructuring has not been carried out in special areas. During the third, current, phase, we submitted the command to restructuring. I would define the essence of the current phase as follows: The transfer of the command over to the young generation. To a very significant percentage we have made that transfer to the new generation. In the future that transfer will amplify within our institution so that the command should be, to an ever-increasing extent, in the hands of the young people who joined the SRI after 1990. For the present, this process has just begun, but we made the transfer to put the command in the hands of a generation that, above all, has a better perception of the current role of our institution and of our fundamental goals. Please note that such restructuring did not occur merely in some areas of the territory, but rather over the whole of it. Over one-third of the command of our county branches, as well as in our central units has been revitalized since last autumn. [Lucaciu] Article 4 of Bill No. 14 stipulates that upon request of the leaders of public institutions, public corporations, and so on, the SRI is allowed to disclose information about persons who are to be appointed in important offices in the said units. Did the presidency contact you in this regard, requesting that you disclose such information about the persons who were to be appointed presidential counselors? [Magureanu] Yes, they requested it in quite a number of cases. But not in all cases. I would like to emphasize the fact that the law gives us the right to do that solely upon the request of leaders of institutions. This clause has been introduced deliberately. Thus we should offer objective information about the character, about the aptitude of the persons who are to be appointed to certain offices. In some cases they request such information. In certain cases they do not. Actually no institution leader is compelled to request such information, especially if he considers that he already has sufficient information about the person in question. At the time they discussed this law, the aforementioned paragraph was the subject of lengthy negotiations. I always stress this fact. Initially, that paragraph sounded much more imperative, as it stipulated that institution leaders are compelled to consult with us. That is when I also took the floor and I said that I do not wish our institution to mediate or to be responsible in any way for the appointments made in leading offices, as this would resemble the previous practice, generate suspicion, and it would artificially act as arbitration, which is not necessary. [Lucaciu] Bill No. 14 also stipulates that the SRI organize and carry out the transportation of official mail over the whole territory of Romania, in order to protect the state secrets. [Magureanu] This refers to secret mail, which it is our duty to transport. [Lucaciu] You are aware of the fact that recently a top secret document, which had been elaborated by presidential counselor Colonel General Vasile Ionel and confidentially sent to Radu Timofte, the chairman of the Senate Defense Commission, was also published, partially, by the weekly ROMANIA MARE. The information contained in that document, once published, may affect national security. How would you term this situation? [Magureanu] That was a leaking of information caused by the incorrect conduct of an employee. [Lucaciu] There are several plausible variants... [Magureanu] I know the dispute and I do not believe that things are as simple as they seem at first glance. I do not think that one of the persons at the two ends -- Messrs. Vasile Ionel and Radu Timofte -- are responsible for it, but rather the blame should fall on the incorrect action of the intermediary who transported the mail. [Lucaciu] Will you ever be able to present the truth about this case to the public? [Magureanu] If they request that we should interfere in this case, which does not directly refer to us... [Lucaciu] But is the surveillance of secret correspondence not one of your tasks? [Magureanu] The leaking did not occur during the transportation of the mail. Owing to the strict transportation regulations we have, such a thing would have been impossible. [Lucaciu] Does the publishing of that document infringe upon national security? [Magureanu] Of course it can affect national security. [Lucaciu] And, under such circumstances, will you intercede? [Magureanu] Yes, if we are requested to do so, because we were not involved in this matter and I am not sure whether the mail in question was part of the correspondence for which we normally ensure the transportation. [Lucaciu] During a news conference you asserted that the level of your cooperation with similar bodies in the Republic of Moldova was not very good. [Magureanu] No, it was not. [Lucaciu] How is it currently? [Magureanu] It still isn't. [Lucaciu] Certain analysts claim that if one were to simplify things, currently there is an underground struggle going on in our country between two wings of the former Securitate. One consists of those who are nostalgic, while the other, those who are pragmatic, who adapted to the market economy, and support the reform. What is your opinion on such allegations? [Magureanu] I think that such reasoning is a little artificial. I did not really understand your assertion about the former Securitate. These old structures no longer exist in our country. [Lucaciu] I was not referring to structures, but rather to people. [Magureanu] Those people retired a long time ago. It is true, some of them went into business, so that remark was correct. However, I would not consider them as champions of the reform. Similarly, I would not consider that the other ones, the structured [structurati] ones -- as you termed them -- within the former Securitate, exert a genuine, palpable, influence upon our security system. There are no such influences. [Lucaciu] I did not mean especially the SRI, but rather their influence upon our political life. [Magureanu] I do not believe there is such an impact, except perhaps to an extent that I would term as marginal; certain employees of the former Securitate have been called upon to carry out certain operations, let us say, professional ones, by certain political parties. However, in my opinion such cases are not very significant. [Lucaciu] Do you think that those persons have altered their outlook? [Magureanu] To a varying degree, from case to case. [Lucaciu] Do you not think that the inability to change certain conceptions is hindering the reform process? [Magureanu] Of course, old conceptions, regardless of the domain in which they manifest themselves, act as hurdles. However, I do not think that it would be conclusive if one claimed that certain hindering actions could, to a relevant extent, be exerted by former employees of the Securitate. In my opinion, in our case conservatism may be traced back to completely different things. I would like to warn everyone of this potential error that comes of looking at things schematically. It is not a certain part of the former Securitate acting to hinder reform, while another part of the same echelons of the Securitate acts in favor of reform. I think this image is an artificial one. But we could talk in detail about this subject some other time. [Lucaciu] Many people endorse this idea by the manifold underground ties the former Securitate people had. [Magureanu] One oversimplifies things if one considers all hindering actions -- which are really there, one can feel them in Romanian society -- as the work of some former Securitate employees with old conceptions. The image of our current situation is much more complex. [Lucaciu] Which are the factors, in your opinion, that cause such visible hindering effects? [Magureanu] There are very many of them. For instance, at the local level and in the central administration there are certain corrupt or corruptible persons, who are interested in keeping their current advantageous positions and therefore their actions cannot be but hindering, going against the tide. [Lucaciu] If one looks at reality, our current situation, there seems to be quite a number of persons interested in going against the tide. [Magureanu] Again, one has to distinguish among things. Hindering actions cannot be explained solely by the existence of old conceptions and corruption. Such actions may also be the consequence of certain inadequate juridical regulations, loopholes in the organization, the wrong assessment of the steps that ought to be made in certain directions, and the unsuitable nature of the development programs at various levels. [Lucaciu] I would like to mention the fact that I did not discuss all these issues with the acting director of the SRI, but rather with a person who is interested in political expertise. Do you intend to go into politics when you retire from the SRI? [Magureanu] That is an issue that will have to be decided in the future, and in any case not in the near future. What I intend to do is go back to my former work, that is, education and research. However, other routes cannot be excluded either. As far as the future is concerned, I consider myself a person who still has sufficient time ahead of him, so there is still some uncertainty about my future options. [Lucaciu] As a person who is interested in the political domain, do you believe that currently in Romania there are clearly structured political doctrines? [Magureanu] No. And that is another reason for the continuing stagnation and hesitation. Although various parts of our political spectrum have been claiming their own doctrines, these have still not sufficiently jelled. Some of them have not even been adapted to the general European course either, despite claims that their ideologies stem from broader currents existing in Europe. There is discrepancy between the doctrines they claim to follow and the similar doctrines as practiced in the neighboring countries and, generally, in Europe. Besides, the level of our political culture is quite low. Unfortunately, this phenomenon is quite obvious. I have had the opportunity to see with my own eyes, even during public debates, persons who claimed they were followers of a certain current, a certain doctrine, and yet they were not familiar with its canons. Besides, there is also a kind of a circumstantial behavior, meaning that whenever they find a slogan that is useful for the purpose of their immediate political profit, they will not hesitate to adopt it, without pondering and trying to analyze it deeply first. A great deal of confusion is also generated by the very large number of political parties that currently exist, some of which -- and quite a number of which -- claim they belong to social- democracy or some other contemporary doctrine, without sufficient knowledge about those currents and without being able to explain either the Romanian tradition in the evolution of those doctrines or the way in which they evolved in Europe and in the world. All this sometimes generates a bleary situation with respect to the relation between those doctrines and reality in our country. [Lucaciu] The absence of well-established doctrines leads to the personalization of our political life, to the accentuation of the role of the leaders. What importance would you ascribe to leaders in the life and representation of political parties? [Magureanu] If one thinks in terms of what is specifically Romanian, one sees that this influence is palpably very strong. It is true, the phenomenon of personalization -- the personalization of power, one might say -- in the life of political parties and even generally in politics, may appear in the initial phase of democracy, but it may continue later on as well. However, in the two aforementioned cases the quality of the personalization is essentially different. In the case of our country, in the initial phase, within many of the political parties the leaders had an overwhelming role in the shaping of those currents, in their gaining credibility and even legitimacy. This is a fact that is valid not only for Romanian society, but for other societies as well. I mean the other societies, which similarly to us, are also in the transition phase. It seems inherent to me that personalities should play such a role in the initial phase of democracy. In some cases it may even have beneficial effects. [Lucaciu] Under the current circumstances do you believe early elections could be held? [Magureanu] This is possible. [Lucaciu] Considering that the various doctrines are not clarified yet, how do you think the electorate could find its way about? [Magureanu] The electoral options will be significantly reoriented. This is a normal phenomenon during the transition period. Today we have reached a further phase of reform. Let us not forget, Romania has made significant steps on the way of transition, and, although for some people those steps proved to be quite painful, their results are irreversible. This is also acknowledged by certain international bodies. From now on, the crucial issue for us is whether or not we manage economically. Our performance in solving that issue will be decisive for the option of the electorate. [Lucaciu] Is economic success not the result of strategies? [Magureanu] Yes, obviously. [Lucaciu] That strategy is offered by the parties designated by the electorate. [Magureanu] As far as the shaping of strategies is concerned, responsibility is shared by all those who, at a given time, share the state power. [Lucaciu] Do you anticipate a positive outcome? [Magureanu] I refrain from making forecasts. But if I were to do so, I should be moderately optimistic, while, in any case, manifesting restraint. If I were to make an assertion now, it could be superseded by the dynamic evolution of events and, besides, any clear-cut assertion of mine might be interpreted as an attempt to meddle in the normal course of political life. [Lucaciu] Before the end of last month you held a meeting with the editors in chief of various dailies intended to better the circulation of information between the SRI and the press. What have you accomplished so far in that sense and what has the press accomplished? [Magureanu] We are trying to refine our relations with the press through the press office, which we have improved both in structure and function. Moreover, we are trying to make our relations with the press more fluent in the case of issues of general interest. Those are issues that are equally interesting for both parties and which we could make joint efforts in clarifying.
