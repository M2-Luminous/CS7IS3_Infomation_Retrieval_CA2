Altogether 4,641 enterprises from all parts of China invested a total of 15 billion yuan in this city, China's largest economic center, last year. According to economists here, the surge of domestic investments in Shanghai can be characterized by the enthusiasm in the development of the New Pudong Area and the interest in service trade and transforming the old urban districts. The New Pudong Area is a newly-established economic zone that is expected to lead in the transformation of Shanghai's industrial and financial sectors. A survey shows that over 1,700 enterprises with a combined investment of 10 billion yuan from outside Shanghai settled in Pudong in 1993. Regarding it as a new corridor to the market of the Pacific region, Anhui Province, which was hit by natural disasters over the past two years, still has invested large funds in Pudong. Many of the projects have now begun to make profits. Among the 350 securities companies in Shanghai, 176 were founded by investors from outside Shanghai. The intensifying interest in real estate has brought 60 new projects to Pudong, with a total construction area of 1.5 million square meters. Shanghai's nine urban districts have used domestic investment of more than 300 million yuan respectively, to transform old buildings and improve infrastructure facilities. The business volume of enterprises from outside Shanghai topped 20.6 billion yuan in 1993, and they delivered 300 million yuan to the government in taxation last year.
