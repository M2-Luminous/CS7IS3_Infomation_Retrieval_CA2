The situation of the Korean peninsula is now being brought to the brink of war by the new war provocation moves committed by the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique to stifle our Republic, the article says, and goes on: The U.S. imperialists have brought the nuclear-powered carrier Carl Vinson near the Korean peninsula and deployed a naval fleet of 30 warships including two carrier task forces on the waters within a reach of 24 hours from the Korean coast for the resumption of the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises. Meanwhile, a Patriot missile battalion involving 40 odd missile launching pads and over 800 troops left Texas for South Korea on the order of U.S. President Bill Clinton. Availing itself of this situation, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique has become all the more undisguised in its criminal war moves against the North. The Kim Yong-sam group ordered all the puppet forces on to "a special alert" to keep them "prepared to attack the North," crying for "a tough reaction" against the North and "full preparations to invade the North through a cooperative system" with the United States. The puppets went so far as to make public a war plan against the North dubbed "New Operation Plan No. 5027." The U.S. imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique have staged very provocative and dangerous war gambles which might develop to a real war any time on the ground and in the air and the sea almost every day. The danger of war on the Korean peninsula is imminent and real. The U.S. imperialists intend to keep hold on South Korea indefinitely as their colony and, with it as the bridgehead, dominate the North of Korea and the rest of Asia. Intolerable are the crimes of the U.S. imperialists, who are trying to turn the Korean peninsula into the theatre of a thermonuclear war for their aggressive goal and of the Kim Yong-sam group, which is acting the shock brigade in executing their policy of aggression and war, courting their favor. Our people and People's Army do not want a war. But they are not afraid of it.
