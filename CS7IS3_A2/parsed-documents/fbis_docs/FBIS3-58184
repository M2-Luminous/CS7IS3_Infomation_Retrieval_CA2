Al-Qaysi first visited Foreign Ministry Under Secretary Ozdem Sanberk. The two delegations later held talks headed by the two under secretaries, respectively. Before the meeting, Sanberk said Turkey supports protecting Iraq's unity and integrity, and sincerely hopes that country will reassume its place in the international community. Sanberk stressed that the Karkuk-Yumurtalik oil pipeline is an important investment for both countries. We have been discussing the pumping of the oil in the pipeline for some time now, he said. We have been making contacts and working on ways to eliminate the problems created by the fact that the pipeline was idle for three years, he said, and on ways to reactivate the system once the embargo is lifted in the future. Sanberk said that at the meeting they would discuss what kind of a common solution can be found to the problem within the framework of UN Security Council resolutions. Al-Qaysi said relations between the two countries are historical ties of friendship. We will exchange views, he said, on issues concerning the two countries. Foreign Minister Hikmet will receive the Iraqi delegation this afternoon.
