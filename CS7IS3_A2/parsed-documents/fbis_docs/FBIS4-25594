Zeng Xingqiu, vice-president of China National Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Corp. (CNODC), said exploration work was carried out in the first, second and fourth blocks, with AGIP, Esso and BP being the respective operators. The three blocks, situated in the south-east of the Taklimakan Desert, totalled 38,765 square kilometers, Zeng said. The operators will work out exploration details and implement them in the light of the contracts, he added. CNODC concluded two oil contracts and one agreement on a geo-physical survey with the three operating groups formed by 14 foreign companies after they won the bidding. A total of 68 companies from 17 countries had expressed interest in the five blocks China offered, although fewer tabled tenders afterwards. Zeng said he was satisfied with the result of the bidding, China's first for onshore oil and gas exploration. He said the harsh natural conditions in the desert pose severe challenges to exploratory operations there. The Tarim Basin, with an area of 560,000 square kilometers, is one of the few "virgin areas" in the world for oil and gas exploration. However, most of it is covered with dunes or even sand hills, and often referred to as a "sea of death." "At a time when oil prices are stagnant, so many companies' participation in the bidding indicates their deep interest in China's oil and gas prospects," he added. Zeng said China's second round of onshore international bidding has fared well. This time China exposed 26 blocks for risk exploration and 11 projects for enhancing oil recovery. So far 76 companies from 17 countries in the world have registered and are studying data packages. Some of them have even made field tours, he said. The deadline for lodging tenders is September 28 this year, he added.
