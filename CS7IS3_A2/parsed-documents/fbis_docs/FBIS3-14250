Groups of the Ismaili and Uzbek militias, and other Communist opposition groups, are concentrated there now. In a telephone contact with AL-HAYAH in Jeddah, the Afghan sources made little of the attacks that the Uzbek militias, under the command of General 'Abdol Rashid Dostam, are launching against the capital, Kabul, and described them as "desparate." They indicated that the government forces had three days ago taken large amounts of booty in the form of weapons, ammunition, and tremendous quantities of fuel and provisions. They said that the Communist militias had been preparing their men and large quantities of arms, ammunition, and supplies for an attack on northern Kabul from the Pol-e Khomri region. They described the amount of booty which the government forces had captured as "inconceivable, praise God."
