Oleg Falichev: "The Main Thing Is Combat Readiness: Press Conference of the Minister of Defense"] [Text] The Armed Forces of Russia have an anniversary on 7 May 1992: It is two years since the beginning of their formation. That is enough time to summarize results and to talk about problems and prospects. This is really what was discussed at the press conference in the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, where Minister of Defense Gen. of the Army Pavel Grachev spoke to Russian and foreign journalists. "Two years is truly a short time," he said. "But for military people these years were extraordinarily filled with doings. In this time we realized very clearly the kind of responsibility that the army has. For this reason, one of the main results of its formation is this: The armed forces are a dependable institute of the state and the guarantor of its security. Real patriots of the motherland are now serving in the army under these difficult circumstances. They serve in accordance with their conscience and not for rubles and dollars. The truth is this: Whatever difficulties Russia may experience, the armed forces will retain their combat capability and will remain controllable. I thank the officers, generals, and soldiers for this." The main task today, the minister of defense stressed, is to support the army and navy at a level of combat readiness that quarantees the defense of the state under any conditions. And it is being fulfilled. The Strategic Nuclear Forces remain the guarantor of the security of Russia. And they will continue to be the main means of deterring the unleashing of nuclear war. The process of establishing new force groupings is being concluded. The Mobile Forces will play an important role in them. Work is now under way in the forces to bring them up to prescribed strength. The minister of defense gave a brief assessment of what has been done in each branch of the armed forces. He said that the mixed principle of manpower acquisition will be retained. In 1994, for example, it is planned to accept 64,000 men in the Ground Forces. And it is planned to have 50 percent of them be contract service personnel by 1995. The minister found a shortcoming in the fact that we have not yet learned to work with this contingent. As a result, about 25 percent of the contract people had to be discharged. As for the Air Defense Forces, about whose demise there has been much talk, they will remain. It is planned to reorganize them into Aerospace Defense Forces. Overall the Minister of Defense had a rather high assessment of the combat readiness of the troops. The situation is best in the Strategic Missile Forces, Moscow Military District, Leningrad Military District, the GRVZ [Group of Russian Troops in Transcaucasus], and Leningrad Naval Base. Things are worse in the Pacific Fleet. The minister of defense stressed that beginning with the summer training period the armed forces will put rigid demands on the work. Two years was enough time, he said, to eliminate shortcomings and to establish efficient work. Among the problems that require a decision at the national level, Gen. of the Army Pavel Grachev named the dependable and stable financing of the armed forces, their adequate strength level, the conclusion of the troop withdrawal, and the provision of housing and facilities for the troops in the territory of Russia. We will speak in more detail in the next issue about the problems raised at the press conference with respect to the development of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.
