The upper house is expected to endorse the bill as early as next week, setting the stage for the enforcement of the legislation one year later. The new law, the first of its kind in Japan, will make it easier for consumers to prove manufacturer liability for damage stemming from defective products. The legislation had met strong opposition from some lawmakers within the Liberal Democratic Party, the largest opposition party, who had demanded that blood products be exempted. The Japan Society of Blood Transfusion had joined the LDP in demanding an exemption of blood for transfusion, saying that the bill could hurt the blood supply. The opposition did not lead any change in the draft bill, but forced the government to attach seven resolutions making it clear that an unavoidable spread of viruses through blood transfusion at the current scientific standards and blood transfusion reactions do not constitute defects.
