He announced the dispatch of 15 special groups from the Federal Judicial Police [PJF] Narcotics Division to hunt and capture the drug trafficking "capos," so as to dismantle the drug dealing rings. He added that those units, assigned primarily to the northern part of the country, consist of 40 graduates of the Training Institute run by the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic [PGR]. That department is backing their training to combat the "narcos" presumed to have connections with those in the United States and in Central and South America. He claimed that the principal goals of those groups are to capture, among others, Benjamin, Javier, and Ramon Arellano Felix, the presumed material perpetrators of Cardinal Posadas Ocampo's assassination; Luis Hector Palma Salazar, alias "El Guero"; and Amado Carrillo Fuentes and Juan Garcia Abrego. There are apparently clues leading to these subjects, and "their operating methods are now known." According to Tello Peon, the INCD's first commissioner, this year the activities of the agency headed by him will be consolidated. It has approximately 800 police agents trained in 63 subjects. The topics include antiterrorism, constitutional law and, particularly, respect for human rights and guarantees. He added that the graduates have been prepared also for air, land, and sea interception, noting that the training in investigation is to be reinforced this year. An effort has been made to devise data processing and communication systems, and to obtain equipment and technology. The high-ranking commissioner also claimed that great progress has been made in locating crime areas, indicating that the narcotics agents' effort would be focused on these areas. He added that the police agents and those from the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office assigned to the INCD would work jointly and cooperatively with the PGR's circuit representatives, and with military, state, and municipal authorities. He observed that, last year, the Attorney General's Office, specifically, the Federal Judicial Police, headed by Rodolfo Leon Aragon, confiscated over 44 tons of cocaine base, and made "arrests of prominent persons associated with the drug traffic." He remarked that "members of the INCD also participated in these operations."
