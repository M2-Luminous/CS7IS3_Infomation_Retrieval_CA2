Unasked, he stated that in 1994 he would not recommend to the citizens to elect a European Parliament to which basic rights are still denied. At that time, the chancellor wanted to exert pressure to ensure that the Maastricht conference paid the same attention to the development of the former European Community into a democratically legitimated political union as part of the project of monetary union. The Strasbourg chamber still does not have the most important of all parliamentary rights, that is, the power to pass laws. But now, four weeks before the election, Kohl does not call for an election boycott because this would not serve the cause, the European unification process. A poor turnout at the election does not exactly improve the parliament's chances of ever getting more power. On the other hand, it is hard to imagine that the Community might once again get new responsibilities that are not accompanied by credible parliamentary control. A growing number of member states would not take part in that. Thus, those who want to continue to put the Strasbourg chamber forever on the backburner, are curbing, in fact, European integration. The conclusion for the deputies is that they are more or less obliged to struggle for their own rights if they want to advance the development of the European Union. And it is likely that they do not want to refrain once again from using their means of power, such as the refusal to ratify the entry of new laender. If Switzerland were to submit an application for membership in a few years, a frustrated parliament would probably be obstinate. Thus, in the future the unification of Europe will mean thinking of the Strasbourg parliament. The question is only whether Maastricht II, the second conference for the examination of the treaty scheduled for 1996, will seriously consider further integration at that time. Apart from the British, all who reflected on the Community at the time of Maastricht still had the European federal state in mind, as if this were self-evident. However, hardly anybody talks of this anymore. After the nations lacked the necessary enthusiasm for the treaty, more and more governments are opposing integration. At the table of the Council of Ministers in Brussels, political blackmail triumphs more and more frequently over reasonable compromises -- would it not be too much of a good thing to really give the "obscure" Strasbourg chamber legislative power? For example, the partner state, Germany, which is otherwise so well disposed toward integration, reacted to the Community's increase in power, as a result of Maastricht, with more control powers for the national parliament -- instead of strengthening the rights of the European Parliament. Thus, the unification process has perhaps already been stopped, so that those who want to advance it -- undoubtedly, the chancellor can be considered one of them -- have to think of something. Consistently thought out to the end, the completion of the Strasbourg parliament as the second chamber, in addition to the Council of Ministers, cannot be avoided because only in this way can the powers of the European institutions be brought to a stable balance. It is wrong to deny the parliament its full rights; rather, it would be correct to precisely define the field for which they are valid -- for example, for all resolutions that are adopted with a qualified majority in the Brussels Council of Ministers. Thus, the people in Strasbourg would not get the right to levy taxes, but the power to use the revenue from a tax reserved to the Community. These are not pipe dreams, but integration policy objectives that seem to be attainable by 1996, though perhaps not with all partner states. What matters is that France and Germany want it. Helmut Kohl knows that only then will his Europe rest on a solid foundation.
