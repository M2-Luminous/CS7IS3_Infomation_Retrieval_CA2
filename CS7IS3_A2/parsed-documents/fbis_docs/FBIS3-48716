COURRIER DE LA CONFERANCE DE LA PAIX published in Hague, the Netherlands, quoted the Korean envoy, Yi Wi-chong, who went to the Second World Peace Conference as saying that the socalled "Ulsa Five-Point Treaty" in 1905 was nothing but an accord signed by the then foreign minister without the approval of the Korean emperor, that the signed document had not been ratified and that the "treaty" had not taken effect. Egyptian GAZETTE said that with the discovery of a personal letter of Korean Emperor Kojong in 1906 as regards the illegality and invalidity of this "treaty", it has been proved that the colonial rule of Japan over Korea had no legal ground. The paper noted: Kojong said he as the emperor did not authorize the ministers to sign the "treaty" and the Japanese side faked up the "treaty" after locking up ministers. He declared that "it is against public law to claim that the `treaty' was concluded and so it is null and void." The Mozambican Magazine TEMPO said the "Ulsa Five-Point Treaty" was faked up by Japan to colonialize Korea by "legalizing" its occupation of Korea and forging Korean history. The Shihata News Agency of Tanzania said the personal letter of Emperor Kojong showed the absurdity of the argument of the Japanese Government for the "lawfulness" of the past "treaty". Radio of Mongolia elaborated on the illegality and invalidity of the "Ulsa Five-Point Treaty" and said the Japanese authorities must repent of the crimes against the Korean people and honestly liquidate the past.
