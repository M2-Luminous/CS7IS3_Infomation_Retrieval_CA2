This year, the British Overseas Development Program will help Hainan draw up a plan to protect the environment in Haikou, the island's capital. It will also train personnel and provide equipment for environmental protection. A German-aided sewage-treatment plant in Haikou is expected to go into construction next year. Located in a tropical region, Hainan has a land area of 34,000 sq km, with forest coverage of 40 percent. It also boasts a coastline more than 1,500 km long. No other area in China matches Hainan in terms of the abundance of animal, plant and marine resources. No large-scale development was launched until five years ago, when Hainan Province was founded. Since then, the island has been faced with environmental pollution, a drastic shrinkage of its forests and the deterioration of the coastal marine ecological system. Whether Hainan can avoid economic growth at the expense of the environment, which most developed nations have experienced, has become a focus of concern. Martin Lees, former assistant secretary general of the United Nations, has cautioned the Chinese Government of the problem of economic development and environmental protection. He said Hainan should set an example for the world by combining economic development with minimal damage to the environment. With the help of UN organizations and other overseas foundations, Hainan has hosted seminars on the environment problem. In September of 1990, eight Chinese and eight international experts formed an international advisory council on the economic development of Hainan in harmony with the environment. The Asian development bank allocated 600,000 U.S. dollars to work out a comprehensive plan for the administration of Hainan's environment and natural resources early this year. According to the plan, sewage-treatment plants will be built for a sugar plant and a rubber plant, in addition to a garbage disposal plant. A province-wide environmental monitoring network will also be set up.
