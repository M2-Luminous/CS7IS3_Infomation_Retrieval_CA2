In the letter, entitled "Romanies are Citizens with Obligations Only, and No Rights," Scuka analyses the problems of Romanies within the framework of European integration. He believes that reform has to take place both in social opinions, which should take into account Romany interests and their position within the European Community, and in the finding of a solution to Romany problems. This solution should be based on a new orientation, issuing in part from Christian philosophy and the Romany culture in Europe as an essential basis for the broadening of the Romany educational level. It would require the international Romany Union to cooperate with all the international and church organizations, with the leaders of Romany organizations and parties, and with Romany intellectuals in Europe. There is a need for an educational and cultural center or community which would act in individual European states and regions and help Romanies to find their own identity and to be not only good Romanies but capable citizens, Scuka says. The Czech Republic lacks a sound legal means of suppressing racism and objective statistics on the social position of Romanies, Scuka says in the letter, and also suggests that the president have a Romany adviser in his office.
