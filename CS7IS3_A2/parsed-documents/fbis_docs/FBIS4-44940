FBIS4-44940 "jpnea029___94020" JPRS-NEA-94-029 JPRS Near East & South Asia 25 April 1994 SOUTH ASIA INDIA New Left Party To Contest in Serampore By-Election New Left Party To Contest in Serampore By-Election 94AS0284D Calcutta THE STATESMAN in English 25 Apr 94 p 3 94AS0284D Calcutta THE STATESMAN English CSO [Text] Mr Manoranjan Hazra, former CPI(M) [Communist Party of India-Marxist] MLA [Member of Legislative Assembly] and a prominent leader of the newly formed Proletarian Revolutionary Party of India [PRPI], will contest the forthcoming Assembly by-polls at Serampore in Hooghly district on a PRPI ticket, the party general secretary, Mr Sumanta Hira, said on Sunday. The PRPI candidate will be supported by a 10-party combine including the SUCI [Socialist Unity Center of India] and the CPI(M-L) [Communist Party of India-Marxist-Leninist], Mr Hira said. Mr Hazra has already begun a door-to-door campaign to garner votes for himself. Being new, his party, not surprisingly, has a limited following in Serampore. The Congress(I), Mr Hazra said, had won the past three Assembly polls in the constituency on the strength of the "negative votes," cast against the CPI(M). The PRPI leadership is reportedly of the view that Mr Hazra will cut into the votes of both the Congress(I) and the CPI(M). Mr Hazra would get the Congress(I) votes because of his association with the freedom movement, Mr Hira said. Traditional CPI(M) voters, he added, would also support Mr Hazra as he had initiated several development projects in Serampore.
