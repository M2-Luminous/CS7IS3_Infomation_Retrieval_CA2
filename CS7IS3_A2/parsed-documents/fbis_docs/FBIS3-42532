An answer to this question has been sought in the republic for 1 1/2 years. Precisely for such a time our country, acquiring independence, has "twirled" the space heritage of the former union, not being able to make up its mind what to do. Not without hesitation was it decided to use it for its direct purpose. In other words, such resources were earmarked under the earlier signed Intergovernmental Program for Space Research and Use, which Belarus decided to carry out together with Russia, the Ukraine and other countries of the Commonwealth. Boris Beregov, deputy director of the Technical Cybernetics Institute, Belarus Academy of Sciences, chairman of the republic conference on space, states: Only at first glance does it seem that getting out of the expensive space game means the saving of money. Over the course of many decades a unique scientific-industrial capability was formed in the republic which was oriented on the development and production of space systems, instruments and equipment for research on the Earth's surface and atmosphere and the solution of other technological and scientific problems related to the mastery of the universe. To break up the formed infrastructure, to seek a new place for application of the knowledge of specialists (most frequently with a very narrow field of specialization) and to redirect well-organized production to something else is possible only at an enormous cost. An example of this is the Gomel Electronics Plant. It is outfitted with the most modern equipment, including a supercomputer, and has specialists of the highest class who were brought together from the entire Union. Some mathematicians brought about a hundred families from the Novosibirsk Akademgorodok. And now they are mastering the production of lamps and other consumer goods! The Novopolotskiy Izmeritel plant, an enterprise which formerly was so secret and extraterritorial that not many even in the government of Belarus knew of its "space specialization," has found itself in a similar situation. A reasonable owner must not think about how to rid itself from what had been built up over the course of many years, but how to use this wealth in order to bring it income. Thank God we were able to convince the government of the republic of this. Just what is the nature of the contribution of Belarus to the intergovernmental program? The most important contribution is a fractional participation in the funding of individual projects, the sequence of which is embodied in a special agreement. Sums will be allocated only for tasks to be performed by institutes, design bureaus and industrial plants in Belarus. In addition to sums taken from budget appropriations for science, in accordance with the corresponding intergovernmental agreement, for the Belorussian share for maintenance of facilities in the space infrastructure, the government of Belarus has allocated money from the Ministry of Finance reserve. For this sum Belorussian standard-produced equipment and materials will be supplied for ensuring the normal operation of cosmodromes. Thus, jobs and production facilities will be preserved. The program for Belarus includes 32 themes which the institutes and enterprises of the republic had begun to work on (and in most cases have simply continued). It must be noted that the program is being carried out jointly with the Russian Space Agency and this is so-called peaceful space. The military people have their own cooperation and their own plans. With respect to Russia, it is interested in such a joining of efforts: for the development of such research it would require not only additional appropriations, but also three or four years for organizing corresponding scientific groups and bringing them up to an acceptable level. Well, what is the interest of Belarus in this? Is it only striving to preserve its space intellectual and production capabilities or is it also counting on some return? "To be sure, we are counting on a return," explains Boris Beregov. "It must not be forgotten that our republic is in a more advantageous position because the principal financial burden for space is not on our shoulders. Much of that which is being done in the space field moreover is of a purely national character and is directed to satisfaction of our own needs. In addition, today possibilities are appearing for making formerly secret technologies available to `nonspace' production facilities, which also will bring an economic return. In agriculture, for example, a space survey includes a high-quality evaluation of the condition of soils and monitoring of the fertilization of plants, as well as more successful contending with weeds and predators and reproachless monitoring of the development of sown crops and calculation of yields by species. Belarus has everything necessary for the processing of satellite information. It is only necessary to organize this work into a system. The first steps in this direction have already been taken. But it is the opinion of scientists that serious work will be possible only with the appearance of a satellite information center and with the raising of this entire service to a state level."
