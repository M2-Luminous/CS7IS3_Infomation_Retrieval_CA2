FR940429-2-00024 FR940429-2-00019 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [Docket No. CP93&hyph;548&hyph;000] Wallkill Transport, L.P.; Availability of The Environmental Assessment For The Proposed Wallkill Pipeline Project April 22, 1994. The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission) has prepared an Environmental Assessment (EA) on the natural gas pipeline facilities proposed by Wallkill Transport Company, L.P. (Wallkill) in Docket No. CP93&hyph;548&hyph;000. The EA was prepared to satisfy the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. The staff concludes that approval of the proposed project, with appropriate mitigating measures, would not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. However, we are requesting specific comments on one route variation discussed below. The EA assesses the potential environmental effects of the construction and operation of the proposed Wallkill Pipeline Project, including: •23.9 miles of new 10-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline; •A 6-inch meter run; •A 6-inch orifice meter; and •Eight pipeline valve assemblies. The purpose of the proposed facilities would be to transport up to 30 million cubic feet of natural gas per day from an existing Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee) pipeline to the planned Wallkill Generating Facility. The EA also evaluates alternatives to Wallkill's proposal. The staff specifically requests comments on the proposed route in the area of Bates Gates Road, near MP 18, versus the I&hyph;84 Variation. The discussion of the variation begins on page 39 of the EA. As further discussed in the EA, each of these routes offers advantages and disadvantages which deserve comment. The EA has been placed in the public files of the FERC and is available for public inspection at: Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Division of Public Information, 941 North Capitol Street, NE., room 3104, Washington, DC 20426, (202) 208&hyph;1371. Copies have been mailed to Federal, state and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals, newspapers, and parties to this proceeding. A limited number of copies of the EA are available from: Ms. Laura Turner, Environmental Project Manager, Environmental Review and Compliance Branch II, Office of Pipeline Regulation, Room 7312, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20426, (202) 208&hyph;0916. Any person wishing to comment on the EA may do so. Written comments must reference Docket No. CP93&hyph;548&hyph;000, and be addressed to: Office of the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426. Comments should be filed as soon as possible, but must be received no later than May 16, 1994, to ensure consideration prior to a Commission decision on this proposal. A copy of any comments should also be sent to Ms. Laura Turner, Environmental Project Manager. Comments will be considered by the Commission but will not serve to make the commentor a party to the proceeding. Any person seeking to become a party to the proceeding must file a Motion to Intervene according to Rule 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214). Additional information about this project is available from Ms. Laura Turner, Environmental Review and Compliance Branch II, Office of Pipeline Regulation, at (202) 208&hyph;0916. Lois D.
