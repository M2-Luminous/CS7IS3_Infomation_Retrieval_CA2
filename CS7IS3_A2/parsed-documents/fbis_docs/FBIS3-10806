Maluf will have to resign as mayor of Sao Paulo on 29 March. Maluf's decision is not tied to his party's decision to form an alliance to support his candidacy. Maluf made the announcement to five of his aides: Planning Secretary Claudio Lembo, Finance Secretary Celso Pitta, Government Secretary Edevaldo Alves da Silva, Highway Secretary Reynaldo de Barros, and Education Secretary Solon Borges, who is also the deputy mayor of Sao Paulo. It will be Maluf's third attempt to reach Planalto Palace: in 1984 he lost to Tancredo Neves at the Electoral College; and in 1989 he lost to Fernando Collor. "I have already decided and I want to make it quite clear that I have already met with my government team. I am very well prepared," he said after lunching in Rio de Janeiro with Globo Organization President Roberto Marinho. Claiming he would feel restrained if he announced his decision in Rio de Janeiro, Maluf only hinted that he would run for president: "I have even studied the timetable. I cannot resign on 2 April because it is Saturday, and it will be published in the official gazette on Monday, which is 4 April. It is not good to do it on 1 April, right? March 31 might have a political connotation (anniversary of the coup of 1964). I cannot do it on 30 March because it will be published by the official gazette on 31 March. Consequently, my deadline is 29 March. It will be published in the official gazette on 30 March," he said. Maluf reiterated that he would renounce his candidacy in favor of Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes (PFL) [Liberal Front Party], whose name "appears second in the polls" and who cannot be excluded from an alliance among the PPR, the PFL, the PP [Popular Party], the PL [Liberal Party], and the PTB [Brazilian Labor Party]. Maluf says he had dinner with Antonio Carlos Magalhaes three weeks ago. He noted that he will consider it discourteous if during a meeting scheduled for today, PFL President Jorge Bornhausen proposes that he give up his candidacy. Giving a personal example, Maluf criticized the proposed alliance between the PFL and the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party]: He said: "Just imagine if [Workers Party President] Lula [da Silva] and I made an alliance. It would be cynical, hypocritical, and would reduce the number of votes for both parties. The PFL is much better with the PPR." Maluf believes the implementation of the URV [Real Value Unit] is merely a dollarization, adding that Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso should not resign to become a candidate. "He should explain whether the plan was made for the election or for Brazil," said Maluf.
