They had an in-depth exchange of views on Sino-Kazakh relations and issues of common interest. The talks were conducted in a cordial and friendly atmosphere. Li Peng said: "Our talks have been fruitful. The talks, which have deepened mutual understanding and trust, will be conducive to further expanding relations between the two countries in various fields." He added: China and Kazakhstan are neighbors sharing a long border. China attaches great importance to its friendship with Kazakhstan. The two countries hold identical or similar views on many international issues. He pointed out: Sino-Kazakh relations are new-type relations based on equality, mutual benefit, respect, and noninterference in each other's internal affairs. Nazarbayev stated: Premier Li Peng's visit to Kazakhstan, the first in history by a Chinese leader, is a historic event in Kazakh-Chinese relations. He added: To develop relations with China is a priority of Kazakhstan's foreign policy. Kazakhstan will stick to the stance of noninterference in each other's internal affairs, will oppose national separatism and hegemonism, and will not allow "Eastern Turkistan" to carry out activities from Kazakhstan against China to the detriment of Kazakh-Chinese relations. Kazakhstan maintains that Taiwan is an integral part of the Chinese territory, and that Almaty will not have any official contacts whatsoever with Taiwan. Li Peng expressed appreciation for Nazarbayev's stand that the Kazakh Government will not allow national separatists to engage in anti-Chinese activities from Kazakhstan. He also thanked the Kazakh Government for taking the correct stand on the Taiwan and Tibet issues. The two leaders highly evaluated the Sino-Kazakh border agreement, which they believed is a historical event in bilateral relations and another important hallmark of the growth of Sino- Kazakh goodneighborly and friendly relations. The agreement will have a positive impact on expanding economic cooperation between the two countries. Li Peng said: The signing of the Sino-Kazakh border agreement once again shows to the entire world that Sino-Kazakh relations are founded on mutual trust and have strong vitality. He added: "We shall strive to build a new silk road together and will turn the Sino-Kazakh border into a boundary of peace, tranquility, friendship, and cooperation." Discussing bilateral economic and trade relations, Nazarbayev noted there exists broad foundations for developing economic and trade relations based on equality and mutual benefit. He hoped to further enrich the contents of cooperation and expand the areas of cooperation at a level commensurate with the two countries' potential. Li Peng said: "Despite the large growth in bilateral trade in recent years, there is still room for further development. I entirely agree with Your Excellency the President's proposal for further developing cooperation between the two countries. China will adopt a positive approach toward this proposal." LI Peng conveyed President Jiang Zemin's greetings to Nazarbayev, as well as the Chinese president's invitation to him to visit China once again. Nazarbayev asked Li Peng to relay his best wishes and gratitude to President Jiang Zemin.
