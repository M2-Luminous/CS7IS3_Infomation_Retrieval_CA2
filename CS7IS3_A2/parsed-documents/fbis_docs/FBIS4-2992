Tzou and Lilian Wu] [Text] Marrakech, Morocco, April 14 (CNA) -- A European union (EU) official Thursday [14 April] extended his support for Taiwan's bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) during a meeting with Republic of China [ROC] Economics Minister P.K. Chiang. Leon Brittan, vice president of the Commission of the European Union, said however, that the EU is concerned about Taiwan lowering its customs tariffs and removal of non-tariff trade barriers, especially those related to the import of European wine and liquor. Brittan also asked Taiwan to bring its government procurement program and service market into line with regulations laid down in the GATT Uruguay Round accord. Brittan said before Taiwan enters GATT it must remove trade barriers and adjust its custom tariffs. Chiang asked Brittan to submit an EU list of desired tariff reductions as soon as possible, so that both sides could engage in bilateral talks in the near future. Chiang, who met with Brittan for 45 minutes, was accompanied by Vice Economic Affairs Minister Sheu Ke-sheng and the Board of Foreign Trade Director-General Huang Yen-chao. Meanwhile, the Taiwan delegation to the GATT ministerial meeting here earlier met with Swiss Public Economy Minister Jean-Pascal Delamuraz. Delamuraz and Chiang discussed Taiwan's plans to open its service market, especially the financial and insurance sectors. Chiang also asked Delamuraz to submit a tariff reduction list so that Taiwan can begin bilateral talks with the Swiss before June, when a GATT working party meeting on Taiwan's membership bid is set to meet. Taiwan applied to join the Geneva-based world trade body in 1990 and was granted observer status in September 1992. It hopes to become a full member by the end of this year.
