This was stated by Sergey Filatov, head of the Russian Federation president's administration, at the opening of an international conference on "Legal problems and information aspects of creating a single economic space within the CIS." The main aim of the forum which opened today is to standardize legislation in the independent states of the former USSR to the greatest degree possible, in order to create a single economic space within the CIS, but without harming their individual sovereignty in any way. The conference is being attended by delegations from all the commonwealth member states, the Baltic states and representatives of the European Community. Vladimir Shumeyko, Chairman of the Interparliamentary Assembly of the CIS Member Countries, is taking part in its work. Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin have sent greetings to the conference, which will last two days.
