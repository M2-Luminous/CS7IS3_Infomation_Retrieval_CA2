Contrary to what the Uruguayan press has reported over the past two days, Fritsch confirmed that there is still impasse in the definition of a protection tariff on informatics and pharmaceutical products, conventional capital products, commodities that are subject to quotas, and cars. "Until there is consensus on all products affected by the common external tariff, we will not sign anything," Fritsch told the ESTADO news agency. He said Brazil will not close any partial deal. He thus referred to the 15-percent portion of the list of products affected by the TEC, on which no agreement has yet been reached. Agreement has so far been reached on practically 85 percent of the list of products, with tariffs ranging from 0 to 20 percent. Fritsch said he believes the list will be ready at the end of the first half of the year. He believes more negotiations will be necessary. Shortly after arriving in Montevideo yesterday afternoon, accompanied by Foreign Trade Secretary Renato Marques and other Itamaraty advisers, Fritsch met with Argentine technicians at the Argentine Embassy to continue negotiating the subject, which will be raised at a Common Market Group meeting today. A consultant with fluent contacts with technicians of Argentine ministries has said that Argentina might agree to a TEC ranging from 8 to 12 percent for those products, provided this tariff gradually falls to 0 until year 2,001. If Argentina makes this proposal at the meeting in Montevideo, Brazil will reject it. Next Monday, Brazilian, Argentine, Uruguayan, and Paraguayan Presidents Itamar Franco, Carlos Menem, Luis Lacalle, and Juan Carlos Wasmosy, respectively, will meet in Colonia, 170 km from Montevideo, for the 5th Common Market Council meeting. Depending on the impasse, the TEC may or may not be confirmed. The TEC is not the only obstacle obstructing the implementation of Mercosur, which is scheduled for 1995. Regulations on origin, the deployment of duty-free zones, and the protection of consumers are other controversial, unresolved matters. Such matters have so far been analyzed at the level of work subgroups, at which the technicians of the four countries formulated their proposals. Those three subjects, along with the list of exceptions, will now be studied within the Common Market Group, which is an executive organ of Mercosur.
