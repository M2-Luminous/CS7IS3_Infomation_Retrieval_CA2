FR940812-2-00195 FR940812-2-00069 [Docket No. 50&hyph;400] Carolina Power & Light Co.; Withdrawal of Application for Amendment to Facility Operating License The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has granted the request of Carolina Power & Light Company (the licensee) to withdraw its August 6, 1992 application for proposed amendment, as supplemented September 15, 1993, to Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;63 for the Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1, located in Wake and Chatham Counties, North Carolina. The proposed amendment would have revised Section 6 of the Technical Specifications to implement the functional role and responsibilities of the Nuclear Assessment Department (NAD). The NAD performs internal evaluations and assessment activities. The proposed change would have modified the facility Technical Specifications pertaining to the NAD. The fundamental role of the NAD is to assist in the early identification of deficiencies that may prevent the company's nuclear projects from achieving the desired level of performance on a sustained basis and to ensure effective correction of deficiencies. Because of major changes in the original submittal, the licensee has chosen to withdraw the previous amendment application and provide a new amendment request. The Commission had previously issued a Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment published in the Federal Register on September 16, 1992 (57 FR 42770). However, by letter dated July 22, 1994, the licensee withdrew the proposed change. For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated August 6, 1992, as supplemented September 15, 1993, and the licensee's letter dated July 22, 1994, which withdrew the application for license amendment. The above documents are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the Cameron Village Regional Library, 1930 Clark Avenue, Raleigh, North Carolina 27605. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 5th day of August 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Ngoc B. Le, Project Manager, Project Directorate, Division of Reactor Projects_Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;19719 Filed 8&hyph;11&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7590&hyph;01&hyph;M
