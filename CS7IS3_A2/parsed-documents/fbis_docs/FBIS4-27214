The sources said the government will release 200,000 tons of domestic rice from its stockpiles in July, 50,000 tons more than was originally planned. According to the Food Agency's new rice-supply plan, the proportion of domestic grain in the government's total supply will increase to 60 percent in August, 80 percent in September and more than that in October. Currently, the ratio stands at just 30 percent. The new plan will be officially adopted in early June after the agency briefs each prefecture. Under the original plan, the ratio of domestic rice was put at 30 percent by the end of July. It was only in September that supplies of domestic grain exceed those of imports. But following last year's devastating harvest, which forced Japan to buy foreign rice, farmers planted more early-harvested rice this year, prompting the government to add more domestic rice to its supplies in the coming months. Some analysts are even concerned that supplies of domestic rice will become excessive from August to October, leaving large amounts of imported rice on the shelves. A rice market official said, "if nothing is done, only domestic rice will be distributed around October and it will load wholesalers with large stocks of imported rice." Already, some imported rice, mainly Thai rice, has been left unsold after the panic hoarding of domestically grown rice in March.
