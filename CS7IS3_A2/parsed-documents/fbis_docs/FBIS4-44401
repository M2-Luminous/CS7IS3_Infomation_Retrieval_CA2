The matter must be put on the agenda and energetically handled." This was a forceful call to the people's representatives attending the second plenary session of the eighth autonomous region people's congress. In 15 years of reform and an open door policy, the issue of public security is increasingly prominent. Our region has gone from being closed to open. The economy has developed considerably. At the same time, some bad things have taken the opportunity to come in. Moreover, in recent years personnel from elsewhere have flooded into our region. In 1993 throughout the region there were more than 11,000 crimes tried, a relatively great increase over 1992. In Urumqi criminal activity was even more serious; the number of criminal cases tried was up 27 percent. Representative Xie Jianxun [6200 1696 8113] said that when society was closed we used static public security. Now that people, money and things are in great circulation, we use dynamic public security. Now, motives for committing crimes are complex: blind pandering, seeking high levels of enjoyment, undisclosed remuneration of profit distribution to heads of enterprises, etc.; leading to cases of graft, robbery, explosives, and beatings. In mentioning criminal cases, circulating people must be mentioned. They account for more than 30 percent of the crime rate in Urumqi and 70 percent of those harmed are personnel in circulation at the southern railway station. Representatives He Bingxian [0149 4426 6343] and Zhang Xuewen [1728 1331 2429] are deeply empathetic. Many thefts and robberies are committed by personnel circulating independently. Before the spring festival in particular, they steal chickens and seize dogs everywhere, stealing whatever they can, robbing whatever comes along, "bagging things to take home and pass the new year." It is noteworthy that the age of criminal elements is ever younger now. Youths account for 80 percent of crime. Many representatives believe that this is related to our greater social environment. In schools there is little moral training but lopsided seeking of high grades and advancing grades. Some periodicals, movies, and television propagate violence and sex. These factors enticing many young people to take the path of crime cannot be overlooked. Representative Xie Jianxun said that ineffective attacks on criminal elements and low solved case rates are current problems we cannot dodge. Yet the serious difficulties of weak police forces, lack of funds and backward equipment affect the speed and quality with which law enforcement departments try cases. Our entire bureau has a total of more than 3,500 people. Overall quality is insufficiently high. Only one-third of the personnel has undergone systematic training. Communications equipment is far from up to date. In one instance our cadres and police caught a fleeing criminal. The jeep had only gone several hundred meters when it died and they watched the criminal run away. It now costs more than 10,000 yuan to catch a criminal but our annual costs only pay wages to support common office work. Law enforcement sectors' prime job is to face the flashpoint issues in public security, adopt effective measures and curb rising crime. Representative Chen Jinchi [7115 6855 3069] believes public security organizations must further implement a "serious attack" policy: quickly and doubly attack various criminal elements. Enhance overall control of public security, issue control measures with all social forces, augment watchguard work, establish various watchguard measures and systems suited to developing a socialist market economy. Additionally, we must enhance public security work, improve the quality of cadres and police, perfect grass roots security and control systems and street offices, allowing grassroots organizations to play fully the important role of maintaining public security. He also called on society to show more concern and support for the work of public security troops.
