"I will withdraw my signature because I don't want to make agreements with the People's Party," League official Roberto Maroni announced, adding that if Segni "ever thought that the League and the PPI could be together, he was fooling himself." Maroni and Segni on Wednesday signed an accord that outlined a government program but fell short of an official alliance for the March 27 elections. Segni today commented that the League was standing in the way of a broad anti-left alliance and, in apparent response to Segni, Maroni said that "we were with the Pact and were not three-way." Maroni stressed the differences in political thinking between the People's Party and the program outlined in the agreement between League and Pact, especially the part calling for direct election of the prime minister.
