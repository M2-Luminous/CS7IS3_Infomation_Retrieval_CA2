The Taoyuan District Court meted out the prison terms for taxi driver Yang Ming-te and his wife Pan Feng-ying after finding them guilty of air piracy. The couple said that they would appeal. Judge Chiang Hsiao-pei said that the court showed leniency to Yang because he surrendered [words indistinct]. His wife received the shorter term because she was only an accomplice, Qiang added. The couple could have been sentenced to death. The couple armed with a knife and fake explosives brought their son along when they hijacked the Russian-built Tupelov 154 run by the mainland Sichuan Airlines to Taiwan on September 30 and asked for political asylum.
