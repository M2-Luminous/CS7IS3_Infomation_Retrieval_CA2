This was what President Bill Clinton stated positively at the recent Japan-U.S. summit talks. However, YOMIURI SHIMBUN's New York Bureau recently obtained a document that clearly indicates how the President decided on taking a hard line against Japan. The document entitled "Repairing the U.S.-Japan Relationship" was written by Glen S. Fukushima, vice chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry [of American businessmen] in Japan. Fukushima, who is currently head of the Comprehensive Policy Department of AT&T in Japan and a former USTR official in charge of Japanese affairs, is no stranger to the backstage activities of Japan-U.S. talks on such issues as rice and automobiles. The President himself read through the 12-page report, and wrote on it such comments as "worth reading," "to the point," and "needs to be discussed." Here and there in the document are underlined sections with a note stating "agree." Included in this report are an analysis of the current Japan-U.S. relationship, a frank criticism of the Clinton administration's policy toward Japan, and suggestions for future strategy in dealing with Japan. The report was handed to the president by Prof. Derek Shearer [name as published] of the Occidental University, who has been an intimate friend of the President since their student years. The President studied the report on 20 January. Reportedly, the copy of the report with the President's comments was returned to Fukushima through Prof. Shearer. At the same time, President Clinton gave instructions that copies of this report, bearing the initial "B (Bill)," should be distributed to 10 officials, including USTR Mickey Kantor, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury Undersecretary Roger Altman, and Anthony Lake, assistant to the President for national security affairs. What is noteworthy is that the so-called pro-Japanese group at the State Department, which oversees Japan-U.S. security issues, was excluded. The returned report indicates the President read it intensively. In particular, the comment "agree" was written in two places in the report. One place is where the report concludes it is "wrong" to say that "Japan will go down [shizumu]," a comment that has been conspicuous in recent news coverage. It continues by stating the "depression may last longer than expected," but "since the foundations of the Japanese economy are not impaired, it will be able to make a comeback as the strongest rival once again." The other place is where the report makes the following criticism: "In dealing with the issue of Japan's opening up of its market, the Clinton administration does not seem to understand when, where, and to what degree it should impose pressure to induce the maximum results while trying to keep Japanese indignation to the minimum." This portion is not only underlined but also marked "agree." There are as many as 15 portions underlined. For example, "An administration's failure to take any concrete action is regarded in Japan as weakness, not as tolerance," or "Even if the two countries reach an accord, problems are bound to arise in a couple of months because of interpretation of the language." In this way, the report also gives instructions that in the event that an accord is reached, Japanese and English vocabulary used in the accord should be clarified to Japanese and American reporters.
