Addressing a speech rally held in Beirut yesterday to mark the anniversary of the victory of the Islamic revolution in Iran, he referred to "imperialist moves to undermine the nation's steadfastness and force it to follow a new plan intended for the region." He enumerated "the Islamic Republic's achievements," noting that "it was able to increase the local product by 7.7 percent, while the average local product increase last year did not exceed 2 percent." He pointed out that the aim of "the imperialist campaign is to undermine Iran's stability and security through groups linked to it." Shaykh Na'im Qasim, Hizballah's deputy secretary general, spoke on the occasion and attacked the Lebanese Government, saying "we have seen nothing from it except harm to its people and to all Lebanon." He spoke of "the government's suppression of the press and the media because they talk about the head of that government or some of its members."
