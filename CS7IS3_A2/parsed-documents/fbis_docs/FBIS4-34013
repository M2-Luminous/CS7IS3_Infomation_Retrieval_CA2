The statment proposes that the topic be discussed within the OAS. The governments of the isthmus, who yesterday requested the island's democratization at the end of a regional summit in San Jose, are willing to meet with Cuban President Fidel Castro to ask him for political openness in Cuba, according to Figueres. Figueres also suggested that the Cuban case "be reviewed by the Inter-American system in bloc," and he noted that the Colombian president's assumption of the OAS Secretariat in August will be "an important ingredient" for the matter to be taken up by a strengthened and invigorated organization. This is not a case of creating obstacles but, rather, one in which the Central Americans want a peaceful solution to the Cuban situation, the Costa Rican president stated. Figueres added: "More and greater progress must be achieved in the areas of democratization, freedom of speech, religion, domestic and foreign association, and others to promote a climate of understanding." The Costa Rican president, who took office 8 May, said Cuba's situation is a legacy of the Cold War, adding that its resolution must mainly involve the various groups of Cubans. As an example of such a transition, he noted the case of the Central American countries "in which the securing of peace has been the fruit of concerted efforts and dialogue." In terms of Cuba's democratization, he said, all of the members of the island, without distinction, including the dissident groups abroad and those in the country, must participate. However, "any planned transition" must strengthen and secure "the revolutionary achievements in the areas of education, health, and housing," he said. Fidel Castro, who was the last president to arrive in Cartagena on Monday evening amid tight security, has again been the focus of attention of newsmen and chiefs of state attending the summit. Argentine President Carlos Menem, who at last year's summit requested Cuba's democratization, told EFE that this is "the wish" not only of his country, but of many Latin American countries. He also noted that "there is no problem" in meeting with Castro, if he wishes to meet or if the opportunity exists within the framework of the summit. The Cuban leader today surprised the summit participants by attending the opening ceremony wearing a guayabera shirt instead of the traditional olive drab uniform he has worn at previous summits.
