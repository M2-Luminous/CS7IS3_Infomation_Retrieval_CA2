The only thing Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine can do is to confirm unambiguously to Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton his republic's international commitments on nuclear disarmament and promise to submit again the START-I treaty for ratification by the new parliament. This statement was made to INTERFAX Wednesday by a senior Russian diplomat responsible for Russian-Ukrainian relations. He believes that the likely three-sided summit may present a good opportunity for Kravchuk to distance himself in public from the partial ratification of the treaty. The diplomat has said the United States promised to Ukraine financial aid worth $170 Mn as soon as the disarmament process begins. The Americans are practically-minded people. They will not give money to Ukraine for mere promises, he said.
