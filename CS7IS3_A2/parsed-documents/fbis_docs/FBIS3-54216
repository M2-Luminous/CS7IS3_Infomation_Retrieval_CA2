In his reply to the settlers' opposition to the principle of withdrawal from the Golan and the possibility of dismantling and evacuating the settlements there, Rabin proposed a general referendum to decide on the dispute over the future of the Golan. Clinton's promises and pledges to maintain Israel's military edge over the Arabs are not enough. All the guarantees and concessions that Hafiz al-Asad offers are not enough. Because the Jew, who has become an Israeli, does not look at his huge gains in land, security, and superiority, but raises media and political battles concerning the tiny issue of the land of others that he will relinquish after imposing too many conditions. The settlers do not feel secure about the future despite the U.S. proposals for deploying U.S. forces in a buffer zone in the Golan, in which U.S. military bases will shoulder the tasks of warning and security that are shouldered by the settlements at present. To the Jew, who is skilled in blackmail, the U.S. presence in the Golan is a gain for Washington, and Israeli military power, which was created through U.S. support, is also a gain to Washington and its Middle East policy. Therefore, the U.S. policy of giving orders that will be applied by Arab rulers engaged in the settlement does not suit the rulers in Tel Aviv or the Israeli settlers. According to U.S. plans for establishing a U.S. peace in the Middle East through Israeli-Arab agreements and through subjecting the rule of the Arab agents to the security, military, and economic needs of Washington, the Arab rulers should apply the U.S. orders. We have not heard from a ruler participating in the settlement any promise to conduct a referendum on reconciliation with Tel Aviv, on establishing normal relations with it and on relinquishing most of the land of Palestine and some nearby Arab territories. While we hear the enemy, which the colonialist West set up, speak about referendums on the fate of a land that does not belong to it, we do not hear Hafiz al-Asad asking the people of Syria about their opinion. This is because he knows well the Syrian people's opinion of their enemy, which is occupying some of their land and the whole of Palestine. Al-Asad also knows the opinion of the Syrian people on his regime, his personality, as well as his pan-Arab, international, and internal policies. The strangest thing is that Hafiz al-Asad is opposed to the idea of a referendum, about which Rabin spoke to his settlers. This is because to al-Asad, the subject is really about agreements between presidents, with which the Syrian people have nothing to do, despite the fact that the Syrian people are the owners of the land. By this premise, why should the Israelis have an opinion on this subject? This time we agree with Hafiz al-Asad's viewpoint. It is true that the Syrian people have nothing to do with al-Asad's agreements with Washington and Tel Aviv, because the Syrian people are innocent of these agreements and of al-Asad's signing of these agreements.
