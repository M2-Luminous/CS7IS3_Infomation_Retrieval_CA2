Velayati, here for the 11th session of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) ministerial meeting, made the remark in his address to the NAM session on te issue of disarmament. The issue of security assurances for non-nuclear weapon states is the second major point, Velayati said. The non-aligned countries should insist that the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) be finalized before the NPT review conference and that it should be comprehensive, verifiable, non-discriminatory and devoid of any exceptionalities. How to deal with the existing nuclear test sites also remains as an important task, he said. In this respect, added Velayati, the non-aligned countries also welcome the decision of the [UN] General Assembly to start negotiations on a treaty banning the production of fissile materials for weapon purpose. On the chemical weapons convention, he said that the non-aligned members of the Chemical Weapon Convention (CWC) need to consolidate their efforts to make certain that their views and positions on issues ranging from definition of chemical weapons and modalities of challenge inspection to the problem of technological assistance and peaceful use as well as their fair share in the organisation are met before ratification and entering into force of the convention. As for biological weaapons, Velayati said that what may be at stake is the health requirements of the developing countries as significant parts of the pharmaceutical industry, including serum and vaccine production, will be affected by discussions due to take place at the special conference in September this year. Touching on the issue of transparency in armament, the Iranian foreign minister said debate continues on the scope and expansion of the register. "It is realized that regional arrangements is an essential ingredient for a complete register and, therefore, for the success of transparency in armament. This may also open the way for the reduction of conventional weapons both at regional and global levels to the eventual point of ensuring only the minimum security requirements of each state."
