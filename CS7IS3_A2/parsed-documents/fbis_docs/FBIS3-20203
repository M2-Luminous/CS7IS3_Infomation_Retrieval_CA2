(1) -- A New Snag in Relations"] [Text] Washington -- Turkish-U.S. relations are entering a difficult period. Many people in Turkey are not aware of this, but one must not be surprised if a crisis erupts in the near future. The reason for this trend -- the signs of which can be seen much more clearly here -- is simply the Kurdish problem. Until now, only Europe raised its voice with regard to this issue. Reactions, recommendations, and criticism concerning this matter also emanated from Europe. The United States did not display much interest or sensitivity. For some time now, the situation in the southeast, its terrorism and other aspects, have been creeping onto the U.S. agenda as well. Especially since the recent incident involving DEP [Democracy Party] deputies, this issue has begun attracting attention here in Washington. This subject is debated in the U.S. Congress; it is discussed at various think tanks as well as academic institutions; and it is appraised by the press. Naturally, all the Clinton administration services concerning the region are following the developments very closely. Officials from the State and Defense Departments are openly voicing their displeasure and concern. In the past, there were a few issues that cast a shadow over Turkish-U.S. relations, such as the Cyprus and Armenian issues. These are now in the past. One can now observe an increasing awareness of the Kurdish problem. There are two reasons for this. First, the issue has assumed serious proportions in Turkey. Second, a team that is sensitive to human rights issues is currently in power in Washington. These two factors complement one another. If the Democrats were not in power, the course of events would still have triggered reaction in Washington. The subject would still have been discussed in the Congress, at think tanks, and by the press. In this case, however, the administration does not hesitate to react. Not because it does not attach importance to Turkey; and certainly not because it wishes to destabilize or weaken Turkey. It is necessary to diagnose the U.S. stand without blindly creating anti-American feelings and to reach the appropriate conclusions. Let us realize that this topic will be discussed more and more extensively in the United States in the coming weeks and months. Let us also be prepared for developments that may not please us so much. The issue will be the subject of criticism and even threats during the debate in Congress on the aid package for Turkey. Various activist groups will embrace the subject. Mrs. Danielle Mitterrand will soon arrive in the United States to engage in lobbying activities. Influential U.S. newspapers will follow the developments more closely. A debate conducted in Congress a few days ago was an indication of the new winds that have begun to blow in Washington. Lee Hamilton, chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Subcommittee, expressed his displeasure over the events in Turkey in reference to the DEP issue and asked for explanations from Stephan Oxman, U.S. undersecretary of state who had just returned from contacts in Ankara. Some of Oxman's remarks clarified the administration's new stand and views. Let met cite a few examples of Oxman's responses to Hamilton's questions: "We support Turkey against the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan], but at every opportunity we advocated a nonmilitary solution... There are many more things Turkey should do (toward a political solution)... We value Turkey as an ally, but we also say that this problem cannot be resolved only through military methods... Unfortunately, DEP members were punished for expressing their views. This is a very disturbing development... This gives the people the message that there is no alternative other than to join the PKK." During the same session, Hamilton also directed questions at D. Johnson of the Defense Department: Is Turkey using the equipment sent to Turkey within the framework of the supplementary U.S. military aid? Response: " It is using the Cobra". What is the total amount of this aid? "$121.6 million". Pointing out that he is not satisfied with these answers, Hamilton asked to be supplied with all the details. Maybe he will want to introduce the condition that this aid not be used in the southeast in the future. Yes, it is possible that the Clinton administration will attach certain conditions and restrictions to the $453 million military aid (in the form of loans) and $100 million economic aid (in the form of a grant) as well as to the supplementary weapons and equipment program envisaged for the coming fiscal year. In other words, at this rate, Washington could warn Turkey not to use this equipment in the southeast.
