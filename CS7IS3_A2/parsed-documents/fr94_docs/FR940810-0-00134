FR940810-0-00134 FR940810-0-00021 The record supports the need for on-site supervision of setting up of controls. Chip D'Angelo, when asked what were his major concern about glove bags, testified that ``Just the act of attaching *␣*␣* concerns us *␣*␣* a lot of times the material is so overly dry and very loose *␣*␣* simply attaching the bag can create some problems *␣*␣* Removing the bag, if not done properly and evacuated properly and twisted properly, actually expels fibers out into the air'' (Tr. 3126). For example, he/she must be present when a glove bag is attached and determine that a smoke test is passed and again be present when the bag is removed. It is not necessary that the competent person continually watch the operation, rather that he oversees its proper completion. OSHA has not specified the ratio of on-site supervisors to abatement workers. Mr. Booher of Exxon Company, testified that ``if you have three glove bag operations going on next to one another, in close proximity to one another, that one competent person can handle up to three jobs effectively'' (Tr. 2677). The Agency believes that various operations need closer supervision than others; the exposure assessment should clarify how close supervision needs to be. So long as the specific activities in the standard requiring inspection are covered, the extent of the required inspections are up to the judgment of the ``competent person.'' Training for the competent person is the same for those who supervise Class I and II asbestos work under the standard. The training must be obtained in a course which is the equivalent of the EPA supervisor course. Unlike the training requirements for workers for Class II jobs which may concentrate on a particular kind of material if that is the only asbestos work which an employee does, the ``competent person'' supervising Class II jobs must be trained comprehensively in all aspects of asbestos related construction work. Thus, for example, a flooring removal supervisor must be informed about all asbestos removal control methods: this is the person who must evaluate a prospective job to assure that the PELs will not be exceeded, who must choose among available controls to reduce exposures, and must know how to supervise extensive control systems if they are needed for high exposure Class II work. The training requirements of persons supervising Class III work are different. Most Class III work is maintaining or renovating building components. Supervisors of such work need not be trained in methods of abating asbestos material on a large scale. The EPA asbestos in schools rules, now updated to encompass commercial and public buildings requires that maintenance workers in asbestos-containing buildings be trained in a 16-hour course which includes; proper asbestos-related work practices, waste handling and disposal, respirator use, decontamination procedures, and the content of applicable Federal, state and local asbestos regulations. All Class III workers and their supervisors must take such a course, which covers all control measures required for Class III work. In this regard OSHA notes comments which stated that training supervisors of plumbers, pipefitters, and sheet metal workers, who are engaged in projects of incidental removal that are small scale and short term, in full enclosure techniques is wasteful (see e.g. Ex. 7&hyph;151, 152, 153). Although the formal training for supervisors and workers in Class III work is the same, additional criteria for ``competency'' contained in the general construction standard distinguish worker and supervisor on all asbestos jobs, including Class III. Thus, the ``competent person'' must be ``capable of identifying existing and predictable hazards *␣*␣* which are *␣*␣* hazardous to employees, and (have) authorization to take prompt corrective measures to eliminate them'' (29 CFR 1926.32(f)). Also, the ``competent person'' must be designated by the employer (29 CFR 1926.20(b)(2)). OSHA notes that the ``competency'' of the competent person is independent of the training required. ``Competency'' as well as training is required. Thus, a ``competent person'' is not merely someone with a specified level of training but connotes a high level of knowledge of worksite safety and health issues as well. The need for a high degree of expertise for Class III work was acknowledged by labor representatives. (See ACCSH reference in the proposal at 55 FR 29727, and R. Gobbell's testimony (Tr. 4318). Employer representatives questioned the need for this uniform training requirements for competent persons supervising all asbestos work, but also acknowledged that supervisors of maintenance projects needed training in the control methods required (See e.g.Ex. 7&hyph;151, 7&hyph;152, 153); others stated that in-house training was often superior to EPA's (see e.g. Amoco Corporation, Ex. 7&hyph;37); and that trained competent persons should be allowed to train other workers (Gulf Power Company, Ex. 7&hyph;50). OSHA is allowing in-house training so long as it meets the criteria for curriculum, length, and method of training contained in the standard. Training for ``competent persons'' for Class IV work depends on when that work is performed. When Class IV workers perform their duties in facilities and buildings where no other asbestos work is taking place, the ``competent person'' supervising them must be trained in an EPA accredited course on operations and maintenance workers or its equivalent, much as for Class III work. If clean-up work is done within a regulated area, supervision of the clean-up must be conducted by the ``competent person'' who is supervising the asbestos job for which the area was established, which in most cases will be Class I and II work.
