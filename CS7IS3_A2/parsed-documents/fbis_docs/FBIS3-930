This was the message from IFP Central Committee member Walter Felgate, following renewed optimism that the party might contest the April poll. On Monday, senior IFP negotiator Ben Ngubane said the IFP had yet to decide on participation in the country's first all-race poll. "Far from being out of the elections, Inkatha has yet to decide on participation," Dr Ngubane reportedly said in Kimberley on Monday. But Mr Felgate said Dr Ngubane's statement was no different to the IFP's official stance on elections: "There's no change in the IFP's position. I don't know why there is confusion. The position of the IFP is unless the December 19 (Freedom Alliance) amendments to the constitution are accepted, we will not enter elections. Talks on mediation are under way and if mediation results in changes to the constitution, then I believe it will be in the national interest to ensure timetables are adjusted." He said talks between the IFP and African National Congress on mediation would continue on Wednesday. Mr Felgate added that the IFP would "most certainly not" submit a candidate list by Wednesday's 4.30PM deadline. IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi also said in Kimberley on Monday that his party was serious about contesting elections, but not before its constitutional demands were met. "We are not prepared to commit ourselves to fighting the election until the ANC makes a sincere commitment to address our demands," he said. On the printing of ballot papers without the IFP's name, Inkatha MP Farouk Cassim said on Tuesday: "There's no good reason why they couldn't keep this open. They can't exclude us knowing mediation is taking place. We don't see the time limits as more important than a solution. Any artificial time limits can have very negative results for the country. When we are so close, we should go that extra half a metre," he said. Mr Cassim said mediation on constitutional disputes was imminent and progress was being made on the Zulu king's demands, which the IFP has also said must be resolved. Meanwhile, IFP national spokesman Ziba Jiyane said he believed the IFP was "out" of the April elections. "It does seem like we are not participating," he said on Tuesday. On speculation he might leave the IFP for another party contesting the poll, he replied: "Nothing could be further from the truth."
