Panic even has begun to loom: A rupture in American-Russian relations is said to be inevitable. The development of events has indeed taken a dangerous turn. James Morrris, counselor at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow (he is a representative of the CIA, don't be surprised -- Moscow and Washington have reached an accord whereby they don't keep secret who the chief representatives of their special services are) has been officially declared persona non grata. But why actually has such a furor been created? Have Russia and the United States really reached an accord that the two sides stop intelligence activity? Nothing of the kind. Moreover, the calls to intensify such activity in relation to Russia and to give it priority status are growing in Congress. Nor does the Russian Federation Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS] hide the fact that it too is engaged in such work -- not with the aim of undermining the United States (the political intelligence service is scarcely up to that) but out of a desire to learn what the trends are on the banks of the Potomac, who wants Russia to fall apart and who wants it to remain intact, and who is trying to play the Ukrainian or other cards. For its part, the United States takes an interest in what is being done in our country and which parties and forces are seeking power. The Americans advance the argument that the Ames' presence in the CIA has undermined U.S. security. Excuse me, but, given that Aldrich was recruiting agents in Russia, whose security is actually at stake here? However, once the "case" of the Ames couple had blown up it immediately began to retreat into the background. Something quite different began to predominate. Unhappy that Russia had taken the initiative in resolving the Bosnian crisis, some people began grumbling: Look, the Russian bear is awaking again. At the same time a broad hint was dropped: The United States is a country which has not just special commitments but also special rights in the world. And Russia meanwhile should not conduct intelligence activity in the States, it should not engage in intelligence at all. In general, as you can see, we have back-to-front logic here. True, you do also hear in the United States the voices of people like, for example, ex-CIA Director William Colby, who take a realistic and sensible line. But the problem is that they are immediately put down for allegedly acting unpatriotically. Clearly, the position of those people in the United States ready to blame the Clinton administration for having recklessly and naively expanded relations with Russia is strengthening. Now the "case" of the Ames couple has become known it is necessary to correct the mistakes made, that is to say, call a time-out in relations with Russia. It is essential to take a closer look at what is happening over there. Being gentlemen, Russian intelligence officers appreciate that the CIA (professional solidarity is no doubt in play here) is now experiencing a psychological trauma, being under strong pressure from the FBI, the legislative bodies, and, finally, the taxpayers (we pay our money in and it then ends up in the pockets of traitors). Preserving a sense of tact, CIA Director James Woolsey is seeking not to fuel the situation. But certain circles in the United States are very persistent and are inclined perhaps to revive elements characteristic of the period of confrontation and to shift purely professional questions (the questions of the special services) into the sphere of state relations. The Russian FIS rejects any gloating whatsoever over the situation in which CIA staffers find themselves and is ready to engage in dialogue and discussion on these painful issues. It is no secret that there is a lot the Americans don't like about current practice, but their Russian counterparts have their own complaints too. It is well known, in particular, that the bugging of Russian Federation representatives has not stopped. V. Bakatin handed over important documents to the American side, but nothing has been received in return to date. The intensive recruiting of Russian citizens by the U.S. special services also disturbs Moscow. In short, both the Russian FIS and the CIA favor cooperation, but cooperation with necessary consideration of national interests. They favor cooperation on an equal footing. This has to be a two-way street. Any other approach is tantamount to requiring the other side to surrender its position while allegedly on a level playing field.
