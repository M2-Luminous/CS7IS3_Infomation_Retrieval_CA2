FR941213-0-00053 FR941213-0-00010 VIII. Paperwork Reduction Act Section 482.43 of this rule contains information collection requirements that are subject to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3504, et seq. ). The reporting burden for the collections of information in ยง482.43 is comparable to the burden for ยง482.21(b), which it replaces (and which is currently approved under OMB approval number 0938&hyph;0328). IX. Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking The Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requires us to publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register and afford prior public comment on proposed rules. Such notice includes a statement of the time, place and nature of rulemaking proceedings, reference to the legal authority under which the rule is proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved. However, this requirement does not apply when the agency finds good cause that such a notice and comment procedure is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest, and incorporates its reasons in the rules issued. We have in this final rule published our intent to conform our requirements on medical director qualifications to those of section 6025 of Public Law 101&hyph;239 and to change the name of an accrediting program. Since this final rule merely conforms our regulations regarding medical director qualifications to the statute without interpretation, and the change of name of an accrediting program only amends the regulations to reflect the new name, we believe it to be unnecessary and not in the public interest to publish a proposed rule to obtain public comment.
