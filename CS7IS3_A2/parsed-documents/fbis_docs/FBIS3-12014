With full awareness, I accept this responsibility that the president has entrusted upon me in the full exercise of his powers. According to our juridical system, the president is the only person who may grant such a responsibility. Due to the seriousness of the action, everyone is aware of the importance of the task ahead. In order to comply with this delicate mission, I will act with an open mind, in a firm and serene manner. I will respond to those who have appointed me so that the law will be the main protection of society and the main instrument of justice. As you will recall on the afternoon that the president announced his decision, he explained he was doing this at the specific request of Mrs. Diana Laura Riojas de Colosio [Luis Donaldo Colosio's widow], among other reasons. In fact, Mrs. Riojas de Colosio called me directly and honored me with her confidence. I am aware of the magnitude of the investigation that has been entrusted to me. My public commitment is with the truth. My method of work will strictly adhere to the juridical norms and the scientific techniques of an investigation that will lead us to solve a murder. I am calling on the most distinguished Mexicans from the various areas that will be required for this task. I have designed a strict method of selection that will be applied indiscriminately to all those who will form part of the investigating team. I am demanding they present their resumes in order to analyze them. In the absence of even one requirement from those we feel are indispensable, they will be excluded. This method includes everyone, from the directors general to -- and with much more reason -- to the administrative staff, and -- of course -- the technical staff. In due time, we will announce the resumes of the team members who form part of this Office of the Deputy Attorney General. The action of justice which allowed the immediate arrest of the perpetrator of the homicide as well as the profuse testimonies and other sources of information relevant to this case, make it possible for me to begin my work with an important database. As for the investigative matters, we are absolutely autonomous. The investigation process is the exclusive responsibility of this Office of the Deputy Attorney General, with no other limits but those established by the law. All investigations of this type have their own dynamics and strict logic. I share the widespread concern for this to be carried out as soon as possible. I will seek through means established by law, new useful information. I ask anyone who has any information that can contribute to clearing up this event to make it known to me. I accept the people's demand to speed up these investigations, however, the very nature of the investigation determines that it not be subjected to a fixed timetable. Neither in Mexico, nor anywhere in the world, should deadlines be set to conclude an investigation. It will last however long is necessary; we will strive for it to be brief. We will investigate and analyze all the possible hypotheses, even the smallest. We will try to report on the progress because we know that the Mexican people are waiting for this. An important part of this public responsibility's success depends on the fact that anticipated conclusions or versions are not generated without foundations. I know how to remain calm. My tool is my attachment to the truth and the law. We must be very careful not to distort the investigation's goal. I will also ask everyone to be calm and objective in the handling of this case, which has significant consequences for the nation. The investigation cannot be subjected to foreign pressures, only to its logical and natural development. Every clue followed up, every witness' deposition, every piece of information received, can open multiple roads to follow. On several occasions, information has been made public that has led to inaccurate or mistaken conclusions. I will request from the media their support and responsibility so that the conclusions reached on the event be duly founded on the event. I am certain the media will responsibly report corroborated facts. To help them report, we will of course design a method so that periodically and officially they receive news on the work being carried out. We will never give out information that can hamper the ongoing investigation. Nevertheless, we will always make public whatever we have fully corroborated and which, I insist, will not hamper the ongoing investigation, or the honor, or reputation of innocent parties. I feel the first moral duty is not to contribute to uncertainty with reports lacking precision that only foster an environment contrary to the spirit of truth and justice. This spirit is the superior demand undoubtedly expressed by all Mexicans at this time. As of tomorrow I will be in Tijuana to personally take over this task the majority of leads and data to be substantiated are located there. I will conduct the investigation to the end with responsibility and without prejudice. Mexican society demands that this crime not remain unpunished. Mexican society will have the truth on the incident. I will establish responsible coordination and cooperation with the Baja California authorities. I will remain totally open to any cooperation; I reiterate, from the public and the media. I stress that the very sensitive nature of the case forces all of us to act responsibly and ethically. I understand I am assuming an immense commitment to the nation; I will contribute with all my capacity. I conclude by saying once again that my commitment is only with the truth, so that out of the truth and only from the truth can justice be made. Thank you very much.
