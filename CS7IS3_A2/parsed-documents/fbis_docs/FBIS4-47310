V. Barabin, V. I. Vershinin, V. G. Yelyushkin, L. I. Yablonskiy; UDC 528.711.18:[681.3:516] [Abstract] Automated terrain analysis requires reliable detailed information on the spatial position and relative heights of objects in digital form. Currently, this is done with photogrammetric processing of stereoscopic large-scale aerial photographs. This, however, is slow. A computer method of creating digital terrain models has been developed which uses individual large-scale space and aerial photographs, digital topographical maps, or large-scale topographical maps. The system uses an IBM-AT PC with a half-tone scanner. Single-exposure, panoramic, and infrared aerospace images may be used. The article examines the following steps in the process: preparatory work; photo scanning with a half-tone scanner; formation of a digital relief matrix; acquisition of the coordinates of reference points in the coordinate systems of the photo and the terrain; photographic resection; photo digitizing; photographic intersection; determination of the relative heights of objects; and formation of the digital terrain model. The resultant models are highly accurate, detailed, and reliable. References 3 (Russian).
