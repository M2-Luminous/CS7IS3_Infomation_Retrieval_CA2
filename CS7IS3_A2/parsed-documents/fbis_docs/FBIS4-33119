FBIS4-33119 "drlat106_m_94011" FBIS-LAT-94-106 Daily Report 4 May 1994 Brazil Report Details 1989 PT, Leftist Activities Report Details 1989 PT, Leftist Activities 94SM0352A Sao Paulo ISTOE in Portuguese 4 May 94 pp 20-23 94SM0352A Sao Paulo ISTOE Portuguese CSO [Article by Otto Sarkis and Luiz Antonio Novaes] [Text] During the 1989 presidential campaign, five of the government's intelligence organs were mobilized to keep tabs on Brazil Popular Front candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva. The spies focused especially closely on the most radical groups within the PT [Workers Party]. Coordinated by the SNI [National Intelligence Service] and in cooperation with the secret police services of Argentina, Israel, and England, agents were infiltrated into organizations that had a history of activity in the armed struggle. They kept Planalto Palace supplied with the documents prepared during the campaign. The results of the investigation are found in 154 pages of reports produced by the Alfa 1 Working Group, or GT-A1 as it was known in the business, and obtained by ISTOE on an exclusive basis. In eight months, the SNI listed 17 radical factions housed within the PT, studied the modus operandi of 21 leftist organizations in Latin America, and identified, among 300 militants, 97 Brazilians who had studied guerrilla warfare in foreign countries. The documents prepared by the group state the target of the operation, the working rules to be observed by the information analysts, the minutes of the meetings, their final conclusions, and--frequently--refer to internal flaws in the official intelligence system. Begun in March 1989, the spying in the PT was intended to detect the potential for emergence of an armed movement that would seize power in Brazil. On 10 November [1989], five days prior to the first round of voting, the "brain" of the Brazilian espionage effort concluded that although the party was respecting the rules of democracy, the ideological base of the PT was still "orthodox Marxist," founded on the class struggle. The only reason Lula did not win the support of some people in the top echelon of the government in the runoff election was that the SNI found that he was hostage to radical schools of thought. President Jose Sarney and his minister/chief of the SNI, Ivan de Souza Mendes, were personally at odds with Fernando Collor, who had called the former "corrupt" and Planalto Palace a "den of thieves." The task of collecting and analyzing the information for the GT-A1 was an important factor in the decision by Sarney, General Ivan, and other Planalto aides to cast blank ballots. Other participants in the investigation besides the SNI were the Intelligence Centers of the Army (CIE), the Navy (CIM), the Air Force (Secint), and the Federal Police's DOPS [Department of Political and Social Order], which was then headed by Chief Amaury Galdino, later the Federal Police director during the Collor administration. After obtaining the reports, ISTOE contacted five high officials in the intelligence community. On Wednesday 27 April, we located the coordinator of the entire operation, Colonel Jose Luis Savio Costa (Reserve), who was then an advisor to the SNI's Central Agency, headed by General Freitas Almeida. Costa confirmed the authenticity of the documents and agreed to talk with this magazine provided that the names of three other SNI agents who worked on the operation were not revealed. Two of them are still in the Intelligence Undersecretariat of the SAE [Strategic Affairs Secretariat], an office linked to the Presidency of the Republic that absorbed what was left of the SNI. On Thursday, 28 April [1994], Galdino told ISTOE that he had attended the first meeting of the five Alfa groups--one from each organ--at which three agents from SIDE [Secretariat for State Intelligence], the Argentina secret police, were also present. The Alfa groups were initially set up to monitor the risk that disturbances might break out in Brazil similar to the La Tablada armed uprising in Argentina on 22 January 1989, or the Caracazo, the popular revolt that occurred in Venezuela that same year. The SIDE agents alerted the Brazilian intelligence community to the possibility that La Tablada had been planned in the zone along the border between the two countries. Two Brazilian sisters had participated in the invasion of the Argentine barracks: Aldira and Celia Pereira Nunes. Aldira died. The Argentines suspected that terrorist Henrique Haroldo Gorriarah Merlo, aka "El Pelado," was behind the attack. He was thought to have masterminded the assassination of Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza in September 1980, in Asuncion, Paraguay. According to the SNI investigation, El Pelado had made several visits to Praia Grande, on the Sao Paulo coast, between 1968 and 1975. In 1983, he was shadowed in Sao Paulo by Brazilian agents. Besides the Argentine terrorist, a Brazilian--Expedito Carvalho, aka "Paolo Parra"--had been named as one of the leaders of La Tablada. The reports obtained by ISTOE do not mention those two individuals, since Operation Alfa ultimately expanded to become a meticulous analysis of the groups on the Left, both legal and clandestine, in Brazil. There are, however, references to three other investigations undertaken by the SNI that involved monitoring two terrorists--the "Gringo," "Goiabada," and "Acapulco" operations. The "revolutionary movements" in Latin America, mainly those of Colombia, Peru, Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, Venezuela, and El Salvador, were analyzed, as were their ties to the Brazilian Left. At that point in time, according to the SNI, the Latin leftists were coordinated by cells established in Nicaragua, Cuba, or Libya. "By then, talking about armed struggle was a thing of the past," Admiral Mario Cesar Flores, now the minister/chief of the Strategic Affairs Secretariat said on Wednesday the 27th. "That's over with. People are no longer being followed around in Brazil for ideological reasons," Flores said. After setting out the rules governing the work routine of the GT's [Working Groups] in a document dated 30 March [year not given] entitled "Analysis of the National Trend (Political Violence)," in which the obtaining of the Argentine information is reported and the British and Israelis are asked to mobilize, the SNI produced, on 18 April [year not given], its first document on the Brazilian "revolutionary Lefts." They are described as more "prudent" organizations--but still fully captive to the "possibility of the eclosion of the armed struggle." All the documents are written in typical leftist language and that report, for example, studies the existence of the "objective and subjective conditions for revolution." Col. Savio Costa was considered at Planalto Palace as one of the SNI's most well-versed specialists in Marxist theory. Among his recommendations are requests for surveillance of the student movement, the Progressive Church, the actions of labor unions, and the news reporters in the press. In analyzing the possibility that a "charismatic leader" might foster conditions favorable to a "union of the Lefts" and the "armed movement," the SNI is referring indirectly to Lula. It asks that leaders who have that potential be monitored not only in the "political arena" but also in their personal lives. Another factor uniting the Lefts was the activity of the radical Right. The UDR [Rural Democratic Union] was also closely watched by the SNI. The Alfa GT listed the following leftist organizations as priority targets of surveillance: the PCBR [Brazilian Revolutionary Communist Party], the PRC [Communist Revolutionary Party], the ALP [expansion not given], the PLP [Progressive Liberal Party], the MCR [Revolutionary Communist Movement], the PRO [expansion not given]--all given top priority. Assigned secondary priority were the Trotskyite organizations CS, ORMD-S, OQI, COT-QI, COT-PT [expansions not given], PORT-P [Revolutionary Workers Party-Trotskyite Faction] and PRT do B [expansion not given]. The PCdoB [Communist Party of Brazil] and the MR-8 [8 October Revolutionary Movement] (neither allied with nor housed in the PT) ranked third in priority. The PCB [Brazilian Communist Party] came last. The 21 leftist organizations in South America, most of them Argentine, were always selected with an eye to their connections with alleged Cuban or Nicaraguan commandos and their possible links to Brazilians. Cuban, Nicaraguan, and Libyan diplomats were also kept under surveillance. The efficiency of the SNI, capable of listing 97 Brazilians who had taken courses in guerrilla warfare in foreign countries, was only relative. The agency was only able to locate 71 of this contingent in Brazil--26 were still unaccounted for. On 25 September [year not given, photo accompanying article suggests it was 1989], a periodic report expressed regret, for example, that the lack of systematic studies and the absence of a documentation at the Central Agency made it impossible to locate Jose Luiz Del Royo, described as an ex-militant in the ALN [National Liberating Alliance]. The militant not found by the government spies was located by ISTOE on Thursday the 28th [1994]. Now shuttling between Milan and Sao Paulo, Del Royo is a writer and historian. He returned to Brazil in 1979 under the amnesty, and since then has been publicly active, representing Italian social studies institutes. He voted in all the elections and holds a passport. In 1986, he wrote the book Historias do Primeiro de Maio [Stories from May 1], which received plenty of attention in the press. "Now we discover that the intelligence service was working in our favor," Del Royo said, sarcastically. According to him, the DOPS has accurate information on his activities in Brazil. "That means they didn't even cross-check the data," he concluded. In 1982, Del Royo launched a magazine, Memoria da Historia [Memoirs of History], in Brazil. His name appeared on the masthead of four published issues. The SNI catalogued that magazine. According to the regulations governing the work of each analyst, the coordinator of the Alfa GT ordered them to meet daily. On Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday afternoons the GT-A1 met to read through documents and reassess previous studies to update the information. Thursdays were reserved for evaluations of political developments. Periodically, the Alfa GT's met to exchange experiences. The first meeting of this kind was held on 10 and 11 May [year not given, presumed to be 1989], and the work continued until Collor's inauguration in March 1990. In another document, of 15 pages, the SNI made a study of the educational and training background of former militants of the Left and their influence on the new members. The organ assessed the various factors that led these militants to get involved in the armed movements starting in 1964. In 1989, the SNI perceived that those militants were more influential and more careful: "So, they had progressed from the impetuousness of adolescence to maturity and, although not as vigorous physically, had gained greater cultural and political leverage." [Box p 21] "There Have Always Been Moles"--The Boss of the Spies Talks About His Work The coordinator-general of the spying operation against the PT and its radical factions, Col. Jose Luis Savio Costa, 61, who recently underwent a triple bypass, subscribes to official party publications and buys books on Marxism. Currently he is reading Jurgen Habermas's Necessidade de Revisao da Esquerda and Anatomia da Esquerda Universal, by Ferenc Feher and Agnes Heller [original titles not given]. In the reserve since 1990, married, four children and five grandchildren, he is setting up a property security company in Brasilia. Following are highlights from the interview he gave ISTOE at his home. [ISTOE] Do you know whether the intelligence organs still have undercover agents in the PT? [Savio] There will always be infiltrators whenever you have a radical group, provided the service is an intelligence service. People were not planted in the PT, but in the illegal organizations that existed within the PT. We had people in the PCBR, the old ALN, in the MRC, the PRC--organizations that had blended into the factions in the PT. [ISTOE] And what is the situation now? [Savio] I am out of that so I don't know, but if some agency thinks a party is capable of putting the democratic state at risk, it will inevitably try to infiltrate that party. I think that right now, the Causa Operaria [Workers' Cause] is an illegal party. It was expelled from the PT and is acting without recognition. There may be some "moles" in Causa, but it is a very closed group, one with tight security because it is small. [ISTOE] Did the SNI infiltrate people into the Sixth National Meeting of the PT, in 1988, the last one of your era? How did it do so? [Savio] Yes, by issuing them credentials as if they were state representatives. [ISTOE] And now, do you think there were "plants" at the Ninth meeting? [Savio] There is no need now, everything is open. [ISTOE] Were the PCB and PCdoB also infiltrated in 1989? [Savio] Traditionally the PCdoB was infiltrated. [ISTOE] And now? [Savio] Now there are friendships between former members of the enforcement agencies and the subversives. They talk about ideology. [ISTOE] Is there any way for the intelligence organs to go back to the former "moles" and get them to spy on the Left? [Savio] They know there are plenty of shameless moles out there. That has always been true. [ISTOE] Does the SAE have that list of moles? [Savio] I don't know, the SAE did not inherit all the SNI's material. A lot of things were neutralized during the transition. A lot of people, disgusted with the way things were done, ruined the documents so they could not be used. [ISTOE] In your opinion, is the PT still a revolutionary party? [Savio] It is not I, but the PT's own documents, that say so. The party is based on the class struggle and it wants to achieve as nonviolent an institutional breakdown as possible. [ISTOE] Does the PT pose a threat to democracy? [Savio] I am not afraid of the PT, but of its radical factions. My greatest fear is that the election campaign will become hardened, so that the radical groups that thought they saw victory at hand might then lose hope and start doing things that threaten the institutional order. [ISTOE] If you were in the SNI, would you suggest that a group shadow the PT? [Savio] There should be a group that would monitor the election situation for signs of potential political violence and take action to prevent evolution of the problem. [ISTOE] Do you think such a group is being readied? [Savio] I don't know. The suspicion that hangs over the intelligence organs is preventing them from acting. That was set up, a campaign that turned out right [sentence as published]. Despite that, Jose Dirceu (a federal deputy and PT candidate for governor of Sao Paulo) is interested, excessively interested, in intelligence and is capable of organizing a system for the PT. [ISTOE] Do you think the PT has a functioning SNI of its own? [Savio] I think there are a lot of PT spooks [petepongas] out there. [Box pp 22-23] Spooks in the Backlands--The Service That Did Not Predict Its End Now Works on Droughts Except for the building and the idiosyncrasies typical of any intelligence service, such as a mania for security, little or nothing remains of the old SNI. In its heyday, the "Service," as it was called by insiders, had as many as 3,000 employees in Brazil and other countries. Unable to anticipate the full impact of Fernando Collor's resentment of its activities, the SNI was taken by surprise when the "hunter of maharajahs" abolished it in March 1990 and created the Strategic Affairs Secretariat (SAE). Collor blamed the spooks of the secret service for the abduction, accompanied by a mock execution by firing squad, of which he had supposedly been the victim during his student days at the University of Brasilia. The implosion of the SNI reduced its personnel to a little more than 1,400 employees. The overseas agents were deactivated, and illegal and covert operations such as telephone-tapping ended officially. That does not mean the Intelligence Undersecretariat of the SAE, which inherited the estate of the SNI, might not sometimes resort to "bugging" someone's telephone. To do so, however, it needs court permission. The SAE does not even know what happened to the SNI files, many of them destroyed by agents who were unhappy with the change. This is admitted by Col. Savio Costa himself, one of those affected by Collor's purge. By its very nature, the "Service" continues to eavesdrop on events it thinks the President of the Republic should know about: strikes, rural unrest, and "more prosaic things," as SAE chief Admiral Mario Cesar Flores said. An example of the latter would probably be the survey made last year of the drought in the Northeast, to guide the government in selecting the cities to be given priority in federal aid. Furthermore, the Intelligence Undersecretariat is no longer headed by senior military officers, as it was even during the Collor administration. Part of the folklore is the anecdote about former SAE Secretary Pedro Paulo Leoni Ramos's attempt to visit the facilities of the undersecretariat. He was barred from entering by the spooks on duty at the building in Brasilia's South Police Sector. Now the undersecretariat is headed by journalist Afonso Antonio Marcondes, who never practiced the profession for which he studied. Instead, he has been a career employee since SNI days. Security is still strict. The Intelligence Undersecretariat has a sophisticated system that includes locks with electronic codes. Outsiders, when they visit the building, are escorted at all times by agents. The site of the former National Intelligence School now houses the Center for Basic and Advanced Human Resources Training (Cefahr), used by the undersecretariat for courses in international espionage and counter-espionage aimed mainly at protecting scientific and technological projects. At the end of the year, the government plans to sponsor the first open competition in the "sector" to recruit 60 new analysts.
