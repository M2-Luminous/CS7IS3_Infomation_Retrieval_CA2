At the meeting, the two sides stressed the need to seriously honour the provisional agreement which was signed (by Vietnam and China) on Nov. 7, 1991, control the border area basing on the status quo at the time of signing the above-said agreement without any artificial actions made in order to change the border situation, promote the opening of the official border gates agreed by the two sides and try to restore order and law in trading and travelling across the common border. Regarding problems happening in the border area, both sides had the same view that the local authorities and offices concerned of Vietnam and China should meet for peaceful negotiations to settle them properly and at the same time report them to their respective governments. The two sides agreed to extend the provisional agreement for another two years. On Jan. 15, the Vietnamese expert delegation was received by Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan.
