The announcement by Dacom kicks off a race for a market share among foreign and domestic equipment makers, as all major carriers are scurrying to tap the latest market service, known collectively as wireless data transfer. The idea of wireless data transfer is to use radio waves to free traveling executives and other people on the go from having to plug laptop computers and other data devices into telephone lines. "This marks our major initiative in the wireless data market as we expect a three-way race with Korea Mobile Telecom and Korea Telecom," said Dacom spokesman Yi Song-ki. Dacom is installing base stations, or radio transmitters, to launch the trial service in a 5-km radius area around its Yongsan headquarters in Seoul by August. It plans another trial service in Taedok Science Town near Taejon. Dacom's system, modeled after the Modacom service of Germany's Deutsche Bundes Post-Telecom, uses a wireless packet-switched messaging technique. A tall powerful radio transmitter sends data in short bursts known as packets. Each packet holds about three- quarters of a page of text (about 128 English words). Longer transmissions are broken up and reassembled at the receiving end. "The real advantage of our system is that we can rapidly establish a nationwide network through connections to our existing (wired packet-switched) Dacom Network Service," said Yi Un-tae, a manager at Dacom's technology development department. "It will allow business people carrying easy-to-use wireless devices to move into new, unexpected places," he said. Dacom expects to offer a commercial service by the latter half of next year. Just as Dacom is trying to steal the thunder in the domestic wireless industry, cellular monopoly holder Korea Mobile Telecom plans to launch its own digital messaging system by June, which would provide packet-switched data over its existing cellular channels. Korea Telecom, the nation's state-owned public telephone operator, is working on its own wireless data system, officials said. Although these networks are to operate in the same general radio- frequency range of 800 megahertz, their technological modes are different, so they require their own terminals. Dacom customers would have to buy one of Motorola's palm-size messaging device InfoTac or bigger and higher-capacity PDT-220 terminals. The prices are high: 2.15 million won for an InforTac terminal and 5.6 million won for a PDT-220. A Korea Mobile Telecom subscriber would have to buy a $1,000 wireless modem, the size of a cigarette box with a small protruding antenna, that snaps onto a notebook computer and allows data files to be sent over cellular telephone networks. Officials expect the price of terminals to drop sharply as more and more customers sign on. No one is sure how big the market will be. The industry says there will be about 10,000 subscribers by the end of next year. They foresee that number burgeoning to 100,000 to 500,000 by the end of the decade. Dacom says one advantage of its system is that it is well tested in the market, while Korea Mobile Telecom's rival Cellular Digital Packet Data system is still an emerging service overseas. Two public radio frequency systems similar to Dacom's are in operation in the United States: Ardis, a joint venture between Motorola Inc. and the International Business Machines Corp., and Ram Mobile Data, a partnership of RAM Broadcasting and BellSouth. But Dacom says its system, with a carrying capacity of 19,200 bits of information per second, is much faster than Ardis' 4,800 bits and Ram's 8,000 bits. Korea Mobile Telecom's CDPD system, which also uses the clearer and faster digital format of ones and zeros of computer code, boasts the same transmission capacity as that of Dacom. It would allow a file containing a page and a half of text to be sent in one second. Although wireless data is new and virtually unheard of here, companies hope it will thrive for some of the same reasons that have helped the domestic cellular industry attract half a million subscribers in its first nine years: it provides vital mobility to key people. Here are some of the possibilities: Credit card companies would use wireless networks to authorize credit in places where a dial-up (wired) service is unavailable (taxi drivers, for example, would accept credit cards). Postal couriers would use hand-held terminals and a wireless network to accept signatures written with an electronic pen and to notify the company's package-tracking center. Delivery services and car rental companies would depend on wireless networks to keep track of their packages or vehicles. A small set-top box on a vending machine would send out wireless messages telling its owner that certain products are out of stock. Airline ticket agents would come out from behind the counter to confirm tickets and assign seats for passengers standing in line at airports. Department stores would exchange price lists and sales figures instantly, making point-of-sale management possible. Police can check, on the spot, whether a number plate is on the wanted list in a computerized data base. The wireless data transfer is the telecommunication industry's latest whispered promise that soon, and very soon, it will unite telephones and computers into a single wireless go-anywhere device.
