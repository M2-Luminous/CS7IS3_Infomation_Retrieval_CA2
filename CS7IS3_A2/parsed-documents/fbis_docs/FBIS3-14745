Although through efforts taken by the Georgian party, the United Nations, and the Russian federation there appeared hopes that a consent could be reached over the return of refugees and the political statute of Abkhazia within the Georgian borders, the Gudauta group again took a destructive and uncompromising position thus, actually, failing the talks and making the situation extremely tense. I consider it necessary to remind the world community that Abkhazian separatists have perfidiously violated agreements signed by them three times. This was nothing else but a disgraceful disregard of fundamental norms of civilized behavior. Regardless of these unacceptable activities of the Gudauta group, and in order to avoid further bloodshed, the Georgian side spared no efforts to use all possible means for the peaceful settlement of the conflict. In this respect, significant assistance was received from the United Nations Organization, the Russian Federation, the CSCE, and the Group of Georgia's Friends [a US-based group that includes former political figures Shultz, Baker, and others]. I cannot help thanking them for all they did in order that a settlement of the conflict by political means would become possible. It is regrettable that in response to their efforts the Gudauta group launched a new wave of genocide of Georgians, the tragic effect of which we are already facing. Hundreds of people were killed and injured, while 15,000 joined those 300,000 refugees who were forced to abandon the land of their ancestors in order to avoid death. The Abkhazian separatists have again ignored universally accepted norms and did not permit a group of UN observers, including the head of the group, General (Videkaar), to go to Gali Rayon and give an appropriate assessment of the events taking place there. I believe that this scandalous act was not followed by an adequate reaction from international organizations and the whole world community. Fundamental international norms were disregarded and all this cannot be left unpunished if we are aspiring to build a just and harmonious world. Despite all the abovementioned, the Georgian leadership regarded it possible to participate in the following meeting in Geneva in order to completely use even the smallest opportunity to settle the Abkhazian conflict peacefully. It is evident that the Gudauta side failed the talks with the aim to exterminate or drive a small part of the Georgian population still remaining there out of Abkhazia, make the return of refugees impossible, and cut them off from their motherland Abkhazia forever. The situation is extremely tense today. I can declare with all responsibility that in case the negotiating parties, the UN Security Council, and the Russian Federation fail to find the fastest way to come out of the crisis, a spontaneous explosion and renewal of large-scale combat operations will be unavoidable. This will be followed by a bloodshed the scale and cruelty of which will exceed everything witnessed by the much suffered land so far. The events will develop spontaneously and it will be impossible to keep them under control. Therefore, we do agree to an immediate continuation of negotiations. I, personally, am ready to visit the UN Security Council, meet the UN secretary general, his plenipotentiary envoy, the leadership of the Russian Federation, and representatives of friendly countries in order that the catastrophic effects that will certainly follow the failure of the Geneva talks are avoided. A dialogue that will be held in Washington and New York during my official visit to the United States following President Clinton's invitation will have to provide a substantial contribution to a political settlement of the Abkhazian conflict.
