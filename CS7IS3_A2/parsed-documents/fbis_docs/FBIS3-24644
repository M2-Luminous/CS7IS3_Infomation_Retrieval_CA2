MOROCCO France Freezes Financial Aid to Morocco London Arabic expatriate dailyAL-HAYAH has reported that France will freeze nearly FFI billion in financial aid promised to Morocco by the Beregovoy government and will limit other financial aid for that country to short-term loans for Moroccan-French joint ventures working on local projects. French officials reportedly argued that with the continuing economic downturn in France, reduced aid to Morocco is justified in view of that country's foreign currency reserves in excess of $3.5 billion and the stronger showing of the Moroccan dirham vis-a-vis European currencies, especially the French franc. Furthermore, French officials were said to now give priority to aid requests from Africa and other French territories. The direct French financial aid packages for Morocco affected by this decision were: FF35O to 500 million in grants and financing for the Moroccan budget deficit. Nearly FF500 million in long-term loans with interest not exceeding 2.5 percent. Among the important French loans still programmed for Morocco in 1994 are: FF300 million to expand the activities of ALCATEL in telecommunications. FF200 million to purchase two freighters. FF160 million to continue nuclear energy research for peaceful purposes and electricity production. FF70 million for the Office of Communications. FF81 million for the Office of Phosphates. FF15 million for the Office of Electricity. According to AL-HAYAH, French aid to Morocco has declined since 1990, because of the French policy that approves aid only to joint ventures or for projects that provide for the purchase of French goods and products. This decline reportedly reflects France's concern that its share of the Moroccan market has dwindled to 22 percent. Sources cited by AL-HAYAH reported that the purpose of the French aid freeze is to pressure Moroccan officials-to give preference to French firms in local development projects. (London AL-HAYAH 11 Jan 94) Ministerial Visit Nets Loan Agreement Moroccan Prime Minister Mohamed Karim Lamrani led a delegation of government ministers and other officials to Madrid in December, where they reached agreement on a series of loans to Morocco totaling 150 billion Spanish pesetas to purchase Spanish goods and maintain the preferential fishing arrangement for 650 Spanish boats operating in Moroccan waters. A joint communique issued after the visit affirmed Spanish willingness to offer financial support for development programs in Morocco's northern provinces, as well as to complete studies on plans for a Maghreb-Europe gas pipeline, telecommunications networks via undersea cable, and a fiber-optic communications line. According to Rabat daily AL-ANBA', 1992 Spanish investment in Morocco constituted 19 percent of all foreign investment in the country. The paper reported that Prime Minister Lamrani has stated that more work is necessary "to encourage letting Spanish contracts in Morocco, similar to French and EU contracts, in order to realize a comprehensive and gradual development of the economy of the two countries." Lamrani also noted that several cooperative educational, cultural and environmental projects were planned. Lamrani acknowledged the need to solve the problem of transporting people and goods over the Straits of Gibraltar, especially when workers cross into Spain during the summer. He also acknowledged that the two countries were investigating ways of stemming the tide of illegal Noroccan emigrants and illicit drugs into Spain. (London AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT Il Jan 94; Rabat AL-ANBA' 5-6 Dec 1993; Rabat AL-ANBA' Weekly Supplement 12-13 Dec 93) Conflict Between Spanish and Moroccan Fishermen According to the Moroccan press, a dozen Spanish boats surrounded two Moroccan trawlers off the Tangiers coast and threatened to wreck them if they continued to operate in the area. Moroccan authorities asked EU representatives in Morocco to intervene "to end these acts which harm not only Moroccan-Spanish relations, but Moroccan-EU relations as well." The incident took place the day after the Moroccan-EU commission meeting on fisheries and one month after the EU announced a grant of 155 billion Spanish pesetas to the Spanish fishing industry to renovate its fleet and repair ports. Disputes continue between Morocco and Spain over the use of fishing beds that have been declared off-limits during a "biological pause" to enable stocks to replenish themselves. According to a front-page article in Rabat daily AL-'ALAM, the Spanish fishing lobby is putting pressure on Morocco and the EU to reduce the duration of biological pauses, and has objected to Moroccan boats fishing in areas that are off-limits to Spain. (Rabat L'OPINION 18 Jan 94; Rabat AL-'ALAM 6 Jan 94; Rabat AL-MITHAQ AL-WATANI 25 Dec 93) Foreign Minister Addresses Ceuta, Melilla Question Foreign Minister Abdellatif Filali reportedly told the Moroccan Council of Deputies that Morocco still seeks to establish a joint Spanish-Moroccan commission to study the future of Ceuta and Melilla, even though he said King Hassan's 1987 letter to King Juan Carlos requesting this has yet to be answered. Regarding recent discussions among Spanish parliamentarians concerning the possibility of granting self-rule to the two cities, Filali opined that the discussions would not lead to self-rule, but rather to further development of the existing city government system. (London AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT 21 Jan 94) Spanish Investment in Melilla Being Studied The Spanish Economics Ministry is reportedly studying a proposal to fund development in Melilla. The proposal would involve EU cooperation and would provide up to 35 billion Spanish pesetas to the city from 1994 to 1999. The proposal would raise Melilla's development budget to 53 billion Spanish pesetas over the next six years.
