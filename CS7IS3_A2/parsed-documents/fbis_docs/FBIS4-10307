He said he received an "excellent response" from European Union [EU] officials. Wasmosy said he has the "complex" mission of reconditioning the "completely unrealistic" image of "today's" Paraguay. Today he will raise with [French President] Francois Mitterrand the possibility of rescheduling the foreign debt for the next two years so as to allocate funds for social programs. Wasmosy said his European tour is taking place "at the right moment." He said he has received an "excellent" response to his explanations of cooperation projects, most of which seek to favor the most vulnerable classes. Wasmosy yesterday ended a two-day visit to Brussels where his busy agenda involved meeting with high EU and European Parliament dignitaries and European Bank of Investments officials, among others. He is scheduled to meet on 8 April with French President Francois Mitterrand at the Elysee Palace in Paris. Wasmosy will raise with the French president his desire to reschedule the Paraguayan foreign debt repayments. Wasmosy will discuss the same issue with French Patronage and Paris Club board members. In a brief chat with ABC COLOR, Wasmosy described his meetings in Brussels. He explained to the European Parliament our country's political situation, our hopes for agro-industrial development and progress in processing raw materials, which are currently exported without added value. Wasmosy said he clearly explained the peasant problem and the way in which his administration is coping with this situation that was broadly covered by the press, specially in February and March. Asked if the key point of his European tour involves rescheduling our foreign debt, Wasmosy made it clear that Paraguay is not specifically asking for renegotiations because "we have no arrears." The president emphasized: "We have not come to ask for pardons, but to raise a rescheduling of our repayments for the next two years so as to have the funds we wish to allocate for social programs. We have not come to ask for renegotiations or pardons." Wasmosy described as complex the task of overcoming the distrust towards the image that Paraguay had projected over the past 30 years or so, an image that still prevails in Europe. He added: "Think about Paraguay's current profile in Europe. It is completely unrealistic nowadays. As president, I have the huge task of reconditioning this image." Industry and Commerce Minister Ubaldo Scavone said the Paraguayan delegation was impressed by the interest demonstrated by European officials in the Paraguayan process and Paraguay's future. Scavone noted: "The president was subjected to what we could call a very interesting questioning by the European Parliament Foreign Relations and Security Committee. This demonstrates that there is considerable interest in the Paraguayan process and Paraguay's future." The EU is experiencing difficult times both in its internal recycling, its stance toward GATT, and its relationship with the United States. These complications, however, will not prevent Paraguay from securing some assistance. Scavone said: "Considering our past achievements, which were nil, we have very good possibilities." Scavone emphasized the favorable inclination that exists. He added that "President Wasmosy's image and his correct and able handling of the issues has greatly contributed" to this visit's success.
