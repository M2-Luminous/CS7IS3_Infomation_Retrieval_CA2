A spokesman of the military space forces of the Ministry of Defense told an INTERFAX correspondent that the decision to create a new Russian space port in Amur Oblast would probably not be adopted until the end of this year. Experts believe that the launch of the first Far East spaceship, scheduled for 1996, is quite feasible, but this is only a blueprint. Today, the only work conducted in Svobodnyy-18 is aimed at maintaining the town's infrastructure and keeping the missile complex's existing technical equipment in shape.
