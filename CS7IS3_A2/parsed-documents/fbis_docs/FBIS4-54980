On this occasion he delivered a speech marking the 49th anniversary of liberation from fascism. We now present the full version of this address. [Begin Havel recording] Gentlemen, veterans, esteemed fellow citizens! Voices pointing to various possible external dangers and demanding that politicians should pay more attention to the security of our state and to a faster building of a system of security ties with the democratic world are beginning to appear in our part of the world and from time to time even in our country. These voices, even though they may often be out of proportion to the situation, do nevertheless, testify to a certain fact. They are evidence of a certain disquiet, of a feeling of uncertainty, and of concerns that four years after renewing its independence, our comparatively small country, which is moreover situated in an exposed position, is still finding itself in too much of a vacuum, because its belonging to the West has still not been properly, or if your like, institutionally, confirmed. By adopting a cautious approach, by having an aversion to changes and fear of new things, the West allegedly keeps showering on us uncertain promises rather than tangible deeds and our politicians are allegedly accepting this situation with too much ease. I am not going to evaluate now to what degree these opinions are or are not justified. I will rather concentrate on bringing to your attention what we ourselves must do if we wish to reinforce our own certainties. The appropriate international talks aimed at our speedy and firm incorporation into the political, economic, and security structures of the democratic world are being conducted almost on a daily basis. Perhaps they could be conducted with an even greater urgency. But this approach itself is far from being enough. I think it is far more important that we, as a society, are capable of expressing through concrete deeds our willingness, will, and courage to both defend our own freedom and independence and to participate in the joint international defense of democratic values anywhere where they are being trampled on. The point is that no one will give us any security guarantees unless he is sure that we ourselves are capable of defending our country and, at the same time, we take on the broader responsibility we are demanding from others. An international alliance is not and cannot be based on a unilateral action, which means that the task of one side is to render all-round help, while others are here to be helped. In other words, we ourselves must not refuse to take risks and make sacrifices and at the same time, ask others to run risks and make sacrifices because of us. The advantages of freedom, independence, and development cannot be enjoyed while responsibility for their defense is delegated to others. I think that our modern history offers quite a lot of evidence of the fact that freedom is not a gift that is fought for and that is later handed out by the powerful of this world, but that only he, who himself is working toward winning and defending it is able to win or defend it. [passage omitted] Thanks to the entire set of historical circumstances we fortunately did not have to wage an armed struggle to liberate ourselves from Communism. But this does not at all mean that all has been taken care of forever and that we do not need to worry about our security any more. Unfortunately, we do not, and will hardly ever live in such an ideal world. After all, the will to get involved in the struggle for justice and peace demonstrated by our units in the Persian Gulf and in the former Yugoslavia has given a considerable boost to the respect our state enjoys on the international arena today. [(passage omitted] Today, the day when we recall the end of the Second World War, I greet on behalf of all my fellow citizens our war veterans. I greet those present in this hall and all other veterans, including those living abroad. I greet them as people to whom we owe our present freedom, I greet them as people who should be an inspiration for our entire army. In appointing new generals today, I am guided by the conviction that they are aware of this example and that their work will enhance the credibility of our army. The great changes that have taken place in our army in the recent years testify to the loyalty and professional attitude of career soldiers. I believe that our army will successfully continue the work that has begun. The credibility of our republic, or in other words, the credibility of all of us, depends to a considerable degree on its loyalty and credibility. Providing our army is ready to defend at any time the values we enjoy today, and providing this readiness is based on the general support by society, the society that is aware that evil must be fought even with arms, we do not have to fear for our security and we do not have to fear that in case we are threatened, others will fail to show their solidarity for us. Gentlemen, I congratulate you on your appointment. War veterans, thank you. [end recording]
