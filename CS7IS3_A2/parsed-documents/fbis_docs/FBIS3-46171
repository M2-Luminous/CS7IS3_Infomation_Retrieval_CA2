The conclusion of the world trade talks last month has made section 301 "a more effective tool", U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor told a hearing of the House Ways and Means Committee. The section 301 trade law, effective since 1974, is the legal basis for Washington's unilateral trade actions, such as sanctions against foreign countries which it says engage in unfair trade practices. Sanctions usually go into effect in one year, during which investigations are conducted to prove if the unfair trade practices are true or not. Kantor denied that the final agreement of the Uruguay round of the global trade talks sponsored by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) had adversely impacted U.S. trade sovereignty. "As far as dispute settlement is concerned," Kantor said, "we believe (section 301) is even more effective, and helps our sovereignty and makes us stronger, not weaker." "We can assert our rights effectively and on multilateral context, and make (section) 301 even a more effective tool," he stressed. The trade representative argued that except for the changes in the time length of investigation against the alleged unfair trade practices, section 301 was virtually left unaffected by the Uruguay agreement. Under GATT, the U.S. is required to go to the GATT before it enacts section 301 trade law and unilaterally imposes trade sanctions against a GATT-covered trade item and a GATT member. Almost all of the areas not covered by GATT are still not covered by the world trade organization, which is to replace GATT, U.S. officials said. Kantor, meanwhile, cited anti-competitive behavior and violation of bilateral trade agreement as possible reasons for Washington to use section 301 trade law. "We have a better dispute settlement mechanism to go to in the new world trade organization to enforce it in those circumstances where we would have to go to GATT," Kantor said.
