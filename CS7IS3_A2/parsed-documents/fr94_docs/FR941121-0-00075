FR941121-0-00075 FR941121-0-00009 Section 1876 of the Act provides the authority for us to enter into contracts with HMOs and CMPs to furnish Medicare covered services to beneficiaries and specifies the requirements these organizations must meet. Contracting HMOs and CMPs may be paid on either (1) a risk basis, under which they are paid a prospectively determined per capita monthly payment, or (2) a cost basis under which interim per capita payments are made on the basis of a budget and a retrospective cost settlement occurs to reflect the reasonable costs actually incurred by the HMO or CMP for the covered services it furnishes to enrolled members. Section 1833 of the Act provides the basis for regulations under which we enter into written agreements with HCPPs to furnish or arrange to have furnished covered Medicare Part B services to a defined population on a prepayment basis. II. Additional Background and Provisions of the Proposed Rule On October 7, 1992, we published a proposed rule (57 FR 46119) in which we proposed to amend the Medicare regulations governing administrative review rights and procedures for Medicare enrollees in prepaid health care organizations to: (1) Impose a 60-calendar-day limit for an HMO or CMP to complete a reconsideration requested by a Medicare enrollee (or authorized representative) for denied services or claims; (2) permit an HMO or CMP enrollee (or authorized representative) to request immediate Utilization and Quality Control Peer Review Organization (PRO) review of an HMO, CMP, or hospital notice of a determination that an inpatient hospital stay is no longer necessary; and (3) require HCPPs to establish administrative review procedures for Medicare enrollees similar to those that we require HMOs and CMPs to establish for Medicare enrollees. A. Time Limit on Reconsiderations Section 1876(c)(5)(A) of the Act requires a contracting HMO or CMP to establish procedures for hearing and resolving grievances between the organization and its Medicare enrollees. Section 1876(c)(5)(B) provides specific administrative and judicial review rights to Medicare enrollees who are dissatisfied with determinations by the HMO or CMP regarding services and claims. These rights are similar to those available to beneficiaries in the fee-for-service system, except that, under the existing regulations at 42 CFR 417.614 and 417.620, the initial level of review is by the HMO or CMP rather than by a PRO, intermediary, or carrier. Issues that are subject to the full scope of administrative and judicial review are those in which beneficiaries believe they: (l) Have been denied access to a service to which they are entitled, or (2) are required to pay an amount that is the responsibility of the HMO or CMP. (Other issues are only subject to the HMO's or CMP's internal grievance procedures.) Regulations at §§417.600 through 417.638 describe the administrative and judicial review process. Under the first step of the process, the rules provide that the HMO or CMP must make a timely determination and notify the beneficiary of the reasons for the determination. A determination regarding a request for payment must be made within 60 days of receiving the claim. If the decision is unfavorable (in whole or in part), the beneficiary (or his or her authorized representative) may request that the HMO or CMP reconsider the decision. (The beneficiary must request reconsideration before proceeding to the next step in the review process.) An organization may issue a reconsidered determination on a case only if the reconsidered determination is entirely favorable to the beneficiary. If the organization reaffirms its denial of payment or services, in whole or in part, the organization may not issue a reconsidered decision to the beneficiary. Instead, the organization must prepare a written explanation and refer the case to us, along with a justification for its initial denial, so that we may make a new and independent determination concerning coverage of the services at issue. This step is considered part of the reconsideration process. If our reconsideration determination is not fully favorable to the beneficiary, the beneficiary has a right to request a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ) of the Social Security Administration if the amount remaining in controversy is $100 or more. If the ALJ hearing does not result in a fully favorable determination, the beneficiary may request Appeals Council review of the ALJ decision. Following the administrative review process, the beneficiary is entitled to judicial review of the final determination if the amount remaining in controversy is $1,000 or more. Existing regulations do not establish time limits for an HMO or CMP to complete a reconsideration. A beneficiary may not proceed to the next level of administrative review, however, until the HMO or CMP issues its decision or refers the matter to us. Therefore, we proposed to amend §417.620 (``Responsibility for reconsideration; time limits'') to require the following: •That an HMO or CMP act on the beneficiary's reconsideration request within 60 calendar days from the date of receipt of the request. •That, if the decision made by the organization is entirely favorable to the beneficiary, the organization so notify the beneficiary within the 60-calendar-day period.
