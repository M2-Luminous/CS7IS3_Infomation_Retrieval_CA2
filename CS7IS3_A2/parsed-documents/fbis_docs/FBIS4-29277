Military experts said such reckless acts would only aggravate the situation eventually by dancing to the North Korean tune of psychological warfare. They said such emergency buying is quite unnecessary because the North's military preparations for invasion would be detectable at least three months in advance. Some people, mainly in wealthy apartment complexes in Kangnam, south of the Han River, began showing a keen sense of insecurity this week in sharp contrast to their earlier lack of concern about national security. Such a drastic change of attitude was apparently nudged by the ever-intensifying North Korean stance over the nuclear issues highlighting withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Following the reports on the hawkish policy of the North, lots of people rushed to supermarkets and other stores to buy such contingency provisions as ramyon (fried instant noodles), rice, butane gas and medicines. At the Grand Department Store in Taechi-tong, Kangnam-ku, all 660 20-kg packs of rice in the store were sold out Tuesday, compared with an average daily sale of 160 packs. Residents in the region had to form long lines to buy such daily necessities as flour, canned food, canned gases and candlesticks etc. A similar phenomenon took place in other department stores in Sanggye-tong in northern Seoul and Sinchon, north of the Han River. Small stores are also enjoying profits from a remarkable increase in sales of such contingency necessities as candles, matches, batteries, wooden chopsticks and soap. In an attempt to hang on to as much cash as possible, most buyers paid with credit cards. Nhongshim Corp., one of the largest ramyon makers, said it began producing 30 percent more ramyon than average a day since this week. The Bank of Korea also started to issue more cash than in ordinary time -- 49.3 billion won (61 million dollars) on June 10, 42.8 billion won the next day and 57.4 billion won Monday. The spread of a sense of instability is also seen in the increase in the number of people applying for visas for foreign tours. A travel agency official said that the application increased by 30 percent this week, adding, "Most of their planned trips seemed not to have special purposes." Military experts said there is no need for the people to buy a large amount of provisions because during wartime they would be moved to public places like schools for safety and daily necessities will be rationed. They said the current buying spree among some people would be of no use if hostilities were to occur, but would only cause panic among the people.
