While hailed at the time as symbolic of national reconciliation, the coalition government has been rent by infighting and an inability to enact significant legislation. Much of the current stasis afflicting Phnom Penh has been blamed on CPP hardliners but a closer look at the power balance suggests that this is not the case. This coalition was mooted throughout 1992, but during the run up to the election collapsed in anti-Funcinpec violence, blamed at the time on the Chea Sim hardliners Sar Kheng and Sin Song. Now that recent invitations to the United States have implicitly exonerated the two, international credence has been lent to Hun Sen who had always maintained the CPP was not responsible for the pre-election mayhem. In preparation for the coalition the CPP made some quick substitutions among its 51 winners in the National Assembly. Thirty-three mostly old cadres resigned in favor of younger technocrats and intellectuals. The Chea Sim faction lost status, that of Hun Sen gained, and the shifts in CPP personnel indicate sincerity in playing the parliamentary game. Eight Chea Sim followers, including Sin Song, resigned, leaving eight among the CPP deputies, while fifteen of the "Hun Sen Clan", mostly intellectuals and professionals, remained with eight dropped. Eleven veteran provincial governors were passed over, and only five, all but one young men believed close to Hun Sen, were included. Also excluded were most candidates with a military or security service background, while those included were generals Ke Kimyan, age 38, and Chay Sangyun, 40, sometimes called 'military intellectuals', and the Defence Minister, Tie Banh, 48. When the Provisional Government was chosen in July, with 37 of its 65 members from outside the assembly, 15 of the CPP members were of the 'Hun Sen Clan', while only four were Chea Sim men; and none was from among the old politicians or Chea stalwarts in the assembly. The affiliation of the remaining ten CPP members of the government was uncertain. The only Chea Sim man in a powerful position was Sin Sen, as a Deputy Minister of Interior and Public Security, the others being in Tourism, Transport, and Public Works. In October 1993 a new Royal Government of Cambodia was formed, with near equality between the two large parties maintained. Twenty-nine members of the Provisional Government, including 12 CPP and 15 Funcinpec, were dropped, and there were eight new faces, four CPP, three Funcinpec, and one listed without party affiliation. The new line-up showed some gain for Chea Sim, who moved up from Vice-President to President of the National Assembly. Of the 12 CPP members of the Provisional Government dropped from the Royal government, three were his men against six from the Hun Sen group. Sin Sen was removed, but another protege, Sar Kheng, came into the government as a Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior. Still, of the 24 CPP members of the government 11 are considered of the Hun Sen group, with only two certain Chea Sim followers. Most of the rest, because of their relative youth or intellectual background may also be presumed closer to Hun Sen than to Chea Sim. In the provinces the parties share the 20 governorships equally, with a first deputy from the other party, and the CPP has shifted much of its personnel. In nine provinces, including those whose governors entered the National Assembly, the former governors have been removed. In any case the Funcinpec personnel may be figureheads, because of long-standing CPP relationships with subordinate officials and he population. In general, during 1979-93 the provinces were run by local people, not just functionnairies sent out from Phnom Penh. This does not, however, guarantee tight party control, and some provinces may constitute their own factions. In the future, equal attention should be given to Funcinpec factions. Ranariddh has complained that not all members vote for his proposals, and there is a Funcinpec faction, probably centered on Sam Rangsi, which is lukewarm towards monarchy, especially of the Sihanouk variety. Likewise, members of the KPNLF/BLDP [Khmer People's National Liberation Front/Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party] of Son Sann, whose organization has never been royalist, may find more congenial colleagues among the new CPP elite. The first sign of realignment may be in the military. Before the election both the KPNLF and the Sihanoukists suffered defections of generals to Phnom Penh; and immediately after the election the commanders of those three armies agreed to unite. The Phnom Penh army was headed by young generals without a Vietnam background, probably closer to Hun Sen than to Chea Sim, and the KPNLF army was run by a faction which formed the Liberal Democratic Party, a group of non-royalist younger men. Then the reorganized Cambodian Armed Forces, in a return to the situation preceding Untac [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia] intervention, launched a campaign against the Khmer Rouge, adopting Hun Sen's policy against that of Sihanouk and Ranariddh. If they succeed, they will have proven that peace in Cambodia required no more than international neglect of the Khmer Rouge and normalization of relations with Phnom Penh, and could have been achieved years ago.
