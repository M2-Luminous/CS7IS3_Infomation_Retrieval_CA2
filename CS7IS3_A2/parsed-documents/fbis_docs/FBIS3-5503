The dispatch is in line with a request from U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali made late February to send Japanese personnel to monitor the March 20 presidential and parliamentary elections, the officials said. A peace agreement was signed in January 1992 after a decade-long "proxy war" in El Salvador between the right-wing government, backed by the United States, and leftist guerrillas, supported by the former Soviet Union. In a meeting with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Tokyo last November, El Salvador's President Alfredo Felix Christiani asked Japan to send voting monitors for the elections. The 15-member Japanese team, comprising three from the Foreign Ministry, one from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government and 11 from the private sector, will join a 900-member U.N. unit to oversee the polls in the Central American country. All the Japanese members are proficient in speaking Spanish, the officials said. The Japanese team is scheduled to work in El Salvador until March 31, but its stay may be extended until May 10 if no candidate wins a majority of votes to become president and vice president and a reelection is called to pick the two top leaders of the nation. El Salvador will be the third country to which Japan sends election observers in accordance with the U.N. Peacekeeping Cooperation Law, following Angola and Cambodia. The 1992 law stipulates that to send election monitors overseas the government must confirm three necessary conditions -- a declared cease-fire, agreements by parties concerned to accept such personnel and assured neutrality in the country.
