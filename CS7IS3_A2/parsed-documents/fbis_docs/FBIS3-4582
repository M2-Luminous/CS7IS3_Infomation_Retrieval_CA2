Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii told Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen at their meeting near Frankfurt, Germany, that the planned income and residential tax cut is but a first step toward a more full-fledged tax reduction in the future. The source said Fujii made the remarks "on an assumption that the ongoing debate over tax reforms will produce conclusion in one year." "They're not an international pledge," the source said. The government has been discussing a dramatic overhaul of the country's taxation system, with a more perpetual tax reduction on the agenda. The tax debate is scheduled to come up with some conclusions by the end of the year.
