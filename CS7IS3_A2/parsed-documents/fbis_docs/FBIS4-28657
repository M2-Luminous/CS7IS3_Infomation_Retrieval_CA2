At 2309 GMT, Kuroiwa begins the interview by asking Ozawa for his opinion on the present DPRK situation. Ozawa says: "I do not think they are changing their basic position. But when we discuss and review the matter, we must try and use dialogue to bring them to a compromise and a change in their policy. That would be the best, and we will have to do our best towards that. But if we have done all that, and if things still do not go well, we will have to take a firm stand." He adds: "Maybe the DPRK sees some political significance in owning nuclear arms; anyway, I do not think they are giving up their position yet." Kuroiwa asks whether Japan, the United States, and the ROK should join together to mete out sanctions against the DPRK if the United Nations fails to agree on sanctions. Ozawa says: "I do not think China will reject or exercise its veto right (on a UN proposal for sanctions). China will gain nothing by doing so, and it is possible that China itself may become isolated (from the international community). I do not think it will do such a foolish thing." Speaking on alleged differences of opinions on how sanctions against the DPRK should be implemented, Ozawa says: "It is only natural that they be implemented step by step. It is not that Japan, the United States, and the ROK differ on the question of implementing them step by step, but rather, I think there are some differences in opinion on what types of sanctions should be implemented in a step by step manner." Even before the United Nations formally passes a resolution on sanctions, he notes the possibility of other nations calling on Japan to take action to discontinue commodity trade and money remittances to the DPRK. He explains: "I am afraid about the possibility that Japan, as it is, will not be able to do anything when that happens." He adds: "What I am worried about most is the possibility Japan will lose trust in the international community. I think damages to Japan (if it cannot take the called-for actions) could be such that they will not be repaired even in the next scores of years or next several generations. Hence, I think, action in the preliminary stages will be very important and tough for Japan." Professor Kobayashi asks Ozawa if he thinks Japan should agree to the U.S. proposal that Japan, the United States, and the ROK join together to punish the DPRK economically if the United Nations is unable to agree on sanctions. Ozawa says: "So far I have said that Japan should act only in accordance with UN resolutions when compulsive actions are concerned. But what is being discussed and called for now are preliminary actions that involve domestic matters, such as halting money remittances and regulating visits. These are not actions that cannot be carried out without a UN resolution. That being the case, Japan is in a very difficult position." When asked about Japan's crisis management capability under the Shinseito led coalition government, Ozawa states: "Officials of concerned government agencies are studying various fields very hard. However, neither the government nor the Diet openly discuss this issue. The government has no official position on the subject, that is the actual situation in today's Japan. While I think some quarters in the government are continuing informal studies, we are not yet prepared to have an improved system." In regards to this, Ozawa expresses concern over Japan's taboo to fully discuss defense issues, and says: "In particular, the mass media still deal with important topics in very old-fashioned ways. Such a tendency by Japanese society creates a national crisis." In response to Kurosawa's comment that Japan seemingly has a consensus to deal with the DPRK issue within the Constitution's limitations, Ozawa notes: "Many people have a different definition of constitutional limitations. For instance, the Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ) says, under constitutional limitations, Japan must not take part in any compulsive actions, even indirectly. In their opinion, Japan is not allowed to supply provisions or fuel to U.S. Forces in case of emergency since it aids in compulsive actions or military force. Even if the nation has a consensus on actions within the constitutional limitations, there is no accord on the definition of the limitations." [Editorial Report] When Kuroiwa asks if Japan, under Oazawa's constitutional concept, can assist U.S. Forces with regard to the DPRK issue, Ozawa answers: "In my own understanding of Article 9 of the Constitution, the Japanese Government must not, at is own judgment, be allowed to dispatch the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) to any international dispute. Article 9 strictly prohibits such behavior. On the other hand, the Constitution's main concept is international pacifism. When the United Nations has a clear policy for certain disputes and member nations agree to jointly conduct law enforcement or peace activities, that does not conflict with the Constitution at all. That is my understanding." Asked if the government intends to fully cooperate with anti-DPRK sanctions if imposed at the United States' initiative, Ozawa says: "I do not think so. My opinion is that, when compulsive forces are to be used, Japan must take part in the actions only within the framework of the United Nations. However, controlling money remittances from Japan to the DPRK is a matter of Japan's domestic economic policy. Since this has nothing to do with Article 9 of the Constitution, we have to take necessary actions in consultations with the United States and the ROK. When the United Nations clearly decides to impose sanctions against the DPRK and asks member nations to support the sanctions, as a matter of course, Japan will have to assist with its SDF or all other possible means because it is an event in Japan's neighboring region." In reply to a question asking if Japan should be admitted to the UN Security Council (UNSC) as a permanent member with a limited military role, Ozawa says: "If Japan becomes a permanent UNSC member, it should meet the same qualification as other members. But I do not really think Japan should seek such a position. The UNSC is an organization to deal with international security. I think Japan has neither the determination nor public consensus to obtain the position. It is too much for today's Japan, although Japan has strong economic power." Ozawa adds: "What Japan can do would depend on individual cases, but if Japan becomes a permanent UNSC member, it cannot stay away from what everybody else does. The international community would never accept such a foolish offer. If Japan says so, it would become a standing joke in the world. If Japan wants to stay away from certain UNSC duties, it had better not become a permanent member." When asked if the minority Hata administration can survive the difficult political situation, Ozawa says: "While people often say the Hata administration is in trouble because it is a minority government, I am not worried. If we really had a serious problem, the administration would have collapsed already. However, nobody can draw a picture of the post-Hata political scene. The Liberal Democratic Party is not united in backing Mr. (Yohei) Kono as the next prime minister, and neither is the SDPJ. Under such circumstances, we should not be scrupulous about winning back the majority. This is the time for all politicians to overcome party barriers and to seek policy-oriented allies. In connection with Ozawa's positive stance on the SDPJ rejoining the coalition, Kuroiwa asks if the coalition would have a clearer policy accord when discussions are held on the SDPJ's return, Ozawa says: "If we had a clearer policy accord, it would put the SDPJ in a difficult position. I am positive about clarifying coalition policies if the SDPJ agrees to it."
