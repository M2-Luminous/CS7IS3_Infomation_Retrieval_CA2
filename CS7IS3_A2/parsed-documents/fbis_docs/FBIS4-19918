[Woerner] I hope so, but to say I believe so would be an exaggeration. Above all, we are raising the stakes of their aggression. I hope this will at least mean they will think about distancing themselves from their policy of unbridled aggression particularly against civilians, hospitals, and refugee camps. As I say, I cannot express any more than my hope. [Privtera] In the other protection zones, with the exception of Gorazde and Sarajevo, there has been no model along the lines of the ultimatum for Sarajevo. [sentence as heard] Why this solution? Is it perhaps also a concession to Moscow? [Woerner] I would not call it a concession. It does indeed give Moscow the possibility, which it already had at the time of the first ultimatum for Sarajevo, to talk to the Serbs in an effort to convince them to stop attacking safe zones. It will not have gone unnoticed that the Russians were disappointed by the Bosnian Serbs and their behavior in Gorazde. I can therefore well imagine the Russians making their contribution to this. But regardless of that, we were the one to make the decision, on the advice of the UN secretary general; but the decision, as I said, was made by the 16 NATO nations.
