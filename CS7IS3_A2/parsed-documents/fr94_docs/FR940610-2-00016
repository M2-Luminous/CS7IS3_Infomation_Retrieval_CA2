ADDRESSES: Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled, Crystal Square 3, suite 403, 1735 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, Virginia 22202&hyph;3461. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Beverly Milkman (703) 603&hyph;7740. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On April 15, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled published notice (59 FR 18104) of proposed additions to the Procurement List. After consideration of the material presented to it concerning capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the military resale commodities and service, fair market price, and impact of the additions on the current or most recent contractors, the Committee has determined that the military resale commodities and service listed below are suitable for procurement by the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c and 41 CFR 51&hyph;2.4. I certify that the following action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major factors considered for this certification were: 1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities other than the small organizations that will furnish the military resale commodities and service to the Government. 2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on current contractors for the military resale commodities and service. 3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish the military resale commodities and service to the Government. 4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c) in connection with the military resale commodities and service proposed for addition to the Procurement List. Accordingly, the following military resale commodities and service are hereby added to the Procurement List: Military Resale Commodities Pad, Replacement, Handle Scrubber M.R. 540 M.R. 545 M.R. 546 Service Janitorial/Grounds Maintenance, Buffumville Lake and Hodges Village Dam, Oxford, Massachusetts This action does not affect current contracts awarded prior to the effective date of this addition or options exercised under those contracts.
