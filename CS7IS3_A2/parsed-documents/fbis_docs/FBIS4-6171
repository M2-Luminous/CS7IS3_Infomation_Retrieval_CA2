On the final day, delegates debated the development of nuclear energy in the Asian region and the effects of radioactivity. A declaration issued at the closing affirmed the delegates' opposition to nuclear weapons. It also called for continued efforts by countries involved in dismantling nuclear weapons and the development of research into technology aimed at making the peaceful use of nuclear energy safer. At a news conference after the conference, Takashi Mukaibo, chairman of the forum that promotes peaceful use of atomic energy, said the group came to Hiroshima "to learn." About 1,500 atomic power specialists from Japan and abroad took part in the 27th annual conference. Hans Blix, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), told delegates the IAEA will hold a special meeting on April 21 and 22 in Vienna to discuss the Chernobyl nuclear reactors in Ukraine. Chernobyl was the scene of one of the world's most serious nuclear accidents in 1986. Antinuclear activists protested the gathering around the conference hall in central Hiroshima. Next year marks the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombing during the closing days of World War II.
