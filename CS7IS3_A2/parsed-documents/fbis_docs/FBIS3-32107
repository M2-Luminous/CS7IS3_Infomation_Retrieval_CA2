Mireya Moscoso de Gruber thus reiterated what she proposed weeks ago in David when she called for a great alliance against the Democratic Revolutionary Party. [Moscoso de Gruber] "I don't think Panamanians want to return to the past. We must therefore call for this great alliance of all parties. Let's sit down and discuss what is best for Panama, not what is best for personal or economic interests." Apparently the difficulty lies in the absence of identifying a person to unify all these forces. [Moscoso de Gruber] "Let's all sit down and look for this person, just as we did in 1989. [Alvarado] "Even if it is not you? [Moscoso de Gruber] "Even if it is not me." Moscoso de Gruber said it is time to leave behind the arguments and political ambitions that have so harmed democracy. If we must hold a new convention, we are willing to hold it, added the leader. [Moscoso de Gruber] "There are seven candidates for the presidency of the Republic, and we think there should be only two." Mrs. Mireya Moscoso de Gruber made these statements during a meeting of the parties that form the so-called Democratic Alliance, alliance representatives commented later. [Alfredo Arias of the PA; identified by caption] "I think that when we talk about a great national alliance, it has to be based on the alliance's majority party. [Alvarado] "What do you think of a possible unification of criteria? [Roberto Aleman of the Liberal Party; identified by caption] "The truth is that I do not know. Right now I think it would be very difficult, but it could happen. [Alvarado] "Would you support it? [Aleman] "I don't know. I would have to propose it to the party's national executive committee. [Joaquin Franco of the Authentic Liberal Party; identified by caption] "I see no such possibility at this time. Mrs. Gruber represents the Democratic Alliance. She made some statements this morning, which you have already heard. We are still awaiting responses to those statements."
