FR940805-0-00037 FR940805-0-00012 4. The second sentence of paragraph (b)(4) is amended by removing ``1.263A&hyph;1T(c)'' and replacing it with ``1.263A&hyph;4T(c)''. 5. Paragraph (b)(10) is amended by removing the second sentence and by adding paragraphs (b)(10) (i) and (ii). 6. The text of paragraph (j)(4) is added. 7. The added text reads as follows: §1.263A&hyph;1 Uniform capitalization of costs. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* (10) *␣*␣* (i) For purposes of this section, substantial construction is deemed to have occurred if the lesser of_ (A) 10 percent of the total estimated costs of construction; or (B) The greater of $10 million or 2 percent of the total estimated costs of construction, was incurred before March 1, 1986. (ii) For purposes of the provision in paragraph (b)(10)(i) of this section, the total estimated costs of construction shall be determined by reference to a reasonable estimate, on or before March 1, 1986, of such amount. Assume, for example, that on March 1, 1986, the estimated costs of constructing a facility were $150 million. Assume that before March 1, 1986, $12 million of construction costs had been incurred. Based on the above facts, substantial construction would be deemed to have occurred before March 1, 1986, because $12 million (the costs of construction incurred before such date) is greater than $10 million (the lesser of $15 million; or the greater of $10 million or $3 million). For purposes of this provision, construction costs are defined as those costs incurred after construction has commenced at the site of the property being constructed (unless the property will not be located on land and, therefore, the initial construction of the property must begin at a location other than the intended site). For example, in the case of a building, construction commences when work begins on the building, such as the excavation of the site, the pouring of pads for the building, or the driving of foundation pilings into the ground. Preliminary activities such as project engineering and architectural design do not constitute the commencement of construction, nor are such costs considered construction costs, for purposes of this paragraph (b)(10). * * * * * (j) *␣*␣* (4) *␣*␣* The District Director may require appropriate adjustments to valuations of inventory and other property subject to section 263A if a transfer of property is made to another person for a principal purpose of avoiding the application of section 263A. Thus, for example, the District Director may require a taxpayer using the simplified production method of §1.263A&hyph;2(b) to apply that method to transferred inventories immediately prior to a transfer under section 351 if a principal purpose of the transfer is to avoid the application of section 263A. Par. 9. Section 1.263A&hyph;3(c)(4)(vi) is amended as follows: 1. The heading is revised. 2. The text of paragraphs (A) and (B) is added. 3. The heading for paragraph (C) is revised and the text is added. 4. The revised and added provisions read as follows: §1.263A&hyph;3 Rules relating to property acquired for resale. * * * * * (c) *␣*␣* (4) *␣*␣* (vi) Costs not required to be capitalized as handling costs _(A) Distribution costs _( 1 ) In general . Distribution costs are not required to be capitalized. Distribution costs are any transportation costs incurred outside a storage facility in delivering goods to a customer. For this purpose, any costs incurred on a loading dock are treated as incurred outside a storage facility. ( 2 ) Costs incurred in transporting goods to a related person. Distribution costs do not include costs incurred by a taxpayer in delivering goods to a related person. Thus, for example, when a taxpayer sells goods to a related person, the costs of transporting the goods are included in determining the basis of the goods that are sold, and hence in determining the resulting gain or loss from the sale, for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder. See, e.g., sections 267, 707, and 1502. For purposes of this provision, persons are related if they are described in section 267(b) or section 707(b).
