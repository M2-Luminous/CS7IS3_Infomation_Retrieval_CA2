Over video clips of past CIS summit meetings and President Nazarbayev's visit to Russia, Medvedev says President Nursultan Nazarbayev's three-day official visit, "did yield one surprise, namely the suggestion to set up in place of the CIS, which is not working, a new state association with a single parliament, a council of defense ministers, common borders, and a supranational currency. Evidently understanding that the ground had not been prepared for any discussion of these topics in Russia and its sovereign neighbors, Nazarbayev described his initiative as not a formal proposal, but just an idea. This is why it was aired not at the official negotiations in the Kremlin, but on the second day of his visit, at a meeting with the intelligentsia in Moscow State University -- though doubtless Kazakhstan's leader could not but have shared his new ideas with Boris Yeltsin during the talks. It is interesting why Nazarbayev decided, without mentioning the Russian president's reaction, to appeal to public opinion. "The idea has been voiced, and it is giving rise to more questions than answers. The Russian Foreign Ministry, for instance, is unclear what would happen if a Eurasian Union were set up in place of the CIS, which has just obtained the status of observer at the United Nations." Medvedev points out the principles underlying the European Union cannot simply be transferred to a Eurasian version, and the right of veto, which it is suggested each sovereign member state would have, is unlikely to meet with acceptance. Given the level of the current disagreements in the CIS, such a right could paralyze any new collective body, and it would hardly be possible to reach agreement on anything. Surveying the reactions to the new proposal for a Eurasian Union in CIS capitals, Medvedev switches to an interview with President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine. The idea, President Kravchuk said, was discussed when the CIS was set up, and is still being developed within the context of the CIS. "But," Kravchuk says, "I do not think we should disband the CIS today. I believe that if the task of setting up a Eurasian Union is set, the CIS should prepare the conditions for this." "All this must be studied very attentively" and properly prepared, President Kravchuk says. Over a photograph of President Akayev, Medvedev says, "President Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzstan was one of the few to give immediate support to the idea of setting up a Eurasian Union. He regards it as promising." Myacheslaw Gryb, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Belarus, interviewed in the Soviet chamber, said: "I am familiar with the proposals put forward by President Nursultan Nazarbayev. We find them politically interesting, to a certain degree, and without doubt merit attention, a great deal of attention. But in this respect I see that we must, first of all, resolve issues of economic cooperation, of economic integration between our state, the Republic of Belarus, and the member states of the CIS, first and foremost with the Russian Federation. This could be the second stage, because today, as far as I surmise, we are not yet ready to settle this question." "President Islam Karimov of Uzbekistan believes that the CIS's potential is far from exhausted, and it is better to expend one's efforts on making the existing union work than on creating a new one," Medvedev concludes.
