Even before the talks in the Kremlin, the U.S. head of state paid his respects to the great people who saved humanity from fascism -- Bill Clinton laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Aleksandrovskiy Garden by the Kremlin Wall. Then an extremely intense work session began. The third and final round of the Russian-U.S. summit talks took place in the Yekaterinskiy Hall of the Great Kremlin Palace. On the Russian side, Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian Federation defense minister, took part in the talks together with other delegation members. This enables us conclude that the subject under discussion was Russian-U.S. military-political cooperation. One aspect of this was the retargeting of both countries' strategic nuclear missiles. On this issue, it was announced, a mutually acceptable understanding had been reached. At the subsequent joint news conference, President Boris Yeltsin announced among other things that new flight plans had been prepared not just for the missiles (which in itself would have been a major sensation just a couple of years ago), but for the whole complex of Russian-U.S. relations. They will become partners on the global strategic level. It is precisely the fact that his intentions are sincere, together with the fact that he is firmly protecting his own interests, that seems to explain the persistence of President Clinton's mediation efforts to settle the Russian-Ukrainian crisis with regard to the nuclear missile problem. The agreement signed after the trilateral meeting in Moscow guarantees that the missiles stationed in Ukraine will finally be dismantled and that the warheads will be transported to Russia to be destroyed. All the work involved in eliminating the third most powerful nuclear complex in the world should be completed in record time -- 10 months. It is true that a specific schedule for withdrawing nuclear warheads from Ukrainian territory has not yet been published in accordance with the mutual agreement of the parties involved.
