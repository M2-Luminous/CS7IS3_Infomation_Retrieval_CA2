There were only small leaks about yesterday's confrontations due to the Israeli military censorship. REUTER said the Israeli Army killed a Palestinian woman, who was five months pregnant, while she was watching the clashes from the window of her house--clashes which resulted in the injury of at least five Palestinians. In a telephone interview with our radio, Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, head of the PLO Information Department, confirmed the death of the woman and said about 30 Palestinians were wounded, and another three killed during the day. He added that the Israeli Army carried out a large-scale offensive in the city of Hebron, occupied the children's hospital and Queen 'Alya' Hospital, and fired rockets at houses on the pretext of searching for wanted persons. Therefore, added 'Abd-Rabbuh, today's Cairo meeting between the PLO and Israel will not be held. This Cairo meeting was expected to be held after the failure of the Israeli and Palestinian sides in Tunis to agree to the resumption of peace talks. The meeting was scheduled to concentrate on the issue of protecting Palestinians in the occupied territories.
