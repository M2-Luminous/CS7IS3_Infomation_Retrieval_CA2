William Taylor, vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told YONHAP in an exclusive interview that he expects North Korea to allow further IAEA checks in the near future, though he cannot tell exactly when. Taylor visited Pyongyang from April 12-19 at the North Korean Government's invitation for President Kim Il-song's 82nd birthday and met with Kim for three and a half hours. He said that during the meeting he got the impression that an inter-Korean summit would take place if the North and South relaxed their bureaucratic rigidity, though Kim did not make any direct mention of a summit. Facing the United States, Japan and South Korea which he said have "strong hands," North Korea has only one card to use, staking everything on its nuclear program; to spur the North Koreans toward settlement of the dispute, the United States, Japan and South Korea should first prepare to offer economic assistance and diplomatic recognition, observed Taylor, who has visited Pyongyang four times. He revealed that he is carrying a message from Kim Yong-sun, chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly Unification Policy Committee, which he will personally deliver to a ranking South Korean Government official on or after Thursday, but he declined to comment on the message's content. Taylor thus suggested he will convey Pyongyang's official position on resuming inter-Korean dialogue ahead of a summit and the nuclear dispute to Seoul later this week. Taylor said North Korea would announce "very soon" a set of opening measures exceeding the existing joint-venture law in scope. Chinese, Japanese and German companies already sell products to North Korea and its trade with third world countries is brisk; should this situation continue, South Korea and the United States would be the last in line for North Korea, he observed. Denying western reports that North Koreans lead a miserable life, Taylor said the people looked healthy and happy despite President Kim's admission of food, clothing and energy shortages. He said he had not conveyed a message from President Bill Clinton to Kim during his stay in Pyongyang nor was he carrying a message from Kim to either Clinton or South Korean President Kim Yong-sam. Taylor leaves for Seoul on Thursday and will stay there until next Tuesday.
