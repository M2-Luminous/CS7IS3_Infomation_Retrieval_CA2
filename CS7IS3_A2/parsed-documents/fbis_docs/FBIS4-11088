Gonzalez, age 34, a member of the outlawed Cuban Human Rights Committee, admitted he cooperated with counterrevolutionary radio stations based in the United States. (Edelmira Pedriz) was the prosecutor of case No. 49 of 1993 and now gives us details on the legal substantiation of the case. [Begin recording] [Pedriz] The paragraphs of Article 103 of the Penal Code, through Paragraph 3, describe the offense of enemy propaganda. To be specific, the charge against Rodolfo Gonzalez is contained in Paragraph 2 of Article 103. It notes that a person who spreads false news or ill-intended predictions for the purpose of causing alarm or public unrest is liable to receive one to four years in prison. Paragraph 3 mentions a specific aggravating factor for this offense. It notes that if the mass media are used in carrying out the actions mentioned in the above paragraphs the prison term ranges from seven to 15 years. What happened in this case? Everything that was said -- even the defendant said it during the hearing and the defense lawyer, who was tasked with representing the interests of Gonzalez in accordance with what our Constitution and law dictate, corroborated it.... [pauses] During the trial, the argument against the charge was that Rodolfo Gonzalez committed no offense because he did nothing but make use of his sacred right to express his ideas freely, the right of freedom of opinion, the freedom to express ideas and beliefs. The constitutionality of the charge was questioned during the trial to buttress this argument, although it is totally without legal or material justification. The argument was that in this case there was no dissemination of news but of ideas and that the Cuban state is violating not just what our Constitution but what the Universal Human Rights Declaration says. [Samper] I [word indistinct] mention the case and that it was proved during the trial that Gonzalez used to contact U.S.-based radio stations to give false reports on disturbances and human rights violations in Cuba, things that never happened. In addition, it was also proved that everything was distorted. Would you like to explain briefly to us this aspect? [Pedriz] This case involves a dissemination of neither ideas nor opinions because, according to the file, on a nearly daily basis between March and May 1992, Rodolfo Gonzalez had contacts, with the frequency I just noted, with Mr. (Alvaro de Insua), a journalist residing in Miami, through calls from the United States to a specific location in Cuba that could never be determined. [end recording] According to the charges, citizen Rodolfo Gonzalez spread false information [accusaciones] on the country's situation and on actions by domestic law-and-order groups [cuerpos del orden interior] that violate citizens' rights to create unrest and to incite the population to carry out acts of civil disobedience against island authorities. Other charges refuted by the Public Prosecutor's Office pertain to the health status of counterrevolutionaries Sebastian Arcos, who is currently in prison, and Maria Elena Cruz Varela, who is currently free. Pedriz commented on the international repercussions of the dissemination of this false information: [Begin Pedriz recording] If you recall the trial, which received ample coverage, the accused insisted that all the news and all the information on alleged human rights violations in Cuba make their way to the headquarters of the Human Rights Commission in Geneva, and, of course, given the effect of this on our country's security abroad, the Socialist state is under attack. The integrity and the stability of the entire Cuban social order is being attacked with this activity that is adorned with a peaceful and humanitarian touch. This is not so, because it does not have a trace of humanitarianism. Actually, it was antipatriotic, and this was demonstrated at the trial. [end recording] The trial, which was held on 29 March, complied with all guarantees specified in procedural rules that are currently in force in the country. In keeping with Article 59 of the Constitution of the Republic of Cuba, this trial involved a competent court by virtue of laws that were in force prior to the perpetration of the crime and conformed to the formalties it established. Lawyer (Juan Escandel Ramirez) defended the accused, Rodolfo Gonzalez Gonzalez. The defense may appeal, in keeping with Article 67, Paragraph 1, of the Penal Procedure Law, before the Havana City People's Provincial Court within five days of the ruling.
