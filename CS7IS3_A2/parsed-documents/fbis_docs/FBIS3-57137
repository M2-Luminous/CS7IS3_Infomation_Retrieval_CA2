The place and date of the interview are not given. Shokhin is asked to comment on what he thinks the government should be doing. Shokhin says: "The most preferable government policy would be to continue maintaining the policy of the past few months. Any sudden fluctuations would only be worse. Continuing the line of the Chernomyrdin government would mean continuing the policy of improving the financial health and stability of the Russian economy, while, at the same time, taking account of the economy's problems and a policy of renouncing shock methods. The most difficult thing here is finding the golden mean." Shokhin goes on to regret that experienced government members who had learned from their mistakes were leaving the government: "I think both the president and the prime minister should keep all those willing to work at this difficult time. One should not, of course, be raising the issue of satisfying all the ultimatums coming from absolutely everyone. However, I do think that sensible compromises should be made here. Unfortunately, the present government crisis was, of course, prompted by the not very well-timed decree on the reorganization of the Cabinet." Shokhin then gives his forecast of what the compositon of the new Cabinet would be: "It is known that First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets will be remaining first vice premier. The long, drawn-out discussion between Fedorov and Zaveryukha has to end with the resignation of one of them." He says he could not say who might replace Gaydar on the economic portfolio: "I doubt it would be Yavlinskiy, because that would entail a long period during which the prime minister and the new father of reforms would have to get to know each other and learn how to work together." Yavlinskiy, he says, criticized Gaydar for many months, and his reforms would be different anyway. Shokhin goes on to say that people with previous economic experience, like Soskovets and people who wish to continue reforms, should work together. Shokhin says he was given the CIS portfolio, but he rejected it. A ministerial post is not enough to deal with such a wide remit, he says, you have to have wider powers. He says he was also offered the economics portfolio, but says he cannot give his final answer until he knows the identity of the deputy prime minister in charge of macro-economic affairs. He concludes by saying: "To be honest, I cannot say whether I will remain in the government, although, to be honest, it is more interesting to work in the government than in the Duma, as far as I am concerned."
