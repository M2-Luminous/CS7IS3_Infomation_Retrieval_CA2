Judging from initial reports received from the Belgian capital three main questions will take a central place on the session agenda. First, can the transatlantic alliance be maintained now that the Cold War has ended and the United States is terminating its military presence in Europe, and if so, how can this be done? Second is the relationship between NATO and its former adversaries -- the states making up the Warsaw Pact, many of which, as well as Lithuania, Macedonia, and a number of others, are persistently knocking on the bloc's door. Third, what kind of future does the alliance have in general, and what tasks is it designed to fulfill now? In addition, at the insistence of France and the Netherlands, there will be a debate about whether bombing strikes should be made on Serb positions in connection with the latest exacerbation of the situation in the area of Sarajevo. We will have to wait a day or two for the results of the discussion of all these questions. But even now it is clear that no NATO Council session has ever attracted such attention as the one now taking place in Brussels. An avalanche of speeches, statements, publications, and comments has swamped the public. The most diverse opinions are being expressed. The British SUNDAY TIMES, for example, claims that the North Atlantic alliance is on the brink of a slow death because the reason for its existence has disappeared. While THE NEW YORK TIMES observer W. Safire calls on NATO leaders to take advantage of the "temporary weakening of Russia" to expand the bloc and include East European countries in it. U.S President Bill Clinton also agrees with the need to review the alliance's role. But he believes that efforts must be channeled into developing partnership with East European countries, including those which previously comprised the USSR. And, THE WASHINGTON POST observed, he has taken on a solemn duty: America will play a leading role, "linking" the stable, democratic states of the West with the emerging democracies of the East in the military and economic spheres and in the sphere of creating democratic institutions. This purpose should be served by the "Partnership for Peace" program, which will essentially be an intensification of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council's activity. The question of expanding NATO is not being put on the agenda now because it carries the risk of dividing Europe into blocs and drawing new demarcation lines on its map.
