[Mitsuharu Ito] I've maintained for some time that economic problems between the United States and Japan should be settled through talks according to international rules. But among Japan's economists this view seems to be in the minority--that is, with the exception of Ryutaro Komiya. Of course international rules are quite different from domestic laws and tend to carry little weight, I know. But that's all the more reason we have to try to follow them and make them more effective. I don't believe Japan has in any way been trying to do this recently. Rather, it has been doing the opposite in trying to resolve its current trade problems. This was the case with regard to the semiconductor dispute and it is also the case this time in regard to mobile communications. In fact, I feel there's even a certain danger in the way the issue was resolved. To take life insurance, for example. The United States is making certain demands on Japan. Americans see that foreign firms have a 4.2-percent share of Japan's insurance market. Compared to other OECD countries (excluding Japan, of course), this share is just too small, particularly when compared with the European Community countries. They want it raised to a two-digit figure. This is only fair, they say. So, using this as proof that Japan's market is closed, they say we should introduce the broker system into Japan. It's a system we don't currently have, but it is a characteristic of the U.S. life insurance market. What Japan has instead is a system where insurance companies set up their own insurance agencies to represent them. In the United States, on the other hand, consumers go to a broker, tell him what kind of insurance coverage they want and ask him to find a good company to represent them. Based on this difference in their systems, Americans complain that Japan's market is closed. Therefore, they say there are obstacles preventing their access to Japan's markets. This same kind of claim can be seen in recent negotiations between Japan and the United States over other matters. I'd like to ask Mr. Ishiguro, then, what exactly does "market access" mean? [Kazunori Ishiguro] "Market access" came into vogue about the mid-1980's. It's a term that still hasn't been formally defined. To be frank, my own personal view is that [Americans] are very cleverly playing on the symbolic meaning of the term to get [Japan] to swallow their demands and somehow think it understands what the term means. At the Uruguay Round of GATT talks, people were speaking about "market access negotiations" as if everyone just naturally knew what was meant. But after a while, it was used to include so many different demands, one couldn't tell anymore what it meant. In the life insurance example we just took up, the term was "equitable market access." In the case of mobile communications, the term people are using is "comparable market access." What these terms mean, in effect, is: if Japan has a 20-percent share of our market, then we should have a 20-percent share of Japan's market. It's that kind of simplistic argument. But rather than rebutting the other side's argument point by point on its theoretical merits, we cave in and make concessions. So the situation keeps deteriorating until we're at the point where we are today. At the recent Uruguay Round of talks, final steps were being taken to create an international body, the World Trade Organization (WTO), to take a comprehensive approach to matters concerning intellectual property rights and trade in goods and services. As far as I'm aware, this is the first time the term "market access" appears in a trade agreement concerning services. Services aren't the only area that will be affected, however. The entire trade issue will be affected. And what would simply have been negotiations to raise tariffs has been made over into market access talks. Japan doesn't usually catch on fully to that kind of subtle difference. So, the idea of market access has somehow gotten mixed in with the idea of nontariff barriers, which came out of the Tokyo Round [of GATT talks], and rather than just eliminating tariffs, we begin talking about eliminating all kinds of other barriers. Finally, the emphasis shifts and we're employing the concept of "market access." What we have to do, I think, is look back over GATT's long history and with the disciplined eye of the historian and scholar see whether this direction was really part of the natural course of events and whether the argument that has been developed, particular the argument the Americans have developed (the European Community is arguing a similar position) really has any merits to support it. Another thing. When did this argument about "unfair trade" develop? According to some people, it is one of the major principles informing the GATT agreement. But the words "fair" or "unfair" are never directly mentioned in the original GATT agreement. Article 6 of the agreement establishes certain steps that can be taken against violators of antidumping rules or against [government] subsidies, but gradually more things were added to expand the content of Article 6, and it came to be linked to debates on unfair trade. Then, the differences in the various economic systems got emphasized and countries were told to "Americanize" their ways. But there were also deep-rooted reasons for countries to resist this "harmonization" of their respective systems, so naturally, it wasn't possible to change everything over to the American way. Americans consider Japan its easiest target, and Japan has been their first line of attack. Japan doesn't understand this and, being solicitous toward the United States, quickly makes concessions. That attitude on Japan's part, wouldn't you say, has contributed to the present state of confusion the world is in. I think we should approach U.S.-Japan trade problems in the same way we would a damage suit. If Japan just says "yes" to the other party's demands, no matter how unreasonable, without any opposition, then that means Japan agrees to accept the other party's demands and the case is closed. In effect, it is acknowledging that the other party was right. What Are GATT's Principles? [Ito] With regard to the differences in our systems... if we go back in history to the formation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), we'll see, just as we see in GATT's case, that it was right after the end of World War II, and people believed that their future economies would be very closely tied to the economies of other countries. People also reflected on the situation before the war. They asked themselves: could the sort of conflicts that arose in the past when different economic systems came into contact have been avoided? If so, let's create the kind of mechanisms that will prevent those conflicts in the future, they said. So, what emerged is the so-called national treatment principle which is found in Article 3 of the GATT agreement. In other words, this means you extend the same freedom you extend to your country's own companies, citizens, and property to foreign companies, citizens, and property, without discrimination. This, I think, is one of the principles contained in GATT. Recently, however, this principle seems to be coming apart. If you can imagine, there are even some Japanese theorists who are now following the same logic as the Americans'--namely, the logic that sees whatever is "American" as "universal." U.S. demands ignore the principle of treating foreigners in the same way one treats nationals--the principle established by GATT's founding fathers--in favor of the principle of mutuality. [Ishiguro] I think there are several issues here. First of all, and here I'm thinking primarily of the insurance problem, bilateral rules haven't been established by most countries with regard to financial services, including insurance, and the trade services agreement, which was recently drawn up, still doesn't officially go into effect for awhile. But that agreement was drawn up at the Uruguay Round to move international trade in services as close as possible to GATT's basic principle regarding trade in goods. So, the "national treatment" principle you were talking about also becomes one of the agreement's basic principles. GATT was set up, from a legal point of view, according to the principle of equal opportunity, which combines both the principles of national treatment and most-favored-nation treatment. [Ito] "Liberalization," the term we hear so often, doesn't actually appear in GATT but we can find it here [in the principle of equal opportunity] if we look. [Ishiguro] "To liberalize" means to set free of restrictions. It means affording countries an equal opportunity. Article 6, which I mentioned earlier, is odd given how GATT was set up on the basis of equal opportunity. It seems to me that the original intent of Article 6 has been gradually broadened until we have the situation we have today. In GATT, we also find the idea of mutuality, which was mentioned. In the past, this principle was thought of in terms of reciprocity, or the idea of countries making mutual concessions with regard to tariffs. But here, too, the idea of mutuality changed along with the emergence of debates about unfair trade or the kind of results-oriented approach we find in demands to secure a market share. I think these latest developments are wrong and we should return to our original point of departure. Another term that is used a lot is "borderless economy." It doesn't necessarily mean that we will have a uniform, homogenous set of laws that will apply universally to every country, regardless of national boundaries. "Harmonization" is another term in popular use. But the fact that the term is used in a different way in Japan than it is in the United States concerns me very much. If we are going to think about world harmony, then we should get to the true meaning of "harmonization." We ought to find it has an entirely different meaning. Compared to the efforts being made toward harmonization based on comparative law, Americans are coming from an entirely different place, with American rules reflecting the U.S. desire to export. I think this [difference in perspective] is what's behind U.S.-Japan trade frictions and in the background of the Uruguay Round. Danger of Reverse Discrimination [Ito] The term "market access" seems to me to have been very cleverly fabricated. It carries the nuance that consumers can have access to whatever goods and services they want whenever they want them. By drawing on that nuance, the term leaves the impression that an economic system without adequate market access isn't to the consumers' benefit. Like a conjurer, it seems to cast this spell over us. But it's not clear what the term really means. Another point--the issue of what is "fair" or "unfair." When a foreign enterprise can't enter another country's market because their systems differ, I don't think the problem should necessarily be considered in terms of "fairness" or "unfairness." The claim that something is "unfair" because of such differences is really a demand by latecomers to get a larger share of the market. It seems to me to be nothing more than a call for reverse discrimination. I think "reverse discrimination" is one of those words we'll find tucked away in the demand for market access. [Ishiguro] Yes, just as you point out. There's very symbolic meaning to the fact that the concept of market access should have come from the area of trade in services. Systems in various countries differ markedly in this area. Where services are a government monopoly--for example, this was the case in communications--even nationals were excluded from the field. If we were to afford foreigners "national treatment"--in other words, if we were to treat them the same way we treat our own citizens--then foreigners couldn't enter the field either. Even with national treatment, there would be no improvement in market access. "Market access" in such a case, then, means forcing open your trading partner's market in order to get in, so the term, from the start, goes beyond the idea of national treatment. [Ito] How is this issue being resolved in the Uruguay Round of talks? [Ishiguro] The services trade agreement was framed in such a way as to recognize market access. And this became one of the major focuses of debate. Fortunately, Japan's young bureaucrats persevered in Geneva, and I think we can safely say the term, "market access," has been fleshed out and stripped in principle of the idea of numerical quotas in the final form of the accord proper. However, in the case of financial services, a codicil of sorts has been added--an "article of agreement recognizing (and committing to) the deregulation of financial services. In effect, it says: Even in policies meant to be nondiscriminatory, reverse discrimination [preferential treatment of nonnationals over nationals] is sanctioned in order to recognize the entrance of foreign enterprises into national markets. It may become an issue--for example, if Japan's life insurance companies are unfairly discriminated against--but until that [problem] arises, foreigners, it says, should be given preferential treatment. It's hard to believe, but after the Uruguay Round was concluded, the Japanese Government announced it would deregulate financial services based on this "article of agreement." This is truly to practice reverse discrimination. In short, what's in this article of agreement is exactly what the United States was demanding all along. There seems to be a certain consistency in what the United States has been advocating. But what does this all mean for Japan? According to what is in the article of agreement, it means Japan will practice reverse discrimination. The Japanese Government hasn't taken a steadfast position on this point. Nor, to make matters worse, is it a point that has been of much interest to Japan's economists. Concerning Mobile Phones [Ito] This can really be said to be part of the U.S. strategic trade policy. A classic example comes to mind in the recent problem over mobile phones. I'd like to go back over the problem to illustrate a point. The trouble began with the Market-Oriented Sector-Selective (MOSS) talks in January 1986, when Japan acceded to U.S. demands that it open our mobile phone market to the frequency used by Motorola's equipment. American television, for example, uses a different frequency than does European television. There are about three different systems being used in the world. At the time of the MOSS talks, the United States demanded that multiple formats--the format used by United States, by Europe, etc.--all be made available in a single country, though this was something that had never been accomplished before. What format a country uses had been left to each country to decide for itself. Japan was the first to recognize two formats for mobile phones. Supposedly, this was to encourage competition and would be good for the consumer. With this decision, the Japanese Government then assumed the problem had been solved. This MOSS conference was the occasion for bilateral negotiations between the United States and Japan. But given the experiences before World War II, when the logic of the strong prevailed in bilateral talks, the push after the war has been toward multilateral negotiations, and GATT has advocated the idea of each of the parties concerned making mutual concessions. This MOSS conference, however, violated that convention. In April of the following year (1987), Nippon Ido Tsushin Corp. (IDO) set up a system to accommodate both the formats of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) and Motorola in the Tokyo area and in central Japan. Daini Denden (DDI) used Motorola's format in the remaining areas. NTT Docomo, on the other hand, set up a parallel nationwide network to accommodate the NTT transmission format. Since then Motorola has claimed, through the office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), that Japan has not gone far enough in opening its market and has continued to demand that it be allocated more frequencies and that additional relay stations be set up to handle calls using its phones. In talks between Motorola and IDO, which is a private corporation, the latter rejected as economically unfeasible the idea of setting up additional relay stations for Motorola. More recently, however, negotiations have resulted in an acceptance of Motorola's demands as the result of pressure from the U.S. Government. Also accepted was the U.S. demand that a certain amount of Motorola terminal equipment be sold on Japan's market. In effect, what was essentially a problem between two private enterprises and should have been decided by the consumer in a free market was thus resolved in a pact between two governments, forcing the demands of a private enterprise to be met. If Japan had ever made similar demands of the United States, Americans would be outraged and wouldn't even consider them worth discussing. Specifically, in IDO's case: about 10,000 phones were using Motorola's format, 310,000 were equipped to accommodate NTT's format. One of the demands was to even these figures out. There are 400 relay stations that can accommodate NTT's format and 110 which can accommodate Motorola's phone equipment. Motorola wanted 80 more relay stations deployed by April and another 130 within two years. Adding this many relay stations will require an investment of about 30 billion yen. For Japan IDO, this is a huge amount of money and, I think, will be an economic hardship on the company. Yet, it is the government that is backing this disregard for the economics of the situation. That's not all. While the threat of invoking Super 301 [provisions under the 1988 Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act; expired in 1990 and revived in March 1994] was forcing an agreement between these two private enterprises, Japan's minister of posts and telecommunications and the U.S. ambassador to Japan were giving official recognition to the agreement in order to elevate it to the level of a pact between the two governments. If this hadn't been done and the United States imposed sanctions against Japan through Super 301, the Japanese Government was afraid even if it appealed the case to GATT, without an existing agreement between governments, the case wouldn't constitute a GATT violation and Japan would lose its appeal. [Ishiguro] From what you say, I can see that various issues are involved. But to jump ahead and give my conclusion, I'd say, if another agreement already exists in addition to the special pact between governments, even if Japan appeals to GATT, it's in a very unfavorable position. I can see it all very clearly. But since there are various background factors to consider, maybe we should go over these point by point. First, I think we should begin by explaining what's strange about what the U.S. government is saying. On the one hand, it is appealing to the principle of competition and the market mechanism, claiming Japan must open its markets. In other words, it's arguing from the perspective of private enterprise. On the other hand, it ignores the logic of a private enterprise like IDO. If we want to understand the rationale behind what the United States is saying, I think we can find it in the idea of affirmative action. This is the idea, which has emerged as an issue within American society, that is used to secure the rights of ethnic minorities, Blacks, and women. Affirmative action presupposes a person has been discriminated against in the past. In the case we've been discussing, the logic behind the U.S. actions would be that it has been discriminated against and treated very badly by Japan. When there is no attempt to redress the situation of those victimized by discrimination, the argument goes, then you end up with a socially very untenable situation. Therefore, according to this logic, reverse discrimination is acceptable. At the same time, according to decisions handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court, unless there is actual proof that a person has been discriminated against, this kind of reverse discrimination can't be recognized. This kind of proof doesn't exist in Japan's case. So, in lieu of any proof of past discrimination, the United States wants the Japanese Government to hand over a document. Assumed implicitly in the document is the U.S. claim of past discrimination. And on the basis of that claim, promises are made in writing. And once those promises have been made, it becomes a pact between the two governments in which Japan recognizes the U.S. style of affirmative action, and reverse discrimination is justified. This seems to be the sort of argument the United States is trying to go with. Therefore, it would behoove the Japanese Government when sending documents overseas to carefully review them as if they were contracts and to carefully study the logic behind them. If this sort of "check" has been adequate, I would think Japan has a good chance to win its appeal when it goes before GATT, even in the [Motorola-IDO] case. Given these assumptions, I would say Japan's biggest mistake was in not having gone to GATT with a case it might easily have won. Instead, concerned about what the United States might do, it settles the matter in a vague, ambiguous way. [Ito] The same could be said in the case of semiconductors, too, can't it? [Ishiguro] The logic [strategy] developed by the United States began around the time of the U.S.-Japan semiconductor accord. Thus, there's a precedent for a trade policy which tries to establish numerical targets. Yesterday's experience becomes today's truth. In the case of the semiconductor negotiations between the United States and Japan, one side said guarantee us a market share and, for some reason or another, the other side came up with 20 percent. It is the same with the vaguely worded agreement on auto parts that came out of President Bush's visit to Japan. So there was the semiconductor accord, then the auto parts accord. Using these two as a springboard, the U.S. government then, at the recent U.S.-Japan summit meeting, urges a trade policy on Japan that is results-oriented and tries to establish numerical targets. But Japan's officials--particularly those from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] and the Ministry of Finance--have gone all-out to build a barrier-wall. Because the Americans can't crack the wall, they turn to officials at the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications who have been standing to the rear of the stage, and whip out their "301" hammer. And when they do, Japan's officials, trained by long years of tradition to react like Pavlov's dogs, finally end up giving in to a compromise agreement. [Ito] Encouraged by its success with mobile phones, the United States is also applying its strategic trade policy to auto parts. Its set up numerical targets for auto parts and is trying to get private enterprises to buy a specified number of such parts. Toyota and Nissan have begun to comply. This is very dangerous, I think. Also behind these problems is the tendency of Japan's bureaucrats to accommodate the other party's demands without officially agreeing to do so and then having their solicitude turned into a firm commitment. This is also the case with regard to auto parts. As soon as the United States sees that private enterprises will accommodate some of its demands, it comes with a request to the Japanese Government that it somehow put these things down in writing. I can't help feeling this is all done as a safeguard in the event that Japan brings the matter up before GATT. [Ishiguro] The U.S. strategy is very simplistic. In other words, Americans see everything in terms of lawsuits and litigation. In fact, lawyers hold very important positions in government. It is in this sense that I have been saying U.S.-Japan trade disputes should be considered in the same light as lawsuits among companies. It is in this sense, too, that we shouldn't go around writing up strange letters of agreement, since that alone is enough to lose us our case. Are Japan's Markets "Closed"? [Ito] Another legal question I have is this: with whom does the burden of proof lie when the United States accuses Japan of having closed markets or of having regulations that close its markets off to other countries? [Ishiguro] Normally, of course, the burden of proof in a civil suit would fall on the United States. In GATT's case, too, if it is a question of resolving a dispute--to take the case, for example, of mobile phones--the United States would state the nature of the problem and Japan, in turn, might argue that, as the result of negotiations between the two countries, the case boiled down to a question of "comparable market access." [Ito] And the United States would then have to prove its claim, I guess. [Ishiguro] In GATT's case, the term, "burden of proof," isn't necessarily something one customarily hears. But basically, that's what it boils down to. So, in the mobile phone case, Japan should have just sat still and waited. [Ito] Yes. We should have just had the United States prove where and in what way Japan's markets were closed. The reason I say I'm in the minority is that Japan's economists take it for granted that Japan's markets are relatively closed in nature. [Ishiguro] I can't understand that. However, in terms of distribution, I have a feeling that the tenor of debate has changed somewhat. Before, there seems to have been some scholars who thought Japan's distribution system was a problem. The tone in recent arguments, however, seems to be that Japan's system has its own inherent rationality. [Ito] Speaking of distribution, about five years ago, an Italian delegation of distributors and a French delegation came to Japan and said our markets were about the most convenient for the consumer than anywhere else in the world. Objectively speaking, the retail industry is extremely competitive. For every 5 percent of the retailers who go under, another 5 percent enter the market. When we compare international figures on sales profit ratios and turnover, we certainly can't say Japan's markets aren't competitive. I have the feeling that international comparisons of this sort really aren't being made. To take the example of the life insurance industry. As far as regulations are concerned, there are far more controls on the industry in the United States. There are also a great many state regulations. With land, too. The United States has a lot of regulations. Japan not only has fewer of them, the ones that exist tend to be ignored. Of course, besides the regulations that are explicitly written into law, the Japanese receive what can only be called an excessive amount of "guidance." At the same time, this isn't to say the fewer regulations there are, the better off we are. There are a lot of areas in society where some restrictions are necessary. For example, if we climb to the top of "Sunshine City" at night and look down, we'll see bright, glittering neon signs of every color and hue. In Paris or London, there are no such displays. That's because there are regulations concerning neon signs. Some people are all in favor of relaxing regulations. But if city plans are drawn up without any regulations--restricting supermarkets or whatever--our cities would be in complete chaos. Necessary regulations of this kind are far too few in Japan. Words like "relaxing regulations" have a magic ring to them, they have a certain value judgment attached to them, and are similar in this sense to words like "market access." Finally, we're told: Because Japan has such a large surplus, it has to meet the Americans halfway." Personally, I find this reasoning rather odd. But I'm in such a minority, probably no one other than Mr. Komiya subscribes to my view. I don't believe we'll find an international rule anywhere that tells the creditor nation it has to take steps on behalf of the debtor nation. The United States once took the same position, gaining the support of [then former] secretary of state [Cordell] Hull, when the IMF was being formed. It was the United States that rejected the idea of a creditor nation's "shared responsibility. It based its position on the argument for self-responsibility; namely, that a debtor nation should take the responsibility upon itself to correct its own deficit; that IMF would provide funds to the debtor nation during this period of adjustment, thus preventing any drastic adjustments from occurring; and that the World Bank would provide the necessary loan to enable long-term structural changes to take place. However, the United States is now essentially talking about the shared responsibility of creditor nations. In reality, I don't think it would serve any purpose to lay the burden of responsibility on a creditor nation when suitable adjustments haven't been undertaken by the debtor country. I believe views like mine are definitely not in the minority among the world's economists. In fact, a similar claim was made in a 1987 report issued by the U.S. President's Advisory Council. Professor Baguatei [as transliterated], a leading international economic theorist, is also saying the same thing. But since it can't reverse itself on its earlier claim, the United States talks instead about there not being sufficient market access or about our markets being closed, thus shifting the blame onto another country. I can't help but think this is the case. [Ishiguro] I think that in the relationship between our countries--especially in regard to trade negotiations concerning services--there's going to be a problem agreeing on what the end goal for deregulation should be. In listening to the claims of the United States and the EC, it looks like they're going to be arguing that an entirely deregulated environment is the best. That's entirely nonsense when it comes to financial services. Anyone who remembers what happened with the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), for example, would know that. There was a time, quite awhile ago, when problems in the securities field were causing the general investor in Japan a lot of trouble, and to prevent such things from happening in the future, regulations here were strengthened. Every country has undergone a similar experience: either because of tradition or some development in the past, they have all at one time or another introduced regulations into certain areas of their society. To ignore such regulations entirely and argue that it's good to ease restrictions is just too simplistic. If we don't argue, first of all, how illogical such a view is, we're never going to resolve the issue and will end up sinking deeper and deeper into a quagmire. Japan Should Be Consistent [Ito] When [our trade] problems cut deep into the center of our financial sector or the auto industry and other parts of our economy, I don't think those in the business world are going to tolerate the situation any longer. I've been saying for quite awhile that if America is going to invoke Super 301 provisions against us, the earlier it's done, the better. We should appeal to GATT and fight such a move. Even if the United States loses, it probably won't back down but, again, that's all right. When we look at the world economies, we have to wonder if developing nations can fight a powerful country like the United States and appeal their case to GATT should the United States impose Super 301 sanctions against them. The only ones powerful enough to fight Super 301 are the EC countries and Japan. EC has done it. Japan must stand firm with regard to maintaining fairness in world trade and supporting GATT. For example, even if Super 301 is imposed against us, Japan should consider that one of the costs of preserving certain world principles. The fewer victims there are, the better; the sooner this comes to pass, the better. This is what I've been saying. But, the ranks of those who fall victim are steadily growing, and the negative repercussions keep multiplying and spreading. The United States is not the whole of the world. Of course, there are many things there that have universal value. At the same time, there are many examples from its past history where mistakes have been made. For example, out of its confrontational relationship to the president, Congress may enact legislation that violates international rules. The president may not apply the law as strictly as intended. And, in the end, Congress may repeal the law on its own, having recognized the error of its ways. In this sense, American culture is still young. If Japan does not act at such times to correct the United States and its actions, what hope can we hold for the future of the world economy? Those in business and international trade and industry complain that academicians make such statements because they have no vested interest in such matters. "Think about our position," they say. Unfortunately, I have the feeling that over the past 10 years their situation has been getting worse. [Ishiguro] Basically, I totally agree. Only, I think there are also two schools within MITI. Of the two, the traditionalists are solicitous of the United States and have made a series of concessions to the Americans. But MITI has also cultivated the kind of agency it takes to put out publications like the Industrial Structure Council's Unfair Trade Report. Staff has already put out the 1992 and 1993 reports and the 1994 edition is now being worked on. The report maintains that multinationalism, if carried out on the basis of international rules, can take us wherever we want to go. I would highly recommend it. Finally, I would like to direct the discussion to our views on four basic points. First of all, I think we can say Japan's policy toward the United States, to put it simply, has been to see the world through U.S. eyes. To go a step further, the world has only existed for us somewhere beyond the shadows of the United States. We have to correct this attitude. Hideo Tanaka, an eminent scholar of English and American law, among others, has said that Americans have relatively little interest in getting an objective, comparative view of the laws and regulations that exist in other countries. In other words, the world is up against a large yet uniquely different country which has a tendency to try to judge the rest of the world by its own standards. If Japan finds itself thinking it would like to join with developing countries to better the world, it will have to be more prepared than it is now to speak clearly and frankly to the United States. Second, there are certain to be various occasions when Japan will consider appealing a matter to GATT, and the United States, of course, will try to get Japan's politicians to step in. The question is: How will our politicians respond? Third, when the Motorola problem came up, for example, the argument was that, since it had to do with communications, it was the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunication's problem, but even within MITI, people were arguing that the problem started because their suggestion to ease regulations hadn't been followed. Self-contradictory arguments like this occurred. Then, the Industrial Structure Council released a document opposing the United States' strategic trade policy, and at the U.S.-Japan summit meeting that followed, a clear "no" was voiced. It seems rather odd considering what was happening prior to the summit. When the problem occurs in someone else's backyard, we brush it aside, saying it doesn't concern us. You have reason, certainly, to feel apprehensive. This problem, the one which arose with regard to Motorola, is also a problem that affects our financial sector, it is a problem that affects the auto industry, and since it could occur in any other industry as well, it's a problem that cuts across every sector in our economy. We have to be strongly cognizant of this fact. The final issue I'd like to bring up is Japan's mass media. We said "no" at the U.S.-Japan summit, and the talks were said to have "broken down." "To break down" is an odd phrase. It was natural to say "no" at the summit, and I expected more than a certain amount of support from our mass media people overseas. In fact, when Japan said "no," it had done something it normally doesn't do, and it seemed the line to any future negotiations had been cut off. At least, that was the view of the media. It was then that the media people began looking for a scapegoat, and locking steps with the Americans, started saying how unusual and odd Japan's bureaucrats were. We researchers too were targeted. Then, concerned about what the United States would do, a segment of the economic community started to call for a compromise to be reached. It was in this context that the Motorola problem emerged. As soon as Japan swallowed the entire set of American demands, the media immediately moved on to other things, as though the matter had been settled. This despite the fact that our young bureaucrats--in Washington and elsewhere--were hard at work trying to correct any American misapprehensions. This lack of consistency, is spreading its way throughout all of Japanese society, including the mass media, wouldn't you say? I have the feeling this is structurally Japan's weakest point. [Ito] I think that Japan's economists, especially those who were educated after the war, don't view the United States in relative [as opposed to absolute] terms. Those before them saw the United States from Europe's perspective, so they understood the unique character and idiosyncratic elements of American society. The lack of such a perspective has become a weakness among our economists. For example, consider the U.S. patent system. Is it being assessed in the context of international law? Americans adhere to the first-to-invent principle when it concerns their own companies, their own discoveries, their own inventors. That's the reason there are so many industrial secrets. Unlike Japan or Europe, they don't adhere to the first-to-apply principle. Yet, despite upholding the first-to-invent rule among their own enterprises, they follow the first-to-apply rule for foreign companies, foreign products, and foreign inventors. This is a violation of GATT's principle of nondiscrimination, which says foreigners and nationals have to be afforded the same treatment. The United States is a country where its systems are always in a state of flux. Japan's economists don't realize that and are too intent on seeing its present systems as absolute, immutable entities. I think we have to view the world with slightly more attention to its diversity.
