As world experience indicates, it is necessary to designate various groups of enterprises and apply different methods to them. Everywhere that privatization has occurred, a combination of forms took place. State property is privatized through vouchers, redemption, and auctions. In Ukraine it is planned to conduct privatization principally (or even exclusively) with the certificate method. Are we going our own way? Privatization can be conducted by the direct method (for cash and credit resources) and with vouchers (coupons, certificates)--free of charge, or at a low price (as in the Czech Republic). It must be noted that privatization that is free of charge is not such a simple and easy solution, as some naively think. It accelerates privatization, but it produces less significant results, for it does not attract additional capital, it diffuses stocks, and it complicates the management of property. Large enterprises are privatized by means of vouchers. Poland's experience indicates that the best method of privatizing large enterprises is their transformation into joint-stock companies and the sale of stock on the securities market. Small-scale privatization in the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary was carried out through auctions of stores, restaurants, dining halls, hotels, and workshops. It is fundamental that the center initiated small-scale privatization, but it was implemented by regional organs. Public auctions were the main method of small-scale privatization, and large-scale privatization--open conversion to joint-stock companies. Those who want to buy propose privatization projects. A competition of projects occurs, whose criteria of evaluation are quality and availability of financial support. Obviously, large-scale privatization in Ukraine without large investment funds and foreign capital is unrealistic. On the other hand, if privatized enterprises do not operate successfully, then a crash of privatized funds is inevitable, inasmuch as they will not be able to pay dividends. As world practice shows, the privileges of a labor collective in the process of privatization are unsuitable. In the Czech Republic no one received special privileges. The trade unions demanded special rights for the labor collectives, and even threatened to go on strike, but no privileges were given to labor collectives. The only thing the workers received was credit for the purchase of enterprises on condition of a high-quality privatization project. The Ukrainian model of privatization envisions privileges for the labor collective and managers of enterprises. Are we again taking another path? World privatization experience indicates that the redemption of an enterprise by a labor collective is not feasible and ineffective. It is not privatization "in the true sense of the word." In Chile enterprises were privatized through redemption by a labor collective, but they went bankrupt, and the state bought them out and subsequently privatized them. In enterprises that are redeemed by a collective, as a rule, innovations and investments are lacking, and the predominant part of profits goes to the wage fund... It is not difficult to forecast that if we take the path of a transfer of enterprises to labor collectives, the problem of bankruptcy and re-privatization will inevitably arise. Ukraine is implementing privatization by means of pre-privatization measures; i.e., it is taking not a direct but a roundabout path. Moreover, pre-privatization measures are treated as privatization intentionally or through misunderstanding. Commercialization, incorporation, leasing, closed conversion to a joint-stock company, and redemption by a labor collective are still not privatization but a complex of pre-privatization measures. The stock of a closed joint-stock company cannot be sold--it is not liquid. If there is no right of ownership to a part of property--this means that there is no private property. What is occurring in Ukraine is collectivization, not privatization. The opinion exists that the only possible and strictly Ukrainian path of privatization is leasing. What can be said in this regard? Leasing property is not excluded, but it should be associated with a search for investors. In our country, leasing hampers privatization. Leasing is destatization in the framework of state property, and it can only be discussed within the framework of pre-privatization measures. The lease contract expires the day of full privatization. The privileges of the leasing collective consist only in the fact that it knows its enterprise well and that it can propose the kind of privatization project that will win in a competition. In many countries a serious problem of privatization crediting exists. Credits for those who desire to take part in privatization are extended by commercial banks. Without a bank reference, it is impossible to take part in an auction or competition of projects. In the Czech Republic, 10 percent (40 billion krona) of the total sum of credit resources of the country were allocated under privatization. Ukraine does not have any real credit resources, and its most severe problem is lack of capital. In this connection, the creation and development of a credit resources market and a securities market is of vitally important significance. In the process of privatization, the search for a real property owner and a strategic investor who proposes a strategic plan for development of an enterprise and finances is of decisive significance. Investment banks, funds and companies, insurance funds, joint-stock companies, and physical persons perform the role of such an investor. A majority of enterprises of Ukraine are not competitively capable, in connection with which it is necessary to make capital investments. A strong investor is needed who will invest resources and improve the financial situation. In our country commercial banks most of all could be such investors. It must be clearly realized: Without a resolution of the question of the strategic investor, privatization in Ukraine will be reduced to collectivization.
