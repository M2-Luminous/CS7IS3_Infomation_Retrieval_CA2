FR940711-0-00037 FR940711-0-00006 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;21&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8957; AD 94&hyph;14&hyph;05] Airworthiness Directives; Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes, that requires removal of the actuator from the fuel-ballast transfer valve, and installation of a locking device on the fuel-ballast transfer valve. This amendment is prompted by a report that the fuel-ballast transfer valve on certain airplanes must be modified to ensure the valve is closed at all times. If the transfer valve is open during flight, the fuel supply to the engines may be reduced during cross-feed operation to the extent that fuel starvation could occur. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent engine flameout due to fuel starvation. DATES: Effective August 10, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of August 10, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Fokker Aircraft USA, Inc., 1199 North Fairfax Street, Alexandria, Virginia 22314. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street NW., suite 700, Washington, DC.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes was published in the Federal Register on March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14799). That action proposed to require removal of the actuator from the fuel-ballast transfer valve, and installation of a locking device on the fuel-ballast transfer valve. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the single comment received. The commenter supports the proposed rule. After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. The FAA estimates that 5 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 0.5 work hour per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $250 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,387.50, or $277.50 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES .

Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. §39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: 94&hyph;14&hyph;05␣Fokker: Amendment 39&hyph;8957. Docket 94&hyph;NM&hyph;21&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes, serial numbers 11443, 11446 through 11449 inclusive, and 11456; certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent reduced fuel flow to the engines during crossfeed operations and the possibility of engine flameout, accomplish the following: (a) Within 30 days after the effective date of this AD, remove the actuator from the fuel-ballast transfer valve, part number 7933141J, and install a locking device on the fuel-ballast transfer valve, in accordance with Fokker Service Bulletin SBF100&hyph;28&hyph;029, Revision 1, dated November 30, 1993. (b) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. (c) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished.
