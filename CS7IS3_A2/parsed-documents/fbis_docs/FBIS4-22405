The purpose of the official visit was to settle trade-economic relations and to resolve questions on the renewal of air transportation from Krasnodar to Armenia, which was halted two months ago after the crash of a cargo plane that was heading for Gyumri. Besides other questions discussed by members of the delegation with Nikolay Yegorov, the head of the local administration, and Viktor Gladskiy, his deputy, problems were also touched upon that are associated with the migration of citizens of Armenia to Krasnodarskiy Kray. In the course of the conversations with the leadership of the kray, the possibility of the cooperation of law enforcement organs was discussed, and, in particular, the question was broached on the return of Armenian citizens located on the territory of Krasnodarskiy Kray who were army draft evaders. Three documents were signed as a result of the negotiations: "Agreement on the Principles of Trade-Economic Cooperation for 1994," "Provisional Agreement on the Conveyance of Cargoes by Air Transport," and an "Agreement on Cooperation in the Cultural- Educational and Scientific Sphere, and in the Sphere of Sports and Tourism." The members of the Armenian delegation had a meeting with representatives of the Armenian communities of Krasnodarskiy Kray.
