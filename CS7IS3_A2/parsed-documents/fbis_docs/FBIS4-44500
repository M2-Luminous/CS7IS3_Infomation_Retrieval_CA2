What Is the First Choice for Investment? An Interview With Xiao Jixin, a Hong Kong Businessman Investing in Hainan"] [Text] On 28 January, the author visited Hong Kong businessman Xiao Jixin, who had just returned to Hong Kong from Hainan. He spoke about the background of the tentative plan for Taiwan and Singapore to cooperate in the development of Hainan, the reaction related to news of the cooperative development, and the current opportunities, advantages, and potential choices for investment in Hainan. Xiao is a native of Hainan, who more than 10 years ago emigrated to Hong Kong, and has consistently been engaged with Hainan and Guangzhou-related real estate businesses. At present he is the Chairman of the Board of the Hong Kong Jinrong Industrial Corporation, Ltd, and the Hainan Sanya Huaya (Sino-foreign) Real Estate Development Corporation, Ltd. First Choice in Investment: Onshore Natural Gas According to Xiao Jixin, for the Taiwan Singapore cooperation in developing Hainan, the first choice investment point will be Sanya City. This is because Sanya is on Hainan's southern tip, and nearby Nanshan is the onshore site for taping natural gas. Because Taiwan and Singapore have put primacy on exploitation of Hainan's petroleum resources, they must establish a base in Sanya, and construct various types of service-oriented logistics facilities. In addition, Sanya is a scenic tourist vacation spot, with sunshine all year round, and winter temperatures that do not get below 17 degrees C. The sea water around Sanya is not polluted, and beaches have fine sand, all conditions that could help it become a first-class tourist vacation spot. Before Taiwan's Executive Yuan head Lien Chan visited Singapore, on December 20 of 1993, Singapore senior advisor Lee Kuan Yew took an airplane from the mainland making a special trip to Sanya, touching down at a coastguard airfield near Sanya. Lee's visit to Sanya was very possibly the background to the subsequent Lien Chan proposal during his Singapore visit for cooperative investment in Hainan. Ruan Chongwu Holds Meeting To Arrange Welcome for Taiwan Investment Xiao Jixin also brought along from Hainan local reaction to Lien Chan's proposed plan. According to Xiao, after he heard that Taiwan and Singapore were inclined towards investing in Hainan, the province's Governor Ruan Chongwu immediately convened office level cadres and various specialized corporation presidents, and held a meeting, to concretely give instructions about how to properly prepare for welcoming Taiwan investment. On 13 January, Ruan met with Taiwan reporters for an interview, and pointed out that at present there are excellent opportunities for investing in Hainan. Ruan's remarks were carried on the front page of the 14 January edition of HAINAN RIBAO. In addition, it is reported that when introducing some companies from China's hinterland to investment in Hainan, Ruan afterwards personally recommended Sanya. Why Sanya? In addition to the two factors described above (natural gas deposits and a tourist vacation spot), looking at the situation of Hainan as a whole, the northern city of Haikou naturally is the locale with the most investment from Taiwan and Hong Kong businessmen, but because it is already thriving, the investment costs are also much higher. Take real estate, for example: in Haikou City's most thriving area it costs 6000 yuan per square meter; while because development is Sanya has not yet gotten underway, real estate prices have been kept to 2500 to 3000 yuan per square meter. As for the Yangpu Zone, to be developed by Hong Kong's Xiongsu organization, because it is still in the planning stage, and also has no tourism resources, it will probably be around five years before development is likely to take off. Airport, Expressway Opening Mid-year Why has Sanya not been developed before now? Xiao Jixin points out that the major problem is transportation. Because Sanya is situated on the southern tip of Hainan, it does not have an airport (it only has a coast guard airport not open to the public), and in addition there is not highway from Haikou to Sanya. Many tour groups going from Haikou sit on a bus that reveals fantastic scenery like, but five or six hours are required to get to Sanya. Consequently, though there is a wonderful tourism environment, it is very difficult to attract tourists to struggle over long distances to come to Sanya. Many years ago, Hong Kong businessman Huo Yingdong at one point had a plan to invest in Sanya in the vicinity of Yalong (Dragon's Tooth) Bay. Yalong Bay is a 22 kilometer length bay with blue waves and fine sand, and the original plan could have built a vacation area on this spot, but because of the transportation problem, for several years no funds flowed in for investment. Up until last year, the plan had been on hold. This year in June an express highway from Haikou to Sanya will be open for traffic, and at that time it will only take over two hours to get to Sanya from Haikou. In addition, on 1 July of this year, the currently under construction Sanya Fenghuang (Phoenix) International Airport will open, and on that occasion, various Hong Kong and southeast Asian airlines will be able to fly directly into Sanya. This will inevitably lead to the thriving development of Sanya's tourist industry. Semi-Duty-Free Situation Will Foster Shopping Paradise What advantages are there to investing in Hainan? Since the CPC established Hainan as a province in 1988, the prerequisite of "open the first line, properly manage the second line" has been established. The so-called "opening the first line" involves changing the whole of Hainan Island into a low tariff "free island," and departing from Hainan and going to China's hinterland then requires going through customs procedures, and adopting so-called "proper handling" procedures. Central authorities have allowed Hainan a number of special policies. The most important of these includes: the importation of machinery facilities is completely duty free, and importing consumer goods (except tobacco and alcohol) is semi-duty-free. This condition alone is sufficient to make Hainan become a tourist and shopping paradise for mainlanders. Whichever consumer goods are able to gain semi-duty free status, mainlanders will come here and buy various types of things and bring them back, and this will offset tourism expenses. For this reason, after the issue of transportation has been solved, the running of large scale markets here should have bright prospects. In addition, the importation of facilities to produce consumer goods also should be a good business. When it comes to the aspect of taxing enterprise profits, Hainan's special policy is to only collect 15 percent, half the rate for enterprises on the mainland. This is one advantage. The other special policies of Hainan Province include: it is possible on Hainan to set up foreign invested banks; foreign investment generated hard currency profits can be freely taken remit abroad; land can be transferred with compensation, and can be divided up by one person and contracted for development; foreigners entering can get a "local visa" at Haikou or Sanya; Hainan has aviation rights, and can permit foreign airline corporations to open Hainan routes, and retain reciprocal flight rights. Nightlife Varied There is another advantage that is not explicitly spelled out in any regulations. This is the varied look and feel of Hainan's nightlife. At present Taiwan businesses have invested in a number of entertainment businesses in Haikou, including bars, restaurants, discos, dance halls, nightclubs, karaoke bars, etc. Allegedly, large bars are very strict about prostitutes, but in discos and dance halls, there are often several hundred good-looking women to choose from. In the north there is a saying currently in fashion: "I went to Beijing and realized my own position was low, I went to Guangzhou and realized that my own wealth was small, I went to Haikou and realized that my body was not in good shape." After hearing this sentence, one can put one's finger on the situation in Haikou. During the development of Sanya, the future state of affairs will be relatively the same as for Haikou, as control is relatively lax. What projects does Sanya have to invest in? Xiao notes that the hotel business is developing, and at present, there are more than 30 in business, more than 30 under construction, and more than 30 that have requested permission to build. Of course, some of these are small, and he does not know of any that are genuine five star hotels. Businesses related to tourism, such as vacation villages, water amusement parks, and yacht clubs, in addition to bars, eateries, and nightclubs, also should do very well. At present, it is commonly reported that mainland tourists coming to Sanya are not buying things. Those "loaded" mainlanders come to Sanya and spend several hundred yuan, and afterwards go to Guangzhou and buy things, spending several thousands of yuan. In the wake of the development of the tourist industry, the opening of markets is also a major investment area. Large Portion of Land Is in Corporate Hands In coming to invest in Sanya, it is of course possible to go by the official way, through the government foreign trade channels to invest. However, the system on the mainland still cannot avoid the trouble of bureaucratism, and examination and approval of projects often requires a lot of time. For this reason, seeking cooperation with Hong Kong companies well acquainted with the situation on the mainland is one way to approach the issue. Whatever project one decides to invest in, one will run into land problems. It is known that at present in Sanya City there is a limited amount of land that is available for developing businesses, and in addition to the fact that the government strictly controls land, a major portion of the land is in the hands of corporations. For this reason, seeking talks with corporations holding land about transferring land is also a possible shortcut. The tourist industry has been established as Sanya's mainstay industry, the goal of which is to construct an international coastal tourist city. The tourist industry will bring along the development of other industries, which will greatly stimulate real estate development. At present, there is not much foreign investment in Sanya. In the wake of the construction of the express highway and the airport, prospects for foreign investment in Sanya are looking up.
