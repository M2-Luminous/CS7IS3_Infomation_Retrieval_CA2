Price growth was approximately identical for foodstuffs, nonfood goods, and paid services to the population. We congratulate our readers -- the past week saw the lowest level of inflation (0.8 percent) in the past 30 months. Consumer prices of goods and services in the Central Chernozem, Volga, and Urals Regions remained virtually at last week's level, and in four economic regions they changed by less than 1 percent. Only in the Northern, Central, Volgo-Vyatka, and West Siberia Regions was their growth slightly over 1 percent. The most marked increase last week was for fruit (up 4.9 percent), groats, pasta, and salt (up 1.7 percent), and bread and loaves (up 1.3 percent). Prices of butter, vegetable oil, fish, and vodka did not increase. Eggs were 2 percent cheaper compared with the end of May. The average cost of a basket of 19 of the most important foodstuffs as of 14 June was 56,000 rubles [R] over the month -- an increase of 1.1 percent on the week, of 3.8 percent since the start of the month, and of 80 percent since the start of the year. The basket cost R53,900 in the official trading network, and R68,700 at markets, stalls, or from private traders (in other words, still 30 percent dearer). The spread between the maximum and minimum cost of the basket in different Russian cities was 260 percent (as against 250 percent in the previous week). The most "expensive" area in terms of the cost of the basket is still the Far East Economic Region -- R91,200 over the month. The basket cost R43,200 -- or less than half as much -- in the "cheapest" region (Central Chernozem Region). The biggest increase in the cost of the basket in Russian regions was in the North Caucasus and East Siberia Regions -- up by 6.3 and 4.3 percent respectively. There was hardly any increase at all in the cost of the basket for the residents of the Volgo-Vyatka, Central Chernozem, and Volga Regions. In Moscow the cost of the basket of 19 of the most important foodstuffs was up by 4.4 percent over the week to stand at R63,800 at 14 June. There was hardly any increase in the cost of the basket in St. Petersburg -- its cost there being R55,300. Moscow moved up from 36th to 30th on the list of cities surveyed, while St. Petersburg is in 50th place (49th last week). Prices for nonfood goods also increased minimally -- by just 0.9 percent. The largest increases over the week were for wallpaper, medicine, and matches (up 3 percent) and for children's knitwear and summer footwear (up 2 percent). Fuel prices were unchanged. The differences in the price dynamics of nonfood goods in different economic regions were insignificant last week. Prices of nonfood goods increased by between 0.2 percent in the East Siberia Region and 1.6 percent in the Volgo-Vyatka Region. Moreover, price growth for industrial goods was higher than the Russian average in the Central Chernozem, Central, Urals, and West Siberia Regions. The "costliest" cities in terms of prices of nonfood goods continue to be Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, Novyy Urengoy, Yakutsk, and Magadan.
