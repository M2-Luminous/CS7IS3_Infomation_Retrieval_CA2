According to the poll, taken throughout 1993 on the initiative of the newspaper's editorial board and the VP Public Opinion Study Service, the final list of more than 100 most influential politicians of Russia in 1993 is headed by President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. The newspaper also carries chronology of all most significant dates and events in Russia in the past year. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA on Russia's military doctrine and reforming of the country's armed forces: "As far as the development of the country's armed forces is concerned, the year 1994 will be notable for the fact that the country already has available a practically complete 'military package' of laws, right up to basic military regulations. "The 'basic provisions of a military doctrine of the Russian Federation', adopted at the end of last year, make the work on the development of the armed forces still more conscious politically, militarily, economically and from the viewpoint of military technology. "However, all that does not at all mean that the new parliament will have nothing to do in the field of military legislation. On the contrary, rather. Life brings forth new and new tasks aimed at fostering a sense of patriotism in Russian people, pride for one's native land, and readiness to defend it. We must maintain and enhance the defence capability of the state and the combat readiness of the army". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an interview with President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, who dwelt in detail on Kazakhstan-Russia relations and their role in the rallying of other sovereign CIS countries. Having pointed out in particular that "unity is the way to the prosperity of Russia and Kazakhstan", Nazarbayev explained that "strategically Kazakhstan should be in alliance with Russia. Both Kazakhstan and russia now need each other". Noting the multi-ethnicity of his country, Nazarbayev said this is why "sovereign Kazakhstan is responsible for the equality of other nations". TRUD runs an interview with Arkady Volsky, one of the leaders of the Civic Union, who, upon having recognised the setback suffered by the bloc at the December 12 elections in Russia, nevertheless pointed out that "the Civic Union representatives in the State Duma are intent on constructive work". "We are prepared to back any realistic and welllfounded bills aimed at promoting real reforms that are of benefit to all people in Russia," Volsky said. Touching upon a possible participation of representatives of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, headed by him, in the work of the Russian Government, Volsky said "We are redy to join the government but, naturally, such a government in which our philosophy of reforms without 'shock' and unnecessary social by- effects would be shared. We are ready for the most resolute steps towards reforms but according to the principle: Measure seven times and cut off once". PRAVDA on U.S. President Bill Clinton's forthcoming tour (beginning on January 8) of a number of European countries, including Russia and Belarus: "The busy schedule of the U.S. President's European tour is believed to demonstrate the activeness of U.S. foreign policy and Washington's leadership in the post-Cold-War period." The tour "does not promise to be simple and easy. In the changing world, American claims to leadership are in need of continuous backing by specific deeds or new ideas capable of taking the fancy of allies and partners. So far, there are not so many such ideas in the new administration's foreign-policy bag". On the eve of Christmas, celebrated in Russia on January 7, all today's newspapers carry articles calling on people to do good and show tolerance in the country's present-day difficult situation, relate the history of the holiday, its peculiarities and traditions.
