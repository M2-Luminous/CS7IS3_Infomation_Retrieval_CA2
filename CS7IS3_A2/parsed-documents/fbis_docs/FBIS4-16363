This opinion was expressed in a RIA interview by Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. The reason he gave for this is that the international community does not have the funds to deploy a new peacekeeping operation. Moreover, there will hardly be many wishing to leave for the conflict zones on the territory of the former USSR, the minister said. He believes that only UN observers could be present in the hotspots of the CIS, the more so as, he believes, it is the Russian Army that the majority of CIS members would like to see as peacekeeper on their territories. Touching on the presence of Russian subunits within the UN peacekeeping forces in the former Yugoslavia, Pavel Grachev said the United Nations has requested Russia to increase its contingent. However, in view of the latest events in Bosnia, the Defense Ministry will have to discuss this matter in detail, the head of the Russian military said.
