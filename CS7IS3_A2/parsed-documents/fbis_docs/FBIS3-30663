He said he saw success of his own and of Czech foreign policy in the Security Council mainly in the fact that now the other countries in the Council "view the Czech Republic in a different way than a month ago." Kovanda said he succeeded in intentionally reducing the Council's talks, but increasing their efficiency, though this was hampered by a slower pace of some Council's member countries. "The Security Council proceeds ahead in line with the slowest of those essentially interested in the problem discussed," Kovanda explained, adding while in his post, he became aware of the extent of control exerted over the chairman by the Council's other members: "Some topics I originally believed to be partially settled during the month of the Czech chairmanship, have not been taken up at all, or only marginally," he stated. Things were similar with the talks on specific world problems: "When we adopted the chairman's statement on Bosnia, journalists asked me what good another statement would be -- the Serbians would laugh at it and it would be of no help to Bosnians. And I could only agree with them. But if a group of the Council's members submits a proposal or request that the chairman issue a statement, how can this be prevented?," Kovanda said. It is a "tough reality" of present world that the Security Council's possibilities are limited, and can be further restricted with the decline in countries' willingness to support the council, including by offering their soldiers. "If member countries do not offer their soldiers, it is impossible for the Security Council to send anybody anywhere," Kovanda stated. As an example he gave the case of Somalia. After many countries announced their intention to withdraw soldiers from there, the UN Secretary General asked all 42 countries to offer their soldiers. All of them refused to do so. On the other hand, in the past there was insufficient link between the Council's political resolutions and the rules enabling soldiers in the field to fulfill these resolutions with less or more success. "I think that the link between the Council's activities and the views and troubles of the countries offering soldiers is one of the ways to lessen the differences between what the Council would like and what is feasible," Kovanda said. He himself presented such a diplomatic initiative in the form of a coordination meeting between the Council and the countries with soldiers stationed in Somalia.
