The Russian delegation insists that the Russian Black Sea Fleet and the Ukrainian Navy should be located in different places. The Ukrainian side, however, believes that both can stay in Sevastopol, but in different harbours. Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev who headed the Russian delegation to the talks told journalists that at the first plenary meeting the sides outlined their positions on the matter. Experts were due to resume discussions later in the day. The talks will continue on Friday on an enlarged basis. Black Sea Fleet spokesman Andrey Grachev said the Ukrainian side is playing a "Massandra scenario" at the talks. Under the agreement signed by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk in Massandra, the Crimea, in 1993, Ukraine pledged to sell its part of the fleet to Russia in exchange for writing off its debt for Russian energy supplies. However, the deal was strongly opposed by the Ukrainian military. Ukrainian Defence Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy's refusal to allow Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov and Sevastopol city council chairman Viktor Semenyov to join in the talks added to the tension. Articles five and six of the law on the delineation of powers between Ukraine and the Crimea allow Crimean leaders to have their say in issues connected with the location of troops and establishment of new military units in the republic, the spokesman said.
