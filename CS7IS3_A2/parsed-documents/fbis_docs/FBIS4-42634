Waigel said in Bonn on Monday [6 June] that the rescheduling had gained Russia "more breathing space" for its debts of more than $7 billion, which would otherwise have had to be paid this year. The extension of the deadline on payment on the debt would above all relieve the Russian state budget. Its stabilization was the main component of the reform program. Waigel also stressed that, as the biggest creditor with $2.7 million or 4.5 billion marks, Germany was once again making the greatest contribution. Relevant provisions have been made in the 1994 German federal budget and in the draft budget for 1995. Waigel now called upon Russia to conclude the planned rescheduling with the commercial banks. A satisfactory solution also had to be found soon for debts owed to German exporters without federal guarantees.
