At the UCR [Radical Civic Union] executive committee offices on 1 June, he was installed as head of the brand new Political Action Committee. The committee is made up of 25 men who represent a variety of UCR internal factions. Angeloz announced that "he is willing to accept" an electoral alliance for the 1995 presidential election based "on common principles" with other political parties that "share our concern over our country's social situation." Nevertheless, he said he would decide on his possible presidential candidacy after the UCR is reorganized. The Political Action Committee will be responsible for presenting within 90 days an ambitious project aimed at turning the UCR "upside down" and totally reorganizing it in order to overcome the deep crisis prompted by various electoral defeats and the storm provoked by the Olivos Pact [between UCR President Raul Alfonsin and President Carlos Menem on constitutional reform]. Yesterday was a key day for the Cordoba governor. His presidential candidacy largely depends on his success in this effort. At the UCR executive committee offices, Angeloz managed to gather the representatives of almost all UCR internal factions. San Isidro Mayor Melchor Posse smartly encouraged the cheerful participation of a large number of party members who constantly applauded and cheered Angeloz. [Senator] Fernando de la Rua was the only one absent. He is convinced that the Political Action Committee, devised by Angeloz and approved by Alfonsin, conceals an agreement between Angeloz and Alfonsin since no deadline has been established for Alfonsin's early departure as UCR head. De la Rua refused to participate [in the committee]. In the eyes of other UCR people, he seems to be the only one hoping to become the anti-Alfonsin opposition leader. [passage omitted]
