FR940324-2-00040 FR940324-2-00026 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY [FRL&hyph;4853&hyph;6] Agency Information Collection Activities Under OMB Review AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ), this notice announces that the Information Collection Request (ICR) abstracted below has been forwarded to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and comment. The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected cost and burden. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before April 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For further information, or to obtain a copy of the ICR, contact Sandy Farmer at EPA, (202) 260&hyph;2740. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Office of Research and Development Title: Quality Assurance Specifications and Requirements (EPA No. 866.04; OMB No. 2080&hyph;0033). Abstract: This ICR is an extension of existing information collection activities associated with quality assurance (QA) procedures as required at 40 CFR 30.503 and 31.45. Under these regulations, State and local governments or non-profit research institutions seeking Federal assistance for proposed projects must include written QA plans or narrative statements that document the steps taken to assure that the data are of the quality that is needed. The EPA needs this documentation to ensure that all extramural projects involving environmental measurements adhere to existing EPA QA guidelines. By so doing, the EPA may ensure that all data used in environmental protection efforts will be valid, scientifically sound, legally defensible, and of known and documented quality. Non-profit research institutions must provide a narrative statement that describes the purpose and objectives of the proposed study, and the QA/Quality Control (QC) procedures documenting the precision and bias of the data produced in support of the research. State and local governments must submit a more extensive written QA plan, as described in the ``Interim Guidelines and Specifications for Preparing Quality Assurance Projects Plans.'' The plan should describe in detail, or by reference, the measurement systems used, the QC procedures to be followed, data analysis and reporting, and any other aspects of QA/QC used to document that the data generated are of the quality claimed and needed to meet project objectives. The information submitted to EPA will be used by appropriate EPA offices and their respective Quality Assurance Managers as a basis for recommending approval of financial assistance for projects involving environmental measurements. The EPA project officers will maintain file copies of the plans and narratives. Burden Statement: Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 79 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing information sources, completing and reviewing the collection of information, and submitting the information to EPA. Respondents: State and local governments, non-profit research institutions. Estimated Number of Respondents: 1395. Frequency of Collection: Annual. Estimated Number of Responses per Respondent: 1. Estimated Annual Burden on Respondents: 110,325 hours. Send comments regarding the burden estimate, or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to: Sandy Farmer, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Information Policy Branch (2136), 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. and Tim Hunt, Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, 725 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20530.
