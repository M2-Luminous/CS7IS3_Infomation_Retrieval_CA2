FR940930-0-00008 FR940930-0-00003 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;19&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;9033; AD 94&hyph;20&hyph;05] Airworthiness Directives; Beech Aircraft Corporation 1900 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that applies to certain Beech Aircraft Corporation (Beech) 1900 series airplanes. This action requires inspecting the hot battery bus fuse assembly for proper wiring, correcting the wiring if incorrect, and modifying the wiring to add a redundant power source for the hot battery bus. This action results from a report of the hot battery bus bar wrongly installed on the lower (load) side of the hot battery bus fuse assembly on one of the affected airplanes. Correct installation is the upper (power) side of the circuit. The actions specified by this AD are intended to protect from overloads to either circuit connected to the hot battery bus from overloads, which, if not protected, could result in loss of certain emergency equipment. DATES: Effective October 14, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of October 14, 1994. Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before December 12, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket 94&hyph;CE&hyph;19&hyph;AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106. Information that relates to this AD may be obtained from the Beech Aircraft Corporation, P.O. Box 85, Wichita, Kansas 67201&hyph;0085. This information may also be examined at the FAA at the address above; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Harvey E. Nero, Aerospace Engineer, FAA, Wichita Aircraft Certification Office, 1801 Airport Road, Room 100, Wichita, Kansas 67209; telephone (316) 946&hyph;4137; facsimile (316) 946&hyph;4407. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FAA has received a report that the hot battery bus bar was wrongly installed on the lower (load) side of the hot battery bus fuse assembly on a Beech 1900 series airplane. Correct installation is the upper (power) side of the circuit. With the reported configuration, a single five amp fuse supplies electrical power to all the systems connected to the bus instead of (under the correct wiring configuration) the hot battery bus supplying each essential load independently through a fuse for each load. In normal conditions, an airplane operator would not notice the miswired hot battery bus bar until the single fuse is blown. This condition, if not detected and corrected, could result in the loss of electrical power to all emergency equipment connected to the hot battery bus. This equipment includes the left and right engine fire extinguisher bottles, the left and right fire wall shutoff valves, the cockpit emergency lighting, and the engine fire extinguisher indicator lights. In addition, these airplanes currently are not equipped with a redundant power source for the emergency equipment receiving power from the hot battery bus. Under the present scenario, an internal battery problem could prevent the use of the emergency equipment because of no backup power sources for this equipment connected to the hot battery bus. Beech has issued Service Bulletin (SB) No. 2562, dated August 1994, which specifies procedures for (1) inspecting the hot battery bus fuse assembly for proper wiring and correcting the wiring if incorrect, and (2) modifying the wiring to add a redundant power source for the hot battery bus. After examining the circumstances and reviewing all available information related to the incidents described above, the FAA has determined that AD action should be taken in order to protect either circuit connected to the hot battery bus from overloads, which, if not protected, could result in loss of certain emergency equipment. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other Beech 1900 series airplanes of the same type design, this AD requires the inspection and modification specified in Beech SB No. 2562, dated August 1994. Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity for public prior comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days.
