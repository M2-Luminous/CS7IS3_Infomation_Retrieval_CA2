The Arab nation stood fast and struggled in defense of its honorable, free existence, and refused, proudly and loftily, to capitulate to its enemies, through wise stands leader al-Asad has embodied in sound, unmistakable decisions. AL-BA'TH notes: The topics the Damascus Declaration member states' foreign ministers will discuss are comprehensive and versatile and in the interest of pan-Arab issues that must not be relinquished. AL-BA'TH adds: At the time of international changes and the economic blocs it has produced and whose objective is to control world economy, the Arabs have no choice but to unify ranks in order to pave the way for establishing the most important bloc, taking into consideration the Arab world's location and resources. AL-BA'TH says: Our call for establishing a bloc is not based on hostility to or confrontation with anyone, but on the principle of defending our livelihood and providing the best living conditions for a nation that, throughout its history, has been the nation of generosity and kindness. Concluding, AL-BA'TH says: Frankly speaking, we call for further coordination, consultation, and unity. This is because joint Arab action contains abundant benefits for the masses of our nation which, everyday, hear about new world blocs, while it can do nothing. Based on this, the Damascus meeting is of special importance, particularly, considering the positive results it will produce, and which will be in the interest of all Arabs. The newspaper TISHRIN comments on the meetings of the Damascus Declaration member states' foreign ministers. It says: It is not a coincidence that the Damascus Declaration member states' foreign ministers meet to discuss ways to implement the declaration, taking into consideration that Syria is the country of all Arabs, the vanguard of pan-Arab solidarity, and the supporter of everyone who has been exposed to a spiteful aggression. The Kuwaiti brothers have realized Syria's concern about adhering to right and its readiness to confront falsehood. TISHRIN adds: The Damascus Declaration should have been implemented long ago, especially since it lays the foundations for an entrenched and genuine Arab solidarity based on a host of pan-Arab principles. All Arabs are aware of the fact that the absence of Arab solidarity and some sides' deviation from the bases of this solidarity have led the region to two catastrophes: The first was the Iraq-Iran war which exhausted the resources of Iraq, Iran, and the region's states. The second was the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait which led to more serious results, not only the exhausted resources and capabilities, but also concerning the West's attempts to reimpose its hegemony over the region and to control oil prices. TISHRIN says: In light of this tragic situation, there should have been a real solidarity that put things on their right course, entrenches the principles of pan-Arab action, fraternal relations, and genuine traditions, and confronts all those who tamper with the nation's fate and give predominance to their parochial interests and crazy whims over the Arabs' higher interests. However, the declaration remained only ink on paper, and the economy and foreign ministers held meetings which produced nothing although none of the signatories rejected or renounced the declaration. The Gulf states affirmed their adherence to the declaration, and Syria and Egypt expressed their readiness to fulfill their obligations and to give anything required of them. TISHRIN clarifies: Arab security is an indivisible whole, and Gulf security is part of Arab security. No one can guarantee Arab security other than the Arabs themselves. TISHRIN adds: In all their countries, the Arabs are looking forward to implementing the Damascus Declaration and to adopting Arab solidarity as a tangible and genuine principle. Things are changing rapidly and the entire Arab region has new obligations to fulfill. The current Arab fragmentation weakens the Arab cause. In fact, some have deviated from solidarity and concluded a deal with Israel, which harmed the Palestinian people and the region. Concluding, TISHRIN says: It has been said that the Arabs' strength lies in their unity and solidarity. Only through unity and solidarity can territories and holy places be restored. Syria has called and is calling on the Arabs to rise up to the level of pan-Arab responsibility. All Arabs can win through their solidarity, and lose through their fragmentation.
