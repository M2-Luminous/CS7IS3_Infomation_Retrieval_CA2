It is instructive that this campaign issues from parties of the white establishment. The ANC remains convinced that this has nothing to do with the 34 SACP members in the ANC national list of 200 for the constituent assembly nor the deliberate security police type lie about the so-called "sleeping members". It is quite clear that this is a pre-planned campaign timed to coincide with the release of the ANC national list to the public. The aim remains to divert people's attention from crucial issues facing the downtrodden people: violence and the dismal track record of the NP over the years. This is because the NP has no answers to offer. The ANC list includes persons of integrity who fought against the apartheid system: believers Christians, Hindus, Muslims, Jews, communists, democratic nationalists and patriots who believe in a non-racial democracy and a better life for all South Africans. It is a truly South African list of democrats chosen in a transparent and democratic manner. All the candidates will campaign under the ANC banner, pursue the ANC platform and policy in Parliament. For this democratic practice we owe the NP and its allies in the apartheid establishment no apology. What the ANC would like the np to tell the public, though, is how it is preparing its own lists- their silence in this matter id deafening. We are extremely concerned at this witch-hunt against illustrious fighters against apartheid. On the one hand it has brought to the fore some of the worst characteristics in the life of the NP: Suppression from 1950 to the 80's had in its definition of all opponents of apartheid as communists. Its fascist approach to campaigns, that the more a "big lie" is told, the more people believe it. We are therefore bound to ask: where is the new National Party? The ANC remains concerned that negative campaigns of this nature, have in the past been followed by assassinations and attempts on the lives of leaders of the ANC and its allies. We genuinely hope that the media will not find themselves used unwittingly for these machinations of the NP and its allies. We wish to remind them that it was first the Communist Party in the 50's, then the ANC in the 60's, religious leaders and students in the 70's and 80's and then the media, which suffered from the political intolerance of the National Party.
