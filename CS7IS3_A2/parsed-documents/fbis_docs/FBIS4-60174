FBIS4-60174 "drnes099_o_94004" FBIS-NES-94-099 Daily Report 21 May 1994 SYRIA Al-Asad's Talks With King Husayn Reported Al-Asad's Talks With King Husayn Reported Commentary on Talks, Coordination JN2105170494 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 1155 GMT 21 May 94 JN2105170494 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Station commentary] [Text] Gentlemen: On the eve of the blessed 'Id al-Adha, President Hafiz al-Asad and King Husayn held a comprehensive evaluation of the developments in the peace process and the obstacles Israel has placed in the way of a just and comprehensive solution to the crisis in the region. The two Arab leaders agreed to continue bilateral consultations and coordination on positions. If we recall the recent past, we see that Jordan was subjected to intense pressure to sign a separate agreement with Israel. Jordan refused such an agreement and emphasized the continuation of its coordination with the brothers, especially Syria. Jordanian officials revealed that Israel wants to sign a peace agreement with Jordan without withdrawing from the occupied Jordanian territories in return. Likewise, sisterly Lebanon was subjected to similar pressure. Israel escalated its aggressions against southern villages, towns, and cities to the extent of displacing tens of thousands of Lebanese citizens and threatening an all-out sweep. As usual, Israel used the pretext of national resistance, but the main reason was Lebanon's refusal to sign a separate agreement and its insistence on the implementation of Security Council Resolution 425, which requires Israel to unconditionally withdraw its forces from all of south Lebanon. The same is true with Syria. After more than two and a half years of the Washington talks, several shuttle tours by the U.S. secretary of state, the summit meeting between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton, and several statements by Israeli officials on their intentions to advance the peace process on the Syrian-Israeli track, it became clear that the Tel Aviv rulers reject full withdrawal from the Golan and the return to the 4 June 1967 borders. At the same time, these rulers demand the normalization of relations. When we compare Israel's behavior on the three Arab tracks--the Syrian, Jordanian, and Lebanese--we find one thing: the Tel Aviv rulers have not abandoned their expansionist demands in the Arab territories, and they are far from the substance of the U.S. initiative, the principles of the Madrid conference, and the UN resolutions, which call for exchanging land for peace and withdrawal to the 4 June 1967 borders. Israel succeeded in singling out the Palestinian side and drawing it into the position Israel had planned. Israel kept its ugly occupation and its sway over the capabilities of the Palestinian people, but it failed to penetrate any of the three Arab tracks--the Syrian, Jordanian, and Lebanese. Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon clearly announced that separate agreements are unequivocally rejected, and that peace depends on Israel's full withdrawal and the return of all occupied territories. It is important that Arab coordination continues to reach the highest levels because Israel is searching for even a tiny crack in order to propagate its suspicious and distorted solutions, especially since the Gaza-Jericho agreement is facing more difficulties everyday, and is daily confronting new obstacles, the latest of which is Israel's demand that the Palestinian police chase and arrest the men of the intifadah in order to hand them over. This simply means employing the Palestinian police to protect the occupation forces in accordance with this ill-auguring agreement. A quick look at the situation in the occupied territories after the Gaza-Jericho agreement and its implementation is enough to clearly show that just peace and occupation cannot coexist and that the realization of peace is dependent on the elimination of occupation. Hence, Syria firmly adheres to the demand of Israel's full withdrawal from every inch of the occupied Golan, and coordinates its position with those of its Arab brothers so that the Israeli withdrawal will be from all occupied territories, and subsequently, peace will be just, comprehensive, and real.
