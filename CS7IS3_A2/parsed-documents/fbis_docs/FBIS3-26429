Autonomous regional leaders Abulaidi Amudurexiti, Keyum Bawudun, and Wang Yousan attended the conference, which reviewed our region's progress in reforming its economic system last year, and studied and planned relevant tasks to be undertaken by our region this year. In reforming its economic system this year, our region should focus on actively but steadily experimenting with the modern enterprise system as part of its continuing efforts to deepen enterprise reform. It should change enterprises' operating mechanisms, vigorously promote enterprise associations, and expedite readjustment of enterprises' organizational structure. In small state-owned enterprises, it should actively implement the systems of management by people under state ownership, management by the private sector under public ownership, and cooperation through share holdings. In optimizing and reforming the commodity circulation system, it should continue to develop commodity markets and expedite the process of unifying the prices of production means. In the realm of commodity circulation, it should shatter regional blockades, trade monopolies, and compartmentalization. It should earnestly change governmental functions and reform the government's leadership system regarding economic work, so as to facilitate efforts to exercise macroeconomic regulation and control, serve the grass roots, and raise work efficiency. It should continue to deepen rural reform, speed up the pace of establishing social service networks in rural areas, further accelerate the development of village and town enterprises and the invigoration of county-level industrial enterprises, and lead people of all nationalities across Xinjiang toward common prosperity. Speaking at the conference, Abulaidi Amudurexiti, deputy secretary of the autonomous regional party committee and acting chairman of the autonomous regional government, said: It is hoped that party and government leaders at all levels will show a strong sense of urgency, responsibility, and crisis about speeding up reform. They should be determined to accelerate reform in light of Xinjiang's reality. In shifting to a market economy, they should pay close attention to properly handling the relationship between development, reform, and stability. They should follow the principle of first carrying out experiments in selected areas and then popularizing the results, gradually unfolding work on the basis of economic returns.
