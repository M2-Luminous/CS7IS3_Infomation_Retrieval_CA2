Idiz] [Text] Ankara--Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's remarks on Friday in Boston to the effect that Ankara could reject U.S. military aid for 1995 if this is made contingent on "progress in human rights in Turkey" as well as "progress in the Cyprus talks," has undoubted appeal for Turks from both the left- and the right-wing of the political spectrum. Ciller was responding to a decision last week by the U.S. House of Representatives to cut the amount of assistance to Turkey proposed by the administration and to attach the "progress on human rights and Cyprus" conditions on 25 percent of the figure that was eventually authorized. That figure, in this case, is around $360 million, the bulk of which is due to be extended as a low interest loan. Ciller told reporters she had informed President Bill Clinton over the phone of the displeasure with which Turks view the House's decision and also that Turkey could reject the "aid" if the House's decision was upheld by the Senate and endorsed by the administration. "Shouldn't we fight against terrorism? Is this what they (the U.S. Congress) want?" Ciller was quoted from Boston as saying concerning the "human rights" stipulation of the House of Representatives. She was indirectly referring to the fact that for the House, "human rights" as such, appears to be synonymous today with Turkey's "Kurdish problem," and its fight in combating the separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). More than one Turk today is questioning whether it is worth "demeaning national pride" by submitting to such conditions for these amounts of money. Especially now that "Turkey can easily secure such amounts of money from other sources." As it is, "looking to America's hands" for such aid has more often than not been considered "humiliating" for ordinary Turks to begin with. In this respect it is not difficult to understand the political logic behind Ciller's remarks because, "standing up to America" and "refusing its gifts" inevitably goes down well, not just with the masses but also with elements of the intelligentsia whether they be leftish, rightish or pro-Islamic. All this said, however, it is not difficult to imagine the shudders of initial surprise, followed by discontent, among members of the Turkish civilian and military establishment at these remarks by the prime minister. Rumors filtering thought the political grapevine in Ankara have it that even President Suleyman Demirel has found Ciller's remarks "quixotic" and "excessive." Demirel is said to be concerned that the prime minister's remarks risk stoking up the latent "anti-Americanism" which is never far from the surface in the Turkish political psyche. It is likely that for all their anger with the House's decision, Turkish diplomats will also have been taken aback by Ciller's announcement and have found her action to be "not helpful" in efforts to settle the problem by diplomatic means. Their desire to this effect was already apparent in the way that foreign ministry spokesmen have been reluctant to commit themselves to the notion that Turkey might refuse U.S. aid. When pressed by reporters to answer questions on the issue, these spokesmen have often merely said that all options were "open to consideration." Analysts point to the fact that this latest development vis-a-vis the U.S. House of Representatives is not without precedent, and recall that Turkey was the butt of such developments throughout the 1980's. They remind us that all this gave Turkey experience in "managing Washington" through the various executive and legislative branches. They say that the bill which passed the house has still to go through the Senate, and it is very likely it will go to a conference committee from there in order to find a compromise between the house and the senate versions of the bill. The implication in this is that there is still room for Turkey to maneuver and influence its position through its lobby in Washington before the U.S. aid bill takes on its final form. Analysts in close contact with official circles in Ankara, for their part, indicate that the deepest concern over the broad implications of Ciller's suggestion that U.S. aid may be refused can be expected from Turkey's "military wing." Always very displeased with any cutbacks in their funds, the military is expected also to consider what effect a refusal of U.S. aid may do to prospects concerning the aid that is received "in kind," and not in cash. The bottom line in all this is that most analysts in fact believe Prime Minister Ciller's remarks represent no more than a "dabbling in populism." They claim that she eventually will have to "swallow her words" as she has in the recent past concerning such other issues of great popular appeal in Turkey as the question of Cyprus.
