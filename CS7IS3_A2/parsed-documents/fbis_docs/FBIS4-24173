The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] rebels this afternoon shelled one of the last positions held by the government army, which caused a huge fire on Mount Kigali. Major Jean-Guy Plante, the UN mission spokesman in Kigali: [Begin recording] [Plante] This afternoon, especially late this afternoon, fighting was extremely fierce in the center of Kigali. I myself saw explosions in the town of Kigali, but not on Mount Kigali. Mount Kigali, it is true, is a strategic (?point) which is held by the government forces. The rebel forces are trying to get hold of Mount Kigali, and the information I currently have shows that Mount Kigali is still being held by the government forces. [Correspondent Ghislaine Dupont] Does the UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] believe that the RPF, the Rwandan Patriotic Front, has taken new positions in the capital? [Plante] I would say that, given the information that I have and what I saw with my own eyes this afternoon--because I went for a walk in the town of Kigali--I would say that the front, the front line, the positions are almost the same as they were a week or 10 days ago despite the extremely (?fierce) and bloody fighting that has been going on over the last few days.
