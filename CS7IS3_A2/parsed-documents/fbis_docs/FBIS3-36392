The miners of Irsha-Borodino Open-Cut Mine, in Krasnoyarsk Kray, seem to be on the point of stopping sending coal to their consumers, including Irkutsk Oblast. To hit its heat and electric power stations below the belt, as the saying goes. You can imagine what kind of a situation is being created in that complex.... In addition, its own "Vostsibugol" miners are also in a prestrike state. What complaint is being advanced from the two fronts? Reciprocal nonpayments. The power workers are in the same trouble. What money can they demand from Bratsk Industrial Complex, let us assume, when it is on the point of being reduced to beggary? As regards the non-delivery of Borodino coal, Oblast Governor Yuriy Nozhikov has already promised to "introduce countersanctions." For example, to stop the supply of electricity to Krasnoyarsk's industrial enterprises. No, they have not yet fallen out with each other: They are continuing to seek ways to resolve the problem of nonpayments, and they also intend to hold consultations with the Russian Federation Government. The situation is difficult, although it should not be overdramatized. There is still a hope, although it might be a naive one: They are, after all, neighbors. For only yesterday they were championing their interests at the federal level. Today this is necessary at the local level. However "wild" the market might be, the governor is right: "We will never give up the defense of the region's interests. We will say that we cannot increase or reduce the run-off of water to the hydroelectric power station without affecting the interests of Yenisey River shipping. We will not encroach upon each other." Or the gram of coal and the kilowatt-hour of electricity, which are essential to the people, will still prove to be serious arguments, and financial chaos will divide the Siberians along their own banks -- the banks of the Angara and the Yenisey.
