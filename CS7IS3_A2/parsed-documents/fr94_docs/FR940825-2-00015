FR940825-2-00015 FR940825-2-00009 [C&hyph;542&hyph;401] Certain Apparel From Sri Lanka; Revocation of Countervailing Duty Order AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. ACTION: Notice of revocation of Countervailing Duty Order. SUMMARY: The Department of Commerce (the Department) is revoking the countervailing duty order on certain apparel from Sri Lanka (50 FR 9826) pursuant to a decision of the Court of International Trade (CIT) on June 24, 1994. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 18, 1992. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Martina Tkadlec or Kelly Parkhill, Office of Countervailing Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;2786. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On October 22, 1993, the Department reinstated the countervailing duty orders on certain apparel and certain textile mill products from Sri Lanka, effective May 18, 1992 (58 FR 54552). These reinstatements were made pursuant to orders of the CIT and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. ( Belton Industries, Inc. v. United States , Slip Op. 92&hyph;64 (CIT 1992), aff'd , 6 F.3d 756 (Fed Cir. 1993) `` Belton ''.) On November 19, 1993, the Government of Sri Lanka filed an action with the CIT challenging the reinstatement of the countervailing duty order on certain apparel from Sri Lanka. The Government of Sri Lanka argued that the Belton decisions only applied to the countervailing duty order on certain textile mill products from Sri Lanka. The Department concurred with the Government of Sri Lanka, and consented to judgment in this case. On June 24, 1994, the CIT ordered the Department to revoke the countervailing duty order on certain apparel from Sri Lanka. Because an injunction was issued in this case, and because no adversely affected interested party has standing as a party to the litigation to appeal the CIT's decision, the Department is immediately revoking the countervailing duty order on certain apparel from Sri Lanka, effective May 18, 1992. Scope of the Order Imports covered by this order are shipments of certain apparel from Sri Lanka. The scope of this order, published in the Appendix of the Federal Register notice of Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination and Order on Certain Apparel from Sri Lanka (50 FR 9826), was originally defined solely in terms of the Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated (TSUSA) item numbers; no narrative product description was provided. On January 11, 1989, the Department published a conversion from TSUSA to Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) item numbers, and the U.S. Customs Service has been suspending liquidation according to that conversion since then. Instructions to Customs The Department will instruct the U.S. Customs Service to terminate suspension of liquidation of certain apparel from Sri Lanka as of the date of publication of this notice, and to liquidate, without regard to countervailing duties, all unliquidated entries of certain apparel exported from Sri Lanka on or after May 18, 1992. Dated: August 18, 1994. Joseph A. Spetrini, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Compliance. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;20845 Filed 8&hyph;24&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;P
