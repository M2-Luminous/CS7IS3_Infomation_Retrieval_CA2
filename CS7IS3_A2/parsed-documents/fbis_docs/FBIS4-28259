Before leaving for Beijing, Fujimori told EFE he was satisfied with the result of his visit, while Council of Ministers President Efrain Goldenberg added that "the Japanese officials are gradually getting more enthusiastic" in their economic relations with Peru. Upon arriving in Tokyo, Fujimori said the trip's top objective was to inform the Japanese Government and private business about Peruvian economic reforms and the pacification program in order to expedite aid for development and attract private investors. Peru did not get any donation or credit this time but Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata was willing to help Peru with three projects: a drinking water treatment and sewer system for Lima, improvement of the Callao port infrastructure, and irrigation with Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) financing. Regarding an Eximbank credit for Peru for a hydroelectric project, Hata told Fujimori on 6 June that the project depends on sending a mission to Peru to study its cost and feasibility. According to a Japanese Foreign Ministry source, Japan is considering donations of food and hospital equipment to Peru. No details of concrete projects were disclosed until the requests are made through diplomatic channels. Fujimori insisted to Hata that Japan support Peru to join the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), although new memberships have been frozen. Fujimori's agenda, which was much lighter than other times, included an audience with Emperor Akihito, a meeting with 120 Tokyo Chamber of Commerce businessmen, meetings with top Eximbank and OECF executives, and a visit to the multinational electronic NEC Corporation plant in Yokohama to request technological cooperation on telecommunications. At the end of his stay in Tokyo, Fujimori was given an "honorary degree" by the University of Keio in recognition of his work for Peruvian development and stability. At the cultural level, President Fujimori dedicated a traveling exhibition in Japan about the Shikan culture sponsored by the private television network Tokyo Broadcasting Systems (TBS) and another exhibition on Inca art at the University of Tokyo. Negotiations for the payment of the Peruvian debt to Japan, pending since Tokyo accepted its renegotiation with the Paris Club in 1993, have not been resumed. During his visit Fujimori wanted to promote the image of "a Peru in peace" and in rapid economic growth to attract not only capital and trade but also restore tourism in Peru's historic areas.
