The new chairman declared that the Non-Party Reform Bloc was in opposition to the government but not in opposition to all its proposals. The General Assembly granted the title of BBWR Honorary Member to President Lech Walesa. Addressing a press conference after the meeting Religa declared that the BBWR association can be expected to become before its first congress in May "one of the two strongest political organizations in Poland". He announced that he will present the bloc's political assumptions on January 22. Religa also said that Lech Walesa will be the bloc's candidate in the next presidential elections "if he decides to run". If not, the bloc will try to put forth its own candidate, too. Religa stressed that the BBWR association is not "a presidential association for a concrete person but one of its main features is the support for a presidential-parliamentary system." According to Religa the BBWR association may become transformed into a political party in the future but at present the formula of an association is the most convenient since it allows to unite people of different views for the purpose of reforming the country. Religa announced that Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski declared his will to join the BBWR association but that he will not hold any posts in it. Asked by journalists whether his political activity did not interfere with his professional duties, Religa replied that it did but stressed that "in Poland it will not be proper for a long time yet to avoid politics." "I think it to be my duty and an absolutely justified thing to engage in politics," he said. He said that the clinic in Zabrze which he is heading performs some 600 open heart surgeries and he himself makes some 150 surgeries every year. The BBWR association's members are grouped in 121 circles throughout Poland.
