In the appraisal, the professors stripped bare the treacherous nature of the "reform" by the Kim Yong-sam regime, characterising it as "subordinate politics and diplomacy," "big business-centred new economy against reform," "new agricultural policy driving away peasants," "government-controlled education denying change," "return to the cold war system--anti-independent reunification policy" and "retrograding environmental policy". They branded the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime as "power for comprador businesses" and "power bent on consolidating the subordinate relations with the imperialist powers, particularly the U.S. imperialist total capital". They pointed out that the revision of the "Combined Election Law", the "Law on Political Funds", etc. sought by the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is not for a democratic reform, but is aimed at consolidating the foundation of their power by legalizing the political and economic fusion between the "Democratic Liberal Party" and the comprador businesses through the medium of "political funds". Stating that the deceptive nature of the "reform" advertised so loudly by the Kim Yong-sam traitor clique has been completely exposed, they said it is proved by the fact that the force which must be the objects of reform are fooling the people in the disguise of the "leading force" of the "reform".
