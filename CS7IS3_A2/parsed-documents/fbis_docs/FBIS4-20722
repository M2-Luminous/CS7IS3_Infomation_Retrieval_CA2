He said that 'Arafat had gone out of his way to win the world and Israel's approval and had lost his own people. He said that whoever wants to negotiate with Rabin must be close to the Palestinian opposition, not remote from it. 'Abbas Zaki, who was speaking to AL-SHARQ and is also secretary of the intifadah's Supreme Committee, stated that all the agreements that 'Arafat had concluded with Israel "remain for us a truce for another war." He wagered on the resoluteness of the Palestinian people not to submit. "The Palestinian leadership," said Zaki, "must again go through the Jordanian gate, because any Jordanian-Palestinian agreement will protect what remains of the Palestinians and will prevent the Zionist urge to expand." Here is the text of the interview. [AL-SHARQ] From your statements we know that you are one of the opponents of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement. Opponents have expressed their opposition in various ways, such as resignation. How have you expressed your opposition? [Zaki] I am against categorizing everyone who loves his country and who adheres to his principles and maintains the values and heritage of militancy as "opposition," because this will mean that terms will collapse. It will mean that those who adhere to principles and constants are to be called "opposition." The legitimate authority has engaged in concession-making and abandonment and is far from consensus decisionmaking. The Oslo agreement was a disgraceful agreement in the life of the Palestinian people. It was a disaster that took place in circumstances difficult for our people. When we went to Madrid, our incentive was to stop the cancer of settlements and land confiscation from spreading in the Palestinian body. Palestinian speech-making was excellent. Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi outshone Shamir. There was corridor diplomacy, and a Palestinian avoidance of the political indecency of abdication that took place in the Oslo agreement. The latter came by stealth, from behind the backs of the leadership, the negotiators, and the people. The agreement emerged from this work in the dark. It has prevented our people from talking about the resolutions of the legitimate international authority and about the political authority for the political process. Syria and Jordan are talking about land for peace and implementation of 242 and 338. The Palestinians, on the other hand, cannot talk about land for peace or demand implementation of 242. So negotiation takes place piecemeal until one gets 2 percent of Palestinian territory. Surely, no patriot can accept this agreement, despite all the piping and drumming for it. We see its popularity waning and declining. The unfair conditions accompanying the implementation of this agreement do not accord with the nature of Palestinian heroism, Palestinian rights, or the Palestinian role in the liberation struggle. This became clear for example after the Davos and Cairo agreements, which accord with the Oslo agreement, which does not guarantee an Israeli withdrawal. Settlement-building is continuing. We are a tool in the hand of the enemy: he has the last word, and any other interpretations are pure fiction. What's more, the leadership has sold the agreement as being a national authority, etc. Let 'Arafat go; let him sign with Peres, not with Rabin, to cancel the national authority and the free crossing points and demand a halt to settlement. Jericho will remain as many kilometers as they approved without any increase. Gaza, too, has been divided into squares, and new lands have been added to the settlements in Gaza--more than 30 kilometers. Our language now is not against or in opposition to the agreement; it is for Palestine. Whoever isolates himself from his people and national decisions is in opposition--not we. In another way I have expressed my conviction that the children, women, old men, and men of the Palestinian people are innocent of the deal going on. In harmony with our people and the principles of our movement, I will not resign. I shall continue to demand that we stay the course to ward off the corruption, stop the cycle of decline, and realize some of the aspirations we hoped for. [AL-SHARQ] In Davos, Israeli Foreign Minister Peres implied that 'Arafat had abandoned the establishment of an independent Palestinian state and had decided on a confederation. How true is this talk, and what is your opinion? [Zaki] Please don't ask me about the Peres-'Arafat meeting, because it did not take place by Palestinian decision. It took place without our knowledge; so we will not defend something we do not know. [AL-SHARQ] The 10 opposition groups led by the Islamic opposition movement, Hamas have arrived among themselves at a collective leadership that offers itself as an alternative to the present leadership. Do you think the project will succeed? What is your position as an opposition figure regarding this front? [Zaki] First, people understand things the wrong way around. Whoever wants to become leader of this people must fight. He must start from the base. If you want to propose yourself as an alternative to the leadership, you confirm and elevate your leadership on the basis of martyrs' skulls, or great achievements, or defeats inflicted on the enemy, so that you become uncontested leader. You don't snatch leadership by competing with a team that you happen to see in this position. My view is that the Palestinian opposition has not been successful to date. It is seeking to set up an inverted pyramid. We have gotten used to lots of grinding noise from the mill without seeing any flour. The opposition forces must insist on the need to espouse resolutions from which the Oslo team retreated, but without exaggeration and suicidal slogans. We have found that committed militant momentum, along with the feeling and resources of the people, needs implementation without slogans. Anyone who wants to deviate from the national course and constant principles has no place with our people. But for us to make two fronts in a face-off with each other is a real disaster. The opposition realizes that the Americans, the Arabs, and weak-spirited Palestinians and ordinary people are for the agreement. Confronting the whole world at once yields nothing. If only the opposition were working for ultimate issues and struggling for Jerusalem! Jerusalem is being wiped off the map. In six months there won't be any East Jerusalem. It has an area of 72 square [sq] km; Palestinians now own 4 sq km. Now there are Israeli projects like al-Tur and Ra's al-'Amud, in addition to the razing of 438 houses. The issue is being limited to praying in Jerusalem. They are granting us a Jerusalem for prayer, not for sovereignty. Thus, if the opposition works for Jerusalem, the refugees, security, borders, and the issues contested with the enemy, it cannot stand still. I challenge Israel to announce its idea of the scope of the final settlement; for the solution is open, admitting of all possibilities, and needs major forces to make [Israel] yield. With this fragmentation we are serving the plot for a final settlement with open possibilities. Rabin, too, has not talked about the final settlement. The 10 groups must therefore work to alleviate our people's sufferings. Their concern must not become only the Oslo team. They must talk about Israel. This is the direction that we in Fatah have taken. In his recent visit to Jordan, Abu al-Lutf [Faruq al-Qaddumi] expressed this when he attacked Rabin and said that he does not want peace. This is what is needed and wanted: instead of attacking a Palestinian leader, we must attack the Israelis. We must get over our complexes by being clearly of the PLO or clearly of Fatah or any other organization, or we shall begin attacking the fighting men who are in confrontation with the enemy. In that case the people retreat behind the leaders. The leader is the one who goes in front of the ranks. The measuring stick for any revolution is the amount of blood it gives and the martyrs it offers. If Fatah had not given so many martyrs, people would not have remained silent until now and unable to speak about Fatah members as having deviated openly. Whoever wants to become an alternative needs a large pool of sacrifices, positions, and a role that has an audience so that he can overcome all the challenges. I send an open invitation for the opposition to return to weaving the feelings and emotions of the people into a true front. We welcome any Palestinian unity, because the keynote of this period is to give concrete embodiment to democracy. We therefore consider any unity, whether it looks at us positively or negatively, as in the interest of our people. [AL-SHARQ] A number of Palestinian personalities led by Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi have put forward demands for perestroyka in the PLO. 'Abd-al-Shafi has expressed disappointment at the results of the talks with the leadership. What is your opinion about this? [Zaki] The internal situation is tragic. It does not express the existence of vision or a point of departure for dealing with internal conditions. The delegations that have been formed were from the fabric of the Palestinian leadership, but bad management and inept performance have made it necessary for it to raise its voice loudly. Let there be a fight inside the camp of political harmony. But they are at odds administratively. In reality, there is no change in method or style or in performance. We think that if we study the Palestinian situation deeply, we shall reach the conviction that the decline of Palestinian institutions must be halted. [AL-SHARQ] What is the flaw at the present time in the management of the negotiations and the Palestinian situation? [Zaki] In Oslo, the Executive Committee and the Central Committee were kept in the dark for eight months concerning an important event to sell Palestine. The Cairo-Davos agreement was signed without our knowledge. A meeting was held to tell us that the agreement had been signed between Abu-'Ammar and Peres. So the negotiating delegation had no value, and Palestinian institutions have likewise become worthless. This requires serious pondering. [AL-SHARQ] Many resignations of Fatah cadres have been submitted in the occupied territories. The Fatah Hawks have abandoned arms. What do you think is the reason for these resignations? Are they related to the figure of the chairman? [Zaki] There is no doubt that Brother Abu-'Ammar is the head of the PLO. There remains no one with him on the Executive Committee. Second, he is head of the occupied territory and therefore of the struggle now raging, until a compromise leadership arrives and there is a different style. He has surrounded himself with advisers who have harmed him and distanced him from popular feeling. In the occupied territory everyone bears responsibility. Israel prefers civil war and will not leave Gaza in two years unless it has set up conditions for civil war. Events unfortunately are showing that Fatah youth are clashing with each other in Nablus with an Israeli officer reconciling them. When Fatah becomes an Israeli demand, the leadership responsible for the occupied territory must stop and ask itself where it is going. Abu-'Ammar bears the major responsibility for the present state of affairs--decline and turning to the enemy to protect themselves from their own flesh and blood. This is something critical. [AL-SHARQ] There are doubts about the role of the Palestinian police in the autonomous stage in suppressing the opposition and therefore that civil war may break out. What is your opinion? [Zaki] I do not think civil war will break out. The patriotic side will be in the Palestinian police, or will be most prominent. Anyone who wagers that the police will be oriented toward Israel is wrong. I am confident that civil war will not take place with the authority. However, the enemy and the decline in Fatah are working for the premise. The role of the police is to protect the Palestinian establishment; it is to serve the people, not to terrorize and pressure the people. [AL-SHARQ] Some see the Jordanian-Palestinian economic agreement as cutting off the way to the establishment of a Palestinian state in the future. What do you think of the idea? [Zaki] On the contrary, any Jordanian-Palestinian agreement protects what remains of the Palestinians and also prevents the Zionist urge to expand. In the past, we were up against Rabin, who was able to wipe out a military force here or there. Today, however, we are up against Peres, who wipes out entire peoples and states by virtue of his economic program. We think there is a valuable strategic convergence due to factors of interest, necessity, history, and geography. It demands that we be on the side of Jordan, not of Israel. This agreement strengthens the establishment of a Palestinian state. All this depends on the establishment of a monetary authority, also the establishment of a Palestinian national authority. [AL-SHARQ] Many politicians have seen some sort of link between you and the creation of the Arab Islamic Party (Haqq). Are these reports true? [Zaki] First, I am committed to Fatah. I think that Fatah is the shortest way to Palestine. Fatah's mission will exist as long as the occupation exists. In other words, it is a national liberation movement. However, I in Fatah am not against any reserve force, though one should bear in mind that I have no contacts with the Arab Islamic Party or knowledge of its figures. There is no truth to the relationship with it that has been attributed to me. Let anyone who wants to form any party leave Fatah. We believe in political pluralism. We welcome any parties, provided that they are engaged and call for national unity. We welcome any flower that blooms--but in the independent Palestinian garden! [AL-SHARQ] Chairman 'Arafat recently made a visit to Saudi Arabia. What price did he pay to obtain Saudi support? The newspapers have informed us that Saudi Arabia is ready to give aid. [Zaki] We were unaware that the matter had reached a conclusion. We have not been informed of the conditions to which he agreed. We have not heard about anything. [AL-SHARQ] If peace treaties between the Arab rulers and Israel are reached, do you expect there to be a historic popular reconciliation between the Arab peoples and Israel, or just a truce? [Zaki] We think there will be a truce for another battle, because it is not possible for the usurper and the victim to cooperate with each other. The path of making peace and the management of the process have not emerged from convictions. The strong imposes his conditions on the weak. The Gulf war was a defeat for the Arab nation. Now the strong wants the Arabs to pay the price of this defeat. So this is all a payment that has fallen due. Those at work in this field are not men of peace. They are of different sorts; even if they talk about peace, inwardly they are something else. The situation is leading to a truce, rather than peace. Al-Sadat made peace, but the Egyptian people still reject normalization. The people will never be like sheep. They will not throw away their land if their leaders throw it away. We see broad smiles from the negotiators, and at the same time we see murder and street fighting with knives every day. They have not been dazzled by the presence of 'Arafat and the Palestinian leadership in Washington wearing a gold medal with Israel. This is a people that does not stoop and does not fear. Its will is strong. God willing, the inevitability of victory is near. It is revolution until victory.
