A Syrian official told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the Washington negotiations are still going round in a vicious circle and that the Israeli delegation continues to evade adherence to the peace process, first and foremost the full withdrawal from the Golan Heights and the other occupied territories. The official added that the Washington negotiations have considerably and clearly exposed Israel's hostile position toward the peace process. "The Israelis continue to raise the same issues and provoke the same obstacle with a view to prolonging the negotiations and using the wasted time to circumvent the results of the Geneva summit, get around the Security Council resolutions, and empty them of any substance." The official went on to say that Rabin continues to insist on the tone of secret negotiations at a high level with the aim of torpedoing the negotiations and the U.S. initiative, eclipsing the resolutions of international legitimacy, and practicing blackmail against Syria, Lebanon, and the Arabs. Plus, Israel is going to impose other impossible conditions for the sake of playing for time and using the coming years in the service of its settlement schemes. The official called on the United States to adopt a firm position so that the time will not be wasted, because Syria cannot continue to engage in futile negotiations forever or allow Israel to lie to world public opinion and say that it is continuing the peace process merely to achieve its expansionist schemes. The official added that the peace process could collapse if Israel continues to ignore Arab demands. And Israel must know that there can be no peace in the region without Syria and that no agreement concluded with Israel has any hope of continuing or being implemented without Syria. Syria has a known and fixed position, namely not to relinquish a single inch of its territory or the other Arab territories. [passage omitted]
