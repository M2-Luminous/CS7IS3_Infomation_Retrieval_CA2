He expressed the opinion that the government is the party that first raised the issue of self- determination for the south. In an interview with AL-HAYAH, Dr. Nur-al-Da'im said that the Democratic National Grouping [DNG] "is experiencing organizational problems and disputes." He criticized the fact that "some Coordination Committee members engage in executive tasks and issue statements in the Grouping's name. He said that his party faults Faruq Abu-'Isa, who headed the DNG meetings recently, for "holding contacts and making statements in his capacity as the DNG executive chairman." He also criticized the Communist Party severely and urged it not to intervene in his party's affairs. Here is the text of the interview: [Dar-al-Na'im] What is your assessment of Sudan's conditions and what is the solution you offer for the country's problems? [Nur-al-Da'im] To date, we have lived nearly five years under the umbrella of the NIF [National Islamic Front], which staged a fascist military coup and proclaimed specific goals in its first communique--goals which included achievement of peace and elimination of the citizens' hardship and of the government's isolation. But secretly, the NIF's goal was to establish an Islamic society that would act as a model for the world's cultural tendency. But the outcome has been collapse in all spheres of humanitarian activity and the spread of corruption and maladies. Peace has become inaccessible and a terrorist autocratic regime has come into existence instead of an Islamic state. The NIF has committed suicide after 50 years of action. This is the crisis. The cure is achieved by developing a formula to ensure the restoration of peace and to liquidate the tyrannical state established by the NIF. A stable climate is the basis for a new beginning in development and construction. There is no magic wand to repair the damage. Sudan's political movement is aware of the developments occurring in today's world. Therefore, DNG plans and other parties' and unions' plans must be presented at a comprehensive conference in which the Sudanese, who seek freedom, agree on the future. [Dar-al-Na'im] Does your call for civil struggle against the regime still exist? What does this call mean? Will you accept a reconciliation formula that brings the government and the opposition together to deal with the situation? [Nur-al-Da'im] Our call for civil struggle continues to exist and to escalate. The final outcome will be a popular revolution similar to the revolutions that the Sudanese people have come to master and that they have already staged twice. Struggle against the dictatorship is of two kinds: the first is military and it is taking place in the south. The second is civil and it is taking place in the north. We have to be more optimistic and we have to hope to topple the regime at the lowest cost. The socialist camp governments were toppled within months by popular uprisings and by the so-called peaceful resistance. This is what brother al-Sadiq al-Mahdi (former prime minister and al-Ummah Party chairman) has called civil struggle. What happened during 'Id al-Fitr prayers, when al-Mahdi led nearly 1 million persons in prayer, whereas al-Bashir led no more than 1,000 persons less than three kilometers away, confirms that the Muslim masses support the al-Mahdi sect and not the NIF, the original and not the imported. There is no place for any bilateral formula between the NIF and al-Ummah Party, especially since the base of al-Ummah Party, which consists of the al-Ansar supporters, has considered confiscation of Imam al-Mahdi's Dome, al-Khalifah Mosque, and the al-Ansar Affairs Council building an aggression against the creed. The NIF is responsible for offending the Sudanese people's values. [Dar-al-Na'im] Many speak of points of agreement between you and the NIF. What are these points and what are the subjects of disagreement? [Nur-al-Da'im] The al-Ummah Party is one of Sudan's and Africa's biggest parties. It is a popular and broad-based democratic party with Arab, Islamic, and African tendencies. It has dealt with the NIF as it dealt with SANU [Sudan African National Union]. But after reconciliation with (former President) Ja'far Numayri, we disagreed on the future of Islam in Sudan. The NIF encouraged Numayri and pledged its allegiance to him as imam, whereas we decided that Islam can only flourish under the canopy of freedom. We, whether in the government or in the opposition, have cooperated with the NIF respectfully. Our party helped the NIF and protected it from communist oppression. But regrettably, the NIF has chosen the path of coups and of imposing its will by force. The collapse in the various aspects of life and the humiliation the citizen is experiencing have created a deep chasm between the NIF and al-Ummah Party in the political and Islamic spheres. [Dar-al-Na'im] You recently proposed a formula for an agreement with the southerners in which you call for a referendum on self-determination in four years. Has this formula been accepted by the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement? [Nur-al-Da'im] The al-Ummah Party chairman Sadiq al-Mahdi presented a complete peace plan in the wake of the failure of the first Abuja talks and when it became evident that the regime was offering, in the absence of the country's main forces, a deficient and limited vision that couldn't be accepted by the southern movement. The al-Ummah Party's plan focuses on a solution through consent among the Sudanese people. It also focuses on democracy; political, cultural, religious, and ethnic plurality; regional decentralism; federalism and confederalism; and on establishing citizenship as the basis. If war is the only alternative, then self-determination has to be considered in the light of permanent peace. The NIF proceeded to raise the self-determination issue at the Frankfurt talks that were held at the beginning of 1992 (between the government and the al-Nasir wing of the SPLM). This was the first time that the self-determination issue gained weight. Meanwhile, the war continued and the regime proceeded to touch off the religious and holy war dimension. The southerners united behind the call for self-determination that was introduced by the regime into the Sudanese political agenda for the first time ever. Brother Mubarak al-Mahdi submitted the al-Ummah Party formula to a session of the British House of Lords. This formula enables self-determination to proceed in the direction of Sudan's unity instead of the direction of separation. [Dar-al-Na'im] You have said repeatedly that external opposition is an arm of the internal opposition. What is the external opposition's task and what has it accomplished? [Nur-al-Da'im] In light of the domestic oppression, the fascism established by the regime, and the suppression of opponents, and even of disgruntled supporters, such as Mahjub 'Urwah, his faction, and his paper, AL-SUDANI AL-DUWALI, it is normal that the external opposition's voice would be heard clearly because this opposition is free to move. There is no doubt that the external arm of the DNG has accomplished several things, especially in exposing the deceptive image the regime has used to project itself abroad. This arm has also succeeded in condemning the regime's escalation of the war in the south and of its introduction of the religious dimension into this war, in defending human rights, and in projecting the Sudanese people's struggle for freedom. When opposition action escalated and came to be in need of a strong executive decisionmaking instrument, the DNG decided to work through a coordination committee to replace its minimal-level coordination. This led to the talk about restructuring the DNG abroad. It had been agreed to settle this issue at a conference, which was scheduled to take place last November. But the war circumstances prevented its convocation. The al-Ummah Party has noticed that some coordination committee members have been recently engaging in executive tasks and making statements in the Grouping's name. We have already warned that it is necessary to end such acts. Moreover, the al-Ummah Party has presented to the Grouping forces abroad a memorandum that contains specific proposals and observations on how to end such actions until the structure is completed. This is a legitimate issue that can be debated. There is no place for sensitivities in public action. [Dar-al-Na'im] Why have you called for ousting Faruq Abu-'Isa from the DNG leadership and what do you mean by saying that "he lacks neutrality?" [Nur-al-Da'im] Nobody slights the role that brother Abu-'Isa has played within the DNG, especially in defending human rights and upholding the opposition's banner. But what the al-Ummah Party faults Abu-'Isa for is that he has made contacts and issued statements in his capacity as DNG executive chairman. The fact is that brothers Abu-'Isa and Bona Maloual were selected to manage the sessions of a meeting held in Addis Ababa. The al-Ummah Party has decided that since Maloual has withdrawn and since Abu-'Isa has promoted himself to the position of DNG executive chairman, then the chairmanship is supposed to be periodic so embarrassment will be avoided. It isn't surprising that the external Communist Party would issue a statement defending brother Abu-'Isa, one of this party's historical leaders. What is surprising is that the Communist Party would dish out charges against brother Mubarak al-Mahdi, al-Ummah Party's representative abroad, and that it would turn the issue into a personal issue. Brother al-Mahdi and the team that leads al-Ummah Party's action abroad don't need the Communist Party to evaluate their performance because they have shouldered the main part of the burden to strengthen the DNG procession and the opposition leadership. [Dar-al-Na'im] Accusations have been made against Mubarak al-Mahdi because he has firm relations with the NIF. [Nur-al-Da'im] Mubarak al-Mahdi's relations with the NIF aren't personal relations. The al-Ummah Party Political Bureau has assigned Mubarak, along with Dr. Hasan Taj-al-Din and Dr. Shaykh Mahjub, to take charge of relations with the NIF. The party has assigned and Dr. Adam Musa Mawbu and me to follow up on the relations with the [Democratic] Unionist Party. It has also assigned brother Bakri 'Adil, Sarah al-Fadil, and Dr. Bashir 'Umar to tend to relations with the Communist Party, the Nasirist Revival [Ba'th] Party, and the National Party. With this twisted logic, we can list 'Adil and his team as supporters of the Communist Party. I urge the Communist Party not to embroil itself in such issues. We have expected that with the lapse of five years since the end of internationalism, the Communist Party would introduce us to its new position instead of allowing itself to enter into labyrinths that make us suspect that this party still doesn't believe in democracy. There is no doubt that the DNG is experiencing organizational problems and disagreements on how to deal with newly developing issues, such as the self-determination issue. However, such problems accompany every organization and movement. Opposition action has its numerous channels at home and abroad, and these channels have never been blocked. Regardless of whether the DNG is restructured or not, and regardless of whether the ambition of some individuals or factions makes them play or not play a role that is not assigned to them, the opposition procession at home and abroad will continue and will achieve results in defeating the regime that has begun to collapse and to be eroded by the power of the Sudanese people. [Dar-al-Na'im] The al-Ummah Party deputy chairman Nasr-al-Din al-Hadi recently made statements in which he criticized you and the official in charge of external action. What is your opinion? [Nur-al-Da'im] Brother Nasr-al-Din remained silent for ages and then opened his mouth only to utter a blasphemy. Like the Communist Party, he has moved to defend brother Abu-'Isa. We believe that he departed from Sudan to oppose the al-Ummah Party, not the regime. He has had no connection with the party's action at home or abroad. He has tried to dispute legitimacy of the party's institutions. Nasr-al-Din formed a small team, which he called the collective party leadership. But this team didn't survive long because its objective was to impede the role of the opposition al-Ummah Party and to serve the Front. As for Nasr-al-Din's talk about my appointment as chairman of the party's General Secretariat, it isn't true that I was selected. I won the majority of the votes in accordance with the party constitution. Responsibilities were divided and I became the General Secretariat chairman and the official in charge of the Political Department and Nasr-al-Din became finance secretary. When organizational performance was affected after most General Secretariat members entered the Cabinet, a committee that had reviewed the party performance recommended cancellation of the general secretariat system and reinstatement of the general secretary and deputy general secretary system. Party institutions approved this recommendation and selected me as secretary general and selected brother Bakri 'Adil as my deputy. At the time, an advisory presidential council was formed under the chairmanship of al-Sadiq al-Mahdi and it included previous secretariat members who hadn't been assigned any executive duties. Brother al-Sadiq al-Mahdi appointed brother Nasr-al-Din as his deputy in managing this council's sessions. Therefore, Nasr-al-Din wasn't the party deputy chairman, as he alleges. This position doesn't exist in the party constitution. It is regrettable that brother Nasr-al-Din al-Mahdi has come out to offend the party and its leaders. I have the honor to support the position of Mubarak al-Mahdi and his team. This is the least that the al-Ummah Party secretary general can do.
