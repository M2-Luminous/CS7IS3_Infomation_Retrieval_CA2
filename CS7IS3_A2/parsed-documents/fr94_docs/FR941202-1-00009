FR941202-1-00009 FR941202-1-00002 This paragraph would also apply to the nonrecourse provision that is a part of any credit contract meeting the definition of a reverse mortgage transaction. (See paragraph (a) of this section.) Some reverse mortgage transactions provide that a consumer's liability will not exceed a specific percentage of the projected home value, say 75 percent. Other reverse mortgages set the consumer's maximum liability at the ``net proceeds'' available from the sale of the home. That is, if a consumer sells the home for $100,000 and brokerage commissions and other incidental selling costs were $7,000, the creditor would receive no more than $93,000_the net proceeds of the sale. The Board believes that the purposes of the reverse mortgage disclosures would be enhanced if the calculations of projected total costs for ``net proceeds'' recourse limitations were based on uniform assumptions about the costs associated with the sale of the home. Thus, if a contract does not otherwise specify a percentage for net proceeds, creditors must assume closing costs of 7 percent, which approximates the amounts paid for typical brokerage fees and other incidental costs. The Board solicits comment on this approach. If another amount is more appropriate, commenters should provide the rationale for the alternative approach. 33(c)(5) Assumed Annual Appreciation Rates Section 138(a)(1) of the TILA requires each total annual loan cost rate to be based on one of (at least) three projected appreciation rates for the consumer's dwelling. The proposed regulation tracks the appreciation rates used in HUD's HECM program. That is, the total annual loan cost rates are based on assumed annual home appreciation rates of 0 percent, 4 percent and 8 percent. The Board believes these appreciation rates are appropriate estimates for reverse mortgage transactions. For example, HUD's program based the 4 percent annual appreciation rate on its assessment of long-term averages of historical housing appreciation rates. The 0 percent and 8 percent rates help consumers understand the potential costs and benefits of the loan if their dwelling does not appreciate in value at all, or if its value appreciated at a rate double the 4 percent rate. The Board solicits comment on other appreciation rates that might be used in lieu of the proposed rates; and if alternative rates are suggested, commenters should provide the rationale for why those rates would be a more appropriate measure for calculating the total annual loan cost rate. 33(c)(6) Assumed Loan Period Section 138(a)(1) of the TILA also requires each total annual loan cost rate to be based on one of (at least) three credit transaction periods, as determined by the Board, including a short-term reverse mortgage, a term equaling the actuarial life expectancy of the consumer, and ``such longer term as the Board deems appropriate.'' The proposed regulation tracks the assumed loan periods required under the HECM program: a period of two years, a period equal to the consumer's life expectancy, and a period equal to approximately 1.4 times the consumer's life expectancy (the creditor would use the life expectancy of the youngest consumer in transactions involving multiple borrowers). The Board believes these proposed loan periods produce total annual loan cost rates that will assist consumers in understanding the costs of the reverse mortgage transaction in the event that, for example, they move permanently from the dwelling either sooner or later than anticipated. (See the supplementary material accompanying proposed Appendix L for further discussion of the life expectancy data used to derive two of the assumed loan periods.) The statute authorizes the Board to require total annual loan cost rates for more than three assumed loan periods. The Board notes that, depending on the age of the borrower, a significant time interval could exist between the shortest loan period (two years) and the consumer's life expectancy. Accordingly, the Board solicits comment on whether other assumed loan periods, such as an assumed loan period of one-half of the life expectancy figure, should be added to the regulation; and if so, whether calculations based on the additional assumed loan periods should be required (which promotes uniformity), or optional. Appendix K_Total Annual Loan Cost Rate Computations for Reverse Mortgage Transactions The proposed regulation bases the calculation of total annual loan cost rates on a commonly used computation tool, an internal rate of return formula. The formula uses the estimation or ``iteration'' procedure required to compute APRs under Appendix J of this part. However, Appendix J is written in the context of forward (not reverse) mortgages. The proposed formulas are similar to those in Appendix J; however, to ease compliance and avoid confusion about terminology, definitions and instructions appropriate for reverse mortgages are placed in Appendix K.
