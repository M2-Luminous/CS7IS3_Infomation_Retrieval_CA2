He points out that "the Muslim authorities treat the Serbs in the Tuzla region as ethnic hostages, subjecting them to the most brutal terror and pogroms." Djurkovic notes that, "as of now, we have officially requested that 16,500 Serbs, individually named, be permitted to move to RS territory, but that has not been made possible." Djurkovic also notes that "great quantities of humanitarian aid are reaching Tuzla exclusively through the RS. However, the quantities reaching the Serbian population in Tuzla and its vicinity are only symbolic, intended only to prevent mass starvation among them. Even the Serbian humanitarian association `Dobrotvor' is under the total control of the Muslim military, who take for themselves whatever they consider to be of better quality. All this has been going on for months, but the representatives of international humanitarian organizations in Tuzla pay no attention to the frightful scenes of mass suffering of the Serbian people." According to Djurkovic, "Izet Hadzic, chairmen of the Tuzla region, is directly responsible for most of the hardship, pogroms, and persecution of Serbs." "The training center for Islamic terrorists in Tojsici near Tuzla is also under his leadership," maintains Djurkovic, noting that "the majority of instructors in this center are mojahedin from various Islamic countries, and many of them used to be criminals and terrorists in Europe. The Serbian side has evidence about the activities of Fadil Prcic, who has his own jail for Serbs and his private Muslim police. He, together with his assistant, Sherija Zajmovic, who is in charge of private jails for Serbs in Tuzla, has personally ordered and participated in the elimination of many Serbian families." In Djurkovic's opinion, it is becoming increasingly clear that the Serbs will have to determine the fate of their compatriots in the Tuzla region in response to the general mood of the people of Semberija, Majevica, and Posavina. He notes that Dr. Radovan Karadzic, president of RS, has recently also called attention to this necessity.
