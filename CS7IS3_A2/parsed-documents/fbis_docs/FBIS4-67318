The Liege police apprehended a 41-year-old Croat, Nemad Lukic, a Luxembourg resident, in possession of two kg of heroin. A further three arrests were carried out in Maastricht by the Netherlands police. The three persons concerned are currently being held in the Netherlands with a view to being extradited to Belgium, as requested by the Public Prosecutor's Office in Liege. The arrested individuals comprise one 39-year-old Maltese called Wooi Kok Geok, a 43-year-old Indonesian named Hadi Kesuma Bn Djimin, and a 43-year-old Chinese called Kuang Jeniy-Zhou. Finally, a businessman of Chinese origin, considered to be at the hub of heroin trafficking in Europe, was arrested in Luxembourg. The first four individuals arrested had been under close surveillance by various police units. Recently they met in Maastricht where Lukic took delivery of 2.15 kg of heroin. The moment he received the package, Lukic was unwittingly followed by police belonging to the Liege BSR branch, who then followed him to the Post House Hotel by the Liege-Herstal freeway. There Lukic was caught in possession of the drug, which turned out to be a Chinese variety of heroin, 80 percent pure, according to analyses carried out in a specialised laboratory at Liege University. When interrogated by the police, Lukic denied all the facts although he had been caught in possession of the drug. A warrant for his arrest was issued by the Public Prosecutor's Office in Liege and he was then locked up in Lantin prison. Two of the three individuals apprehended in the Netherlands were in possession of firearms. In Luxembourg, the investigation also led to the arrest of a 41-year-old Chinese trader named Wong Suk Yin, who is considered to be the key person for reselling heroin in several European countries. Wong Suk Yin told his investigators that he could regularly provide 10 kg of heroin of the same quality as that seized in Herstal. The confiscated heroin, which still had to be "blended" before being sold, because its purity made it potentially lethal if consumed in that form, had a market value of approximately 100 million Belgian francs. Various police departments are continuing their inquiry.
