The economic advisers of Eduardo Angeloz, Raul Alfonsin, and Fernando de la Rua outline where they agree and disagree. For some time now a heated political debate has been going on inside the Radical Civic Union (UCR). There are three clearly defined political factions in the party: Raul Alfonsin's, Eduardo Angeloz's, and Fernando de la Rua's. And just as there are three different political approaches, there are as many factions in economic policy as well. If we were to plot economic policy on a spectrum with interventionism on one end and the free market on the other, then all indications are that the economic advisers of Angeloz (Ricardo Lopez Murphy and Francisco Mezzadri) would be closest to the market, De la Rua's adviser (Adalberto Rodriguez Giavarini) would be in the middle, and Juan Vital Sourrouille of the Alfonsin faction would be farthest to the left and closest to interventionism. Our main question is: Are the economic philosophies within the UCR compatible? The advisers themselves answer the question in a way designed to temper the argument. Mezzadri contends that "there is a lot more agreement than disagreement among the professional economists who belong to the UCR. We may have our differences about the approach to policies, but on key issues such as the need for a stable, open Argentina, I do not see substantial differences. There may be different assessments among politicians, but not among economists." In the same vein, Mezzadri says that if Sourrouille were minister, in his opinion he would adhere to the guidelines of the Cavallo plan and not return to the previous approach. "I do not think that he would reverse course," he exclaims. Rodriguez Giavarini explains that "the economists you have mentioned (myself, Lopez Murphy, Mezzadri, and Sourrouille) may be associated with different factions, but we belong to the same party. We share many views, from a defense of stability, concern over the effectiveness of government spending, and the dangers of excessive vulnerability, to the need to boost the rate of savings and investment." No Consensus Although the economists themselves contend that they agree on major issues, one has the feeling that the economic program of a hypothetical Radical government would differ depending on its economy minister. And the differences would involve substance, not just approach. Let us see. It is obvious that Mezzadri and Rodriguez Giavarini do not think the same as Sourrouille. Whereas the former have praise for the Cavallo plan, Sourrouille criticizes it unceasingly. For example, with regard to the labor reform, Mezzadri contends that if it were up to him, it would be more sweeping than even the administration's. "There has to be flexibility for managerial, technological, financial, and labor movements. In some cases such mobility takes place easily, but in others, mainly labor, it does not exist at all. It is impossible to sustain an economic plan such as that with labor relations like the ones we have today." Sourrouille, in contrast, feels that although labor relations have to be made somewhat more flexible, the administration's approach is leaving the workers altogether defenseless. As for the exchange rate, Mezzadri says that it is the responsibility of Argentine businessmen to seek out new markets and to adopt an export-oriented stance. "The exchange rate has hurt some of them, but it has not impeded the growth of industrial exports...I do not see the exchange rate as a decisive obstacle. I do not think that those who say they cannot do anymore are working at peak economic efficiency." Yet, Angeloz's adviser thinks that more flexibility is indeed needed in internal factors in order to cut costs and improve competitiveness. In contrast, we need only glance at Sourrouille's remarks to realize that he blames the economic plan, and more specifically the exchange rate, for the mounting trade deficit. What Lies in Store The future of the plan is another issue that divides them. Mezzadri's thinking in this regard is clear-cut. He calls on the administration to step up its program and under no circumstances to stray from the current economic discipline. Rodriguez Giavarini is even more categorical: "The outlook would darken if the administration decided to become passive, as if nothing were happening in the world or, worse yet, to try and keep fueling domestic demand as a short-term fiscal tool, like more government spending, to channel the proceeds from the pending privatizations into consumption, or else to close off the economy." "The economic plan is unsustainable," said Sourrouille at a regional economic meeting of the UCR. The remark conceals an entire philosophy. In turn, we can hear this philosophy every day in Alfonsin's statements and, even more so, in the recent comments by Simon Lazzara ("A little bit of inflation would be acceptable if it boosted demand"). In short, a major faction of UCR politicians and economists feels that a marked change is needed in the rules of the game. What we are looking at, when all is said and done, is a full-fledged debate within the UCR marked by an unmistakable clash of ideas. This is not bad, per se, for a political party. What is harmful is to try and conceal these differences for the sake of appearing united before society. Mezzadri: "Social Investment Lacking" Back when Angeloz still had hopes of becoming president, in 1989, two men had a chance to become his economy minister. One was Lopez Murphy, and the other was Francisco Mezzadri, who in reply to a question from LA PRENSA emphasized that "there are fewer differences among UCR economists than there seem to be." - "The best thing about the administration's plan is that it incorporated the idea of economic discipline." - "You asked me whether I am going to be Angeloz's economy minister in 1995. Angeloz has a saying to answer that question: there are things that only he and his pillow know." - "My labor reform would be much more thorough-going than the government's." - "The State should not take action in the economic area, although it should do so efficiently in health care, education, defense, and security. In these fields the government should make social spending more efficient by setting goals and achieving them." - "The administration is wasting its time on second-rate political matters, such as the reform of the constitution, when it ought to be devoting that time to completing pending tasks such as the labor reform and the provincial reforms." - "The provinces ought to implement reform plans like the administration's plan. Only in this way will there be homogeneity in Argentina's economy." - "A second reform of the State is currently lacking. The first, which had to do with bringing the idea of economic efficiency into Argentina, has already been successfully completed. Now, in order for these efforts to bear fruit, the government needs to address social investment more efficiently." Sourrouille: "The Plan Is Unsustainable" The former economy minister in the last UCR government resumed his criticism of Minister Cavallo's economic plan in his remarks to the UCR regional economic meeting. - "There are two reports on Argentina. The first is that inflation is low, there is stability, interest rates are low, and foreign funds are coming into the country, albeit for speculative purposes. But the other has to note that there are tragic pockets of poverty and that unemployment remained at 10 percent of the population last year." - "Most of the country is suffering crises that seem definitive for the sake of achieving macroeconomic success." - "The administration's plan is good for only one segment of the population, while the majority of people are enduring a situation of neglect in which they cannot find any space." - "Social strains that could explode in the medium term are being fomented." - "The two problems facing the Cavallo plan, which are impossible to resolve under this model, have to do with the trade deficit and unemployment. And I see no possibility of solving them under this arrangement." Rodriguez Giavarini: "The Accomplishments Are Unquestionable" Adalberto Rodriguez Giavarini is an economic consultant and Fernando de la Rua's main economic adviser. "The administration must remain on this course and under no circumstances close off the economy," he said in an interview with LA PRENSA. - "The economic plan has made three major gains possible. Price stability is foremost. The other two are in fiscal policy and economic activity. The consumer price index over the past six months is equivalent to an annualized rate of 3.1 percent, which is similar to the rate in the United States over the past 12 months." - "There has been major growth in economic activity, although we can criticize the exaggerated consumption slant that the expansion has shown." - "As far as fiscal policy is concerned, the effort to balance the budget and eliminate distorting taxes is praiseworthy." - "The growth in government spending of dubious effectiveness concerns me." - "Some aspects of the technical design of the plan are debatable. I would have preferred more incentives for domestic savings rather than spending on public and private consumption." - "I am not pleased about the administration's tendency to proceed on a case-by-case basis, with a large degree of discretionary authority and straying from the sound principles of universality and transparency." - "The administration should step up its fiscal austerity to try to offset the upward pressure that higher international interest rates put on domestic interest rates, by bringing down the country-risk premium." - "The strategy of fiscal austerity should be complemented by progress on pending matters, particularly the labor and provincial reforms and incentives for domestic savings." - "Inflation must be seen as an extremely regressive tax. If the government merely signals that it would be willing to tolerate a little inflation in exchange for growth, I think that the economic agents would react by penalizing it heavily, and this would lead to capital flight and a contraction in credit and production. As you will see, then, I do not agree at all with Lazzara's statements."
