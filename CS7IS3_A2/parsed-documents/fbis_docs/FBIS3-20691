Some time ago UNPROFOR and the NATO information services responsible for monitoring the development of military technology established that the Serbs had developed and started serial production of "shells of the range and destructiveness of missiles." What the military magazines of the former JNA [Yugoslav People's Army] wrote about in 1990 has become reality. Belgrade, which continues to allocate 75 percent of the state budget to the army, has sent artillery ammunition of increased destructive power not to the testing ranges but directly to the real war. The M-65 155-mm caliber Serb howitzers produced under U.S. license fire shells that are made of new materials and filled with better powders. The Serbs have constructed an artillery shell "with an extended range and increased destructive power." Its main characteristic is ribbed embossment in the center part (the Serbs call them "little ribs"). The "little ribs" prevent undesired activity with the extended-length shell. They can therefore be fired from common artillery pieces, and there is no need to construct special gun and howitzer barrels or to refashion existing ones. This means that the Serbs, at the time of a difficult economic crisis, have no intention of writing off their old artillery technology. Instead of replacing artillery pieces, they simply change the ammunition for more modern and effective ammunition. For instance, the shells are filled with the so-called progressive powder, which can increase velocity by 8 to 12 percent. During combustion, the progressive powder creates constant pressure, which equals the highest pressure allowed. Apart from the shells with the "little ribs," the Serbs have been doing intensive work on creating 155-mm caliber precision-guided missiles (they are also planning production of the 203-mm caliber) by adding great precision in hitting very small, moving, but significant targets to the existing destructive power of the missile. Doctrine Tested in Bosnia-Herzegovina The Serb military doctrine, which is also formed on the basis of experience at the fronts in Bosnia-Herzegovina, considers the proportion of surface-to-surface missiles of short (tactical) range, multiple rocket launchers, and long-range artillery simply irreplaceable in the fighting against the opponent echelons and in blocking city areas. The Serbs intend to change the non-nuclear (common) warhead of the Luna surface-to-surface missile into a cluster warhead with 830 bombs that are extremely effective against low-resistance targets, such as missile systems in position, radars, trucks, and all kinds of towed artillery. However, the warhead cannot be used effectively to destroy better protected armored vehicles, especially tanks with active and reactive armor. The 262-mm caliber Serb Orkan multiple rocket launcher has similar effects; the Orkan's 12 truck-mounted barrels launch missiles whose warheads have various kinds of subammunition. The 12-missile salvo of the Orkan warhead covers the target with 7,728 pellets (bombs), which have a destructive effect on exposed infantry (as well as civilian population), low-resistance technology and other low-resistance targets (trucks, classical artillery, [samohotke] with thin armors). As a rule, tanks survive Orkan missile strikes. The Serbs have thus developed two additional items that they have been testing in Bosnia-Herzegovina (Sarajevo): precision-guided warheads and sensor-initiated self-guided (antitank) ammunition. The first group consists of cluster-type missile warheads with subammunition where the warhead is guided to the target area, and after it "recognizes" the target, it lowers the subammunition that guides itself to tanks and hits them from above. That kind of filling has a cluster effect, which pierces the armor, but so does the explosive-formed bullet that is very close to the armor it pierces with its kinetic energy. These weapons belong to the intelligent or smart systems, and the important feature of them is that they consist of microelectronic devices containing memory that should enable them to distinguish between real and false targets. The cluster warhead, launched by the missile, transfers from the ballistic path to the planned one, and, under a very gentle angle, reaches the target. The memory device recognizes targets, at which it throws 16 to 24 self-guided bullets. Destructive Smart Subammunition The microprocessor memory device distinguishes real from false targets on the basis of an infrared image of the target. The sensor-initiated artillery ammunition can also destroy tanks. This is where 155- and 203-mm caliber artillery shells are used. At a certain point in the trajectory, their bottom is kicked out and the subammunition comes out of the missile body (the 155-mm shell contains two, and the 203-mm three pieces of such subammunition), which descends to the zone of marked targets by parachute, where, with its sensor device, it locates a particular target, and then the explosion creates a drop-shaped missile that destroys the tank by hitting the roof part of the armor, its thinnest part. This subammunition has multispectral sensors (infrared, radar, and radiometric), which are active while they descend to the target by parachute. After the opening of the brake parachute, a gentle rotation of sensor devices starts in the searching phase, with a vertical descent velocity of 10 meters per second. When it fixes on the target, the device uses the memory to analyze it, combining sensor signals and determining the optimal time for activating the explosive filling, which shapes the drop-shaped body for piercing the armor. Detonation occurs at a distance of 150 meters from the tank. Three Applications With their new technology and enhanced accuracy, the Serbs want to destroy the rapidly increased power of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. This mainly applies to: guided missiles, command positions, and radio-electronic systems. They also want to neutralize Muslim guns, howitzers, mortars, and antiattack batteries. The new "smart" subammunition will serve to protect flanks, interspaces, and engineering obstacles; it will be used for preparation and counterpreparation, and for neutralizing and decimating the Muslim units in the gathering zones, during the time of approaching the front end of the opponent's defense or on the line of development for attack. There is also the destruction of tanks and infantry wedged into the Serb defense, as well as support for the counterattacks and counterstrikes of other echelons and reserves. The ultimate scope of this undoubtedly important effort in employing the "remodeled" and reinforced missile-artillery potential of the Serb army in Bosnia-Herzegovina embraces the three applications of the armed forces: -- Regrouping, which means that hostilities of medium and high intensity have broken out, and it is necessary to prevail by maneuvering and having great arms power (precisely aimed); -- Anticipation, which means maneuvering to prevent an outbreak of hostilities, by developing all the available "precision-guided ammunition"; -- Deterrence, which means making the enemy (without starting one's own forces from their stationary positions) refrain from any war activities or combat activities of great intensity, as they would be destroyed by the Serb artillery-missile equipment. The ultimatum to the Serbs can therefore be viewed as having several levels. By claiming to protect the Muslims, NATO is actually thinking of its own skin -- and armor.
