[Grachev] We have signed a protocol on intent; I have in mind the setting up of Russian military bases in Georgia. The establishment of three bases is planned: in Tbilisi, in the region of Vaziani, Akhalkalaki, and Batumi. The Batumi base will have branches in Sukhumi, Poti, and Gudauta. They will be created on the basis of troops of the Group of Russian Forces in the Transcaucasus [GRFT] currently located in these areas. These are primarily ground troops and air forces; helicopters, a few Su-25 type attack aircraft, and some fighter-bomber aircraft. The plan includes stationing Black Sea Fleet warships in the Poti region. Where a specific base will be located and the operational task it will fulfill will depend on geography. They will be set up by 1 July 1994. [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] What will be the direct tasks of these bases? [Grachev] Ensuring the security of Russia and the states in the Transcaucasus region that are part of the Treaty on Collective Security. [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Has the question of border troops been resolved? [Grachev] I can only say that the joint border between Georgia and Russia that exists today will not be moved. [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Pavel Sergeyevich, has the question of bringing the Russian troops deployed in Abkhazia under the command of GRFT commander General Reut finally been resolved? [Grachev] All troops located in Georgia are subordinate to General Reut with the exception of the 345th Airborne Regiment. This regiment is directly subordinate to me and is my strategic reserve. [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] To whom will the Russian troops who are to fulfill the role of peacekeeping forces in Abkhazia be subordinate, and who will finance them? [Grachev] The peacekeeping forces will be under the command of Colonel General Georgiy Kondratyev, deputy defense minister. As for their financing, this is a painful question. We still do not have a UN Security Council mandate enabling Russian troops carrying out a peacekeeping mission in countries of the former USSR to be peacekeepers under the aegis of the UN. Therefore, they do not pay us and we have to bear the expenses ourselves. Nevertheless, we are not abandoning our mission, viewing Georgia as a single entity. However, this is both Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Dzhaba Ioseliani, member of Parliament, chairman of the Interim Committee for the State of Emergency: [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Batono [Georgian polite form of address] Dzhaba, how effective is the method of settling Abkhazian problems by means of the deployment of Russian peacekeeping forces in the conflict zone? [Ioseliani] I do not see any other way out of the situation that has been created. This is the most civilized way. The peacekeeping forces will, I hope, be able to restore order and peace on Abkhazian land. [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Was the question of the return of refugees to Abkhazia examined separately? [Ioseliani] We presented to the Russian side a plan for the stage-by-stage return of the refugees. Work on it will be recorded in a document. I am certain that everything will be fine as far as this question is concerned. Andrey Kozyrev, Russian Federation minister of foreign affairs: [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] It is no secret that there were many people in Russia who were opposed to the president coming to Tbilisi and signing a treaty with Georgia. How do you, as a diplomat, assess this step and the significance of the visit? [Kozyrev] Boris Nikolayevich is president and, as such, on hearing all opinions, he adopts the only courageous decision that immediately represents a significant step forward. The most important thing in the signing of this treaty is that it is a huge incentive to achieve a political settlement in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. This is the most important thing. [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] The problem of returning refugees to Abkhazia is of great concern to us.... [Kozyrev] To us also. I hope that a decision will be adopted on the signing of an agreement that is coordinated with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, which will result in the beginning of this process. This is a key issue and it is very strange that certain difficulties have arisen precisely with the Georgian side. [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Nevertheless, as it turns out, Russia's interests in Georgia are great. [Kozyrev] Russia's strategic and geopolitical interests have always been closely connected with Georgia. I do not think we should fear such an expression as Russia's vital interests; and, on the other side, Georgia's vis-a-vis Russia. The only problem is that we should regard this visit by President Yeltsin to Georgia not as a substitute for efforts to regulate the conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia but, on the contrary, as an incentive to achieve a settlement. [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] How do you see the future of Abkhazia? [Kozyrev] I believe that the future of Abkhazia lies within the sphere of the territorial integrity of Georgia; in the acquisition by it of the corresponding political, legal, and economic status and in the division of powers and rights between, let us say, the center and Abkhazia. If both sides show enough common sense and do not aim for a resolution of this problem by force, they will be able to take advantage of this propitious chance and the services offered by Russia, and develop some kind of principle that will enable both Abkhazia and Georgia to occupy themselves on the whole not with military but peaceful matters. General Sergey Shoygu, chairman of the Russian State Committee for Emergency Situations: "The Abkhazian problem will be regulated if the sides do not hinder this." [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] General, do you think that, this time, Russia will cope with its role as peacekeeper in Georgia? [Shoygu] Yes, provided the Georgian and Abkhazian sides do not hinder this. [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] What about the last time...? [Shoygu] Last time: I said two weeks prior to your surrender of Sukhumi that all this will end in a big war. I will not participate in this bloodbath. That was why I tendered my resignation. [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] What is your prediction regarding events in Abkhazia? [Shoygu] A most sad one. Look, we are returning to what we should have done four months ago. I suggested bringing into Abkhazia a regiment under the control of UN observers in order to establish order. The same thing is now being suggested but I think the opportunity has been missed. Boris Pastukhov, Russian Federation first deputy minister of foreign affairs: [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Mr. Pastukhov, you participated directly in the resolution of questions concerning the conflict in Abkhazia and Georgian problems in general. What, in your view, awaits Russian-Georgian relations in the future? [Pastukhov] Our full-fledged cooperation, including economic cooperation, is only just beginning. The point is that we all have had considerable success in destroying and wrecking a lot of things. Moreover, what is now going on in our countries is retribution. [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Do you think that the ratification of the treaty signed today will be a problem in the Russian Duma? [Pastukhov] No treaties are ratified without problems. However, in this case, much depends on how we work in the sphere of regulation and whether we prove our good intentions with deeds: So that the treaty does not remain empty words but becomes something of principle, something big, and something that will guide the destiny of our peoples.
