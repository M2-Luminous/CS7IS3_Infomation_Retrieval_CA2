Distinguished President: I expressed a number of concepts and ideas at the Federal Electoral Institute's regular meeting on 18 June, and I confirm them today. The people have a true saying that goes: He who gets angry, loses. I am more than angry; I am indignant and disappointed with my current position where I have done all I can possibly do. I have found people, however, from many sectors who, in the country's current situation, are only fighting for their own interests or those of their sector without caring for Mexico. On several occasions, I have urged society and the interior to base our actions exclusively on the truth. The response has been more lies, slander, and hypocrisy. I promised to be impartial in my relations with all the political parties when I assumed this position. I am beginning not to be impartial with one of them because I am not and cannot ever agree with the actions of several sectors in that party. One should recognize when it is time to leave. Due to my convictions and dignity, the time has come for me to do so. I no longer feel useful to the country in the political positions I accepted with the sole desire to serve Mexico. I am not a party man. I am really not a man of power. Thus, I will never again accept another political position. For the aforementioned reasons, I respectfully request you accept my resignation from the post of interior secretary with which you honored me. I also want to thank you for your support and your trust in my work at the positions you assigned to me. I want to leave evidence that you never requested anything illegal from me while I occupied those positions. I also want to express my gratitude to my immediate assistants for their invaluable support during the past five years. My norm, during the years I occupied political positions, was to strictly implement the law and to propose changes that would improve the law; my method was to have dialogue with reason. I fervently hope Mexican society and interior will reaffirm their adherence to the law and to truth. Mexico may be going through difficult moments, but, as in other occasions in its history, it will move ahead and will come out stronger. I take this opportunity to reiterate my respect. [signed] Jorge Carpizo McGregor, interior secretary.
