Comrade Nguyen Duc Binh, member of the Political Bureau and secretary of the party Central Committee, attended and addressed the conference. According to the report presented by the Central Ideological Agencies Bloc party organization's executive committee, for more than two years now, ideological, cultural, and artistic activities have helped to motivate everyone to step up production and score achievements in all fields. The report also pointed out a number of drawbacks that need to be overcome. Based on past achievements and shortcomings, the report set forth the key orientations for 1994-95 as follows: It is necessary to satisfactorily implement the party Central Committee's resolutions on the need to carry out ideological, cultural, and artistic activities aimed at shifting the country to a new stage of development through the implementation of a national industrialization and modernization program based on socialist orientations. The report stressed the importance of party-building activities. It is necessary for all party organizations to concentrate efforts on enhancing party militancy; overcoming the danger of socialist disorientation; fighting all indications of waste, red tape, and corruption; eliminating the danger of being left behind; and foiling the enemy's peaceful evolution strategy. It is particularly important for party chapters to devise practical and interesting party activities to make them appeal to the masses. Speaking on this occasion, Comrade Nguyen Duc Binh pointed out the important role of ideological and cultural activities in enhancing party militancy. It is necessary to make cadres, party members, and the entire people clearly understand that given the country's new development stage, everyone must strive to overcome difficulties, step up production, and avoid the danger of being left behind. It is important for theoretical agencies to draw practical experiences from national and international developments at an early date. It is equally important for the mass media to step up propaganda activities aimed at making the people sharpen their determination and at encouraging businessmen to improve their skills. It is particularly important for the Central Ideological Agencies Bloc party organization to make everyone clearly understand the enemy's peaceful evolution strategy aimed at creating political unrest and at undermining our national development efforts. Also at today's session, many delegates expressed their views, further clarifying the causes leading to problems and suggesting measures to carry out the tasks for the days ahead. The conference is scheduled to last for two days.
