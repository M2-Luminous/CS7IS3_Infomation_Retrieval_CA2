And politics serves the goal of "stability", Beijing's euphemism for one-party domination. To give the impression that the economy is in order and everything is under (party) control, various ministries and media have been dispensing misleading and, at times, contradictory information. And to prevent hyperinflation and unemployment -- a potent mix that might jeopardise the "dictatorship of the proletariat" -- from worsening, numerous market reforms have been put on hold. Let us first examine claims last Thursday [12 May] by the Minister of the State Economics and Trade Commission (SETC), Wang Zhongyu, that, according to a survey of 16 provinces and cities, "barely 10 per cent" of enterprises had either stopped production or were operating below capacity". Mr Wang, sometimes regarded as Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji's point man for fiscal liberalisation, then charged the foreign press with exaggerating the plight of the state-owned sector. The SETC chief's assertions contradict numerous internal and public surveys that at least 40 per cent of government-run enterprises in major cities have been shut down or are idling. The situation would actually be scarier if Mr Wang's statements were true. It would mean that the banks were again printing money to bail out state-held firms, 47 per cent of which are in the red. Then there were the equally wild claims last month by cadres and the media alike that inflation had been "brought under control". These contentions were based on the fact that, in March, the year-on-year increase in consumer prices was 0.5 per cent less than that in February. Comparable figures for the services sector and for producer goods were respectively 0.3 and 5.1 per cent. These statistics -- and the rosy projections based on them -- are queried by Western economists. Aside from the need to bankroll money-losing enterprises and pay millions of workers who are owed back salaries, the central government has been unable to curb spending, due to its failure to stop localities engaging in development projects that are outside state plans. Speaking in Hong Kong last week, the Vice-Minister of Construction Tan Qinglian said fixed-asset investment this year would come to 1,300 billion yuan (about HK$1,157 billion), up 13 per cent from 1993. The semi-official China News Service (CNS) [ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE] reported last week, however, that the outlay on new infrastructure would actually amount to a staggering 1,500 billion yuan. And how about reports that grain production had "stabilised" in spite of the massive depletion of arable land as well as the dramatic speed with which farmers are forsaking wheat and rice for commercial crops. Earlier this week, CNS quoted agrarian experts as expressing optimism about future harvests because "China's comprehensive ability to produce grain had in general stabilised at the level of over 425 billion kilograms". Informed sources said the State Statistical Bureau (SSB) and the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) had come up with different statistics for the 1993 grain yield, and a ferocious argument had broken out over which set of figures should be used. The substantially higher SSB statistics were challenged by the MOA, which contended that, given factors including loss of land and bad harvests, their figures were more realistic. The State Council decided against the MOA, on the grounds that "most people had assumed that China's capacity was 425 billion kg and a figure significantly lower than that could trigger the kind of panic buying that took place last December". Even more disturbing than cooking the books, however, is the decision by Beijing to maintain order and stability by mothballing or scaling down reform measures announced last November. Citing the fact that Beijing had lost 500 billion yuan worth of state assets in the past decade, the central government has clamped down on the key reform measure -- the sale and radical restructuring of state-owned firms. The State Council announced last weekend it had taken back powers by provincial and municipal administrations to sell state firms to foreigners or to convert them into shareholding companies. Also under the pretext of restoring fiscal discipline, Vice-Premier Zhu has ordered the temporary closure of futures markets in areas including steel, sugar and coal. All existing futures markets have to be re-registered after a strict auditing process. Displaying his colours as the Great Rectifier, Mr Zhu has been touring the provinces dispensing old-style state fiats along the way. The economic tsar ordered Guangdong and Zhejiang to grow more grain. Guizhou was told to slash tobacco production. And Heilongjiang and Liaoning were asked to change the production lines of their enterprises. In a throwback to central planning, specific targets were slapped on localities. For example, the acreage for real-estate development for Guangdong has been set at 100,000 mu (one mu equals 0.0667 hectares). Fujian was told to close 20 "wasteful" industrial parks to save 102 sq km of land. And in spite of its commitment to rejoining the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Beijing has put new restrictions on foreign trade in an apparent effort to narrow its US$12 billion (HK$92.6 billion) a year trade deficit. For example, Beijing arbitrarily stopped the import of a range of petrochemical products in the spring, and local governments' autonomous powers over foreign trade have been curtailed. Summing up the conservative mode in economic policy, SETC's Mr Wang said last week: "Whether it is today or tomorrow, privatisation is not the necessary trend for the reform of China's state-held enterprises. It is also impossible for the state-owned sector to be replaced by other economic elements -- or for it to undergo major structural changes." As Premier Li Peng reiterated on Monday, "maintaining social stability is the major business that the centre and localities must grasp". The sober reality is that, instead of looking ahead and finding long-term solutions, the leadership is making do with stop-gap measures to shore up the regime, such as re-centralising economic decision-making, propping up the ailing state enterprises, and keeping the 200 million unemployed on the dole. Living under the shadow of Deng Xiaoping's impending death -- and the power struggle that will ensue should he pass on -- even usually vigorous politicians such as Mr Zhu are unwilling to take the smallest risks.
