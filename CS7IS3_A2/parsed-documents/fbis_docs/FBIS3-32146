We are going to hear an excerpt of our conversation. Our first question to him was: What are the fundamental objectives of this trip? [Begin (Sabala) recording] The fundamental objectives of the trip are to analyze with the Japanese Amateur Federation the 1994 agreement it has with Cuba, which is a very broad agreement. We (?plan to go there, in) June, with amateurs and professionals, with our team. And (?we will be in Japan again) in September-October, with professional teams. There are plans for Japan to come to Cuba in February, with the national team, and a university team from Sendai to come to Cuba, in February. They are also interested in [words indistinct] Cuban technicians to work with their university team; and there is also a juvenile program established, for youths 16-18 years of age from the Cuban team to go to Japan for 15 days beginning in 1994 -- because there is an annual plan for the relations between our teams for the youth world championship. These are, broadly speaking, the things that we are going to discuss in Japan, and from that will emerge other talks. They want exchanges with our technicians, which are taking place now. Pedro Medina and Calzadilla will be traveling with me. They are going to work with the Dragons, in (Denagoya); the following week, Miguelito and Chinea from Villa Clara will go to work with the Tokyo Giants [words indistinct] give some 15-day courses, for our improvement. And they are also interested in learning the technical (?elements) of our baseball. (end recording] [passage omitted]
