K. Omelyukh, department director, GSKTB selkhozkhimmash; Ye. A Barysh, department deputy director; S. M. Dutko, head engineer; and A. I. Kolobich, department director: ``Machines for Plant Protection''] [Text] The Lvovkhimselkhozmash Production Association is a supplier of boom and blower sprayers (except for a small quantity of OPV-1200A sprayers transferred to the Tadzhikkhimselkhozmash Plant for production), fertilizer distributors and machines for disinfecting livestock buildings. Most articles are produced as unified families out of basic models and units employing a modular unit layout. However, designers are devoting increasingly greater attention to making machines all-purpose by using various interchangeable tools for surface and soil application, spray rods with hose reels, and so on, and showing concern for improving the health and hygienic conditions of the work of machine operators. Creation of machines making it possible to raise productivity by increasing operating width and speed, and using devices capable of reducing working fluid consumption rates appears promising. The equipment will become less material- and energy-intensive, and it will be fitted out with automated systems based on electronics and microprocessor technology. In 1991 the Lvovkhimselkhozmash Production Association produced 26,500 sprayers and fertilizer distributors; however, this amount turned out to be insufficient to completely satisfy the demand for equipment. In most cases rural laborers failed to receive enough of the machinery they needed because of shortfalls in deliveries of a number of associated parts and materials, and owing to an ill-conceived pricing policy. Information exchange among CIS countries has weakened unfortunately. Sometimes farmers are unaware of what kind of equipment is being produced, where it could be ordered and how much it costs. Readers will be interested in our report on machines in series production at plants of this production association. The plant can offer the following machines today: OP-2000-2 small trailed boom sprayer; OPSh-15 trailed boom sprayer; OM-630-2 small mounted boom sprayer; PZhU-2.5 liquid fertilizer distributor; PZhU-5 liquid fertilizer distributor; PZhU-9 liquid fertilizer distributor; MDPF-2000 trailed disinfector; OPV-2000 trailed blower sprayer; POM-630 and POM-630-1 mounted fertilizer distributor-sprayer; OP-32000 fertilizer distributor; OP-32000-1 fertilizer distributor-sprayer. A diversity of standard tank sizes permits sensible use of equipment in all conditions: in zones with small field maps and a pass length of up to 1 km (630 and 1,200 liter tanks); with midsized field maps and a pass length of up to 2 km (2,000 liter tank); in zones with large field maps and a pass length of up to 3 km (3,200 liter tank); with large field maps and a pass length greater that 3 km; in farms with fields located far away from the central farmstead (6,400 liter tank). Rural laborers, including commercial farmers, will be interested in a new family of boom-type machines for plant protection and for application of liquid mineral fertilizers. The MZU-320 and MZU-320-1 mounted machines and the MZU-1200 trailed machine will be an aid in protecting field row and vegetable crops with liquid chemical or microbiological preparations, and they will provide for surface application of basic solutions of complete liquid fertilizers. They can also be used successfully to disinfect livestock buildings and to wash agricultural machines with the help of spray rods supplied by special order. The machines are outfitted with units for mechanized working mixture preparation, and they are equipped with a special system for flushing the tank and all lines after spraying in order to ensure maximum environmental protection. The MZU-3200 machine for plant protection and fertilizer application is intended for chemical protection of serial crops cultivated by intensive procedures with a constant equipment track width (1,800 mm), and other field crops against pests, diseases and weeds under routine and small-volume spraying conditions, while its MZU-3200-1 modification is intended both for surface application of pesticides and complete liquid fertilizers (including with intensive procedures without a constant equipment track width), and for surface application of herbicides and their simultaneous placement with soil-working implements, and internal application of complete liquid fertilizer simultaneously with presowing soil working by cultivators. An attachment for surface application of all-purpose herbicides with their simultaneous placement in the soil by BMSh-15, BMSh-20 and BIG-3A harrows hitched to SP-16A units, used for internal application of complete liquid fertilizers, may be added to the MZU-3200-1 machine at the client's request. Sprayers are equipped with horizontally stabilized hydraulic wide-swath booms, which guarantees high processing quality at an operating speed of up to 12 km/hr. The process itself as well as folding and raising of the boom are controlled by a hydraulic system from the tractor cab. The height of the boom is adjustable from 0.7 to 1.8 m. Four standard sizes of slot sprayers and two of deflector sprayers make it possible to vary consumption of working fluid per hectare within a wide range. Attachments are secured by quick-release bayonet joints. A closed stream method is used to adjust the machinery for work. Sprayers are outfitted by a separate order with an automatic control system (SAURZh) ensuring stable maintenance of a set consumption rate with a deviation of 5 percent even with change in speed. There is a device for mechanizing preparation of working mixtures, and an extra tank (320 liters) for clean water used to flush the lines. Specialists of the GSKTB selkhozkhimmash [not further identified] are conducting scientific research and experimental design work to create machinery for a contact wetting method of applying herbicides and plant growth regulators, electrostatic sprayers, sprayers employing a pneumatic spray-forming system, aerosols with controllable drop size, and machines for separate delivery of pesticides and water. Some of the work is being done jointly with companies of the FRG. In addition the GSKTB selkhozkhimmash is working on a contract basis to prepare equipment for pesticide-conserving plant protection procedures that produce a savings of preparations of up to 50 percent, and to introduce them into the farms of clients; for band placement of herbicides in the cultivation of corn, sugar beets and other industrial crops by means of the OPK-8 sprayer-distributor; for highly productive remote spraying of potatoes against the Colorado beetle and cereal crops against pests using the OPU-320 sprayer (with a working fluid consumption rate of 1-20 liters/ha); for processing potatoes (OPSh-320, OPSh-630) against phytophthora using pneumatic booms (with a consumption rate of 20-100 liters/ha); for treatment of small volumes of potatoes (PSK-20) prior to planting and storage (with a working fluid consumption rate of 3-8 liters/tonne); introduction of a biological plant protection method of releasing entomophages by means of RESh-18 boom sprayers, and OShU-50 and PRE-35 blower sprayers for releasing Trichogramma; sanitary and hygienic processing of livestock buildings using a cold aerosol generator. The ZR-2000, ZR-3200, ZR-3200-1 and MPR-3200 mixer-loaders, which are intended for preparation of working fluids out of quickly dissolving ingredients and for loading sprayers, occupy a special place in the outfit of machines for chemical plant protection. They are fitted out with a tapered container for storage of concentrated pesticides and a system for their metered delivery. The pumping unit of ZR-2000 and ZR-2000-1 mixers is driven by an internal combustion engine (made in the USA) while that of the ZR-3200 is driven by the tractor's power takeoff shaft. Lvov designers have developed the OMT-100 small sprayer for commercial farms, leasing organizations and peasant farms. This device is mounted on a T-010 tractor of the Kharkov Tractor Plant and the AZhMK-8 of the Gomselmash Plant, and it is intended for chemical protection of orchards, vineyards, and vegetable and other crops. It can be used for disinfection and disinfestation of buildings, for irrigation of small private plots, and in orchard and gardening cooperatives. Comparison of the basic specifications of the new generation of sprayers with the best foreign analogues shows that in terms of productivity, swath, lifting capacity, working fluid consumption rates and other indicators, they correspond to world standards. However, designers still have more work to do to reduce weight and material content, to upgrade the quality of manufacture, and to improve appearance. Designers are also troubled by the problem of raising the effectiveness of chemical plant protection measures, which depends in many ways on the proficiency of machine operators and competent operation of equipment. This is precisely why the association has organized a training center at which to upgrade the qualifications of machine operators. It has been supplied with posters describing the layout, adjustment and control of the machines. Specialists will soon be offered illustrated manuals offering recommendations on the use, technical maintenance, storage, preservation and repair of the machines. It is to be published this year. The equipment is being sold both through the Agropromsnab [not further identified] and through direct contracts. Those wishing to acquire the machines need to sign a contract with the Lvovkhimselkhozmash Production Association or pay for the machines in advance. For information call 34-33-81.
