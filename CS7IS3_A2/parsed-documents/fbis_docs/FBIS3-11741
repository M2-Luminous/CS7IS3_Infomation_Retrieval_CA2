The National Defense Secretariat also confirmed its unalterable and absolute determination to honor President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's orders. The bulletin also says the Mexican Army will not seek to negatively influence the peace and reconciliation process taking place in Chiapas for any reason whatsoever. The bulletin proceeds to explain that the troops movement taking place in Chiapas is mostly intended to relieve the units in Chiapas and at the same time give the soldiers who have been stationed in the region for a long time some rest. In addition, the bulletin emphasizes that the land mobilizations have mainly been to resupply the troops with food and equipment. This, the bulletin indicates, has nothing to do with the cease-fire or the agreement to discontinue all hostilities during the time the negotiation period agreed on in Altos de Chiapas is in effect.
