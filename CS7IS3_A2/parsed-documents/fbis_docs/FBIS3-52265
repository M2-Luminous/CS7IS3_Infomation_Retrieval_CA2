[passage omitted] Information Minister Dr. Muhammad Salman delivered a speech in which he said: A few days ago, we bid farewell to 1993, which witnessed sweeping events throughout the world, the gravest of which in our region was the aggression Israel committed against Lebanon to depopulate the south and eradicate the peace process from its roots. Israel was calculating on the assumption that by its new aggression, it would be able to impose new facts in the arena of conflict in order to avoid the requirements of peace and to undermine the U.S. initiative, which considers the implementation of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 a basis for achieving a just and comprehensive peace in the region. The minister pointed out that the second event was the Gaza-Jericho agreement, which was born in the back corridors of Oslo away from the Madrid framework and the Washington talks and even further away from joint Arab coordination that Syria considers a true expression of the unity of the Arab position in the peace talks and its commitment to achieving peace on all tracks. The information minister said that these two events were part of Israeli attempts to disavow the resolutions of the international legitimacy and to single out this or that Arab party by using force against it and drawing it into unilateral negotiations in order to create a deep rift in the Arab position and to impose the peace of the occupier and the outlaw. Dr. Salman said President Hafiz al-Asad has asserted that a comprehensive and just peace requires an end to the occupation, aggression, injustice, and any other form of hegemony. Therefore, no one can divide peace or bargain over it. The minister also said that events proved the president's assertions to be true. Propagators of alternatives to the Madrid formula have not only lowered their voices, but also acted haphazardly in the crisis of their unilateral agreement. The information minister touched on the summit expected to be held between President Hafiz al-Asad and President Bill Clinton in Geneva in 10 days amid a negative propaganda campaign aimed at harming the meeting and belittling its importance. He said: This summit will be held within the framework of the Syrian and U.S. efforts committed to achieving a just and comprehensive peace in the region. He expressed his hope that this important summit will produce good results that lead to the implementation of the resolutions of international legitimacy that Israel has been trying to disavow. The minister also reaffirmed that everything pertaining to our national and pan-Arab issues shows the importance, on both the political and professional levels, of joint ANAU action in the field of news coverage in the Arab, regional, and international arenas. Dr. Salman stressed the importance of conveying facts to the Arab citizens and world public opinion, promoting Arab solidarity, defending our Arab nation's just causes, and explaining to the world our nation's achievements and human values.
