Does Cuba see any indication that the embargo against it may be lifted in the short or medium term? [Lage] We do not see that possibility nor any indication that the United States will lift the blockade against Cuba in the short term. That is an ignorant and criminal policy that cannot be maintained indefinitely while there increasingly are forces that express their rejection of the blockade. [O ESTADO] The names of Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina and Raul Castro are mentioned as the strongest candidates to replace Fidel. You allegedly also are on the list. [Lage] No. Raul Castro is on the list. He is vice president of the Council of State and second secretary of the party, and the one who would replace Fidel. Why think of his successor if the two are alive? [O ESTADO] The Cuban regime seems to be implementing a transition rhythm different from that preferred by the United States and Cuban dissidents. Could you explain how this transition works and where it will lead? [Lage] We are not engagin in a transition to capitalism. We are adapting our socialist economy to conditions abroad. [O ESTADO] How are subjects like a multiparty system being dealt with? [Lage] Our concept is of a single party. In Cuba, a party is not an electoral party that organizes itself to win or to participate in an election and then lacks power to organize or conduct society. From our point of view, a single party is more democratic. There are multiparty elections in many countries but barely 30 or 40 percent of the people participate in the elections so the winners have barely 30 or 40 percent of the votes. [O ESTADO] Is it true that Fidel admires former President Collor? [Lage] The truth is that Collor, while he was president, had a positive attitude toward Cuba and resisted U.S. pressures. We do not forget that.
