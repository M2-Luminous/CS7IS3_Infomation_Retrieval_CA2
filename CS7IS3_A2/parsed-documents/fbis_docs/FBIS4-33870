Ann Drelo says this has nothing to do with management or a bad harvest. It does, however, have to do with the weather: [Begin recording] [Drelo] The drought and brush fires have combined to put the island's number two industry in financial trouble. Agricultural officials point out that several acres of young cane plants have been destroyed. The damage is so severe that hopes of meeting the 54,000-tonne EC quota appear remote at this point. Already the organization responsible for managing the sugar industry -- the Barbados Agricultural Management Company [BAMC] -- is compiling data on the drought and the fires. It is hoping to use this data to show that any shortfalls are the result of an act of God. [Unidentified speaker] I've been told by the management, the top management in BAMC, that they are going ahead with informing the European Union well ahead of next year's crop of the problems we've had with the drought to make absolutely sure that we are not unprepared when it comes to not being able to fill our quota, because this is a really serious issue. If we lose any of our 50,000-tonne quota and we make it even less, we are even less likely to survive in the future. So, it is absolutely important, it is absolutely essential, that we keep our quota with the European Union. [Drelo] Chairman of the BAMC, Dr. Atley Bradford, says he is looking carefully at the situation and a request for a reprieve could go off to the EC in December. He says this would give them enough time to see if the crop has recovered. However, he says even if the rain falls heavily now, next year's crop won't reach the output of this year's. Dr. Bradford says the industry would not make a profit from this year's crop and the loss of the EC quota or a reprieve would spell doom for the industry. [end recording]
