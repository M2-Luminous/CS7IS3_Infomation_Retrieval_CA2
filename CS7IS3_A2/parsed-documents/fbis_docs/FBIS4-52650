In the letters they earnestly asked the national Red Cross organisations that defend human rights and value Red Cross humanitarianism to pay attention to the miserable lot of their families and launch an active international campaign for an early repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan. Kim Hwa-sim said: "I feel my heart rending when I think of my father who spent more than 30 years in prison and is suffering in a land away from home, not allowed to return home in his declining years. "The South Korean Red Cross unreasonably refuses to send back my father. This is a very wrong behavior ignoring international law and Red Cross humanitarianism. "My father's repatriation is not only his wish but also the unanimous demand of the entire fellow countrymen and human conscience." Ham Suk-nyo said: "It is two years since I heard that my brother whom I had thought dead during the Korean war was alive, but my ardent wish to see him in my lifetime has not yet been realised." She called on the national Red Cross organisations to deeply understand the anxious wish of an octogenarian to see her younger brother whom she had raised on her back.
