Existing ``Jeep'' trails in this section will be open to non-motorized use only.

The purpose of this closure is to protect the river bank and riparian vegetation, cultural resources, wildlife habitat, vegetation, soils, and semi-wilderness and scenic qualities along the Klamath River from damage and disruption by motorized vehicles. The authority for this closure is 43 CFR 8341.2 and 43 CFR 8365.2&hyph;4.
