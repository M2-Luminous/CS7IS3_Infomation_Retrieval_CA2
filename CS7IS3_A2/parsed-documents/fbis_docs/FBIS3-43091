Bitadze, Tbilisi State University, Tbilisi, Georgia] [Abstract] The possibility of formation of SAW breezers in the GaAs-AlAs superlattices, caused by non-harmonic oscillations of the crystal lattice and by dispersion is examined. Since the phenomenon of acoustic magnetic resonance occurs in GaAs in the presence of paramagnetic impurity Fe[.sup]2+[/], the possibility of realization of acoustic self-induced transparency (ASIT) and formation of solitons as well as breezers is also examined. Numerical computations demonstrated that with non- harmonic oscillations of the lattice and dispersion, the excitation of the breezers can not occur. By replacing the Ga atoms in the GaAs by atoms of paramagnetic impurity Fe[.sup]2+[/], the conditions of the ASIT effect can be realized if the system is placed in an external permanent magnetic field.
