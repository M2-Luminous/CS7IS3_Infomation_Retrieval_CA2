The rhetoric that "the whole country is a game of chess," which was stressed in the past, can no longer be heard. The dissenting tendency of the local-lord economy, as well as the structural imbalance caused by the unbalanced developments in various localities, are potential troubles in future economy. Suggestions From "Varying Opinions" Seven, eight, nine, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15... Is this a game of figures or what? These are not ordinary figures; they are supposed to be the economic growth rates on the mainland in 1994. Why are there so many figures? They represent the different opinions on economic growth held by various quarters of Communist China: The Political Bureau says it should be 10 percent; a majority of members [as published] say it cannot be lower than 10 percent; the State Council's preliminary plan is that it should be 8-9 percent; the State Planning Commission's report says it should be 13 percent, and if the problem of power can be solved, the growth rate can be fixed at 14-15 percent; the State Council's Economic and Trade Commission suggests a 9 percent growth; the State Commission for Economic Restructuring suggests an 8 percent growth; the report by the economics development under the National People's Congress Standing Committee holds that it should be 7-8 percent.... The above-mentioned are the estimates by the relevant central departments, whereas provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have their own policies, and they struggle hard for the best growth rates according to their own "national situation." Among 30 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, one province and one municipality suggest that their own growth rates should be higher than 15 percent, while 17 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions such as Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Shanghai suggest that their own growth rates should be higher than 12 percent, whereas other 10 provinces and autonomous regions suggest that their own growth rates should be higher than 10 percent. Through these suggestions from "varying opinions," we can see that up to now, the CPC authorities still have no decision on the economic growth rate for 1994. "Macroeconomic Regulation and Control" Ends The National Economic Work Conference, which was held from 1 to 4 December and presided over by Jiang Zemin and Li Peng, made an assessment of the financial and economic conditions for the economic development in the new year. For the first time the conference made public the internal structure of the economic development on the mainland, as well as changes, and those are things which the outside world had been guessing and assessing. However, the figures are incomplete and sometimes contradictory. What is noteworthy is that Jiang Zemin disclosed at the conference that the pace of reform in 1994 will be very big. He said that it will be a year in which an unprecedented number of reform measures will be announced compared with the past 10 years or so, and he used the slogan of "sustained, healthy, rapid, and good" economic development. This means that Zhu Rongji's measures to carry out "macroeconomic regulation and control" have come to a halt, and what follows would be a new round of "great leap forward." Since July 1993 when Zhu Rongji decisively implemented a series of reform measures, the over-heated economy on the mainland has cooled down, and the very chaotic financial market has returned to normal. Under this condition, the CPC authorities cannot wait to accelerate the economic train, and the "theory of opportunity" holds sway. In fact, under the current system, after more than 10 years of reform, the mainland's economy has not been able to jump out of the strange cycle whereby "when it is let go, it becomes chaotic; when it becomes chaotic, it is tightened up; when it is tightened up, it dies." Zhu Rongji's macroeconomic regulation and control policy lasted for only a few months, and this has surprised economists, whose observations hold that there has to be one or two years of "recuperation" before the economy on the mainland can embark upon the road of healthy development. Many Provinces and Municipalities Are Experiencing Seriously Unbalanced Economic Developments However, the current macroeconomic regulation and control has caused great losses to those who have vested interests. Utilizing their privileges, they engaged in real estate and stock market speculation with all their money, and they reaped huge profits. When the regulation and control was suddenly implemented, they lost their means to make money, and some even faced the danger of bankruptcy. Some commentators pointed out that Zhu Rongji could not get to the bureaucrat-businessmen, who know many tricks, but it is surprising to see the regulation and control becoming ineffective in just a few months. But we want to return to our topic. Are there any conditions for the mainland's economy to grow rapidly? As the saying goes, "a skyscraper has to start on the ground floor." The development structure on the mainland has already had a problem of serious imbalance, and at the economic work conference the commissions and offices under the State Council, the Auditing Administration, and the General Administration of Customs released some information and figures which showed an alarming situation. The information revealed that in 12 provinces and autonomous regions the structure and proportion of economic development showed a serious unbalance, and that in 16 provinces and autonomous regions the total economic returns on production did not reach the state's target. The External Flow of Funds Reached 150 Billion Yuan in 10 Months Other worrisome figures include: --In 1992 the debt chain among enterprises was 110 billion yuan. In the first quarter of 1993 it was 42 billion yuan, in the second quarter of 1993 it was 35 billion yuan, and in the third quarter of 1993 it was 60 billion yuan. --In 1992 the external flow of funds was 30 billion yuan. In 1993, up to October, it exceeded 150 billion yuan; at the end of October, the state's foreign exchange reserve was $33 billion, and disposable foreign exchange was $20 billion. --The state received less revenue, and in 1992 the decrease was 33 percent. In 1993, from the first to third quarter, the decrease was 38.5 percent. --Regarding the goods and materials which were smuggled in or imported unlawfully in 1992, it amounted to $20 billion based on a preliminary estimate. In 1993, from the first to third quarter, it amounted to $30 billion, and about 55 percent of the imported cars were smuggled in. This year, the unfavorable balance between import and export will exceed $12 billion. Finished Products in Stock Amounted to 148 Billion Yuan In addition, the conference also revealed for the first time in concrete terms the alarming losses of enterprises on the mainland: --At the end of October 1993, the machines and equipment and whole sets of industrial facilities which ceased working across the country were valued at 250 billion yuan. Abandoned and idle factory floors totalled 6.5 million square meters, some 16 million idle and unnecessary workers loitered in factories, and over 26 million workers could be laid off for streamlining purpose. --The finished and semifinished products in warehouses across the country were valued at more than 180 billion yuan, while light industrial and finished or semifinished handicraft products were valued at 68 billion yuan. --The normal utilization rate of imported machines and facilities was 62 percent, and economic returns was only about 70 percent. --Some 12 percent of the imported machines and facilities were either not applicable or laid idle in the warehouses. --Some 8.5 percent of the imported machines and facilities have to be written off in three years. --Some 4.5 percent of the imported machines and facilities were old, outdated, and could not be used. Starting from 1985, the state lost 8-12 billion yuan every year. --In 1991, the industrial, light industrial, and electronic products which were written off in the whole country amounted to 120 billion yuan. In 1992, the figure rose to 140 billion yuan. --In 1991, the nationwide rate of good quality of heavy industrial products was 14 percent, and the passing rate was 55 percent. The nationwide rate of good quality of light industrial products was 19 percent, and the passing rate was 62 percent, and the nationwide rate of good quality of electronic products was 25 percent, and the passing rate was 60 percent. --In 1992, the nationwide rate of good quality of heavy industrial products was 16 percent, and the passing rate was 57 percent. The nationwide rate of good quality of light industrial products was 16 percent, and the passing rate was 57 percent, and the nationwide rate of good quality of electronic products was 28 percent, and the passing rate was 58 percent. --A total of 25 million tonnes of coal was lost during transport every year, and the writing off of coal pits due to spontaneous combustion meant losses of 50 million tonnes. --A total of 3.5 million tonnes of oil was lost every year during transport, and more than 1 million tonnes were lost due to spontaneous combustion. The 16-Character "Sincere Remark" Raises a Great Deal of Opinions The economic work conference this time also exhibited another unusual phenomenon, that is, in the beginning of the conference, the persons in charge of various localities remained silent. Obviously, it was some sort of silent protest against the central leadership by the "local economic lords." After detecting this kind of subtle emotion, Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, and Zou Jiahua came out personally to soothe them, stressing that they should "talk freely about whatever is on their minds, offer whatever opinions they have, make whatever suggestions they like, and air whatever grievances they harbor." This 16-character "sincere remark" really worked wonders, and it suddenly aroused the enthusiasm of the representatives to talk, hence complaints, discontents, opinions, suggestions, and examinations were poured into the conference. The CPC Central Committee General Office and the State Council General Office made a "general summation," which summarized the contents into 20 points in the newsletters they later issued, and the title was "Some of the Opinions and Suggestions Made by Representatives at the Central Leadership Work Conference." These 20 points are: Local Authorities Make 20 Points Accusing the Central Leadership of a Series of Mistakes 1. When central leading comrades inspect localities, they give instructions and suggestions, without giving concrete teachings. 2. In actual work, localities find it difficult to thoroughly understand and grasp the policies and regulations announced by the central leadership. 3. The instructions by the central leadership, central leaders, central inspection teams, central on-the-spot teams, and central work teams are not clear, often leading to conflicts. 4. Regarding economic work, the direction in which reform is to be carried out and the scope of the opening up, the central leadership still does not have a set of principles and policies which are scientific, relatively complete, comparatively systematic, and in accordance with the nation's situation. 5. Some central leaders have failed to promptly solve problems arising from economic development, reform, and opening up. They are not mentally prepared for the problems which are likely to arise. "The Central Leadership Has a Bigger Responsibility" 6. Central leaders are seemingly complacent with the achievements and progress in economic construction, reform, and opening up. They have not made summations promptly and some problems have emerged as a result -- the over-heated phenomenon of the economy became very obvious as early as November 1992. 7. Some comrades in the central leadership and some central departments put undue emphasis on vigorously creating conditions for importing foreign funds, without paying attention to whether those funds have arrived on time or not, or to the facilities set up by those funds, or to the technology used by foreign-funded firms, or to the distribution of foreign-funded firms (only 18.2 percent of foreign funds agreed upon by contracts and agreements have arrived on time). 8. For a long time the central leadership has no overall planning for the development of communications, transportation, railways, roads, ports, power, energy, and water resources, as well as for coordinated economic development. There are problems being discovered every year, but the main problems are not put on the agenda for solution. Loss of Control Over Investment in Capital Construction Is Approved by the Central Leadership 11. The problem of IOU's in the rural areas has not been solved since 1989, and the rural problem has become more acute, the main reason being that the polices announced by the central leadership have not be actually implemented. 12. Local protectionism is very serious in the regions which have rapid economic development and good economic foundations and conditions. The central leadership has not corrected it promptly, and this is not helpful to regional cooperation. 13. The scale of capital construction is large, and the amount of investment is large, leading to loss of control. Many loans are approved by the central leadership, or reported by local authorities to the central leadership, which then gives approval. 14. The rise of living indexes in most areas stays above 15 percent, causing conflicts between the people and government. Solving the inflation problem relies on the timely macroregulation and control by the central leadership. 15. Localities think that macroregulation and control by the central leadership is necessary but a bit late, and that the scope of macroregulation and control is not clear, causing ambiguities in local economic reforms. 16. The power and scope of legislation delegated by the central leadership to localities, are not clear. The central leadership must maintain long continuity of policies and systems, so as to benefit industrial development in localities. Many Units and Enterprises Are in a State of Anarchy 17. The two leading groups -- party and government -- in a locality often cannot coordinate well in leading the work in economic construction, reform, and opening up. The central leadership should give clear policy guidance. 18. There is a serious shortage of funds for scientific and technological development, and the number of scientists and technician who quit or change jobs every year exceeds the number of new recruits in the science and technology contingent; although the central leadership understands the seriousness of the situation, it does not have concrete measures to solve the problem. 19. Localities, enterprises, and nonproductive units continue to issue shares and bonds, the central leadership should formulate a legal system and a set of regulations to exercise control. 20. Quite a large number of the cadres in local party and government units, and the cadres in state-owned enterprises, face streamlining and cutbacks in personnel, however, no proper arrangements have been made based on a standardized policy. As a result, serious anarchy and passive emotion emerged in units and enterprises. Judging from the "summation" of the above-mentioned speeches by the representatives, acute contradictions exist between the local and central authorities. The rhetoric that "the whole country is a game of chess," which was stressed in the past, can no longer be heard, and the dissenting tendency of the local-lord economy, as well as the structural imbalance caused by the unbalanced developments in various localities, have already laid down potential trouble in economic development in the future.
