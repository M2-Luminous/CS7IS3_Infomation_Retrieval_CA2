In a group discussion with PLA deputies about the government work report, Liu, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, said that PLA must also redouble their efforts to modernize China's national defense. He said that PLA must help fulfill the overall task of seizing development opportunities, deepening reforms, opening China wider to the outwide world, promoting economic development and maintaining stability as outlined by premier Li Peng in his government work report. The leader called on officers and men to make their due contributions to reform, opening up, economic growth and national defense. He said, "ours is a socialist country. Our endeavor to modernize national defense serves solely to defend ourselves, defend our motherland's territory, territorial waters and territorial air space from being infringed, and maintain China's unification and stability." The amount of China's annual military expenditure is very small in the world, said Liu, who is also a standing committee member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee. "The Chinese people are a peace-loving people. They have suffered enormously from invasions by foreign powers over the past century," he said. The Chinese people, who have stood up, will never allow any aggressor to stamp underfoot China's sovereignty and interests, he said, adding that they will neither seek hegemony nor want to occupy an inch of land of another country, he stressed. "China will not pursue an arms race, nor participate in any military block or seek spheres of influence. This stand of ours has been consistent," he said. For a long time to come, China will concentrate on developing its productive forces and improving people's living standards, he said. "That conforms to the interests of China and those of Asia and the world at large," he said. Liu said that last year the Army made new progress in military training, national defense research and logistic service. Speaking of main tasks for the Army at present and in a period to come, the general said the Army should strengthen its ideological and political construction, develop modern arms and equipment, train commanders and professionals with skills needed in modern warfare and obtain the best combination of men and weapons through scientific arrangements and strict training in a bid to raise comprehensively the combat capacity of the Army. The Army should carry on the fine tradition of hard struggle and building the Army thriftily and work hard to improve military and economic efficiency and march forward by overcoming difficulties ahead, he said. He also urged the Army to firmly carry forward the fine tradition of maintaining unity between the Army and the government and between the Army and the people and make positive contributions to promoting economic development and social stability. The People's Liberation Army should always be modest and prudent and respect local party committees and governments, Liu said, adding that officers and men of the Army should always keep in mind the principle of serving the people wholeheartedly and implement the party's policies and state laws and decrees in an exemplary way. The Army should support and participate in local economic development and help local people solve difficulties, do good turns to them and bravely fight against social evils.
