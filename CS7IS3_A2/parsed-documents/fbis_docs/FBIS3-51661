The "contras" are betting on the lack of a quorum to prevent voting on the articles that are to be revised. A total of 293 congressmen will have to be present in order to approve an amendment. Deputy Jose Fortunati (RS) [Rio Grande do Sul State], PT leader in the Chamber of Deputies, said that "we are going to request that the quorum be verified whether we favor or reject a motion, because we are against a revision of the Constitution." The PDT admits that it will vote in favor of a motion if the revisionists are able to get the 293 deputies and senators to make up a plenum. The two parties indicate that this week, at least, there will not be a quorum. If there is a quorum they are going to ask for a postponement, on the basis of the argument that the quorum is illegitimate with the participation of the congressmen who are involved in the budget mafia.
