After years of hard work, the province now has a booming economic construction drive in progress and a pattern of opening to the outside world in all sectors has been formed. By the end of last March, there were 870 foreign investment enterprises in Gansu, with a total investment of $1.11 billion. Last year alone, more than 500 enterprises opened in the province. Moreover, 87 offices from various foreign economic organizations have been established in Lanzhou, capital of the province, acting in close co-operation with developments throughout the province. Gansu is a landlocked area. Renowned both at home and abroad, the Silk Road passes for 1,655 kilometres through the whole length of the province. This accounts for one-fifth of the ancient trading route's total length. Traditionally therefore, Gansu has always been an important region to China for its cultural and trade exchanges with other countries. Over 2,000 mining sites have been discovered. Among these, there are 115 useful minerals. The proven reserves of nickel rank the mine second in the world, while reserves of 23 other minerals take fifth place in China, and those of 10 more deposits take first place in China. Nonferrous and rare metals such as nickel, copper, zinc, antimony, cobalt, platinum, rhodium, and iridium have realistic and potential advantages for extraction. Gansu is one of China's five major pastoral areas. Meat, hide, wool, and milk are the main products. There are over 4,000 kinds of wild plants, of which 950 are sources of Chinese medicinal herbs. Particularly important is the production of Chinese angelica, dangshen, licorice root, red and yellow vetch, Chinese rhubarb, safflowers, the bulb of fritillary, elevated gastrodia, and glossy ganoderma. It is especially famous for Minggui (angelica root) and wendan (root of baily asiabell) both in Ghina and abroad. Besides grain production, the province produces huge quantities of honeydew melons, black melon seeds, dongguo pears, rose oil, black moss, garlic, dates, apples, day lily, and lily flower. Many of China's important industry bases have been set up in the province. Of particular note are the Jiuquan Satellite Town, Baiyin Copper Town, Jinchan Nickel Town, and Jiayuguan Iron and Steel Town. Gansu has a complete network of railways, highways, and airlines, taking Lanzhou as the geographical centre. It also has an important section of the continental bridge, the international railway between Europe and Asia, from Lianyungang in Jiangsu province to Amsterdam in Holland. Gansu has over 20 airlines connecting it with cities at home and abroad. Telecommunications and telephone calls to every city in China and 152 countries and regions are available. In the educational field, there are over 130 research institutes and 18 universities and colleges with 310,000 technical personnel of various specialities. All of these have formed a synthetical study base in science and technology and such an impressive capacity in science and technology ranks Gansu ninth in the country. Approved by the state government, Gansu enjoys preferential policies on a par with the opening eastern coastal cities. The province introduced preferential measures to encourage foreign investment in August 1992. According to the measures, all overseas investors and investors from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan can enjoy the following preferential policies: -- Enterprises run outside downtown areas can operate free of charge in land usage during their construction and five years after they become operative. -- Enterprises involved in cultural, educational, scientific research, medicine, social welfare, traffic, mining, farming and forestry, animal husbandry, municipal infrastructure, and others operative in remote areas will have no land use charges levied upon them during their operation. -- Investors who develop land can do so free of charge from land usage tax during their period of development. -- Enterprises can enjoy priority of supplies of water, electricity, gas, coal, oil, loan provision, raw materials, communication priority, traffic dispatch, and personnel hire. -- Investors can enjoy a whole range of preferential treatment in creating foreign exchange, depreciation of fixed assets, balance of foreign exchange, visa issuance, and living conditions.
