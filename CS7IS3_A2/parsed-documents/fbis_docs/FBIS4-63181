Yegorova, captioned as member of the civil commission of the Moscow city court] [Yegorova] The court decided that the strike, announced and carried out by the pilots' union of the Russian Federation, is illegal. In accordance with the 20 May 1991 law on procedures for resolving collective labor disputes, in particular Article 12, which states that public transportation, which includes civil aviation, cannot settle its problems, disputes, or conflicts through strikes. [Announcer] Union representatives, who in general agreed with the court's decision, nevertheless think that the law providing for such situations contains contradictions. According to the new Constitution of the Russian federation, they do have a right to strike in order to settle their labor disputes. Right now pilots are discussing their demands at the Labor Ministry. Their main demand is an increase in pensions. According to the pilots' union, veteran pilots receive from the pension fund only one-fifth of the sum paid to the fund by the civil aviation department.
