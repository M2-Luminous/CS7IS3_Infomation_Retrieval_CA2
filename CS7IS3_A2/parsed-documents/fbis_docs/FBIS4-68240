Malynovskyy, the presidential representative in Zhytomyr Oblast. Your assumption of the leadership of the defense ministry, states the letter, has ushered in important changes in the approach to building the Armed Forces of Ukraine. We are impressed by your energetic and consistent search for promising directions in the development of the Armed Forces, and, in particular, in reforming military education. The latter is of particular concern to Zhytomyr residents, who are grateful to you for your attention to one of the oldest military schools, which has been located in Zhytomyr since 1946. On 8 December 1994, the school will celebrate its 75th anniversary. Since its establishment, it has trained more than 30,000 officers for the Air Defense Forces [PPO]. At present, the school, which is the only one of its kind, is training highly qualified specialists for the antimissile and space defense forces. We therefore feel that the decision to close the school is hasty and without sufficient grounds. Being aware that you have given our problems your careful attention, we wish to express our deepest gratitude to you personally and to the entire leadership of the Ministry of Defense and express the hope that you will ultimately reach a positive decision regarding the fate of our school. We believe that one way to decide this matter is to use the school as a base on which to create the military division of the Zhytomyr Missile and Space Engineering and Technological Institute [institut raketno-kosmichnoho profilyu] and a National Space Center. Proposals to this effect have been submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers. Taking into account your support of these proposals, we ask permission to begin enrolling first-year students as soon as possible, thereby preventing the irreversible loss of the school's professors, instructors, and auxiliary teaching personnel--ends the letter from the presidential representative in Zhytomyr Oblast.
