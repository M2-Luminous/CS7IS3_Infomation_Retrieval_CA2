Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, says Indonesia's Government is having to deal with the consequences of greater openness. Senator Evans said Australia must take a long-term view and build a relationship with Indonesia which will survive the current generation of leaders. Senator Evans said the prime minister, Paul Keating, would make a judgment when he visited Jakarta next week on the most productive way to convey the strong Australian and international perception about the ban. [Begin Evans recording] I think we are seeing here simply a society in transition, which is more focussed on its internal difficulties and transition processes, the move to openness -- the consequences of that is negative as perceived by the government as well as positive -- rather than a society that is, at the moment in this respect, paying very much attention to anybody externally. [sentence as heard] It's to be hoped of course that, particularly with an internal reaction which was generated, and the extent to which political openness has already become a mainstream part of Indonesian society rather than [words indistinct] go on and it would be more of a matter, I think, that internal reaction would produce on the ground than any other overt external pressure. [sentence as heard] [end recording]
