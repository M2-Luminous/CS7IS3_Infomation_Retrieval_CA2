Nursultan Nazarbayev Defended Russia During His Recent Visit to America"] [Text] Almaty -- At a news conference held in Almaty, Nursultan Nazarbayev returned several times to the subject of his personal attitude toward Kazakhstani-Russian ties. In his opinion, relations between the two states are developing normally at present, and no actions aimed at infringing Russian interests were undertaken during his visit to the United States. The president of Kazakhstan confirmed that during his U.S. visit, many people asked about the situation in Russia. He tried to convince his partners in the talks that they should gamble not on the specific persons carrying out the economic reforms in Russia but on the actual process of democratic and economic transformations. He raised objections with those interlocutors in America who called the Chernomyrdin government conservative; according to Nazarbayev, he was able to demonstrate why he disagreed by using as a basis his own personal experience of relations with the Russian head of government. The president illumined in detail the problem connected with the upcoming removal of the nuclear warheads of strategic missiles from Kazakhstani territory. Kazakhstan is claiming 10 percent of the estimated value of all the uranium of the missiles which are on the territory of four CIS states and which are subject to reduction. On the whole, Nursultan Nazarbayev advocated lending viability to the CIS states' economic union as quickly as possible. He said that Russia remains Kazakhstan's priority partner. At the same it must be taken into account that "it takes two to tango," the president emphasized figuratively. Therefore the desire for cooperation must be mutual.
