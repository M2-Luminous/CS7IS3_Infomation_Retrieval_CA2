FR940719-1-00066 FR940719-1-00015 Paragraph (b)(3) would also require the examination to include a test of the roof, face and rib conditions on these sections or in these areas. This is to clarify the Agency's position that failures of the roof, face and rib pose a hazard to miners. It has been suggested to the Agency that specifically requiring this examination is proactive rather than reactive and is therefore the preferred approach. The Agency has reconsidered its approach and agrees. Existing paragraph (b)(4) requires that a preshift examination of the approaches to worked-out areas along intake air courses be conducted if intake air passes by the worked-out area to ventilate working sections where anyone is scheduled to work during the oncoming shift. The proposal would revise paragraph (b)(4) by also requiring that the entries used to carry air into these worked-out areas be preshift examined. Under the provisions of existing §75.332(a)(1), air that ventilates a working section or an area where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed must be a separate split of intake air. Air that ventilates a worked-out area is return air and cannot be used. The preshift examination required by proposed paragraph (b)(4) is intended to assure that miners are not exposed to the hazards associated with ventilating working sections with return air and that air that enters a worked-out area in one entry does not reenter the intake air course. Additionally, the proposal would clarify the Agency's intent that the examination of the approaches to these worked-out areas be made immediately inby and outby each entry used to carry air into the worked-out area. Paragraph (b)(6) of the proposal addresses concerns raised during the informational meetings and later discussions on the rule that requiring examination or rehabilitation of rooms and entries described in paragraphs (i) and (ii) could constitute a hazard. The existing standard requires a preshift examination of entries and rooms driven more than 20 feet off an intake air course without a crosscut or more than 2 crosscuts off an intake air course without permanent ventilation controls where intake air passes through or by these entries or rooms to a working section where anyone is scheduled to work during the oncoming shift. It was pointed out that often these rooms and entries have existed without incident for many years, which has allowed methane to bleed off. The Agency also heard assertions that as written the existing regulation may cause a diminution of safety to miners. It was stated that certain areas have been timbered heavily and cribbed because of adverse roof conditions and that rehabilitating such areas would unnecessarily expose workers removing or repositioning cribs to hazards. It was also stated that these areas are subject to roof falls and may remain prone to roof falls and hazardous conditions even after rehabilitation. Finally, it was stated that any advantages that come from physical inspection of these entries or rooms are outweighed by the danger to which the examiner may be exposed. In light of these concerns, the Agency has proposed that rooms and entries developed prior to November 15, 1992, need not be preshift examined and requests additional comment as to the impact on safety. Proposed paragraph (b)(6) requires that entries and rooms developed after November 15, 1992, either be preshift examined or ventilated using permanent ventilation controls. In response to comments, the Agency is proposing in paragraph (b)(8) that the preshift examiner check high spots along intake air courses where methane is likely to accumulate if equipment may be operated in the air course during the shift. It has long been recognized by the industry that methane can accumulate in high areas with no indication in the normal mine entry. As equipment passes under these areas, the methane is pulled down and mixed with the air in the entry and may be ignited by the equipment. Through proper ventilation and examination, this hazard can be eliminated. During informational meetings, commenters expressed concern about the potential fire and ignition hazards associated with electrical installations and compressors. Paragraph (b)(9) of the proposed rule would require that electrical installations referred to in §75.340(a), except for water pumps, and the areas where compressors subject to §75.344 are located, be preshift examined if the installation or compressor is or will be energized during the shift. Pumps would be exempted because of the limited hazard presented by pumps and because certified pumpers would conduct examinations for themselves in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) as they entered the area where the pump is located. The purpose of examining electrical installations and compressors would be to assure that methane in unacceptable concentrations is not present in these areas and that there are no signs of fire. The Agency solicits comments on this proposed requirement. In addition, the proposed rule would modify existing §75.360 to more clearly address those situations where miners are scheduled to work or travel after the preshift examination has begun. The proposal would amend paragraph (a), add a new paragraph (b)(10), and make a conforming editorial change to existing §75.360(b)(1). The existing §75.360(b)(1) requires that a preshift examination include areas where miners are scheduled to work or travel during the oncoming shift. The proposal reflects the fact that on occasion miners may be given their work assignments, and thus be scheduled to work or travel in an area, after the preshift examination has begun. This may occur, for example, due to changing conditions in the mine. In these cases the supplemental examination, rather than the preshift examination, would be required. In accordance with provisions of §75.361, a certified person must perform an examination of any area where a preshift examination was not made before any person enters the area. To permit these areas to be examined other than on the preshift examination maintains the existing level of safety because a complete examination by a certified person would be required. The examination would be conducted closer to the time that persons will actually enter the area, and any area where a hazardous condition exists will be posted.
