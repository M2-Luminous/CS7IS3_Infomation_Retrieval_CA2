This is a result of a meeting between the U.S. President and leading foreign policy advisers. Two new events which had not been envisaged in the U.S. scenario prompted this review, which by all accounts is not coming easy to the White House. They are, first, the inability of the reformist section of the former Russian Government to win sufficiently broad public support, which became a springboard for Zhirinovskiy's success, and second, the Crimean presidential election. In endeavoring to avoid both the triumph of Russian imperialism and the Yugoslavization of the post-Soviet area, the White House is markedly deviating from principles which only recently it was firmly espousing. First, the United States, which has previously put pressure on Western borrowers and investors, the World Bank, and the IMF to make allowances when allocating new loans to Russia, does not intend to do this any more. Second, the period during which one of the main purposes of U.S. aid was to strengthen President Yeltsin's political influence can be considered to be over. "The impressive performance of nationalists, communists, and other antireform forces in the December elections has cooled Washington's ardor to play Russian politics," THE WASHINGTON POST writes. Third, the State Department has confirmed that Clinton and his advisers have reached "firm agreement" about the need to support Ukraine's intentions to revive its withered economy and "put an end to disputes with Russia regarding Ukraine's possession of nuclear weapons." Fourth, President Leonid Kravchuk, who for a long time was something akin to persona non grata here, will at last be able to visit Washington in March. He will be given financial aid in order to weaken Russia's attractiveness in the eyes of the 12 million ethnic Russians living in Ukraine. It is also proposed that the aid will be made conditional on the Ukrainians' agreement to radical economic reforms. Fifth, the U.S. Administration's reluctance to "pursue new lines in Europe" is no longer as absolute as it appeared very recently, during discussion of the "Partnership for Peace" program. Although Washington does not believe that the Russian Government will want, or be in a position, to recreate an empire on the ruins of the USSR, people here will also do all they can to oppose Russia's domination in this region. Ukraine is more than just some other republic capable of serving as a counterweight to the trends making themselves increasingly manifest in Moscow, and the United States will try to play the Ukrainian card adroitly.
