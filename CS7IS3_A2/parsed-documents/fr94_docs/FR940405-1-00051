FR940405-1-00051 FR940405-1-00013 (b) Epidemiological and Experimental Studies . There are at least 32 epidemiological studies that have attempted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of ETS. OSHA analyzed these studies and determined that 14 were positive for an association [Exs. 4&hyph;36, 4&hyph;65, 4&hyph;106, 4&hyph;119, 4&hyph;121, 4&hyph;142, 4&hyph;143, 4&hyph;153, 4&hyph;158, 4&hyph;187, 4&hyph;252, 4&hyph;275, 4&hyph;276, 4&hyph;292, 4&hyph;300], 5 were equivocal with a positive trend [Exs. 4&hyph;4, 4&hyph;47, 4&hyph;117, 4&hyph;122, 4&hyph;171], and 13 were equivocal [Exs. 4&hyph;35, 4&hyph;38, 4&hyph;52, 4&hyph;118, 4&hyph;148, 4&hyph;164, 4&hyph;175, 4&hyph;183, 4&hyph;192, 4&hyph;283, 4&hyph;286, 4&hyph;296, 4&hyph;326]. [See the Risk Assessment section for further discussion.] OSHA considered the consistency of the association to determine if the finding of the same exposure effect occurred in different populations and different types of studies. The great number of epidemiological studies available on ETS were conducted by different researchers, on different populations, in various countries with diverse study designs. This extensive amount of data increases confidence that the associations seen between ETS exposure and the development of lung cancer is externally consistent and is not due to artifacts or a product of some unidentified, indirect factors unlikely to be common to all of the studies. The fact that exposure to ETS is common dilutes the risk estimates derived from these studies because the comparison group has some exposure to ETS. A recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report [Ex. 4&hyph;50] found that 100% of a subset of the National Health and Nutrition Evaluation Survey (NHANES) III conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics had detectable levels of cotinine in their bodies indicating that everyone in the sample had detectable exposure to tobacco smoke [Ex. 4&hyph;50]. Cotinine is a metabolite of nicotine and is used as a surrogate of exposure to tobacco smoke. This indicates that the cancer risk may indeed be greater since the relationship in these studies has been more exposed versus less exposed instead of exposed versus nonexposed. Many potential sources of bias, such as publication bias (the tendency of scientific journals to publish studies with positive results), misclassification bias (smokers or former smokers claiming to be nonsmokers), and recall bias (the reliance on self-reporting of both personal smoking habits and exposure to others' tobacco smoke) can not account for the elevation in risks seen in these various studies. Also, the relative risks that were estimated from prospective study data are similar to those estimated from case/control study data. Biases that may be problematic to case-control studies are not a problem in prospective studies. Since the results from both types of studies are similar it is apparent that these biases are not important in the case-control studies (e.g., misclassification bias and recall bias). This information strengthens the confidence of a causal connection. Animal studies have shown the carcinogenicity of cigarette smoke. Limited existing data suggest that sidestream smoke may contain more carcinogenic activity per milligram of cigarette smoke concentrate than does mainstream smoke [Ex. 3&hyph;689D]. Currently, OSHA is aware of only a few experimental inhalation studies with sidestream smoke or ETS reported in the literature. A discussion of these studies follows. Otto and Elmenhorst [Ex. 4&hyph;247] have shown that there are carcinogenic constituents in the vapor phase of tobacco smoke. They exposed C57B1 and BLH mice to the gas phase of cigarette mainstream smoke of 12 cigarettes for 90 minutes daily over 27 months. The particulate matter was removed by passing the smoke through a Cambridge filter. The percentages of mice with lung adenomas were 5.5% and 32% in the smoke-exposed C57B1 and BLH mice, as compared to 3.4% and 22% for their respective controls. Leuchtenberger and Leuchtenberger [Ex. 4&hyph;197] have also shown that the rate of tumors among mice exposed to the gas phase was greater than animals exposed to the whole smoke. Pulmonary adenomas and adenocarcinomas were induced in Snell's mice by the gas phase but not by the whole smoke in this study. These studies demonstrate that the carcinogenicity of tobacco smoke is not limited to the particulate phase. Studies have also reported hyperplasia and metaplasia in the trachea and bronchi of mice exposed to cigarette smoke by the inhalation route [Exs. 4&hyph;226, 4&hyph;327]. Four lung tumors and emphysema were detected in 100 male and female C57B1 mice exposed, nose only, to fresh mainstream smoke [Ex. 4&hyph;135]. Pulmonary squamous neoplasms were detected in female Wistar rats exposed to a 1:5 smoke-to-air mixture for 15 seconds of every minute during an 11 minute exposure twice a day, 5 days per week, for the lifespan of the animals [Ex. 4&hyph;79]. Respiratory tumors were also observed in Fischer&hyph;344 rats exposed, nose only, to a 1:10 smoke to air mixture for approximately 30 seconds every minute, 7 hours per day, 5 days per week for 128 weeks [Ex. 4&hyph;77]. The incidence of laryngeal leukoplakias in Syrian golden hamsters ranged from 11.3% for the animals that received the low dose to 30.6% of those animals that received the highest dose. These animals were exposed to a 1:7 smoke-to-air mixture for 10 to 30 minutes, 5 days a week, nose only, for a period of up to 52 weeks [Ex. 4&hyph;88]. Exposing hamsters twice a day, 5 days a week for up to 100 weeks resulted in almost 90% of the exposed hamsters having hyperplastic or neoplastic changes in the larynx in a study by Bernfeld et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;30]. Lung tumors have been reported in beagle dogs exposed to the smoke from nonfilter cigarettes [Ex. 4&hyph;19]. However, no tumors were seen in rabbits exposed to cigarette smoke for up to 51/2 years [Ex. 4&hyph;149]. Sidestream condensates have also been shown to cause carcinogenicity when implanted into female Osborne-Mendel rat lungs [Ex. 4&hyph;127]. Cigarette smoke condensate fraction from sidestream smoke was implanted at a dose level of one cigarette per animal in this study. Coggins et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;59] reported epithelial hyperplasia in the nasal cavity of high-dosed rats exposed to environmental tobacco smoke. They exposed Sprague-Dawley rats of both sexes, nose only, to ``aged and diluted sidestream smoke'' (ADSS) at 0.1, 1 or 10 mg of particulates per meter for 14 days and found ``slight to mild'' epithelial hyperplasia and inflammation in the most rostral part of the nasal cavity in the 10 mg group only. They also found that these changes were reversible if the animals were kept without further exposure for an additional 14 days. No effects in the lung were reported. Similar results of mild hyperplasia were also obtained when male rats were exposed to the same concentrations for up to 13 weeks [Ex. 4&hyph;60]. In this study the authors reported hypercellularity and the thickening of the respiratory epithelium of the dorsal nasal conchae and adjacent wall of the middle meatus.
