Arrest of Two Russian Generals: Analysis and Consequences"] [Text] Riga -- "The likelihood of an armed conflict was very real indeed," Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs stated in an interview with Latvian television regarding the seizure in Riga 10 January of two Russian generals and several military installations. The order to arrest Major Generals Anatoliy Vodopyanov and Nikolay Taylakov, who had arrived to investigate illegal activities involving the seizure of Russian military installations, was issued by Andrejs Rucs, leader of Riga's Vidzeme suburb. That evening Latvian television viewers were able to watch the moment of the arrest on television: Guards led away the handcuffed Russian servicemen to a minibus. Then, escorted by the municipal police, the "prisoners" were taken to the Latvian-Russian border. They were held somewhere in a forest where they were threatened and insulted. The area where this incident took place was cordoned off by armed personnel who would not even let through a car bearing the diplomatic license plate of Russian Ambassador Aleksandr Rannikh, who was threatened with an assault rifle. A protest note about this incident was later sent to the Latvian Foreign Ministry. "The damage done to Latvia today, on the eve of the NATO conference in Brussels and the Yeltsin-Clinton meeting and at the start of another round of talks with the Russian delegation, cannot be overestimated," Foreign Ministry head G. Andrejevs acknowledged. A delegation headed by Special Envoy Sergey Zotov flew to Riga from Moscow 10 January in order to clarify the position regarding the treaty on the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia. It seemed that a rapprochement of positions was possible which would finally have allowed both parties to sign documents that are important for both countries. At the airport Colonel General Leonid Mayorov, commander of the Northwestern Group of Forces, informed the Russian delegation about what had happened. After shaking hands with Martins Virsis, head of the Latvian delegation at the talks, Sergey Zotov informed him that the negotiations would be postponed until the situation had been fully investigated, the servicemen released, and explanations received from the Latvian leadership. Colonel General Mayorov, commander of the Northwestern Group of Forces, said that what had happened "is not an incident, it is an unprecedented provocation." He announced that some Russian subunits had been moved up to Riga. Defense Minister Grachev had been notified of what has happened, and he in turn had informed President Yeltsin of the events in Riga. According to Mayorov, airborne troops, transport and combat-zone aviation, and naval units stationed on Russian territory had been placed on combat alert. Mayorov announced that Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis, with whom the commander has been in contact in order to settle the situation, had assumed a constructive position. Consequently both generals had been released. President Ulmanis received news of the arrest of the servicemen during the latest session of the National Security Council -- this was announced in a statement circulated by the president's press service. The session was interrupted, and all security services were issued with a directive to find and release the detainees. The statement says that A. Rucs had ordered the guards to resist all attempts to free the generals, even if the attempts were made by Latvian security services. The statement terms Rucs' actions "provocative" and says that he exceeded his powers. It is acknowledged that the conflict could have resulted in casualties. The Latvian Foreign Ministry statement gives a similar assessment of the actions taken by Latvian officials. It is indicated that issues concerning the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia should be resolved through negotiations.
