"It now appears their ultimate aim is to develop nuclear arms and they are employing a delaying tactics to earn a time," Kim said. Speaking at a National Defense Committee session, the intelligence chief said his agency has been running an early warning system against North Korea around the clock in close cooperation with the intelligence networks of Korea's allies. He said that thus far there have been no direct signs of military provocation on the part of North Korea, though some unusual symptoms such as expanded offensive military exercises and the tightened grip of people's control were detected. Saying that the coercive control of people seems to have reached a point where it no longer works effectively due to mounting difficulties like food and energy crises, Kim said there is the danger that North Korea may choose to foment an external crisis to sidestep their acute internal problems. "Nonetheless, I believe it would be not easy for the North to unleash a military provocation because they themselves well know a war means their suicide," he said.
