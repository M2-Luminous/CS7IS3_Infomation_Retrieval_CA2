Pyongyang Starts Refueling Reactor, Seeks Talks With IAEA Pyongyang Starts Refueling Reactor, Seeks Talks With IAEA SUMMARY Ratcheting up its confrontation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the United States to a brinksmanship level, Pyongyang has announced that it has started the refueling of its 5-megawatt reactor at Yongbyon without an international monitoring presence. At the same time, North Korea hinted at the possibility of some sort of compromise by proposing negotiations with the IAEA on this matter. END SUMMARY Apparently seeking to force the IAEA's and Washington's hand, a 14 May Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement announced that replacement of fuel rods at the Yongbyon reactor has begun (Pyongyang radio, 14 May). Reiterating Pyongyang's earlier claim that the timing of the refueling activities is being determined by "technical" factors, the statement sought to place the onus for the absence of IAEA inspectors at the scene on the IAEA. It claimed that on 19 April Pyongyang informed the agency of its refueling plan and requested the presence of observers, and that Pyongyang had requested the presence of observers four more times subsequently and had issued visas for agency inspectors. Hints of Compromise The statement seemed to take pains to avoid ruling out the possibility of delaying some of the refueling activities. It consistently used the term "fuel rod replacement activities" to denote its current operation, thus leaving it unclear whether the actual unloading of spent fuel rods has begun. In addition, the statement said that, while the refueling activities could not be stopped without "the possibility of raising a new danger" to operational safety, there "still remain possibilities to resolve the problem," since these activities have "just begun." The statement called on the IAEA to negotiate with Pyongyang on the "practical matters" of defining the IAEA's role in the refueling operation. Moreover, although the statement reiterated Pyongyang's earlier rejection of an IAEA request to "select and preserve" spent fuel rods for later measurement, it retained ambiguities that could enable Pyongyang to eventually accommodate the IAEA's position. The current statement again ruled out the "measurement" of replaced fuel rods--an activity that could reveal any past nuclear material diversions--but not their segregation, pending the outcome of future high-level talks between Pyongyang and Washington. Rhetorical Restraint Clearly signaling Pyongyang's continued interest in dialogue with Washington, the statement avoided extreme anti-U.S. rhetoric. In the first reference to Defense Secretary Perry's remarks reported in Western media in recent weeks about the increased gravity of the North Korean nuclear problem, the statement criticized "some quarters" in Washington for spreading "rumors" that Pyongyang is bent on extracting enough plutonium for "manufacturing four or five nuclear bombs." However, it characterized these "rumors" relatively mildly, calling them a "sinister" attempt to intensify pressure on North Korea. In a more conspicuous example of rhetorical restraint, the North Korean news agency KCNA on 7 May reported on President Clinton's 3 May international news conference on CNN, but totally ignored the President's remarks criticizing Pyongyang's nuclear program. Implications The 14 May Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement illustrates Pyongyang's ongoing desire to retain as much bargaining power on the nuclear issue for as long as possible. Pyongyang is clearly signaling that while it is willing to allow international verification of the nondiversion of nuclear materials produced by the current refueling activities, it rejects IAEA activities that could disclose any past diversions of such material, pending the outcome of future U.S.-North Korea high-level talks. The North Korean leadership seems to be betting that there are enough incentives in this formulation for the IAEA to be present at the refueling and for Washington to start negotiating with Pyongyang.
