In a meeting here Monday, the two sides discussed international developments including crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and termed the double-standard of the West, especially the U.S., as "cruel and unacceptable". The two officials also criticized procrastination of the U.N. and the West towards massacre of Bosnian Muslims by Serbian forces. Pointing to the issue of hajj, Hashemi regretted new restrictions being imposed by Saudi Arabia on the number of Iranian hajj pilgrims. He stressed that if Muslims were allowed to raise problems facing the Islamic world during hajj rituals and could make proper decisions themselves, the world arrogance could never find a chance to interfere in their internal affairs. Baridah, who arrived here Monday on a three-day visit, discussed expansion of bilateral relations in all fields. He also underlined the religious and political importance of hajj.
