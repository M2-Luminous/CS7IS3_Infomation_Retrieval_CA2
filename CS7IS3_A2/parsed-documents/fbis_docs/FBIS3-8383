[Reporter] A meeting of the SLD-PSL coalition is over. According to Jerzy Szmajdzinski, the coalition members acquainted themselves with the sociopolitical situation in Poland in the context of the spreading strike action by Solidarity. The government's readiness for talks with Solidarity has been reiterated. The SLD presented to Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak a proposal that the deputy prime minister and finance minister portfolios be given to Dariusz Rosati. As Szmajdzinski put it, the prime minister received the proposal in silence. It was agreed that, before the end of this week, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak will hold a longer conversation with the candidate for deputy prime ministership. During this conversation, Pawlak will agree on conditions for cooperation with the new finance minister. Journalists asked if the coalition members also discussed clauses in the Budget Law that oblige the Ministry of National Defense to purchase equipment only from Polish arms manufacturers. Answering this question, Jerzy Szmajdzinski stated that the SLD expects Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk to indicate all of his reservations concerning the budget of his ministry during the Senate debate on the budget. During the evening meeting, the coalition members also discussed sending the concordat to the Sejm.
