That is the impression that Lorenz Schomerus, head of the Foreign Economic Policy Department at the Federal Economics Ministry, obtained during talks with representatives of the Labor government in Canberra. "It was clear that Australia wants to have equal relations with the main players," said the Bonn-based official. Following the German-Australian economic and political consultations in Canberra, an annual forum that the two governments agreed to hold in 1988, Schomerus assessed German-Australian economic relations as "good, sound, and free of problems." Germany's restrictive policy on the import of coal constitutes a temporary problem. The Australian Government repeated its wish to Schomerus that Germany invest more in Australia and, above all, use the Antipodean continent as a springboard for activities in Asia. "The country is a good location for companies, people are well-trained and conscientious, and that also applies to management. All these things are positive," explained the official in a conversation with HANDELSBLATT in Melbourne. Speaking in Canberra, Schomerus drew attention to the Kohl government's new concept for Southeast Asia, which "is geared toward encouraging German companies, including small and medium-sized ones, to become active in the region." The ministerial director noted that the new Southeast Asia concept that Schomerus explained in Canberra, setting out details that had not been provided before, was noted with interest by the Australian Government. There was also a feeling of satisfaction in Canberra, because one could see that a country as important economically as Germany was consciously looking to the Asian Pacific region. The Australian Government noted with regret that the planned visit by Agriculture Minister Jochen Borchert had been called off, reported Schomerus. Australia has one of the most competitive agricultural sectors in the world, and Canberra had many questions to address to Borchert. Following the decline in German exports to Australia over the past few years, during his talks in Canberra, the minister was able to point to "a new upward trend in exports covering the entire range of sectors in which Germany performs well, from automobiles to machine tools." The significance of German-Australian consultations extends well beyond the two countries' bilateral affairs. Australia is playing an increasingly active, leading role in multilateral organizations. Bonn and Canberra are generally on the same wavelength with regard to economic policy issues. Schomerus said: "This means that there are possibilities for pursuing matters of joint interest in international forums. The most important reason for regular consultations between Bonn and Canberra is to discuss how the world economy is developing and what we can do jointly to ensure that things proceed in the right direction."
