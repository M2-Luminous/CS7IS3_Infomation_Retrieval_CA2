A XINHUA reporter has conducted an interview with Hu Sheng, vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee and deputy head of the task force for amending the CPPCC constitution. [Reporter] The "Draft Amendments to the CPPCC Constitution" have been submitted to the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee for examination. As deputy head of the task force for amending the CPPCC Constitution, would you please talk about the process of the revision. [Hu] In May 1993, the Second Standing Committee Session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee adopted the "Decision on Partial Revision of the CPPCC Constitution." A task force was set up with Li Ruihuan as its head and Ye Xuanping, Wu Xueqing, and me as the deputy heads. After half a year of work, the "Draft Amendments to the CPPCC Constitution" have been completed and submitted to the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee for examination. [Reporter] Why is it necessary to revise the present constitution? [Hu] The present constitution was revised in 1982 under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, who was then chairman of the CPPCC National Committee. It was a good constitution which played an important role in ushering in a new situation in CPPCC work in the new period. In the past 12 years, we have made tremendous progress in reform, opening up, and the socialist modernization drive, and the state has undergone profound changes. Especially since Comrade Deng Xiaoping made those talks when he visited the south and the convocation of the 14th CPC National Congress, China has entered a new phase of reform, opening up, and the modernization drive. To meet the requirements of these changes, necessary revisions have been made to the Constitution, the CPC Constitution, and the constitutions of the democratic parties. Therefore requisite revisions to the CPPCC Constitution should also be made. [Reporter] What are the principles you followed in drafting the amendments the CPPCC Constitution this time? [Hu] In drafting the amendments, our principle is to take the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress as our guidance, to make the changes converge with the amendments to the state constitution, and to emphasize the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the basic line for the primary stage of socialism, the system of multiparty cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the CPC, and the socialist market economic system. We also took care to draw on the new experience and new achievements in promoting socialist democracy and CPPCC work since 1982. Provisions in the 1982 revised constitution that are still applicable today will, as a rule, remain unchanged. We are not writing a new 1994 version of the CPPCC Constitution. It is still the 1982 constitution with some partial, necessary changes. [Reporter] What are the main contents of the present amendments? [Hu] Contents about the theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics, the basic line for the primary stage of socialism, and the socialist market economic system have been incorporated into some pertinent paragraphs and articles. While asserting the CPPCC as a patriotic united front organization of the Chinese people, the CPPCC Constitution, as amended, goes one step further by asserting it as an important organization of multiparty cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the CPC. It also expressly establishes that the principal functions of the CPPCC include political consultation; democratic supervision; organizing the parties, organizations, and personages representing all nationalities and quarters to participate in the deliberation and administration of state affairs; and so forth. It is possible that changes will be made to the draft when it is examined by the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee. It will be promulgated after approval.
