For a New Putsch?', published in the 11th issue of the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA here last Friday," says a statement by the first vice-premier's press secretary, forwarded to ITAR-TASS today. (The article said that Soskovets was a member of an allegedly existing "group of state leaders" wishing to remove Boris Yeltsin from power -- ITAR-TASS). "In principle, he has no intention of reacting in any way to such publications," the statement says. "At the same time, I must express concern on behalf of the first vice-premier in connection with attempts to split our society asunder, to sow discord within the state-governing structures, among prominent politicians and public leaders. Such attempts directly contradict the tendency towards concord, gaining strength in our society, which was created by President Yeltsin's recent initiatives," the document stresses. "Oleg Soskovets believes that the consolidation of civil peace will be promoted also by the government-planned measures to stabilise the economy and increase the social character of the ongoing reforms," the press secretary says in his official document. "The way to consolidate and develop Russia lies through the cooperation of all the organs of power, all the political parties, public movements and social groups. The first vice-premier, just as other members of the government, regards our president as the guarantor of peace, tranquility and stability in the country."
