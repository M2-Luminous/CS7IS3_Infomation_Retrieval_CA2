He said that, after Poland submitted its highly esteemed presentation document for the Partnership for Peace scheme, the case of our integration with the West took on a completely new dimension. Minister Kolodziejczyk said that, during discussions on European political matters, the issue of Russia, whose policies are largely opaque and keep changing from day to day, was on top. In such a situation, it was decided to withhold all of the diagnoses and comments on this subject until the 25 May meeting in Brussels, one day after Russian Defense Minister Grachev's presentation of Russian military doctrine and Russian attitude toward the Partnership for Peace scheme. The meeting participants have taken a completely unanimous stand, saying that Russian participation in the Partnership for Peace scheme can only take place on identical for all, partnerlike terms, Kolodziejczyk said. Speaking about military aspects of our participation in the Partnership for Peace scheme, Kolodziejczyk said that discussion concerned mainly the question about what could be done this year and next, so that the new status of Poland could be implemented as soon as possible. The conclusion was that we should move over from cooperation at a tactical level to cooperation at the operational level as soon as possible. Before the end of this year, we will have participated in 18 joint exercises with NATO armed forces on Polish territory and in Western countries. Joint command and staff exercises will be held next year. Kolodziejczyk stressed that the opening of NATO countries to cooperation in the operational art and technology sphere was a great step forward and a chance for the modernization of our armed forces. During the meeting, the Danish side came out with an initiative that, as part of the Partnership for Peace scheme, cooperation with Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia be strengthened. It was decided that, at the first stage, Sweden and Finland should take appropriate actions, and then Germany and Poland would join in. Minister Kolodziejczyk also mentioned other actions aimed at the military integration with the West and about the Polish-German-French meeting, scheduled for July, as well as an agreement with Sweden concerning military technology. "The pace of these actions is great, but I do not feel I am out of breath. One would like all other politicians to catch up with this pace because this is really a great opportunity for Poland," Kolodziejczyk said.
