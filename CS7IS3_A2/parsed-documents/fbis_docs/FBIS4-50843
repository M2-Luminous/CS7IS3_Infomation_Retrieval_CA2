Statistics from the Beijing municipal commercial commission show that the transaction volume in 27 supermarkets in Beijing topped 100 million yuan last year. In 1992, there were just 15 supermarkets. Total sales volume of the 27 supermarkets reached 9.465 billion yuan, accounting for 17.2 percent of Beijing's total retail sales volume last year. Commercial experts said that large department stores are winning more customers and playing an increasingly important role in market competition as they have the priority in market information, feedback and power. A series of reforms has been carried out in the major stores involving labor, personnel and distribution. Employees' enthusiasm was greatly increased as reforms were promoted in such commercial groups as the Beijing Department Store, the Xidan Department Store, the Dongan Market and the Beijing Friendship Store. In addition, a dozen new supermarkets are catching up. The Lufthansa Friendship Commercial Center, the Scite Tower, the County and Township Trade Center, Xidan Shopping Center among others that were built in the past several years have become new shopping attractions.
