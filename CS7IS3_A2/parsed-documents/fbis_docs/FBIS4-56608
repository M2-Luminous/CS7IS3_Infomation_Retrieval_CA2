[passage omitted] The government has minimized the possibility of an ultra-rightist terrorist organization from the very beginning. The police have only charged Alejandro Suchsdorf, owner of the premises where the arsenal was found. Also involved in the case was Marcelo Schetino, driver and guard of Military Household Chief General Jorge Rearte. Rearte is in charge of Menem's security. He said Schetino's record is unblemished. The justice department could not indict Schetino in this case and released him. Schetino, however, was arrested again when Susana Louzao accused him of having kidnapped her four years ago. Menem said Schetino "confessed -- or at least suggested -- that the resources were part of the painted faced [carapintada] cause." He added: "The police are investigating" whether this individual is connected in any way with "those responsible for blowing up the Israeli Embassy." "When the arsenal was discovered and I said that perhaps the carapintada rebels were involved, the people almost lynched me. We must thoroughly investigate because the arsenal was discovered on a stream that leads to a house of Mario Falak, a friend of mine," Menem said. [passage omitted] The president told Radio America reporters that you can travel to the delta zone "by helicopter or boat," adding that "he (Sucksdorf) had missiles that could blow up a helicopter or a boat -- or even the president." [passage omitted].
