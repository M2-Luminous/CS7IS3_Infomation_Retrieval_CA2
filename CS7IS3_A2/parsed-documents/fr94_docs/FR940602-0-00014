FR940602-0-00014 FR940602-0-00003 C. General Considerations The Asset Value of Loans and Investments will depend upon the circumstances of each individual case and will be based upon the nature of the asset and the stage of a company's existence. In negotiating the terms and conditions of an investment with a Small Concern, the Licensee, in effect, establishes an initial valuation for the investment, which is cost. Cost shall be the Asset Value until there is a basis to increase or decrease the valuation. Unrealized appreciation should be recognized when warranted, but should be limited to those investments that have a sustained economic basis for an increase in value. Temporary market fluctuations or a temporary increase in earnings should not be the cause or sole reason for appreciation. Unrealized depreciation should be recorded when portfolio companies show sustained unfavorable financial performance. Continuous close scrutiny of Loans and Investments will provide insight into the business cycles and problems encountered by small business concerns. This insight will allow the Licensee to differentiate between a temporary downturn or setback and a long-term problem indicating a measurable decline in Asset Value. When a decline in Asset Value appears permanent, a complete or partial write-off of the asset (i.e., recording a realized loss rather than unrealized depreciation) should occur. Some of the more obvious indications of permanent impairment of an investment include the termination of business operations, a petition for bankruptcy protection or liquidation, or the absence of a verifiable forwarding address of the business or its proprietor(s). Less obvious situations may include the loss of major revenue accounts, the shut down of a critical distribution channel, an adverse legal or regulatory ruling, or the expiration of a priority claim on collateral in a distressed Small Concern. These and other possible circumstances should be assessed on a case-by-case basis, with supporting documentation on file. D. Valuation Responsibility As specified in 13 CFR 107.101(g), the Licensee's Board of Directors or General Partners have the sole responsibility for determining Asset Value. In determining Asset Value, the Board of Directors or General Partners must satisfy themselves that all appropriate factors relevant to a good faith valuation have been considered and that the methods used are reasonable and prudent and are consistently applied. Although the Board of Directors or General Partners have the ultimate responsibility for determining Asset Value, they may appoint management or other persons to assist them in such determinations and to provide supporting data and make the necessary calculations pursuant to the Board's or General Partners' direction. It is essential that a careful, conservative, yet realistic approach be taken by Licensees in determining the Asset Value of each Loan and Investment. As part of the annual audit of the Licensee's financial statements, the Licensee's independent public accountant has responsibility to review the Licensee's valuation procedures and implementation of such procedures including adequacy of documentation. The independent public accountant also has reporting responsibility regarding the results of this review. (See appendix I to this part, section III and section V, paragraphs I and J). E. Frequency of Valuation Loans and Investments shall be valued individually and in the aggregate by the Board of Directors or General Partners at least semiannually_as of the end of the second quarter of Licensee's fiscal year and as of the end of Licensee's fiscal year, Provided however, That Licensees without Leverage need only perform valuations once a year. On a case-by-case basis, SBA may require valuations to be made more frequently. Only valuations performed as of the fiscal year-end are required to be reviewed by the Licensee's independent public accountant, as discussed in paragraph D. of this section. Each Licensee shall forward a valuation report to SBA within 90 days of the end of its fiscal year in the case of annual valuations, and within thirty days following the close of other reporting periods. Material changes in valuations shall be reported not less often than quarterly within thirty days following the close of the quarter. Since the valuations will only be as sound as the timeliness of the financial information upon which they are based, Licensees shall require frequent financial statements from Small Concerns. Monthly financial statements are normally appropriate. F. Written Valuation Policy
