It has a 4,000-km long boundary line and a population of 38 million people, which is slightly bigger than that of Guangdong. With 25 minority nationalities living in Yunnan, the province ranks first in China in terms of the number of minority nationalities. In the past, the province was very hard to get to and culturally backward. Although it had abundant material resources, its economy failed to develop for a long time. From 1979 to 1983, the provincial government made vigorous efforts to develop agriculture, and thus basically solved the problem of food and clothing in five years time. Then, in light of its own strong point in resources, the government concentrated efforts on developing such crops as tobacco, tea, sugarcane, and rubber. Yunnan's tobacco is the best in China. Its geographical conditions, such as a big temperature gap between day and night, a long periods of sunshine, and soil, are particularly suitable for the growth of these commercial crops. Through six or seven years of efforts, production of these crops has expanded, thus laying a solid foundation for the development of light industry. Since 1983, the government has concentrated the province's human, material, and financial resources on vigorously developing the processing industries and technology of these commercial crops, set up new factories, and transformed old factories. Today after 10 years of efforts, the province has seven large cigarette factories, of which two rank very high in Asia with a production capacity of 5.5 million cases [xiang 4630] a year; 84 sugar refineries with an annual output of 1 million tonnes; 100 or so tea processing plants with an annual output of 55,000 tonnes; and an annual rubber output of 40,000 tonnes. These undertakings which require little investment have yielded large taxes and profits and are of high efficiency. In 1983, Yunnan had just 1.17 billion yuan in financial revenue, but in 1993, the figure had topped the mark of 20 billion yuan, or an increase of 1.7 times. In the terms of ratio alone, this increase was the highest level in the country. We handed over 4 billion yuan to the central authorities and retained 1.2 billion for our own disposal. Even with money ready at hand, the provincial government dared not spend it wantonly. There were two major factors causing the province's prolonged backwardness. One was the "software" question, namely, people's cultural and education quality was too poor, and the other was the "hardware" question, including backward infrastructures in the energy industry, communications, and water conservancy. This being the case, for Yunnan to develop further, it is necessary to introduce vigorous transformation in these two aspects. The provincial government decided that money should not be spent on construction of non-productive projects and even on repairing the Government Conference Hall, which was built in the 1950's and has now became dilapidated. The provincial authorities decided, first of all, to invest a large amount of funds in capital construction. Yunnan has abundant mineral resources. However, without electricity, there would be no way to exploit them. Through 10 years of efforts, the province and the Ministry of Water Resources have managed to jointly establish the Lancang Jiang Power Station, with a generating capacity of 1.5 million kwh. In 1983, the province had just 1.5 million kwh in generating capacity. Hence, the generating capacity of a Lancang Jiang Power Station was equal to the total generating capacity of the province in the previous year. The waters of the Lancang Jiang, which come from the glaciers of the Qinghai Plateau, have a stable source and will certainly not dry up. In cooperation with Guangdong Province, Yunnan is now building a larger power station in the upper reaches of the Lancang Jiang, with a generating capacity of 4.2 million kwh. After completion, all electricity will go to Guangdong Province for its use. At first, Guangdong provincial leaders did not believe that and thought that we lured them to get hooked and we just took a fancy to their money. In fact, with the completion of the construction of a power station in the upper reaches of the river, if we use the drawn waters of the lower reaches to irrigate farmland in the dry season, this will help solve many problems. In transportation, the province has 27 million tonnes of goods and materials to be shipped out. However, in the past we just relied on the Chengdu-Kunming and Guiyang-Kunming railways whose highest total carrying capacity was just 10 million tonnes. The province was thus compelled to "carry out production according to the amount of goods and materials shipped out." The production of goods and materials which could not be shipped out was not allowed. After enduring enough sufferings in this regard, provincial authorities were determined to vigorously solve the problem. Now we have three new railways under construction, of which the Nanning-Kunming Railway can be said to be the artery of the whole Southwest region. The construction is undertaken jointly by Yunnan, Guangxi, Guizhou, and the Ministry of Railways, and after completion, it will have a carrying capacity of 10 million tonnes, and the province will be able to ship out 100 percent more goods and materials. Moreover, there are arterial highways, airports, and waterways under construction. In the days to come, we are prepared to spend another seven to 10 years opening wider to the outside world, importing new and high technologies, developing major industrial projects worth five to 10 billion yuan, and changing the economic structure. For example, as an anti-smoking trend has become common practice in the international community, it will be dangerous for us to develop the tobacco industry on a single-line basis. Maybe the industry will collapse at any time. In the days ahead, with the exception of tobacco, tea, sugar, and rubber, we still hope to strengthen development of such areas as the machinery and electrical industries, nonferrous metals, iron and steel, timber, food and drinks, spices, and Chinese herbal medicine. For example, the results of a study show that Chinese medicine pseudo-ginseng [san qi 0005 0003], a special product of Yunnan, is not inferior to the ginseng grown in northeast China in terms of useful ingredients. Since the drive of reform and opening up to the outside world was launched, there has been a tilt in the state's investment policy. To put it another way, the state has invested more in the eastern coastal areas and less in the southwestern border areas. For instance, according to the state plan, Yunnan was expected to be built into a nonferrous metal base in the 1950's and the state's investment in the province constituted 2.5 percent of its total investment. However, in the Sixth and Seventh Five-Year Plans, the ratio dropped to 1 percent or so, and even less than 1 percent. Under these circumstances, should Yunnan passively wait for state assistance or actively try to find a way out by relying on its own efforts and hard work? We decided to rely on our own efforts and go all out to develop ourselves instead of waiting. We started with the development of agriculture and light industry, and after accumulating funds, we used them in education and capital construction, and as the investment environment improved, we developed major industries.... Practice in the last decade has proven that this line of thinking is correct and workable. This is roughly the case in the last 10 years. In the coming 10 years, we will surely be able to develop faster with better results on the basis of what we have achieved in the last 10 years. [TA KUNG PAO] In Yunnan minority nationalities live in compact communities. What is the situation of nationality concord and unity? [Pu] Before the founding of the People's Republic of China, in Yunnan there were more than 20 minority nationalities who lived in different social formations, ranging from primitive communal societies where there was no conception of private property, land was publicly owned, and earnings were equally distributed, to slave societies, to societies under the rule of feudal lords or hereditary headmen, to feudal societies. After liberation, they "entered socialism in a single bound" as one may well say. For many years, we have put stress on the nationality cadre policy. Of Yunnan's population totaling 30 million people or so, the combined population of 25 minority nationalities constitute less than one third. However, of the contingent of cadres at all levels, cadres of minority nationalities make up 25 percent. The more senior the cadres, the greater the ratio becomes. Of the members of the provincial party committee and government, deputies to the provincial people's congress, and members of the provincial committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, 40 percent are people of minority nationalities and the remaining 60 percent are people of the Han nationality. In the past few year, we have managed to ensure that minority nationalities are not oppressed politically and not exploited economically. However, this does not mean that we have solved all the problems. Because of some long- standing historical reasons, the gap between the minority and Han nationalities in the cultural and economic fields still exist. Moreover, as the Han nationality's economy and culture expand, the gap will become wider and wider. This will probably cause problems. Only when the economy and culture of minority nationalities are upgraded and developed can the contradictions between the two sides be solved and can genuine unity and concord achieved. Provincial authorities attach great importance to this problem. [TA KUNG PAO] There is a rumor circulating abroad that Yunnan Province is beset with the problems of drug cultivation and trafficking. What is actually the true situation? [Pu] Yunnan Province has a long boundary line. Intermarriage is common among people living in the frontiers which are not separated by big rivers, and it is impossible to surround them with wire entanglements. These people are relatives of each other. For a long time, people living inside and outside the frontiers have lived together in peace and have been law-abiding on the whole. However, there are also difficulties. Outside our borders, people grow 1 million mu of opium poppies. So long as they have a bumper harvest of opium poppies, we will have bad luck. For our part, the Yunnan provincial government firmly bans the cultivation, trafficking, and selling of drugs. Even dozens of mu or a piece of land sown to opium poppies will be promptly weeded out as soon as they are discovered. Last year over 100 mu of opium poppies were rooted out. However, banning cultivation of opium poppies does not solve the problem. As long as you look out at the places across the frontier line you stand on, a sea of red opium poppies will meet your eyes. Making use of Yunnan as a thoroughfare for drug trafficking, drug trading groups ship drugs to Guangzhou and Hong Kong via Kunming. We also firmly ban and crack down on such activities. Last year, we arrested more than 3,000 people and dealt with some of the cases based on solid evidence according to law. Drug traffickers who are arrested will certainly be dealt with according to law, be they from other provinces or outside the borders. While strengthening border customs inspection, we rely mainly on the joint defense of the people, the Army, and the police and form a gigantic net so that there is no escape for drug traffickers. Last year, we seized and confiscated drugs totaling some five tonnes, or 3.5 tonnes of heroin and 1.5 tonnes of opium. However, according to our calculation, this was only the tip of the iceberg. The traffickers succeeded in smuggling out most of their drugs. As long as there are drug markets abroad, it is difficult to solve the problem. Last year, the number of drug cases dropped but that of major cases increased, and there were even cases of armed smuggling and escorting of drugs. This is a complicated international problem. Now we are seeking cooperation with international anti-drug organizations to jointly crack down on drug trading activities. In a word, on no account does Yunnan grow and traffic drugs. The province firmly bans drugs. [TA KUNG PAO] Will you please say something about the recent developments of border trade? [Pu] On the 4,000-km frontier line, 28 counties are slated as border trade areas, with 186 materials being duty-free as approved by the customhouse. We have adopted some flexible measures in areas such as currency exchange and communications and transportation. Now a border trade coordinating organization of five provinces and seven parties in southwest China has taken shape, hundreds of companies are engaged in border trade, and they are expanding markets. Last year, the transactions of border trade totaled 3 billion yuan and the 1985 figure was just 30 million yuan. Now, in reality, goods traded on the frontiers come from all parts of the country. Hence, border trade has become, in reality, a form of foreign trade.
