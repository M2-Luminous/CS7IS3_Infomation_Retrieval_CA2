Vesna Tenjovic reports. [Begin recording] Owing to great pressure, it is diesel that is mostly produced at the moment. The production is progressing according to plan and it should remain at last year's level. Rationalization within the oil industry has led to a decrease in expenses, which has created conditions for a 4.5 percent decrease in prices. However, owing to problems that arose in the earlier period, NIS believes that the price of derivatives should not be decreased immediately, but rather after the company has been consolidated. A decrease in taxes would also create leeway for decreasing prices. NIS is also preparing a program of rationalization and reorganization of the company, but the changes probably will not be great.
