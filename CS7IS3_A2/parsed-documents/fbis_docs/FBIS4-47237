So Far Only Central Asian, Though"] [Text] While Eurasian ideas so far remain on paper, the Unified Economic Space project (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan) is beginning to acquire an increasingly real shape. One gets this impression from a frenetic pace of preparation of numerous documents for the July meeting of heads of these three countries that is currently being carried out in the bowels of Kazakh ministries and agencies. Despite personnel and structural reshuffling in republic state organs, more than 10 agreements and accords are going through final polishing, which gives one hope for at least an outward success of the upcoming Shymkent summit of Presidents Nazarbayev, Karimov, and Akayev. The unquestionable "bomb" among these documents (at least for other CIS partners) will be the substantiation of proposals being prepared by our side for making Almaty the site of the proposed headquarters of a permanent executive body of the "Central Asian trio's" intergovernment commission on intensification of economic integration. Kazakhstan is preparing not only the draft on this organization's status, but also its estimated budget, and will provide the technical infrastructure for its functioning. Such serious preparation for organizing the structures of the Unified Economic Space (EEP) seem to be pointing in the direction that this interstate structure is being set up seriously and long-term. There is, of course, a danger that even after setting up the organization's headquarters, as time goes by and circumstances change, its parents will lose interest in the idea of Unified Economic Space, and this will result in another unproductive squandering of the republic budget money. Notable among other documents is a memorandum and program for creating conditions to reduce the population's migration. It is not yet clear, though, which migration Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan intend to reduce--interrepublic or general? At the root of this question is that it is quite difficult to separate the regional migration issues from general migration problems existing today on the territory of the entire post-Soviet space. Naturally, in attempting to create something unified and economic, the sides concentrated their attention first and foremost on economic issues. Among them, agreements on the following should be noted: --setting up an arbitration court (Supreme Economic Court); --setting up a joint commercial bank; --setting up joint enterprises; --manufacturing cars on the operating capacities of the three countries; --manufacturing cotton yarn and fabrics made of it; --manufacturing textile machinery; --joint construction of an Aktau-Beyneu-Kandagach oil pipeline and reconstruction of oil refineries. Most likely, dealing with these items (if agreements on them are signed) will become the prerogative of the aforementioned Unified Economic Space's permanent executive body and the planned Business Cooperation Council (SDS), in which our side apparently will be represented by specialists from the Ministry of Economics, the Ministry of Industry and Trade, and the Congress of Kazakhstan Entrepreneurs. The presence of the latter organization in the lists of candidates for participation in international structures says that the young businessmen who constitute its skeleton are already tired of simply asking the government for this and that and decided to engage themselves in writing economic history (even though only a Central Asian one). There is a concern, though, that the new generation of entrepreneurs will find themselves too much involved in such close cooperation with Cabinet of Ministers structures, which will eventually leave them firmly linked with the current government course, which is not particularly popular among the people. But this is, as they say, their own problem. In short, we do not have to wait long to find out whether it is right to say that Unified Economic Space ideas are eternal because they are correct.
