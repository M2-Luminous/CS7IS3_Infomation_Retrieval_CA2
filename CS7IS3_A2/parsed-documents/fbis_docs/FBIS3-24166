And who are the financial guards? Something like a modern-day "oprichnina" [Ivan the Terrible's palace guard]? Or something just as essential to civilized society as air traffic, highway regulations, or convertible currency? That, along with many other things, is the subject of our interview with Nicolae Bivol, the chief of the financial guard under the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Moldova. A Quick-Response Unit? [Skvirenko] These days the financial guard is rumored to be just like the OBKhSS [Department for Combating the Embezzlement of Socialist Property and Speculation] once was. But, to the best of my knowledge, it is a new organization and is involved in something new. Please explain what is going on here. [Bivol] Let us begin by saying that there has never been such an organization before, since there could not have been because there were no such violations like those we work on. What benefit could a socialist enterprise gain from evading taxes, for example? [Skvirenko] None. [Bivol] Of course! Let us compare present-day income and the former bonuses and, most importantly, let us consider where they come from and where they used to come from. Both come... from profits. So hiding profit did not make sense before; there would not even have been bonuses. A different type of violation existed, if you remember, account padding. But now? Now everything is different. Profits are concealed, and income too. And they are tens and hundreds of times more sensitive than the former bonuses. That is what gives the actions of our present-day "clients" their logic. [Skvirenko] So you kind of add this quick response unit onto the tax inspection service? [Bivol] And then too, we work on operational monitoring of compliance with customs laws, track contraband... And, of course, we protect consumers' rights--we fight against the illegal practice of overpricing. [Skvirenko] So it is something new, and drastic too. Your first assignment must really stick in your mind. [Bivol] And the first lessons that it taught us? Yes, that is true. But the first assignment was a commercial store. And the first lesson was the awareness of our complete inability to do anything. We requested the documents; there were no documents. We wanted to know whose goods they were; "The goods are my own." And that was it. And no one knew what to do then. We conducted two or three such miserable inspections, and then I went to request that an edict be published on our service. The draft of the edict was prepared, and it was lost somewhere. A second draft was prepared and was sent to the president's secretariat. And there I was given the edict after exactly one week. True, there were strong objections to this document in parliament then, but to be frank, in that particular parliament, I mean in view of its particular make-up, the idea of a financial guard could certainly not find support. And although they could not stop it, certain traces still remain in the document. [Skvirenko] Which ones? [Bivol] Well, for example, instead of a provision on confiscation of illegal goods, there is a vague statement on their detention. But personally I believed and continue to believe that if goods which are not certified with documents and whose legal origin cannot be proven are found at an economic agent, those goods must be removed and confiscated for state income. Incidentally, in most countries that is precisely the type of procedure which operates. And gives pretty good results. [Skvirenko] Just how do you get out of the situation? [Bivol] We tossed around what to do with the detained goods and decided to seize them and fine the economic agent. He pays the fine, he gets the goods. [Skvirenko] Do they pay? [Bivol] Without blinking an eye! [Skvirenko] But later they add this fine onto the price of the goods. And it turns out that ultimately we punish the consumer. [Bivol] That is partly true. But only partly, since the buyer knows how to count and people simply will not buy anything from someone who jacks the price up more than others. But the main thing is that we must certainly do something, and we must start somewhere. Now we have prepared one more draft edict on bringing people to account for economic violations. Many of the provisions in it look much more well-grounded. [Skvirenko] For example? [Bivol] For example, where should dividends from our capital invested in joint ventures created either on Moldova's territory or outside its borders be accounted for? There are no such accounting records. And in general who can tell how much capital has left Moldova for other countries, especially Romania, Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus? No one can tell. But if there were a mechanism for monitoring this sphere of activity, not only could we answer all these questions, but we would not for anything let our state be hurt. The Weakest Spot [Skvirenko] In our country the mechanisms, both in the economy and in politics, are the weakest spot. [Bivol] That is true. But to be specific, we lack the most fundamental thing which economic agents need. There is no Law on Accounting. There is no Business Code. And, finally, as yet there is no Law on Declaration of Income. So it seems that no one clearly knows how, on what, or where to keep records. No one can accurately distinguish a case of buying and selling from an export or import transaction. And no one, although we have been floating and even already drowning in a free economy for a long time, no one declares his income. Take for example the Administrative Code. It meticulously notes down the type of punishment envisioned for taking the trolley without a ticket or walking a dog in the wrong place. But why not, in the sphere of economics too, add the good idea of permitting everything that is not prohibited and add a precise list of what in fact is prohibited? I assure you that it would take no more than 20-30 points, but then not only could we appeal for order, we could really fight for it. [Skvirenko] Unfortunately, many provisions are written in such a way that they obscure rather than illuminate the essence of the matter. [Bivol] That is certainly true. In 1992 a legislative enactment was adopted which says that if an economic agent carries out illegal economic activity or an operation without the necessary license, then the profit obtained from this type of activity is recovered from him--as punishment! I am sure that we will not find one case in the last 2 years in all of Moldova where this sanction was applied. And all because it is tied to profits which can easily be concealed in the common pot of this structure's activity. [Skvirenko] But what should it have been tied to? [Bivol] Revenue from the illegal economic activity itself must be recovered. And if any of the output produced is left, it must also be confiscated. That would be the right way. Otherwise, commercial structures will always have altogether unfair advantages over state structures. [Skvirenko] The advantages of "muddy waters"? [Bivol] Absolutely right. For what happens? Violations of economic laws have become epidemic; more than 75 percent of all economic agents are guilty of this! [Skvirenko] But aren't you afraid that organized crime in an already fairly developed form is behind all this, in the background, so to speak? [Bivol] Yes, that fear does occur to me. [Skvirenko] Where does it come from? [Bivol] From elementary facts. For example: the organs of power, which are always calling upon people to observe the laws, themselves for some reason do not observe them. That is to say, they themselves are constantly establishing exceptions for some person and for some reason. [Skvirenko] And are there a lot of such exceptions now? [Bivol] Enough. Last year the total number of economic sanctions imposed by the financial guard equaled 3.2 billion coupon rubles. At the same time, however, many economic agents were exempted from our sanctions by various directives "as an exception," for a total of more than half a billion rubles. [Skvirenko] Were these "amnesties" not always justified? [Bivol] Above all the very practice of making any exceptions was in no way justified. You want to change the law? Introduce an amendment. But the very effect of the law and of the amendment must be the same for everyone. Otherwise, there is no such thing as economic space. And so what has happened in our country? Let us say there was an edict on in-kind tax. There was an uproar over it: if farms do not hand over as much meat, grain, and other products as is suggested, we will punish them with fines. So first we were criticized for not imposing fines. But when we began to fine the guilty, they went and published an edict so that this sanction would not be applied in the future. Do you sense the, to put it mildly, awkward situation? And now a document is being prepared by which the fines collected before will be returned to the "victims." [Skvirenko] Then why was this whole long procedure undertaken at all? To "trip up" the financial guard? [Bivol] I am most touched when a letter exempting a firm from the fine cites the reason: such-and-such firm has done a great deal for the republic. So just what has it done? Maybe it has supplied something, imported something else. Pardon me, but we have state structures which are supposed to both supply and import. And if they cannot handle this work, then let us either reform them or ask the more efficient managers of the independent structures to head our inefficient state structures! Don't Do It Better, Do It Right [Skvirenko] But on the other hand, while we used to be called the "country of the soviets," now we can certainly be called the "country of the edicts." Is every edict dictated by the desire to do something better? [Bivol] You know,, the word "better" is sometimes quite dangerous. Better for whom? Better how? Better at whose expense? If something should in fact be an exception, then there is the edict. But economic agents must operate under exactly the same conditions and in a unified economic space for all. And then in competition they will begin to do better and to work more efficiently, and that means that as a result we will all be better off. I repeat over and over: a good legislative mechanism is the only thing that will save us. [Skvirenko] All the same, what factors of this mechanism should definitely be singled out? [Bivol] The idea of the mechanism is to untie the hands of economic agents, both state and nonstate agents, as much as possible. And among other things that means that first prices must be freed and licensing and barter must be eliminated, especially barter since it is the main channel for abuses. A market economy must be built on the base of buying and selling, for lei and for hard currency. To do this, of course, banks must operate efficiently, credit transactions must be carried out, and the securities market must operate. But a reliable convertible leu must be the heart of everything. Can you imagine how easy it would be for our economic agents to operate if the leu were convertible both in our country and abroad? You want to go to Kuwait for petroleum products, go and buy them. You want to go to China for food, go and buy it. You want to buy computer equipment in Japan, go and buy it. And everything for lei. We must remove the barriers which impede the economic initiative of the producer and the entrepreneur. Do you want me to cite one case, which although it seems to be from a different area touches on the essence of the question? [Skvirenko] Absolutely! [Bivol] Well, in the village of Kostesht in Yalovenskiy Rayon where I was born, land was distributed to the peasants by quotas. This was done in quite a primitive way, but... this year's extraordinary harvest was gathered in full and nothing was left in the fields or in the gardens. Another thing, the state lost a great deal here, since there was no record of the harvest and by no means were all taxes collected. But the harvest did not rot on the land and people did not become poor. Of course the state got its share too. That is to say, the very same mechanism which we are talking about. But a mechanism based on economic freedom rather than in spite of it. [Skvirenko] It seems that the 2 years of intense work in the very epicenter of lively economic problems were not in vain for you. [Bivol] Yes, our organization has grown stronger and defined itself. We have more than 100 operational employees and we are fairly well equipped; every territorial administration has a minimum of two official cars with radio communications, as is proper. We are trying to conduct our tests not simply efficiently but promptly, the moment the transaction occurs. We only have 24 hours, a day, to do all this. So we must work quickly. We come, we look at the documents, if there are any, and if there aren't, we hear the same thing--we have the documents but not here, wait till tomorrow, we'll get them. And so they do, since these days it is no problem to slap together some documents, just give them a few hours. But we do not allow it. We punish them. Promptness, Risk, and Danger [Skvirenko] But just how do you achieve this very factor of promptness? Or is that a trade secret? [Bivol] Of course I will not touch on all the nuances, but those who think that we have any secret agents, moles, or stooges are mistaken. [Skvirenko] And I am ashamed to say that is exactly what I thought. [Bivol] Essentially everything is much simpler and more reliable. When we check on any economic agent, we take into account all his ties, even if they have nothing to do with this particular transaction. That, strictly speaking, is the whole secret. And then there is the matter of equipment. In the evenings we usually get together, exchange information, compare what we already know, and draw conclusions. That is to say, we hand out assignments. And, you know, we rarely miss the mark. [Skvirenko] Yes, it is simply that everything is brilliant. Then it must be that you already have some kind of data bank? [Bivol] Of course. We have information about all economic agents and it is kept on computer. We naturally update, supplement, and correct this information all the time. We are working on creating a data bank on all economic transactions. This job is more complicated than dynamic, but it can only be that way as a result of taking into account not only the "tip of the iceberg," but also getting an idea of the unrecorded capital, the "shadow capital." We have the Jurist computer program and we use it to get answers to any questions regarding particular legislative or reference information in a matter of seconds. [Skvirenko] Your associates must get a good wage, considering the nature of the work. [Bivol] They get a fairly good wage, but that is not the point. We have working for us economists, accountants, and attorneys who could make a much larger salary in commercial structures. And the average age of our associates is just over 40 years. [Skvirenko] Just how do you attract them? [Bivol] Work, complicated and gripping work. [Skvirenko] But certainly dangerous too? [Bivol] Maybe so. There have been cases of attacks on our associates; in fact I get telephone calls and have been threatened verbally and by letter. We have guns and we have other means of protection. We pay attention to special and physical training. We plan to open our own shooting range and martial arts school. But to be honest, it is something altogether different which really worries us. [Skvirenko] What? [Bivol] What we started the conversation with. Who are those monitoring organs? What are their rights and duties? What guarantees of their social protection are there? I will cite this example. We would like to hire graduates of our Economic Academy. But... what is to be done about their military duty? Their oath? How can weapons be entrusted to them? And once again, what guarantees of protection do we, the employees of the financial guard, have? [Skvirenko] Just what ones do you have? [Bivol] None at all. Even in terms of a question like the right to use arms. God grant one of us will not have to use them. But does our country have a law on the use of weapons? There is no such law. So just how can the actions of our associate be evaluated in court? "On general principles"? [Skvirenko] Yes, that is some puzzle. But to be honest, looking at you, one would never think that you have the burden of such serious problems. You look athletic, energetic, and smart. What is that, the result of special conditioning? [Bivol] Most likely that is my nature. And the experience of work. After all, I have been working in the monitoring-inspection organs since 1970, and I came here right after graduating from the economics department of Kishinev Polytechnic Institute. [Skvirenko] But even so, such specific work most likely demands some special self-control and restraint. How did you manage to be that way? Do you use special autogenic devices? [Bivol] I try, when possible, to take advantage of the lunch break. But generally, the best relaxation for me is to be alone and retire into myself, even if it is not for long. [Skvirenko] Where? In your office? In the car? At home? [Bivol] Wherever, I am not fussy. [Skvirenko] Do you experience a sense of fear? [Bivol] Any answer to such a question would seem to be showing off. But the point is something altogether different. The point is the nature of the profession. People who are afraid of heights do not become steeplejacks. People who are afraid of enclosed places do not become miners. People who are afraid of wild animals do not become hunters. In fact there are a considerable number of professions which by their very essence are innately risky and dangerous. Take the work of a trolley driver; to me his responsibility and risk are absolutely comparable to the risk of a pilot or combat engineer. So against such a background our work does not seem so special at all. [Skvirenko] How about your family? Do they treat your job so philosophically? [Bivol] To be honest, my family, my wife and children, would like to see me in a different job. The fact that I carry a pistol and I am accompanied to the very doors of my home does not reassure my wife at all. [Skvirenko] Accompanied by... a bodyguard? [Bivol] Exactly, my driver. But at the same time those close to me know my nature. They know that if I have already chosen the work, I must do it conscientiously, without reservation, and without indulgences. [Skvirenko] How should we conclude the interview? [Bivol] I think with a wish for the new parliament which we will elect on 27 February. Let us all finally turn to the economy. Let us consider and do everything we can to ensure that the economy provides all of us with what a person, society, and the state need for a proper life and successful development.
