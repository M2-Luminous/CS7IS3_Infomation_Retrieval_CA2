The European Union will continue to play a "pioneer role" to try to contribute to a global solution acceptable to all and viable at long term, said Mr. Papoulias. He stressed that "each of us must bring a stone to the building" and that Russian participation in this process is indispensable. Furthermore, the Council President announced that a group of experts would be going to Mostar very shortly in order to examine the modalities for temporary administration of the town by the European Union. Mr. Papoulias also spoke of the dispute between Athens and Skopje. As Greek Foreign Minister, he stated that the embargo against the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [as received] was necessary to allow Greece to "defend itself" against aggression from Skopje authorities which, he said, have not done anything to normalise the situation. Mr. Papoulias recalled that, on 10 March, he is to have a talk in this connection with UN mediator for Skopje, Cyrus Vance. He was reasonably optimistic as to the possibility of settling the dispute. The European Commission, recalled Hans van den Broek, has clearly stated that the Greek sanctions, which are "virtually an embargo," are in contradiction with Community law. He went on to say that the Commission hopes the embargo will be lifted in the near future and that there will be normalisation between Athens and Skopje. Regarding the situation in Bosnia, he noted the positive changes that have come about over the past weeks and welcomed, in particular, the fact that humanitarian aid can be resumed. We shall calculate new needs in close collaboration with the UN High Commission for Refugees, he announced. Several of the MEPs [members of EP] taking the floor reproached Greece for its decision on the embargo against Skopje. Dutch Socialist Mr. Woltjer said he hoped the embargo would be lifted and that the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia would, for its part, modify its Constitution and its flag. Dutch Liberal Mr. Bertens found this decision "incomprehensible." Mr. Bertens also hoped that additional troops would be sent to UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] in order to extend the warning which worked in Sarajevo and other areas in Bosnia. Italian Green Alexandre Langer said the embargo against Skopje is "the least European, the least cooperative" thing imaginable: In these circumstances, he asked, what good is it to envisage a Pact on Stability in Europe? Several Members of the EP voiced concern about the aggressiveness of the ex-Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and fears about the inviolability of the frontiers between this country and Greece. Mr. Ephremidis (Left Unity) called Athens' decisions "constructive" and capable of obtaining positive results in the face of growing nationalism and Socialist Mr. Papoutsis said the Greek people support its government's decision and that, legally, Greece is acting within its rights since it acted on the basis of Article 224, which has been used by other countries on other occasions.
