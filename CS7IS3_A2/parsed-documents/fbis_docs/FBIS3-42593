What followed later was even more curious: "In order to make unlicensed shipments of weapons, the smugglers had drawn up phony documents for the pistols and ammunition, assigning them to the category of hunting and sporting items." Having read in the newspaper and heard on radio and television such information which, in its time frames, coincided with the visit of President B.N. Yeltsin to Tula and its defense enterprises, I immediately began to seek out the "guilty parties" among the weapons and ammunition makers. It turned out that, back in November, V. Shiryayev, the general manager of an ammunition plant, had sent a memorandum addressed to O. Soskovets: "Dear Oleg Nikolayevich. The AO [Joint-Stock Company] Tula Ammunition Plant is one of the largest producers of small-arms cartridges in Russia. As a result of conversion in the years 1989-1992, the output of various products has been curtailed by 50-100 percent. In order to find additional financial resources for conversion needs, in 1993, the company started producing sporting and hunting cartridges intended to be fired from Russian-made and foreign-made sports pistols: IZh-70, IZh-75, Parabellum, Brunner, Walther, Luger, and Beretta. Testing of the cartridges and their certification have been conducted in full conformity with the requirements of the standards and regulations of Gosstandart RF [Committee on Standardization, Metrology and Certification]. These cartridges are being produced solely for export shipments and conform to international specifications and world-class analogs." "The plant's specialists have studied the sales markets. As a result, contracts have been signed with the largest firms of the USA, Canada, Germany and Austria for the delivery in 1993-1994 of sporting and hunting ammunition in the amount of 350 million rounds at a price of $20 million, American." "At the present time, 10 million rounds have already been shipped to one of the American firms, which has sent us the end-use certificate issued by the U.S. State Department. However, as of 14 September, 1993, the shipping of sporting and hunting ammunition has been stopped at the request of the RF State Customs Committee [GTK RF]. Despite the authorization of the RF State Committee on the Defense Industry of 9 November 1993, and MVES RF [Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations] of 10 November 1993, the AO Tula Ammunition Plant is carrying out the exporting of sporting and hunting ammunition without licenses and without the approval of the RF State Customs Committee." "The company is incurring direct losses from the exporting ban in the amount of $275,600, and from the non-execution of contracts during the fourth quarter in the amount of $1,285,930." "I earnestly request that you instruct the State Customs Committee to give our company authorization to export sporting and hunting ammunition without having to obtain a license. This would make it possible not only to straighten out the enterprise's financial situation, to develop the production of products capable of competing in the world market, to maintain a mobilization potential and to retain highly skilled specialists, but also to enrich Russia's treasury significantly." Attached to the memorandum was an addendum: "In conformity with Decree No 854 of the RF Government of 6 November 1992, the exporting and importing of sport and hunting weapons and ammunition for them shall be carried out without a license from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, as well as on the basis of the RF Law "On Weapons" of 20 May, 1993 (Articles 5 and 17): "1. The Tula Ammunition Plant shall be authorized to export sporting and hunting ammunition... to do this without a license from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. "2. It shall be established that a decision on matters involving the exporting of sporting and hunting ammunition shall be made after the exporter has submitted to the RF Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations the contracts and their accompanying documents and they are examined by an Interdepartmental Council of the interested ministries. "I.S. Materov, RF deputy minister of foreign economic relations. "Yu.N. Starodub, deputy chairman of the RF State Committee on the Defense Industry." After familiarizing himself with these documents, O. Soskovets, first deputy chairman of the government, passes a resolution: "To the RF State Customs Committee (A.S. Kruglov), "I request that you consider and give approval within the framework of the existing legislation." This was on 7 December 1993. And, after a few days, the printed and electronic mass media informed the world about the fact that "contraband has been seized." "And who will have dealings with us after this?" V. Shiryayev asks with righteous indignation. "I do not know who would profit from bringing us to our knees. The government leaders are on our side. Even the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. The Main Rocket and Artillery Directorate has concluded that the cartridges we sold are not combat ones, but ones with lead cores. The entire world trades in such `slippery items.' For us, however -- this is a no-no! It is unthinkable that, in caring about the honor of the dress coat, any one should forget about its cleanliness." It is hard to disagree with one of the oldest and most experienced defense industry workers. It is fitting to recall that, in 1988, there was established in our country a powerful industry for the production of ammunition, which was equipped with unique domestic equipment automatic rotor and rotor-conveyor lines. As a result of conversion, the production of various types of cartridges has been curtailed by factors of 10-18, which has led to a sharp decrease in funds and the flight of skilled personnel. The specialists associate the retreat from traditional sales markets precisely with the production cutback. In order to look for practical ways of preventing the sector's collapse, it is necessary to engage in selling ammunition for civilian use abroad. We have entered a market which is the most promising and prestigious for Russia -- the USA, where, annually, the retail trade network sells from 9 to 14 million rounds of ammunition, which are produced not only by American firms, but are also imported from China, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland. While our cartridges remain out of the running. But, apparently, someone does not like this: he says, let the ammunition makers continue to produce bicycle chains, photo enlargers, toys and thermoses. Let them cram the warehouses with finished products. Let a mighty sector perish. It turns out that, now, even the arguments of the president of Russia may be ignored. Not to mention the first deputy prime minister.
