FR940325-2-00243 FR940325-2-00115 Part I_General Information A. Background Section 201 of the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (Public Law 95&hyph;608, 25 U.S.C. 1931) authorizes the Secretary to make grants to Indian tribes to establish and operate on-reservation Indian child and family service programs for the purpose of stabilizing and preventing the breakup of Indian families and, in particular, to ensure that the permanent removal of an Indian child from the custody of his/her Indian parent or custodian shall be an action of last resort; and to prepare and implement child welfare codes (25 U.S.C. 1902; 25 U.S.C. 1931). It is the policy of the BIA to emphasize and facilitate the comprehensive design, development and implementation of Indian child and family service programs in coordination with other Federal, state, local, and tribal programs which strengthen and preserve Indian families and Indian tribes. Thus, tribes operating BIA contracted social services programs or related programs under the auspices of a tribal-state agreement are encouraged to design their ICWA programs/activities to integrate with or complement existing child and family service programs. This announcement provides information on the FY 1994 ICWA grant application process for eligible Indian tribes, and initiates the noncompetitive distribution of ICWA grant funds to tribes. To access FY 1994 ICWA grant funds, all tribes, including those who have negotiated self-governance compact agreements, must submit a three-year (FY 1994&hyph;FY 1996) application and program plan. Once a tribe's application and program plan are approved by the respective Area Director or Agency Superintendent in accordance with 25 CFR 23.43, continued annual funding of the tribe's ICWA program for FY 1995 and FY 1996 will be contingent upon annual appropriations, receipt of a satisfactory program evaluation from the area's social services office for the previous year of operation, and submission of an annual budget and budget narrative justification statement in accordance with 25 CFR 23.23(b)(7). At the beginning of FY 1995 and thereafter, the distribution of ICWA grant funds to tribal governments will coincide with the Federal Government's fiscal year cycle. Thus, eligible Indian tribes will continuously access their recurring ICWA funds in the tribal priority allocation (TPA) part of the tribe's budget system.
