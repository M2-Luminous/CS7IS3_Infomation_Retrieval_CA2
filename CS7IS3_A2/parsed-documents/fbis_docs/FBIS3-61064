The document calls for reciprocal consultations in matters of security, defense planning and strategy. It calls for the exchange of know-how and information, and visits by officials and officers. The DETA agency reports that the two countries will develop programs for the education and practical training of servicemen and work out other matters jointly. Denmark is the first NATO country with which Latvia has signed such an agreement, but 32 Lithuanian officers have already begun training in officer courses at a Danish military school. Representatives of the main subdivisions of the national defense service--the field army, state border guard service, naval forces and civil defense department--have been sent to attend the courses.
