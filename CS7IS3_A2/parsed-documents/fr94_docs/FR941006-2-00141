FR941006-2-00141 FR941006-2-00099 General Aviation and Vertical Flight Technology Program Office Meeting on Rotorcraft Local Differential Global Positioning System (GPS) Precision Approach Project AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of meeting. SUMMARY: The FAA is issuing this notice to advise the public to a meeting being conducted by the FAA's General Aviation and Vertical Flight Technology Program Office to address issues necessary to proceed with a rotorcraft local differential global positioning system (GPS) precision approach project. This project's primary focus will be to establish instrument criteria based upon: (1) Aircraft systems for reduced pilot workload, improved cockpit instrumentation, enhanced low-speed aircraft handling characteristics, and especially, (2) precision guidance capabilities of local differential GPS. The FAA, as part of this project, intends to establish a joint government/industry research and development team to fully address pertinent vertical flight issues associated with local differential GPS precision approach capabilities and requirements. DATES: The meeting will be November 30 and December 1, 1994 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. ADDRESSES: The meeting will be held at the Stouffer Concourse Hotel, 9801 Natural Bridge Road, Saint Louis, Missouri 63134, telephone (314) 429&hyph;1100, fax (314) 429&hyph;3625.
