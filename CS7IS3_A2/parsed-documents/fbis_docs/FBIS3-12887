In an article published today, the paper adds: Despite the fact that the U.S. position on the embargo has remained unchanged, as attested to by the recent report Clinton submitted to the U.S. Congress, there has been a change in the French and British positions on the embargo. AL-JUMHURIYAH adds: The French position is showing signs of change, as manifested in the Iraqi-French political and oil talks and the statements made by the French foreign minister, in which he said that there is a strong likelihood of Iraq resuming its oil exports shortly. The paper goes on to say: Despite the fact that the British position on the embargo is still close to the U.S. position, there has been a noticeable watering down of the intransigent anti-Iraq rhetoric used by British officials. As for Russia and the PRC, they are sympathetic to the efforts to lift the embargo imposed on Iraq. AL-JUMHURIYAH says: These indications, coupled with Iraq's cooperation and its implementation of the provisions enshrined in the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, underscore the need to lift the embargo, because there are no justifications for maintaining it. The paper concludes by saying: The continuation of the embargo means that Washington is implementing the most dangerous chapter of its grand anti-Iraq conspiracy, and that it is working to stifle Iraq; and this is something the Iraqi people oppose and will never accept.
