The statement was made during a visit by Major General Nasr Yusuf, commander of the Palestinian security forces in the Gaza Strip, to a number of Islamic centers in the area and his meeting with a number of Hamas officials. During this visit, Maj. Gen. Yusuf expressed his readiness to cooperate on several issues with the Palestinian Authority. In this regard, Shaykh Ahmad Bahr, head of the Islamic Society, clarified the Islamic Movement's position under the Palestinian Authority, and dealt with the issue of the collection of weapons from the members of the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions. He said: Neither Hamas nor its military wing will agree to surrender any of the weapons they collected over a period of many years as long as arms-carrying settlers remain inside the Gaza Strip. He also explained that the self-rule agreement does not compel Hamas to respond to everything contained in it, because Hamas does not accept self-rule. Referring to the issue of enlistment in the Palestinian police force, Shaykh Bahr said Hamas has not directed its members to enlist in the Palestinian police.
