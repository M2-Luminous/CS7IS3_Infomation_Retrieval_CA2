According to him, if the upper chamber of Russia's parliament resolves this issue positively, military aircraft will start lifting Russian peace-keepers to the conflict area on Wednesday. There are plans to despatch 5 Russian battalions to the conflict zone. The number of "blue helmets" is to total 25 to 30 hundred men. This week General Kondratyev visited Abkhazia and inspected the locality, where the disengagement of the conflicting sides is to take place along the River Inguri. "The military have already done all they could to ensure success for the proposed peace-keeping operation," he told Interfax on Saturday.
