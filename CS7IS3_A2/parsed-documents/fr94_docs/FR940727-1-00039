FR940727-1-00039 FR940727-1-00014 Finally, the Agency requests comments on other alternatives that still achieve the overall RCRA goal of protection of human health and the environment. EPA is interested in data on the benefits, costs, and legal authority for any alternatives and the Agency will consider such options. B. Universal Waste Management System 1. Background On February 11, 1993, EPA proposed a streamlined, reduced regulatory management structure for certain widely-generated hazardous wastes currently subject to full RCRA Subtitle C regulation, in an effort to facilitate their collection and proper management (the ``universal wastes'' proposal, 58 FR 8102). The proposed reduced regulatory structure, known as a special collection system, is designed to ensure that management of these hazardous wastes is conducted in a manner that is protective of human health and the environment, given the diffuse and diverse population of generators of these wastes. See the February 11, 1993 preamble discussion, for a detailed discussion of the proposal. The general waste types that EPA believes may be appropriately managed under this streamlined regulatory structure are known as ``universal wastes'' and share several characteristics. These wastes: •Are frequently generated in a wide variety of settings other than the industrial settings usually associated with hazardous wastes; •Are generated by a vast community, the size of which poses implementation difficulties for both those who are regulated and the regulatory agencies charged with implementing the hazardous waste program; and •May be present in significant volumes in the municipal waste stream. The February 11, 1993, proposal included specific regulatory text addressing the management of two waste types; hazardous waste batteries, and suspended and/or canceled hazardous waste pesticides that are recalled. The proposal also included a petition process and a set of criteria to be used to determine whether it would be appropriate to add additional waste types to the special collection system in the future. Several waste types such as automotive antifreeze, paint application wastes, and mercury-containing items such as thermostats and thermometers were discussed as possible additions to the Universal Waste proposal, also referred to as the special collection system. 2. Universal Waste System Alternative for Lamps In the February 11, 1993, proposal EPA mentioned fluorescent lamps (58 FR 8110), explaining that the Agency was examining the risks of managing these wastes in landfills and requesting data on the risks of various management methods for these wastes. Comments received in response to that request are included in the docket for this proposal. The Agency will respond to these comments in the final rule together with those submitted in response to Today's proposal. The Agency is requesting comment on using the proposed special collection system for the management of spent lamps as another approach to the management of mercury-containing lamps. The Agency has not yet promulgated a final universal waste rule but anticipates doing so in the near future. Should EPA select the universal waste option for lamps as a final rule, the Agency will ensure consistency with the more comprehensive universal waste final rule. The Agency believes that spent lamps may appropriately be considered ``universal wastes'' in that they are generated in a wide variety of settings, are generated by a very large number of generators, and are present in significant volumes in the municipal waste stream. The special collection system approach may be an appropriate option for addressing the collection phase of managing lamps that are hazardous waste. The special collection system approach (which is consistent with the February 11, 1993 proposal), would not change any of the requirements applicable to the ultimate treatment and disposal or recycling of any wastes collected, but would minimize the regulatory requirements applicable to collection of these wastes (i.e., generation, transportation, and intermediate storage/consolidation) for proper management. Special collection system regulations also could remove some existing barriers to management of hazardous waste lamps under the Subtitle C system by reducing the technical and paperwork requirements applicable to collection, thus making collection more efficient and economical. At the same time, management requirements included in special collection system regulations could be designed to minimize the hazards posed in collection of these wastes (e.g., special packaging could be required to minimize the risk of breakage).
