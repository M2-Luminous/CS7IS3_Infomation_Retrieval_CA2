"In all my years as a detective, even while working in the drug squad, I have never treated anybody in this manner, not even a prostitute," he said. Flanked by two legal representatives at his Pretoria home yesterday, General Smit said he had a good idea of the identity of the mysterious Mr Q, the key witness who gave evidence to the Goldstone commission against three top generals. The generals were waiting for a senior advocate to come back to them before taking legal action. General Smit, one of a number of officers suspended yesterday, denied claims before the Goldstone commission that he had overseen the manufacture and distribution of weapons to Inkatha. "Not in a million years would it be possible, practical or true that I would get involved in deliberately destabilising my country. It is utter nonsense," he said. "I am not a man who deals in allegations. I deal in facts. The Goldstone report refers to `information', but `information' is not proof. No court will convict a man on the strength of `information'". This is exactly what is upsetting him: he was put on mandatory leave and a shadow was cast over his career, without him being able to respond to the allegations made against him. He went through his copy of the report paragraph by paragraph. Notes in the margins say: "Nonsense", "no proof", "hearsay allegations". The only allegation put to him when he and generals Johan le Roux and Krappies Englebrecht went to see the Goldstone commission on Wednesday was that he had been involved in smuggling guns to the IFP. He went to the commission without legal representation and answered all question openly. "It was only later that I learned from General Englebrecht that I was also accused of manufacturing weapons and training IFP members in the handling of guns," he said. "Until this day, I am not sure of the commands I was supposed to have given or what exactly I am accused of." General Smit also denied he had been involved in giving golden handshakes to former members of the notorious Vlakplaas unit to buy their silence. Retirement packages were a political decision, and he had offered to provide the commission with a memorandum to prove his innocence. The document was written by General le Roux and General Engelbrecht, and approved by the commissioner of police, General Johan van der Merwe, and the minister. General Smit was shocked to learn of the drastic measures Mr de Klerk had taken against him, and the reference that the generals would have been arrested if proof could be found was difficult to swallow for a policeman who had been in the force for almost 40 years. General Smit did not think the president would be influenced to such a degree by a mere "skenderstorie" (gossip). General le Roux said in an interview at his office yesterday he was completely astonished by the report. When he spoke to the commission, no allegations were made to him and he had answered all questions openly. An allegation that he had ordered the killing of a certain Maponya had been dealt with at a judicial inquest and by the Harms commission, without any incriminating evidence being found against him.
