Lima, who is 76 years old, said telephone calls had been received over the last few hours warning him of an attack on his home. Lima and coalition presidential candidate Ruben Zamora said during a news conference that the calls were made to an office of the former Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) guerrillas and to the home of party coordinator Shafik Handal. The vice presidential hopeful recalled that Jose Maria Mendez, a lawyer friend, was threatened a few months ago with an attack against his wife if he did not help convince Lima to give up his FMLN candidacy. Lima, an attorney and successful businessman, expressed concern over these events, especially after the police increased his security because "if they are worried, it is only natural that I should be worried; it is me they want to see buried." Ruben Zamora said that in addition to the threats against Lima, FMLN radio repeaters in San Salvador and the Chinchontepec Volcanoes were sabotaged over the last few days, which "does not contribute to the atmosphere of peace" that should prevail during the elections. Zamora, who is 52 years old, will compete for the presidency for the second time against the ruling ARENA party candidate.
