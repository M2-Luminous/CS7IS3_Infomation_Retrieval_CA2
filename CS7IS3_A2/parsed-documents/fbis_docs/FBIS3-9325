It has been the first visit at this level since Slovenia became independent. The sides reviewed bilateral relations and expressed a desire to build a legal basis for contacts, Daskalov said. In Ljubljana he met with his counterpart Lojze Peterle and was received by President Milan Kucan, Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek and Parliament Chairman Herman Rigelnik. The foreign ministers signed an agreement on cooperation in culture, education and science. Daskalov said that a trade agreement and probably an investment promotion agreement would be signed in Sofia in April. Agreements on double taxation relief and transport cooperation are also expected to be signed in the near future. The two countries hold similar views on the crisis in the former Yugoslavia and the efforts of Bulgaria and Slovenia to become integrated into Europe, according to Daskalov. He said the two countries would open talks on establishing a free trade zone, perhaps during the visit here by Slovenia's Minister for Foreign Economic Relations Davorin Kracun on April 20, according to the Bulgarian foreign minister.
