"We have to get a deal because otherwise the whole process of EU enlargement is threatened," Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jacques Poos said ahead of the third effort in less than three weeks to break the impasse. The enlargement process was being held up by the demand of Britain and Spain that the entry of more small countries into the Union should not dilute the ability of London and Madrid to block decisions they do not like. British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said he was not optimistic. "There is nothing on the table at the moment that satisfies the general concerns of the people of Britain," he said. The ministers were also debating a dispute between Spain and Norway over fishing catch quotas which threatens to stop Norway from entering the Union on January 1 next year. Austria, Finland and Sweden finally agreed on their terms of membership for joining the EU on March 1. The EU's negotiations with Oslo are still blocked by Spain's demand for access to Norway's fish-rich waters. Diplomats expect that the fishing issue will be resolved more easily than the voting rights dispute, and that Norway and Spain's EU partners might buy off the Spanish opposition to Norwegian membership with more fish. But Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana said there were no new proposals to break the balance of power deadlock, which hinges on the effect of enlargement on the EU's delicately-balanced system of majority voting.
