Vivekanand] [Text] Amman--A German vessel denied entry to al-'Aqabah was on its way Wednesday [23 March] to another port in the Red Sea to unload part of its cargo to meet the demands of the U.S.-led enforcers of the international sanctions against Iraq, shipping officials said. The 1300-tonne Skyman, carrying 3,000-tonnes of general cargo for Jordan, is the second al-'Aqabah-bound vessel to be turned away this month and the seventh to be intercepted and delayed this year, said Sufyan Muhaysin, manager of the Jordan Shipping Agents Association. The Red Sea Energy, operated by a consortium of British, German and French companies, was turned away last week after the inspectors found two 20-feet containers carrying zinc phosphorate for Iraq. The inspectors' decision came despite documents attending U.N. Sanctions Committee approval for the consignment of the chemical, used in the detergent industry, shipping sources said. As a rule, anything classified as "chemicals" comes under close scrutiny of the inspectors. In many cases, entry to al-'Aqabah is categorically denied. The interceptions came against intensified moves by the government to alleviate the negative impact of the sanctions enforcement on Jordan's economy and a call by Parliament for the Kingdom to refuse to return to the American backed Arab-Israeli peace talks until the "siege of al-'Aqabah" is lifted. Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani told reporters after talks with U.S. Middle East peace coordinator Dennis Ross late Tuesday that Mr. Ross had promised to consider Jordan's grievances over the continuing blockade, which is severely hampering the Kingdom's maritime operations and trade. The stepped-up interceptions of ships entering the Gulf of Aqaba come amid follow-up efforts to a proposal to move the inspection of cargo to the port from the Iran Straits where it is taking place new. The proposal was expected to have been discussed by Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali and Dr. al-'Anani during their meeting with Mr. Ross. Under the proposal, an independent international agency, most probably Lloyd Register of London, will inspect all incoming and outgoing cargo at the port for violations of the international sanctions against Iraq instead of the multinational naval task force led by American warships now patrolling the Red Sea. Contacts are continuing among Jordanian, American and U.N. officials as well as representatives of Lloyd Register on various aspects of the proposed arrangement, sources said. However, no one could provide any definite information as to the progress achieved. Independent land-based inspections by an international agency, from the Jordanian viewpoint, will remove all hurdles that ship owners cite to justify higher freight charges to and from al-'Aqabah to buffet extra costs incurred as a result of the delays caused by inspections at sea. At present, Jordanian importers pay $500 per 20-feet container and $1,000 per 40-feet container over and above the regular freight charges to al-'Aqabah. The surcharge for non-containerised cargo is around $15 per tonne. In addition are extra costs paid by importers to bring their cargo to al-'Aqabah if the original ships carrying them are forced to off load them at other Red Sea ports. "Cargo inaccessibility," one of the main reasons cited by the inspectors for turning ships away from al-'Aqabah, was also the reason for the Skyman being denied entry to al-'Aqabah despite efforts by the crew of the ship to rearrange cargo for inspection. Ibrahim Nauri, an official of the agents of the vessel, said inspectors boarded the Skyman four times between Saturday and Tuesday before refusing it permission to proceed to al-'Aqabah. Mr. Muhaysin said the Skyman and the Red Sea Energy were the third and fourth ships to be turned away from al-'Aqabah since the beginning of the year, the two others came back after unloading or rearranging cargo for inspection. The crew of three other vessels managed to rearrange cargo while at sea to satisfy the inspectors' demands, he said. According to U.S. Navy figures, the naval task force, which is now supported by four American warships, has queried 19,800 ships over radio, boarded more than 8000 for closer checks, and turned away 450 since it took up station following the imposition of the sanctions against Iraq in August 1990.
