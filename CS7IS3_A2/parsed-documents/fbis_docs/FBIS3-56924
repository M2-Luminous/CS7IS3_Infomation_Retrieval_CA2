Yegorov is blamed for arbitrary actions by his subordinates during the recent arrest in Minsk of the former Lithuanian communist party leaders Mykolas Burokevicius and Juozas Jermalavicius. Police arrested the two men without a sanction from the Prosecutor General. Shirkovskiy is accused of office abuse. The commission believes that as the KGB chief he had to control the situation. A group of lawmakers also demanded that the Prosecutor General Vasiliy Sholodonov step down. Meanwhile, as has transpired from a dependable source, the Lithuanian side intends to formally press for the extradition of General Vladimir Uskhopchik, the former Vilnius garrison chief during the events in Lithuania's capital in January of 1991. Uskhopchik now commands a unit of the 5th Belarussian army corps, headquartered at Bobruisk.
