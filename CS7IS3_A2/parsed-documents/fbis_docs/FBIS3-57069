This was announced at a news conference given by Vytautas Petkevicius, chairman of the Seimas National Security Committee. According to him, all the reports in the newspapers RESPUBLIKA and LIETUVOS RYTAS on the purchase of helicopters and warships are correct. Petkevicius said that everything will be decided by the court, but he is convinced that many machinations and the creation of various closed joint stock companies have harmed (?the litas). He also stressed that there are people with two or three previous convictions serving in military units. According to the law, they should not be given arms. Speaking about the main tasks facing the Seimas National Security Committee, Vytautas Petkevicius mentioned the conclusion of the creation of the army legal base [as heard], the handing over of border protection duties to the border police, and the creation of the national security service. According to him, the national security service has been neglected but is now in the embryo stage. Meanwhile, Lithuania has become a hotbed of espionage. Both the East and West are spying, and Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and Western experts know more about the Lithuanian Army than its commanders, Petkevicius claimed. Petkevicius refused to dwell further on the activity of foreign special services, saying that he has no right to do this. Speaking about the arrest of Mykolas Burokevicius and Juozas Jermalavicius, he stressed that due to rumors by some Lithuanian officials in describing events on the border [as heard], the Belorusian minister of internal affairs and the procurator general have suffered a great deal.
