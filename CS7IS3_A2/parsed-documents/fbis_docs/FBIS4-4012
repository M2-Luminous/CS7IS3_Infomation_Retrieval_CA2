Li made the statement to about five hundred business people in Kazakhstan, the last of four Central Asian countries he has visited in the past nine days. The six principles are as follows: Firstly, cooperation should be based on equality and mutual benefit, and conducted according to the economic law. In specific terms, the two sides should help supply each other's needs, stick to the principle of exchange at equal values, and maintain balance of trade, which should be regularized. The setting up of joint ventures should benefit both or all parties, with the purpose to help develop the national economies of relevant countries. Secondly, cooperation should be developed in diversified forms. While exchange of commodities takes up a big portion in bilateral trade at present, cash payment represents the trend of development. For that, means of banking settlement need to be improved. Also, the Chinese Government fully agrees with the Central Asian nations' hope to develop economic cooperation with different parts of China, in addition to the nearby Xinjiang Autonomous Region. Thirdly, economic cooperation should proceed from the actual conditions, with full use of local resources. Also, market prospect should be taken into full consideration from the very beginning of joint ventures, which need to bring in good economic returns with competitive products. Fourthly, communications and transportation need to be improved, with a view to building up a new "Silk Road." China and Kazakhstan have reached an important agreement in this regard. The two sides should strive to ensure smooth traffic through the Euro-Asia continental bridge, to bring benefits to all countries concerned. Fifthly, the small amount of economic assistance China has provided the Central Asian nations within its means is only a symbol of friendship from the people of China, which itself remains a developing country and faces an arduous task of economic development. Sixthly, China is willing to develop multi-lateral cooperation to promote common development. China's open policy is meant for the developing countries as well as the developed nations, particularly the neighboring countries. While China will work for the expansion of cooperation with the Central Asian nations, it is also willing to see the growth of their trade, economic cooperation and friendly contact with other countries. China is ready to participate in equal and fair competition. "China seeks no spheres of economic or political influence in Central Asia," he asserted, in ending the speech.
