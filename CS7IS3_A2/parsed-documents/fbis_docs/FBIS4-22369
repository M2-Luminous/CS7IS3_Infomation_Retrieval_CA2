The procuracy organs have investigated, brought charges, and handed over to the courts a number of criminal cases initiated in connection with thefts. For instance, in 1993 the City of Dilizhan Procuracy checked the system of bread supply for the population and uncovered abuses that existed in this area. Taking advantage of lack of control in the bread supply system and accounting lapses, Lianna Akopyan, purchaser-shipper of the city trade administration--a financially liable person--submitted false trade and transportation invoices and forged and altered documents, stealing 119,766 units of bread for a total amount of 1,773,722 rubles [R]. When on leave, L. Akopyan also managed to arrange for her son to formally replace her as purchaser-shipper and, putting together falsified documents under his signature as well, stole another 15,233 units of bread totalling R495,057. L. Akopyan was charged under Part 4 of Article 60 and Article 187 of the Republic of Armenia Criminal Code, and chief accountant A. Kazaryan--under Article 184 of the Republic of Armenia Criminal Code. In the course of the preliminary investigation, damages to the state in the amount of R2,268,779 have been reimbursed. The City of Dilizhan People's Court sentenced L. Akopyan to a prison term, and A. Kazaryan to correctional labor. * * * Using the fact that the Armmolprom Association, in order to ensure uninterrupted operation of facilities vitally important for the population in the environment of a fuel and energy crisis, permitted milk plants to purchase fuel for cash, the administration of the Akhuryansk milk plant, for the purpose of meeting its own fuel needs, issued from its cash reserves in 1993 in two separate authorizations R622,462 to Gurgen Petrosyan, a person authorized to make purchases of liquid fuel. The latter appropriated the money, and in order to create the illusion that fuel had been purchased, filled the storage tanks with 8,935 liters of water. In addition, he appropriated 1,268 liters of fuel that belonged to the plant and in order to cover the tracks of the crime left open the faucet of the storage tank, through which about [number missing] liters of gasoline remaining in it spilled out. Petrosyan's criminal actions caused R748,000 in damage to the state. He was charged under Part 4 of Article 90 of the Republic of Armenia Criminal Code. In the course of preliminary investigation the damages to the state were completely reimbursed. * * * Ostensibly with the purpose of organizing production and processing animal husbandry products, in 1991 Robert Avetisyan signed a contract with Artashat sovkhoz on leasing two barnyards. It transpired later that this contract provided him with a basis for obtaining and appropriating a bank loan. An operating account for R31,000 in short-term credit was opened in the Artashat branch of the Republic of Armenia Joint-Stock Commercial Bank. The next day R. Avetisyan transferred this money to the Savings Bank as designated for G. Apikyan and E. Mkhitaryan--ostensibly in payment for cattle purchased from them, and received this money and appropriated it. In May, R. Avetisyan, under the guise of paying wages, received a short-term loan for R19,500 in the Artashat branch of Agrobank, and another R42,000 in July, ostensibly to pay for cattle purchased. He also appropriated this money. Continuing his criminal activities, by falsifying documents over the period 1991-1993, R. Avetisyan received from the state in the form of loans and appropriated R992,132. R. Avetisyan was charged under Part 4 of Article 90 of the Republic of Armenia Criminal Code. The damage to the state has been reimbursed, and R. Avetisyan has been sentenced to a long prison term by the court collegium for criminal matters of the Republic of Armenia Supreme Court. * * * Charges under Part 4 of Article 90 of Republic of Armenia Criminal Code have been brought against Silve Agadzhanyan, warehouse director at the Yerevan ethyl alcohol plant. Taking advantage of lax plant security with respect to material goods, over the period July-September 1993 she stole R751,680 worth of acetic acid from material goods entrusted to her. The stolen goods were discovered and confiscated. S. Agadzhanyan's case was referred to the Republic of Armenia Supreme Court with a petition to refer it to the court.
