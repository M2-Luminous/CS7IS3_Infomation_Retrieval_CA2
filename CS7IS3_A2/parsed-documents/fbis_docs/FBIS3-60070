This claim was made yesterday by the Federal Judicial Police first commander, Javier Norona Guerrero. He declared: "People are complaining that there is no money, because the traffickers have stopped circulating their cash through various establishments." Norona remarked that drug shipments through the region are no longer large, since dealers now prefer to risk only small quantities of their merchandise. According to information obtained by the commander, towns such as Nuevo Casas Grandes, Janos, and Ascencion have lost business in jewelry and discotheque establishments. Although to a lesser extent, Ciudad Juarez also has felt the effects of the battle against the drug traffic, because money laundering has declined, according to the commander. He declared: "Drug dealing has been reduced and, in some towns, businesses are operating with very little money too, because of the lack of drug traffic." Norona presumes that the investments made by drug traffickers will decrease, and remain at low levels during the coming months, as a result of a battle that has been started to curb them. The operation called "Blockade Against Drugs and Weapons" provided for investigative and surveillance work by Federal and State Judicial Police [PJE] agents who, since its initiation, have been combing highways and villages in the northern Chihuahua region by air and land. Official reports obtained yesterday by the Sub-Agency of the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic [PGR] indicated that, within just four days (1-4 December), the operation made it possible to seize 400 kg of marijuana. The Federal Police commander declared: "We are hitting the drug traffic very hard, and this will continue." Norona took office as first commander in mid-November, after the PGR's representative in the state, Teresa Jardi, charged that the battle against the drug traffic had failed because of corrupt acts on the part of the previous commander. Norona commented: "The volume of drugs that we seized early this month will be tripled before we finish." In Nuevo Casas Grandes, a town that has seen the proliferation of shopping centers, discotheques, and jewelry shops in less than 10 years, the drug traffic has stopped injecting stratospheric volumes of capital, according to the commander. Norona claims that the clearest sign that the same thing is about to occur in Ciudad Juarez is the fact that large drug shipments have stopped passing through that town during recent weeks.
