Speakers at the rallies branded the introduction into South Korea of Patriot by the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean ruling quarters as an outrageous challenge to the desire of the entire Korean nation for peace and denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, as an unpardonable nation-annihilating act to provoke a nuclear war by intentionally straining the situation. They warned that though they are bringing dark clouds of a nuclear war to this land, the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets should clearly know that the Korean people are never afraid of a war. The speakers declared that the Korean people and revolutionary Armed Forces, rallied rock-firm behind Supreme Commander General Kim Chong-il, would make a thousand-fold retaliation against the aggressors, annihilating them at a stroke, if they dare to provoke the socialist motherland of Korea.
