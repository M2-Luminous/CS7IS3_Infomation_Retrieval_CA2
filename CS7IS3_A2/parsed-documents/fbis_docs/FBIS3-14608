The book slanders and lies about all prophets, especially Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, and members of his family. The delegation told the ambassador that giving the award to Rushdie is a deliberate hostile action and is considered a challenge to the feelings of Muslims. The delegation said this was what U.S. President Bill Clinton had done when he invited Salman Rushdie to go to the United States from Britain, received him at the White House, and encouraged him to continue his anti-Islam and Muslims march. The delegation added that the Austrian Government had committed a serious action, one which influences its relations and friendship with the Arab and Islamic states. At the end of the meeting, the ambassador promised to convey the memorandum to his government.
