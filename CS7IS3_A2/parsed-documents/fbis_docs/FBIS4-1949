It was put forward at the conference that supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels should adopt every possible way and means to broaden their business and service fields, to extensively open markets at home and abroad, to enliven their operation, to enhance their management, and to increase economic results so as to extricate themselves from a difficult position as soon as possible and to get on a track of healthy development. It was contended at the conference that although the supply and marketing cooperatives across the province had played an inestimable role in developing the rural economy, the difficulties they are facing are very serious. In particular, the rate of supply and marketing cooperatives at the grass-roots level of rural areas, which are suffering losses, surpasses 80 percent. These cooperatives at all levels must further do a good job in conducting reforms with the combination of control and decontrol and the enforcement of contracting system as its mainstay. They should break away from their traditional business structure and operation pattern and bring about a change to their operation model of large or small and all-embracing. They should actively bring in the modern styles and methods of business and sales, such as conducting overall sales on commission, acting as an agent, and combining operation between industry and commerce. They should also engage in specialized and standardized business so as to seek a new way for their development.
