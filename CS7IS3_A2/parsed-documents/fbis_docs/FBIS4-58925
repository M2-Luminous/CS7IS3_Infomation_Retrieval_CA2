This group is composed of 600 officers, non-commissioned officers, and other ranks. Palestinian Ambassador in Amman al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim said these forces' entry at the al-Ruwayshid border post came at the request of the Palestinian leadership. His Majesty King Husayn ordered that all necessary facilities be provided to these forces during their stay on Jordanian territory, and that they be treated as the guests of the Jordanian Armed Forces, which will equip and arm them. In a statement to the JORDANIAN NEWS AGENCY, the ambassador added that both Jordan's permission for this group to enter Jordanian territory and the provision of the necessary assistance to them are definitive proof of the true and profound fraternity between the sisterly Jordanian and Palestinian peoples and their common fate. Moreover, this confirms the eagerness of the Hashemite leadership, represented by His Majesty King Husayn, to enable the sons of the Palestinian people to achieve their national objectives on their national soil under the leadership of the PLO. This group was welcomed by representatives from the Jordanian Armed Forces and by the Palestinian military attache at the Palestinian Embassy in Amman. In another development, 'Abd-al-Rahim said the Palestinian police forces' entry into Gaza and Jericho areas is linked to the announcment of the formation of the Palestinian national authority. The Palestinian leadership is continuing its meetings in the Tunisian capital to officially form this authority, he added. The Palestinian ambassador attributed the delay in the Palestinian police forces' entry into Gaza and Jericho areas today to technical reasons linked to the Israeli procedures concerning these forces' weapons. He explained that contacts are continuing in this regard between the heads of the Palestinian and Israeli negotiating delegations, Sha'th and Shahaq.
