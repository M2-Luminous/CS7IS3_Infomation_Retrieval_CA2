Good evening. Thank you for finding time after your long meeting in the Presidential Palace to come here to explain the circumstances under which this meeting took place and, of course, the whole story of the signing ceremony in Geneva tomorrow. First of all, at their meeting today Croatia's state and political leadership and 140 representatives of the Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina discussed the implementation of the Washington Agreement. What is your impression of the meeting? It went on for quite a long time. Does that mean that there were disagreements? [Prlic] It was a frank meeting. First of all, various views were voiced. But, in my view, not for a moment did the meeting question the existing policy of the Croatian Democratic Union [HDZ] and its implementation, the policy embodied above all in the Croat republic of Herzeg-Bosna and, by implication, in the concern for all the Croats who continue to live beyond the borders of the Croat republic of Herzeg-Bosna but remain the concern of the relevant bodies in the Croat republic of Herzeg-Bosna. As I said, the talks were frank and ended in an atmosphere of support for the Washington Federation Agreement. Of course, there were various views on the maps as published yesterday, or rather the day before yesterday. This is understandable, one day after the event every new version, every new map provokes different reactions depending on the location. However, when all this was seen in the context of realizing the Croatian interest in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the interests of all Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and in view of the opportunities the agreement will give to the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the conclusion was reached that, nevertheless, this agreement will help to realize the fundamental goals of the Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Announcer] I can see that you have stubbornly and tendentiously been insisting on saying the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. Does it exist and will it exist, and to what extent does what you call the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna correspond territorially to the maps agreed upon in Vienna? [Prlic] I have not been tendentious in any way. One can, without being tendentious, speak about something, about what he wants to do.... [Announcer, interrupting] I mean, you deliberately placed stress on that. [Prlic] In the areas under the control of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] the people and all refugees from other areas are being born and die as citizens of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. Birth and death certificates, the flag--in other words, the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna is a reality, it is an instrument that has made it possible for us to attain the goal that we have just achieved. The Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna is a state mechanism that helps to secure the care, the logistics, wages for HVO units and fighters, tens of thousands of them, for the police of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, for all those employed in education, in primary and secondary schools, the University of Mostar, health workers, pensions. [passage omitted] [Announcer] When you speak about the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, do you also include the two so-called mixed cantons? [Prlic] The Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna will continue to exist until the agreement on the federation between Bosniak Muslims and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina is implemented. We will not allow a vacuum in this process. Life must go on, daily needs must be met, and we are here to remain to the end. Later, this will be transformed into the authorities in individual counties and mixed cantons, and in the methods as agreed in the agreement on the Constitution. [Announcer] When you said that the meeting in the Presidential Palace was frank, that differing views were put forward, I expect that among these differing views the most controversial one was the mixed, so called Mostar-Neretva Canton.... [Prlic, interrupting] And the canton of Central Bosnia. [Announcer] This came as a surprise to the people of Herceg-Bosna. [Prlic] Well, in some way it did. But in view of the alternatives, I consider this solution a better one. It is a guarantee to both the Croat and the Bosniak Muslim people that they will be able to exercise parity within the two mixed cantons of Central Bosnia, and the area from Konjic to the point where Bosnia-Herzegovina has access to sea, i.e. Neum. I think that what is ahead of us are different forms of struggle. No, not a struggle, but of a normal life of fighting to realize one's national rights, language and all that stems from it, economic goals. More prominence will have to be given to willingness, common sense, ability, more than is the case in war. In other words, capability will have to be given more prominence. [Announcer] Listening here in Zagreb to the voices coming from Herzegovina, it seems that the people there are most surprised by the fact that Medjugorje and Citluk [predominantly Croat towns in western Herzegovina] come under one of the mixed cantons. [Prlic] So what? [Announcer] Well, I do not know. The people seem to be worried about it. Are you saying they have no reason to be? [Prlic] Well, the people are worried. The first reaction was, why is Citluk, which in addition to Grude is the most Croatian of all municipalities including Croatia, and former Yugoslavia, within the mixed canton. However, Citluk will remain Citluk, Medjugorje will remain Medjugorje, the Virgin Mary [vision of her reported in Medjugorje] and everything connected with her will remain there, and I cannot see why being in the mixed canton should threaten it in any way. [Announcer] Let us now take a look at this other Croatian canton, the Bosnian Posavina Canton. It seems to me that the proposal for its size is rather generous--it is based on the census of 1990, but most of the territory of this canton is controlled by Serb units. In your opinion, what will happen to this corridor that seems to be of exceptional importance to the Serbs. Should it be severed in some way or not? [Prlic] This is a matter of political consent. We heard from Geneva today about this agreement between the foreign ministers on the division of the total territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina--51 percent for the Bosniak Muslim-Croat federation, that is 49 percent for the Serbs, which I do not believe will be the final version. I think there are many other options involved in this game, and that we have still not found the definitive solution. What we now have in Bosnian Posavina was a lasting objective of ours....[pauses] Those who said: Look at all the refugees, we have lost something, when will this be returned....[pauses] I primarily value the opinions of those who invested something in this because war always has its own laws that differ considerably from those in peacetime. I believe that the Bosnian Posavina people have the right and opportunity to return to their homes, although this will be very difficult to accomplish through political dialogue. However, we should not disregard other options. [Announcer] How do you view what the five powers have concluded in Geneva--they are in favor of the cease-fire agreement, they advocate the 51-49 percent solution, yet they also support a single Bosnia-Herzegovina in its internationally recognized borders. [Prlic] What else could they have said? The world will not set a precedent so easily--it will not withdraw the international recognition of any state. Since the United States is backing this integrity, this option will be relevant. Whether it will be accepted as the final solution remains to be seen. [Announcer] Let me ask you one more question: In view of the Washington Agreement and all other future options in negotiations with the Serbs--do you think the Croatian identity [Hrvatstvo-- Croathood] is threatened anywhere in Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Prlic] The Croatian identity is threatened in many parts controlled by the Muslim and Serb Armies. There is quite an outflow of people. A Herceg-Bosna Chamber of Deputies delegation will be leaving on a visit to the Croats in Bosnian Krajina on Monday [16 May], this will be a three-day visit. We expect this to materialize, we hope that they will not only stay in Banja Luka, but that they will go to other places as well--there are 2,000 Croats in Teslic, they also live in Mrkonjic Grad, Sanski Most, and Prijedor. The Croats living in these areas are a matter of constant attention and concern for the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. I wish to say that the implementation of the peace agreement and the federation agreement is going well, despite all the difficulties. We have managed to achieve freedom of movement, we signed relevant protocols with the Sarajevo government--for example, our tax and customs system has been accepted in its entirety. We have regulated the free flow of not only commercial goods, but also of humanitarian convoys, including those belonging to international humanitarian organizations. We have formed a mixed group for drawing up a program for the return of refugees. We are particularly interested in this because many more Croats have left the regions now controlled by the Muslim Army than is the case with Muslims who have left areas now controlled by the HVO. Therefore, the return of refugees is one of our vital interests. I wish to say this openly and clearly--this is of primary importance to Croatian policy in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The realization of the construction of the overall power-generating system in Bosnia-Herzegovina is already under way, this also applies to the water supply system and the railway line from the sea toward Sarajevo. These are only some of the measures taken so far. [passage omitted] [Announcer] Just a procedural question that does not seem to be unimportant: Will tomorrow's signature in Geneva be submitted for approval to your parliament's Chamber of Deputies? [Prlic] The Chamber of Deputies session will be held before the constituent assembly--this was agreed this evening--and the constituent assembly is expected to ratify these acts because some of them have altered the federation's constitution adopted at the first session of the constituent assembly [sentence as heard]. [Announcer] So you believe that this will be accepted by the Chamber of Deputies. [Prlic] All or almost all members of the Chamber of Deputies, all members of the bodies of the HDZ for Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the government of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna were present today. Judging by what was apparent, all this was accepted. So I do not believe any problems could crop up in this regard.
