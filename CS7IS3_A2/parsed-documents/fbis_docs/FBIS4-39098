While meeting with reporters aboard his plane en route to Tashkent following his official visit to Russia, President Kim said the two countries have a full grasp of all North Korean movements through an around-the clock surveillance system. "A war should be forestalled by all means," Kim said. "But, South Korea and the United States possess enough force of arms to cope with any contingency." The president said he fully discussed in a telephone conversation with U.S. President Bill Clinton a possible sanction against North Korea and the issue of national security for 35 minutes on Friday. "Cooperation between our two countries is perfect. I understand the telephone conversation between Presidents Clinton and Boris Yeltsin, too, was satisfactory," he said. Saying that all things seem going well with regard to the issue of taking a sanction against North Korea, President Kim said, "Our people may be relieved at conditions that may develop over the nuclear issue." He also said President Yeltsin promised not to supply any weapons either offensive or defensive to North Korea. "Given the fact that Russia had in the past been the main supplier of weapons for North Korea, this pledge of Russia has a very important bearing," President Kim said.
