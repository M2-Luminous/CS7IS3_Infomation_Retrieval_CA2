FR940217-0-00017 FR940217-0-00006 ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing amendment 39&hyph;6613 (55 FR 31816, August 6, 1990), and by adding a new airworthiness directive (AD), amendment 39&hyph;8815, to read as follows: 94&hyph;03&hyph;08 McDonnell Douglas: Amendment 39&hyph;8815. Docket 93&hyph;NM&hyph;112&hyph;AD. Supersedes AD 90&hyph;16&hyph;04, Amendment 39&hyph;6613. Applicability: Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;10F, &hyph;15, &hyph;30, &hyph;30F, &hyph;40, and &hyph;40F series airplanes and Model KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes, certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. Note 1: Paragraphs (a) and (c) of this AD restate the requirements for an initial inspection and the repetitive inspections contained in paragraphs A. and C. of AD 90&hyph;16&hyph;04. Therefore, for operators who have previously accomplished at least the initial inspection in accordance with AD 90&hyph;16&hyph;04, paragraphs (a) and (c) of this AD require that the next scheduled inspection be performed within the specified repetitive inspection interval after the last inspection performed in accordance with paragraphs A. and C. of AD 90&hyph;16&hyph;04. Note 2: Paragraphs (b) and (d) of this AD restate the modification requirements of paragraphs B. and D. of AD 90&hyph;16&hyph;04. As allowed by the phrase, ``unless accomplished previously,'' if the requirements of paragraphs B. and D. of AD 90&hyph;16&hyph;04 have been accomplished previously, paragraphs (b) and (d) of this AD do not require that they be repeated. To prevent structural failure, accomplish the following: (a) For service bulletins other than those identified in paragraph (c) of this AD, within the threshold for inspections specified in the service bulletins listed in Table 2.1 of McDonnell Douglas Report No. MDC&hyph;K1571, ``DC&hyph;10/KC&hyph;10 Aging Aircraft Service Action Requirements Document,'' Revision A, dated February 28, 1990 (hereafter referred to as the ``SARD, Revision A''), or Revision B, dated March 24, 1993 (hereafter referred to as the ``SARD, Revision B''), or within one repetitive inspection period specified in those service bulletins after September 10, 1990 (the effective date of AD 90&hyph;16&hyph;04, Amendment 39&hyph;6613), whichever occurs later, inspect for cracks in accordance with those service bulletins. Repeat these inspections thereafter at the intervals specified in the service bulletins listed in Table 2.1 of the SARD, Revision A or Revision B. (1) If any crack is found as a result of any inspection, prior to further flight, either accomplish the terminating modification in accordance with the applicable service bulletin, or repair in accordance with a method approved by the Manager, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Note 3: Detection of any discrepancies other than cracking necessitates appropriate corrective action in accordance with the provisions of part 43 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). (2) Modification in accordance with paragraph (b) of this AD terminates the individual inspection requirements of the applicable service bulletin. (b) For service bulletins other than those identified in paragraph (c) of this AD, prior to reaching the incorporation thresholds listed in the SARD, Revision A or Revision B, or prior to four years after September 10, 1990, whichever occurs later, accomplish the structural modifications specified in the service bulletins listed under ``S/B No. Rev.'' in Table 2.1 of the SARD, Revision A or Revision B. Note 4: The service bulletin revision levels listed under ``Recommended Modification'' in Table 2.1 of the SARD, Revision B, are acceptable revisions for modifications accomplished prior to September 10, 1990.

Repeat these inspections thereafter at the intervals specified under ``S/B Change Required'' in Table 2.1 of the SARD, Revision A or Revision B. (1) If any crack is found during any inspection, prior to further flight, either accomplish the terminating modification in accordance with the applicable service bulletin, or repair in accordance with a method approved by the Manager, Los Angeles ACO, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate.
