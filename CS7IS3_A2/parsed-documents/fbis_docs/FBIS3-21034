Therefore, when genetically altered bacteria are released in nature, the foreign DNA should not be added into the plasmids, but into the chromosomes of these organisms. Dr. Eric Smit analyzed the risk of putting genetically altered micro-organisms in the ground. He will soon obtain a doctorate in Wageningen on this subject. Smit put an easily recognizable plasmid in bacteria and released it in various soils. Next he verified whether other bacteria would adopt the plasmid. This was primarily the case under life conditions favoring the micro-organisms, e.g. around the roots of plants or when nutrients had been added to the soil. This is probably due to a greater density or a greater bacterial division activity. It has already been known that plasmid transmission in water is absolutely normal.
