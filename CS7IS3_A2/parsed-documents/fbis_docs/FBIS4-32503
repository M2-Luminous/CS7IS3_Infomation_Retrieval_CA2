By 31 May 1994, it declined to 2.29 billion Slovak korunas [Sk] (from Sk3.8 billion at the end of April). As of 21 June 1994, the budget management of the Slovak Republic has been showing a deficit of Sk7.9 billion. This sum will, however, decrease by the end of the month because the surrendering of proceeds from the crucial taxes--the value-added tax and excise taxes--starts after the 23d day of every month. An analysis of the current deviation in the budget management of the Slovak Republic confirms that it is also influenced by the changed position of the Slovak Republic in the fulfillment of the payments agreement with the Czech Republic because Slovakia has now become the Czech Republic's creditor.
