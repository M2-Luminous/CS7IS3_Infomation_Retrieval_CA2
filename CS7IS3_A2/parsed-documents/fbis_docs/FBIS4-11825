He said interception and inspection of al-'Aqabah-bound vessels has increased over the last few weeks, and that it is time that this "intervention" in Jordanian affairs be stopped. "We never agreed or accepted these practices since the beginning," he said. His Majesty King Husayn told ambassadors of the five permanent members to the Security Council on Monday [28 March] that Jordan's resumption of its role in the peace process is conditional to an immediate resolution of the siege enforced on al-'Aqabah. In an interview with THE STAR this week, Mr. Qammuh said the interception and inspection of vessels coming to al-'Aqabah by U.S.- led ships in the Red Sea "is in contradiction with international law and with the UN Charter." He added that the naval act is not supported by any UN resolution and has no legal warrant. "We have informed the Security Council Sanctions Committee (of Jordanian grievances) and the Prime Minister visited New York and addressed this committee and submitted detailed reports about the practices and the losses Jordan had been incurring due to the interception of vessels and the embargo against Iraq and we are still waiting for a response," Mr. Qammuh said. "No less than 12 documents have been sent (to the UN), and we received lots of promises but we have not seen implementation of these promises." The minister reiterated Jordanian demands for compensations to the losses incurred by the Jordanian economy as a direct result of the embargo. "The losses amount to more than $1.3 billion and with the heavy burden Jordan is shouldering this additional burden will aggravate an already difficult financial situation," Mr. Qammuh said. Since the naval blockade was enforced in 1990, over 1700 commercial vessels were inspected by naval forces positioned at the Straits of Tiran. "They were inspected, rerouted, but none was found to be carrying irregular or unacceptable cargo," Mr. Qammuh said. He added that Jordan has accepted an interim arrangement of "an independent, international, nonprofit organization to check on shore cargo coming to al-'Aqabah because we wanted to cooperate with the Sanctions Committee." But he pointed that even such an arrangement does not apply to any of the countries bordering Iraq. "We have been acting in good faith and we are committed to our international responsibilities," the minister said. "We expect other parties to be equally committed and equally fair in treating and handling the problems concerning the peace process."
