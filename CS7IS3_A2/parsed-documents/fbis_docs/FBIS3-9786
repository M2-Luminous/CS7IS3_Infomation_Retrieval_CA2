Walesa, asked whether there is a chance of a compromise in the Rosati affair, replied, "Do they want me to desert?" He added that it is necessary to find a new candidate for that post as quickly as possible. The president referring to the 1994 budget bill, passed by the Senate and the Sejm and waiting for the signature of the president, said that "for today" he would not sign the budget. In his opinion "the nation has been once again cheated, it was to be better." He added that he is in despair "from the economic point of view" as he knows that apart from minor shifts, nothing much can be changed in the budget.
