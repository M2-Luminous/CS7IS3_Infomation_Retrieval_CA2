Our government, which kept silent despite such heated public debate, has begun to direct its attention to Japan's nuclear policy. What touched off our government's interest was the unexpected discovery of 70 kilograms of plutonium in the nuclear reprocessing plant operated by Japan Energy and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation. The entire world has suspected North Korea of having extracted and concealed kilogram-levels of plutonium prior to inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] in May 1992. We may point out that contrary to such global suspicion on North Korea, the recent incident in Japan has been treated in an exceedingly light manner. In fact, nine nuclear bombs the size of the bomb (12.5 kiloton) dropped in Hiroshima in 1945 can be manufactured with this amount of plutonium. This should not be overlooked. Needless to say, direct comparison of plutonium possessed by Japan with that of North Korea is unreasonable. While pushing ahead with nuclear energy development by putting forward the slogan, "democracy, openness, and independence," Japan has allowed the highest-degree of inspections by IAEA. Contrary to this, North Korea has been trying its utmost to evade IAEA inspections as much as possible. The IAEA is using most of its budget to watch Japanese and German nuclear facilities, by permanently posting seven inspectors in Japan's nuclear reprocessing facilities. Thus, the discovery of such a large amount of plutonium which the IAEA failed to uncover is certainly an issue. We may point out, first of all, that there are many unforeseen blind spots [sagak chidae] in the IAEA's inspection system. An even more serious problem is that even if Japan, which is classified as a "semi-nuclear state," were to convert nuclear material on its own after getting rid of IAEA surveillance, no other nation would be able to take steps until its conversion was exposed to the public. It is not easy for one to use nuclear material for purposes other than the generation of atomic energy, even if this material is produced outside surveillance network, because thorough surveys are conducted at each important step in the enrichment, reprocessing, and stockpiling of nuclear fuel. Nonetheless, Japanese nuclear technology, has reached a top level in the world, and includes laser enrichment technology that can be put into operation secretly. This being the case, experts point out that Japan can convert nuclear material whenever it should so desire. At the same time, the Japanese openly declared plan to stockpile plutonium in order to operate high-breeder reactors and converters, has even more serious implications. Experts in the West believe that Japan will stockpile 71.6 tons of plutonium by 2004, and will be able to store 14.9 tons of plutonium from 1993 to 2004 in an unused state after using the amount necessary for use in atomic energy power stations. One can produces 1,500 to 2,000 small-size nuclear bombs with this amount of plutonium. Thus, the world is directing attention to the issue of Japanese plutonium. Our government showed no objection to the Japanese denuclearization policy until last year, because it believed that the Japanese nuclear facilities were under strict international surveillance and that the United States would not remain indifferent to the Japanese moves for nuclear armament. Our government also put into consideration the fact that hurting the Japanese people's feelings would not help resolve either the North Korean nuclear problem or problems pertaining to past relations between the ROK and Japan in a satisfactory manner. However, the government has now changed its attitude with the discovery of plutonium as an occasion, to cautiously raise a voice toward the Japanese nuclear issue. It appears that the government's decision is based on its judgment that this issue should no longer be overlooked. Meanwhile, by taking issue with the possibility of Japanese nuclear armament, North Korea is continually attempting to deflect away attention from the declaration of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, and our government has also had to consider this. Moreover, recent trends indicate that a possibile slackening in the U.S.-Japan security alliance relations, which has been key to blocking Japan's nuclear armament. This being the case, we should make appropriate preparations for such a situation.
