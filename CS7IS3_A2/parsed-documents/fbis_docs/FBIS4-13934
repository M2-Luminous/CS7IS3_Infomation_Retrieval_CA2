It was decided that Fatah will pursue the negotiations with Israel in accordance with the Oslo principles, while the Hamas will continue with controlled operations in order to increase the pressure on Israel and facilitate the withdrawal process. During this meeting, 'Arafat did not call on Hamas to stop the attacks against Israel. Incidentally, the attacks involved are the 'Afula and Hadera attacks, which 'Arafat later denounced. The cooperation discussed is not of an operational nature, nor does it involve early coordination regarding Hamas operations, seeing that Hamas is an independent organization. The participants could surmise, however, that as far as 'Arafat is concerned, Hamas' approach is also beneficial in terms of achieving the goal: namely, removing Israel from the territories. Following the meeting the two organizations worked out cooperation frameworks for Gaza, Jericho, and other territories Fatah takes over if and when Israel evacuates them. [passage omitted]
