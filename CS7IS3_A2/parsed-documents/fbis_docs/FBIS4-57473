The SRF now will have an intelligence service charged with fighting tax evasion. Ricupero's decision represents a victory for Lopes Filho in his dispute with Finance Ministry executive secretary Clovis Carvalho, who has opposed the creation of new positions of trust. During the first stage, 580 new positions will be created at a cost of 300,000 Real Value Units (URV's) monthly to fill four new coordinating offices. The original SRF proposal envisioned the creation of 2,000 positions at a cost of 1.2 million URV's monthly. The following coordinating offices will be created: Fiscal Intelligence, which will be charged with fighting tax evasion; Customs Assessment, which will identify cases of undercharging of export products or overcharging of import items; Classification and Nomenclature, which will monitor the technological evolution of products; and Auditing and Correction, which will oversee internal operations. Furthermore, 18 special offices will be charged with appraising the taxable wealth of taxpayers in court hearings, in addition to their regular assessment duties. The SRF signed an $80 million contract with the Inter-American Development Bank to create automated regional centers to become self-sufficient in data processing operations. Lopes Filho welcomed Ricupero's decision, which he characterized as "recognition of the significant role played by the SRF." The project that appears to be most exciting for him is the creation of the intelligence service. He said: The SRF now will have instruments to fight tax evasion crimes.
