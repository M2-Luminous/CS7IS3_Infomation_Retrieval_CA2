FBIS4-52097 "dreas088_d_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-088 Daily Report 6 May 1994 South Korea Reaction to Japanese Foreign Minister's Remark Reaction to Japanese Foreign Minister's Remark Demonstration at Japanese Embassy SK0605082094 Seoul YONHAP in English 0744 GMT 6 May 94 SK0605082094 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, May 6 (YONHAP) -- Over a hundred protesters gathered outside the Japanese Embassy Friday to demand the immediate dismissal of Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano. "Apologize, Repent," chanted demonstrators belonging to the Association of Pacific War Victims and Families. A letter from the group delivered to the embassy said Nagano's comments revealed the Japanese Government's two-faced view of history and constituted a threat to peace in Asia. The just-appointed justice minister with a long career in the military enraged Japan's Asian neighbors when he said his country was not the aggressor in World War II but a party dedicated to freeing Asia from European colonialism. He also said he didn't believe the massacre of Chinese by Japanese soldiers in "the rape of Nanjing" was true. The comments instantly touched a nerve in South Korea, which still chafes at more than three decades of Japanese colonial rule before liberation came at the end of the Second World War. "Retract Nagano's comments and immediately fire him," the association said in a statement, adding that Japan should suspend its attempts at remilitarization through constitutional revision and clear up all questions about its past by 1995. "If these terms are not fulfilled, we will start with our neighbors in Southeast Asia who suffered from the Pacific War a campaign against buying Japanese products," the statement said. The dissident-led National Alliance for Democracy and Unification in Korea issued a similar statement, demanding legal and systematic compensation for victims of the war. "Nagano's words reflect the Japanese Government's political intention to abort its admission of war crimes and legal, systematic compensation measures," the alliance said.
