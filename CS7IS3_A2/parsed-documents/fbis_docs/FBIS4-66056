Kanther underlined today, at the 5th German-Jewish dialogue in Koenigswinter near Bonn, that those "suppressing" and "playing down" the Holocaust have to be "put in their place." The state must not leave it only to "major films and television series" to inform people and make them aware of German history. The interior minister pointed out that the right-wing extremists in Germany are increasingly stirring up antisemitism and revisionism. Their agitation is having an effect. For example, instances of cemeteries being desecrated are continuing. Attacks on people motivated by anti-Semitism are also a cause for concern. Kanther added that 2,232 right-wing extremist acts of violence were committed last year alone. Of these, 1,609 were xenophobic and 72 antisemitic. Overall, the number of antisemitic offenses rose from 562 in 1992 to 656 in 1993. Initial findings show that this trend is continuing in 1994, too. Greater efforts will therefore have to be made to combat this. Overall there are potentially about 8,000 people who "openly admit to being antisemitic". The interior minister announced that the fight against right-wing extremism will be intensified further. The state and society have to take all possible steps against these "sometimes inhumane acts", specifically through "repressive and preventive measures." Possible gaps in the law have to be closed. Kanther stressed that the Office for the Protection of the Constitution is currently conducting "extensive" investigations into the right-wing extremist republicans. Any further action against this party will depend on the results. At any event, incorrigible agitation and violence have to be "rigorously banned and punished under the law."
