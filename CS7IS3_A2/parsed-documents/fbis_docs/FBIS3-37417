The weekly was funded by the former Central Committee of the CPSU. Its publication was stopped by the order of the former Ministry of the Press and Information of the Russian Federation after the events of August 3-4 last year. Late in January the court annulled the ministry's decision, stating that the weekly had not been published from September 9 and so could not have been involved directly in the bloody events in Moscow. The publication founded by the work collective of the editorial office has been renewed as an "all-union political weekly", Alexey Veretennikov, assistant editor of GLASNOST, told ITAR-TASS. The weekly has not changed its political positions. It declares "for the restoration of the USSR and unification of the communist parties". The assistant editor said that among contributors to the publication are Anatoliy Lukyanov, Oleg Shenin, Nikolay Ryzhkov.
