The aim of the visit was to check, as scheduled, the state of affairs and to study problems in Ukraine's military units. On that day, Hennadiy Hurin visited the headquarters of Ukraine's Naval Forces in Sevastopol and ships of the Ukrainian Fleet. The group of officers also included Ukrainian presidential adviser for military issues Major General Volodymyr Petepko, who visited commander of the Black Sea Fleet Admiral E. Baltin in a naval hospital. On the same day, Ukraine's first deputy minister of internal affairs Colonel General Valentyn Nedryhaylo also visited the Crimea. He headed a group of the ministry's officials that arrived in order to render assistance in the operational work on combating crime.

Meshkov [who was on a visit to Cyprus at the time].
