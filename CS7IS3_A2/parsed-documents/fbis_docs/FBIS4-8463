Describing the circumstances of the criminal act on the basis of the evidence and presenting those present with the facts and indisputable evidence, Musaraj cited arguments to show that this act was committed by a Greek commando unit. He stressed that proceeding from the way the crime was committed, the number of the participants, the automatic weapons used, which resulted in the killing of two militaries, the wounding of three others, and much material damage, it is clear that we have to do with a terrorist act organized and committed by Greek special forces. Starova informed the military attaches and diplomats about special aspects of the Albanian Government's position on Greece's serious act of infringing Albania's sovereignty and territorial integrity. He stressed that the Albanian Government has not yet received an official response from the Greek Government. Regarding the statements of Greek Government spokesman Venizelos, Starova said that these cannot be considered a response. He pointed out, however, that in his second statement Venizelos finally remembered to console the families of the dead. He added that we are expecting an official response from the Greek Government on this criminal act committed by the Greek special forces. Without this, it is difficult to conduct a dialogue between the Albanian and Greek sides. Starova also stressed that the only answer from the Greek side has been the expulsion of the first secretary of the Albanian Embassy in Athens, a vengeful and very unfair action. Musaraj and Starova answered many questions. At the end, the military attaches and the diplomats of the embassies expressed their condolences to the dead and wounded in this criminal act committed by the Greek special forces.
