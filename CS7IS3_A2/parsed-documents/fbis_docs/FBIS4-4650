The Foreign Ministry advocates early tariff concessions on automobile imports, abolition of limits on showrooms for foreign cars and approval of advertising as demanded by the United States, while the Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry firmly opposes lower tariffs and early liberalization of the distribution market before the scheduled January 1996. The Foreign Ministry says concessions are inevitable, pointing to the phrase "reduction in the tariffs on motor vehicles will be addressed at the ministerial level," interpreting "address" as meaning "announce" and therefore a promise on future cuts. As Washington, citing the record, is strongly demanding tariff reductions and predicting Korea will inevitably have to bow to its request, the Foreign Ministry wants to resolve the issue quickly. U.S. Deputy Assistant Trade Representative Peter Collins referred to the record of understanding to demand immediate tariff cuts on car imports in trade talks in Seoul early last month. The Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry, however, sees things differently. It interprets "address" to mean "discuss" as it is often regarded in business, saying it thus cannot be a promise on tariff cuts as insisted by the United States. Even if it is a promise, the reduction refers to tariff offers because the record was made in the UR negotiations, the trade ministry argues. Offering and actual tariff rates may be the same to the United States, but they are two different things to Korea, the ministry says, adding that Seoul only needs to change the offering rates. In its country schedule, Korea had offered to maintain an 80-percent tariff on motor vehicle imports until 2004. The Trade Ministry immediately issued a press release that the government has no plans to lower tariffs on car imports nor to open the distribution market earlier than scheduled, contrasting with earlier reports quoting Foreign Ministry officials as saying that Seoul has decided to accept the U.S. demand on tariff cuts on car imports.
