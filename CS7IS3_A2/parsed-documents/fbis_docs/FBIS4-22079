Or is it a novel mode of militancy against the Israeli occupation? [Nazzal: The 'Afula operation executed by the al-Qassam Battalions -- Hamas' military wing -- was the first reprisal for the Hebron massacre. Four more, just as forceful and impressive, are yet to come. AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: Some Palestinians have spoken out against an operation that targeted civilians and cast the conflict in racial terms, pitting Arab against Israeli, when in actual fact it is one of liberation, and so armed struggle in all its forms must be directed at only the occupation military. How do you react? [Nazzal: In the 40-day interval between the Hebron massacre and the 'Afula bombing, the Palestinian people realized the international community is not about to take revenge for them or compensate them in any way. A statement of condemnation was all that the UN Security Council did, which made no difference. Therefore, all segments of the Palestinian people rejoiced at the operation and saw in it something of a morale booster. The Palestinians who came out against it are a scattered minority whom the operation put on the spot and pulled the rug from under them. AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: Can you state with certainty that the next operations will be modelled on the 'Afula operation? [Nazzal: All I can say is that they will be forceful enough to match the enormity and odiousness of the Hebron massacre. AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: You have a significant political presence in Jordan and Syria, both of which are involved in the peace process. It appears the 'Afula operation has had the consequence of pushing Washington to move against you in the two countries. Have you come under any official pressure? [Nazzal: As I have said, the operation was greeted with universal jubilation in Arab and Muslim circles, because it was in response to the crime and to avenge the martyrs. Sadly, however, the PLO was the only Arab quarter to deplore this heroic action. AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: But you haven't come under any official pressure? [Nazzal: None of the Arab states has criticized us or applied any pressure on account of the 'Afula operation. AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: Information suggests the PLO has complained to Jordan because of your national political role in the Jordanian arena. Have you been informed of this complaint? [Nazzal: We learned about this complaint through unofficial sources, but no one has contacted us in this connection. If anything, this shows the PLO leadership is facing a serious predicament, to the extent that it is lodging complaints with the U.S. Administration to pressure Jordan. I think Jordan understands the position of the Hamas movement on the political settlement and pursuing the resistance against the occupation. AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: After the 'Afula operation, Israel has once again reiterated that your movement receives financial support from Iran and that those who planned and carried out the operation had received training by Hizballah when they were in Marj al-Zuhur in southern Lebanon. How true is this? [Nazzal: I do not believe the Hamas movement is incapable of developing its security and military capabilities. The movement has a highly qualified military agency which is gaining more experience day after day. Therefore, talking about Iranian or foreign financing is not true. AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: Then where does your financing come from? [Nazzal: I can stress that Hamas finances itself by itself and from popular quarters. So far we have not received a penny from any government. AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: Some reports say Hamas is involved in schemes to finish off Yasir 'Arafat in order to abort the peace process. How true is this? [Nazzal: Hamas does not believe in political assassination. It thinks its efforts should be geared toward facing the occupation and its tools. What is being said about a plan to assassinate 'Arafat or other Palestinian personalities is unfounded. AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: But how are you going to deal with the fact that 'Arafat and the Palestinian leadership will soon be in Gaza and Jericho, and then the rest of the West Bank? [Nazzal: It is Hamas policy not to clash with Palestinian authority and its tools. This, however, does not at all mean that the resistance will stop. Therefore, Hamas will pursue its approach to resist the occupation until the objective of removing the occupation is achieved. AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: Do you have any information to prove that 'Arafat has agreed with the Israelis to get rid of Hamas? [Nazzal: We have information about intelligence meetings between Palestinian and Israeli security agencies for coordination against Hamas and to exchange information on Hamas leaders, cadres, and activities. AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: To what extent are you afraid of such meetings, especially during the next phase, when 'Arafat returns home and controls matters in the West Bank and Gaza? [Nazzal: Undoubtedly, we view with extreme caution the cooperation between the Palestinian and the occupation authorities, as this cooperation will be aimed against any Palestinian opposition. But we believe the Palestinian masses will bend toward those who express their hopes and aspirations. They will eject whoever cooperates with the occupation. We reflect the Palestinian masses' determination to continue resistance to the occupation. AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: Some reports mention the movement of some Fatah Hawks to Hamas because the Tunis leadership has stopped sending them money, thus restraining their military movement against Israel. How true is that? [Nazzal: Definitely, there is large-scale opposition within the Fatah ranks against the political settlement. This opposition is expanding to encompass large sectors. Hamas has relations and contacts with honorable and sincere Fatah personnel, some of whom have been absorbed within Hamas, especially military personnel. Hopefully, this will enrich Hamas' experience, especially after it has been joined by some experienced Fatah cadres. AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: It seems the experience of the Fatah personnel who have joined you has appeared in the 'Afula operation? [Nazzal: When any experienced personnel joins Hamas, this will be a qualitative addition to Hamas' experience. We believe any cooperation between Hamas and Fatah military personnel will be a real threat to the occupation and its tools. AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: You have maintained channels to Fatah inside in the occupied territories. Do you have channels to the Fatah command abroad? Have such channels helped establish coordination between the two movements? [Nazzal: Official contacts with the Fatah command abroad have been frozen since the Oslo agreement. We maintain individual contacts with Fatah oppositionists. But they are personal contacts. AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: Are you planning to develop your contacts with the opposition to abort the peace process? [Nazzal: We welcome any contacts and coordination with Fatah's oppositionists if that helps the resistance to occupation. AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: But are they equally willing to do that? [Nazzal: Already some Fatah activists are coordinating with Hamas. AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: And on the top leadership level? [Nazzal: No coordination there. AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: You came out against the reinstatement of Mustafa al-Natshah as Hebron mayor and demanded municipal elections. How is it that you support municipal elections that the occupation does not mind, and, at the same time, you do not want to contest elections for a Palestinian authority that the occupation also has no objection to? [Nazzal: We are for municipal elections that are not tied to any political agenda in particular. This is because municipal elections are the only means available to provide services to the Palestinian population, as well as to alleviate the hardships under which they are living, and enhance their health and social services. We want municipal elections to be held in all the Palestinian cities. Elections were held in 1976 without them being tied to any political agenda, at a time when all Palestinian forces, then adopting the same posture as that of Hamas now, refused to extend recognition to the Zionist enemy. Thus we see nothing wrong in holding elections, but they must be unconnected to any political agenda. AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: Uri Sagi, head of Israeli intelligence, said in press statements that Hamas will field candidates in the elections for the Palestinian authority under a banner that does not bear the name of Hamas. He explains that the Hamas pragmatists in the occupied territories will press for participation. What do you think? [Nazzal: Hamas' position is not to take part in the self-rule elections -- a decision consistent with our opposition to the Gaza- Jericho agreement and its spin-offs. Any word about Hamas contesting these elections is speculative and not based on hard facts. AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: Is that your last word on the issue? [Nazzal: Our position holds for the time being. I don't know about the future. Everything is subject to a review. AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: I take it then that your participation in the elections is not ruled out? Nazzal: We are open to all options.
