Al. and E.S.: "Belgian Navy Will Be Commanded by a Netherlander"] [Text] Efficiency: That is the objective of the "close cooperation" agreement between the Belgian Naval Force and the Netherlands Royal Navy which Belgian Defense Minister Leo Delcroix is due to sign on 30 June with Ter Beek, his Netherlands counterpart. This project is likely to produce some irritation in Belgium. Indeed, although the two Naval Forces should prove more efficient by the implementation of this agreement, some people will not fail to regret the organization of this binational force. Contrary to the methods used in the Eurocorps for instance, (a rotating command among the countries involved), the Netherlands, according to the Naval Force internal memorandum which LE SOIR has been able to procure, will permanently hold the operational command. The Benelux admiral will see his responsibilities extended in peacetime to operations outside Belgian-Netherlands territorial waters. The Belgian rear admiral would always be the deputy and the replacement for his Netherlands colleague. Indeed, this is an extension of a 1951 agreement which makes provision for giving command to the Netherlands in time of war. However, the Belgian ships could, under Belgian operational command, participate in national missions, or even international missions. The agreement should also make it more difficult to carry out another drastic reduction in Belgian and Netherlands naval staffing levels, which have been subjected to stringent reduction plans in recent years. The memorandum also takes up some points which will be consolidated. For instance, there will be no question of one of the two partners in the Belgian-Netherlands force specializing in one sector or another. Each of the forces will as far as possible maintain a "general" role. The ships will also continue to be based at the same home port. Thus, although the joint headquarters will be based in Den Helder, in the Netherlands, the ships currently based at Zeebrugge or in another Belgian port will remain there. In the logistical sphere, the "close cooperation" will relate to the maintenance of ships and equipment, and a joint purchase and acquisitions policy. And, finally, there will be a harmonization of new construction programs. In this sphere, Belgian-Netherlands cooperation has just met with a failure: The Netherlanders have refused to participate in the program to develop new Belgian minesweepers. The Belgian Naval Force will also be able to maintain its relations with other navies, as it is currently doing with the French National Navy, which maintains the weapon systems on Belgian frigates. Finally, the agreement makes provision for the bilingualism of the Belgian Naval Force to be maintained. It therefore remains for the Netherlands admiral to prove that he knows more French than the motto of the Netherlands royal family: "I will uphold."
