"Tying development aid to large export orders," says Guenter Rexrodt, "is out of the question." Only a short time ago, he had "emphatically turned down" such petitions. But once again the liberal is fighting a losing battle: Industry has long since won out in Bonn. Still this year, Bonn is introducing a new financing tool which gives priority to subsidized credits for large-scale infrastructure projects. The procedure of the so-called second window of development policy: The federally owned Reconstruction Loan Corporation (KfW) borrows money from the capital market and, together with development aid, hands it out as loans. Bonn guarantees 90 percent of the outside capital. With such mixed financing, conditions lie between those of usual development aid credits (a life of up to 40 years, with 0.75 percent interest) and commercial loans. The new "mobility of the Federal Government" (BDI) [Federal Association of German Industry] is to give German industry better chances in the hotly contested markets in China, Southeast Asia, India, and Latin America. Especially advantageous: The new tool is also to benefit threshold countries no longer needing development aid, but which stubbornly insist on favorable financing in placing large orders. Recently, enterprises had criticized repeatedly the governments of other countries, above all Japan and the United States, for providing much more support for their enterprises. Because of the "merciless competition," Babcock manager Hans Westphal demands that development aid be handled differently: What is needed are "more credits for a specific purpose" and "competitive financing packages." With the new credit too, Bonn now follows the recommendations of enterprises--and at the same time violates an agreement among OECD member states. In 1991, after a tough struggle, they had agreed on a guideline for financing large projects in developing countries. The principal point: Commercial credits must not be mixed with Third World aid, and tying development money to export orders is inadmissible. At the time, the club of industrial countries thought they had averted a terrible "subsidy fight." Since then, the OECD has been setting "consensual interest rates" that are reexamined every six months. For China, for instance, the interest rate at present is 6.75 percent. In fact, however, it has been the Chinese who have recently tried to force better conditions. A further source of conflict are the differences in the national finance sectors which so far are not even covered in the OECD consensus. Japanese exporters, for example, can borrow money from their banks very favorably and long-term, and in France the state guarantees a large part of the financial risk. Up to now, the Federal Government pursued the goal of also harmonizing these areas at the OECD level and preventing competitive subsidy races. Now, however, Germany is racing in precisely the opposite direction. A model case already exists: Development Aid Minister Spranger contributes 352 million German marks [DM] so that a Siemens/AEG consortium may build a subway in the southern Chinese province of Canton. In this manner the Germans garnered orders worth about DM700 million. "Pushed through at that time as an exceptional case," thunders former development minister and SPD [Social Democratic Party] politician Erhard Eppler, "this method is now to become a system." In view of "unemployment and recession in Germany," as Spranger defends the new economic policy component of his development policy, "export opportunities should not be missed." In this kind of development aid, the lion's share returns as an order for German enterprises. No wonder that managers doing business with India also push "with great tenacity" (Rexrodt) for corresponding financial infusions from Bonn. A consortium consisting of Siemens, Deutsche Babcock, Takraf, and MAN Gutehoffnungshuette is at present negotiating with the Indian Government on a brown coal power plant with its own mine in South Indian Tamil Nadu. "Only the financing is not yet cleared up," according to Babcock manager Rainer Schumacher. It involves over DM2 billion, says the manager, "so Bonn should shell out something."
