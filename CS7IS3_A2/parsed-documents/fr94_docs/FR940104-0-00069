Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) at 1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;8339 between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Student Loan Reform Act of 1993, enacted on August 10, 1993, established the Direct Loan Program under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA). See subtitle A of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66). Under the Direct Loan Program, loan capital is provided directly to student and parent borrowers by the Federal Government rather than through private lenders. This program replaces the direct loan demonstration program that was authorized to begin in July 1994 by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;325). The HEA directs the Secretary to consult with members of the higher education community and to publish a notice of standards, criteria, and procedures for the program's first year in lieu of issuing regulations using the Department's usual procedures. The Secretary's representatives participated in regional meetings at various locations around the country in which members of the higher education community including representatives of colleges, universities, proprietary schools, and educational associations were consulted. The Secretary's representatives have also met with numerous national, regional, and state organizations representing the financial aid community to discuss various aspects of the Direct Loan Program. The Secretary's representatives have met with personnel from schools and financial advisors to assist in the development of the software that will be used by Direct Loan Program schools. In addition, the notice is based in part on final regulations for the direct loan demonstration program in 34 CFR part 685 that were published in the Federal Register on July 2, 1993 (58 FR 36088), following the publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking and consideration of public comment. The Secretary believes that participating schools' familiarity with those regulations will ease the burden of their participation in the Direct Loan Program.
