It has 194,000MW of developable hydropower, equal to 51.7 percent of China's total hydropower. Currently, six of the 12 key cascade development base areas being built through State plans are located in southwest China's Jinsha Jiang, Yalong Jiang, Dadu He, Lancang Jiang, Wu Jiang, and Hongshui He river basins. With major efforts by the State to provide support, energy resource development in southwest China, which has mainly involved hydropower, has entered the best period in the last decade. According to incomplete statistics, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan provinces and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region invested 16 billion yuan in capital during the Seventh 5-Year Plan alone in electric power construction, more than four times greater than the total amount invested during the Sixth 5-Year Plan, adding 6,000MW in new generating capacity. As we enter the Eighth 5-Year Plan, the pace of construction has been further accelerated. During the past two years the primary grids completed 5.86 billion yuan in electric power construction investments and added 2,430MW in installed generating capacity. At the end of 1992, these three provinces and one autonomous region had a total installed electric power generating capacity of 20,155MW, including an installed hydropower generating capacity of 9,640MW. Sichuan Province, which has developed at a rapid pace, increased its total installed electric power generating capacity from 4,624MW in 1985 to 9,565MW in 1992, more than doubling it. The deployment of energy resource development in the vast southwest China region is focused on cascade development of six large river basins. In plans for the trunks, 65 large and medium-sized hydropower stations have been designed with a total installed generating capacity scale of 120,000MW, including 11 that have been completed or are now under construction with a total installed generating capacity of 10,810MW and annual power output of 51.92 billion kWh. According to the Ninth 5-Year Plan, another seven large hydropower stations with a total installed generating capacity of almost 20,000MW will be built in succession. Electric power experts predict that by the end of this century, the installed hydropower generating capacity in southwest China will increase substantially and form China's biggest hydropower base area cluster in these six large basins. As hydropower energy resource base area construction is developed, southwest China's electric power industry, which had been backward for a long time, has begun to enter the development phase of large power grids, large power plants, large generators, high voltages, and high automation levels. In the early 1980s, southwest China had only two large hydropower stations bigger than 500MW, but today we have now completed or are in the process of building five hydropower stations at Ertan, Manwan, Yantan, and Tianshengqiao First Cascade and Second Cascade, all of which have installed generating capacities greater than 1,200MW. This is particularly true of Ertan Power Station in Sichuan, which has a total installed generating capacity of 3,300MW and six generators that will generate 17 billion kWh of electricity annually, the most electricity generated among the hydropower projects under construction in China in these three indicators. Since 1992, we have installed three 500 kV power transmission and transformation lines, the largest in China in terms of capacity, between Guiyang and Tianshengqiao, Manwan and Kunming, and Tianshengqiao and Foshan in Guangdong, which is an indication that a preliminary key electric power facility linking south China and southwest China has been completed.
