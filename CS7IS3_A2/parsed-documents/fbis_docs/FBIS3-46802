The two main banking systems -- the State Bank with its management responsibilities and the commercial banks and credit organisations which undertake money transactions, credits and banking services -- have improved significantly. The whole network has thus become the most versatile and developed in the whole country. In 1993 new systems were established -- state-run commercial banks, joint-stock commercial banks, financial companies, jewellery companies, foreign-owned and joint venture banks. Total capital mobilized in the year was estimated at VND [Vietnamese dong] 6,045 billion (USD [U.S. dollars] 60.45 million), a twofold increase from 1991. Also, a foreign exchange centre has been founded to solve the problem of supply and demand in foreign currencies, especially for import and export. Speaking at the conference, State Bank Governor-General Cao Si Kiem approved proposals for the improvement of the jewel business and the strengthening of state management of foreign banks. He also agreed on the need of improving the efficiency of joint-stock commercial banks, giving priority to medium and long-term credit sources, and helping train bank staff to international levels.
