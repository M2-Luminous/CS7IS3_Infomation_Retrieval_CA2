However, when answering a question from a reporter of this newspaper by long-distance telephone, Wang Dan said that he would certainly escalate to a move of confrontation if the public security police stepped up the above-said surveillance. Wang Dan said he was feeling weak as his current hunger strike was the longest he had experienced since 4 June 1989. As it was anticipated, the public security police remained indifferent. He thinks that his personal safety is less guaranteed now than at any time before, including his time in jail. His present situation is precisely as former U.S. President Roosevelt said: "Living in the freedom of terror." According to his judgment, the authorities around-the-clock surveillance is aimed at controlling his remarks on one hand, and threatening and intimidating him on the other. He believes he has never said anything wrong or false, so he will not shut his mouth because of that. However, he pointed out that if the public security bureau's surveillance is stepped up, he would employ another method to escalate his protest. Wang Dan said that the public security's close watch of him had caused a lot of inconvenience in his daily life. He was unable to call on some friends whom he wanted to see, because "no one is willing to have contact with policemen." He also disclosed that when he returned to his home town in Shandong around 4 June this year, he had stayed the night at an inn, and now that inn has been closed up.
