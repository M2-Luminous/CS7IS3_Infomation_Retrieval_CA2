Nicolae Andronic, Moldovan deputy speaker of parliament, stated to Tiraspol Radio on 31 May that the Tiraspol leaders are to be blamed for jeopardizing the settlement of the Dniester conflict. Concerning these statements, Volkova mentioned that the Moldovan Parliament's statements contain "inaccuracies or even distortions of events." Volkova said that Andronic's statements are unfounded. She mentioned that it was the Tiraspol representatives who proposed a plan for a confederation in Moldova. Volkova said that if Chisinau had accepted that plan, the Dniester conflict would have been solved long ago. Volkova added that it was the Moldovan delegation who left the negotiations "arguing that the commission's members were on vacation or that the parliament was dissolved."
