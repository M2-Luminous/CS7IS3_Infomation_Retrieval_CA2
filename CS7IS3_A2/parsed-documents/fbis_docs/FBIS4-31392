I more or less have an idea on the reason for this. I have mentioned it a number of times that I see Gyula Horn as suitable for the post of prime minister. Bekesi would be needed in the government, Sandor Nagy, chairman of the National Federation of Trade Unions in Hungary [MSZOSZ] and second person on the national list of the MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party], said in his interview with NEPSZABADSAG. [Pogonyi] What is your view on the fact that, at a Democratic Charter event, Gyorgy Konrad mentioned Bekesi as an acceptable politician to lead a coalition government? [Nagy] Obviously, everyone has his own view on who the prime minister should be. In my view, who the MSZP nominates to head the government is an internal matter. [Pogonyi] Whom would you like to see as prime minister? [Nagy] I have said it many times that, considering all factors, I see Gyula Horn as the suitable person for this position. [Pogonyi] What are your views on the opinion of certain political analysts who believe that the MSZP should make heroic gestures when the coalition is being formed because the Socialists have won more than their true share [tulnyertek magukat]? [Nagy] I do not know why the MSZP should make such gestures. In my view, the Socialists have simply won the confidence of the electors at a level that is indicated by the number of their mandates in the new Parliament. We must only start from this. I do not see why we should start from any other reason that is unknown to me. In fact, I believe that this election result actually provides an opportunity for the MSZP to form a government on a broader basis, not only considering a single party. [Pogonyi] Ivan Vitanyi, chairman of the MSZP's national committee, told the "168 Ora" that he considered your latest statement in which you had saucily said that if the SZDSZ is not willing then there will be another partner to be very bad. [Nagy] I have not said anything like this. [Pogonyi] Perhaps in one of the "NAP-Kelte" programs last week.... [Nagy] My words might have been misunderstood. I said that I considered a more than 50 percent mandate for the MSZP desirable because the issue of the coalition would not be decided on the basis of a constraint, the issue would not depend on whether another party wishes to form a coalition. This way, we can also address others. [Pogonyi] It seems that a number of people might have misunderstood what you said.... [Nagy] It is possible. [Pogonyi] The other day, Bekesi confirmed that he would not accept a ministerial role if the MSZP is forced to form a government on its own. [Nagy] I find this statement unfortunate. Bekesi would be very much needed in the government. If he rejects this because of the aforementioned circumstances then this is definitely a loss. [Pogonyi] When did you last meet each other? [Nagy] I can remember two important discussions in the past six to eight weeks. During one of them we only spoke about economic issues with the IMF's representative in Hungary. On the other occasion, I had asked to meet Bekesi before an election debate. This time, we reviewed the area of balance problems, foreign and domestic financial processes, and budget and asset issues. More precisely, I asked him to help Europe become familiar with some macroeconomic facts and interconnections. [Pogonyi] According to many people, you are the MSZP's bogey-man for the SZDSZ. [Nagy] I have already grown to the fact that the SZDSZ is very short-tempered with me. I more or less know the reason, too. [Pogonyi] Tell me! [Nagy] I would not like to embark on a long story. Presumably, the point is that I am not one of those who always and under all circumstances accepts everything the Free Democrats say. Namely that they know everything best. In my view, other parties also have capable people, experts, and honest politicians. I do not believe that a party has the right to attribute the ability always to fulfill the best roles solely to itself. I always express this view and I believe that this is one of the reasons I am not popular with them. [Pogonyi] Would you be able to support a liberal economic policy? [Nagy] I can support the economic policy that is in the MSZP's program. This is pragmatic, has many liberal elements, and one can also find the values of a social democratic party in it. We have lined up in support of this economic policy and not in support of something else. [Pogonyi] Horn recently said that, according to some economic observers, the MSZP's economic policy might have more liberal elements than that of the SZDSZ. What is your view on this? [Nagy] I think that we would need to clarify the terms. I do not know how Horn meant this remark, it was presumably part of a longer sentence. The MSZP's economic policy is a factual and pragmatic package that does not lack sensitivity toward social problems. [Pogonyi] Finally: Will there be a coalition? [Nagy] The decision is not up to me. However, believe me, I most sincerely hope that there will be.
