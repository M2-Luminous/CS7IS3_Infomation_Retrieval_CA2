Of the 416 congressmen who were present at the session, 328 of them voted against this recommendation and 84 voted in favor, while four others abstained from voting. Congress approved, in a second round of voting, an amendment that allows Brazilians to have dual nationality, thus modifying article 12 of the 1988 Constitution. Deputy Jobim believes this amendment "modernizes" the law. The measure abolishes the bureaucratic requirements to recognize the Brazilian nationality of those who are born abroad of Brazilian fathers and mothers. The amendment made three changes to the original text, Chapter 3 of the Constitution, about nationality. The first change is that it is no longer necessary to register a child born abroad from a Brazilian father and mother in a Brazilian consulate or embassy in order to later obtain Brazilian nationality. The other change was to reduce from 30 to 15 years the time of residence in Brazil required by a foreigner to obtain Brazilian nationality. Another change was in the provision that regulates the loss of Brazilian nationality. The amendment approved yesterday allows Brazilians to obtain another nationality when "the foreign law acknowledges the original nationality of the individual" and when "a foreign country imposes the naturalization of the individual as a condition to continue living in its territory or to exert his civilian rights."
