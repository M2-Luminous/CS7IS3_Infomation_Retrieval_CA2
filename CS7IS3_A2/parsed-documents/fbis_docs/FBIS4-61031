Those are impressive figures. It was not signed by G. Zyuganov, chairman of the Russian Federation Communist Party Central Executive Committee, or by N. Vinogradov and A. Tuleyev, chairmen of the oblast legislative assemblies of Vladimir and Kemerovo Oblasts respectively. That would seem to be minor opposition. But that depends. If the leader of one of the largest political parties, which won one-third of the seats in the Federal Assembly elections, does not sign, then the organizers of the second edition of the failed "political new year" should ponder on it. It is not as a result of trivial disagreements that the Communist leader is refusing to sign -- the party disagrees with the policy of the president and the government and is calling for it to be changed. For the sake of peace, harmony, and a dignified life. The Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin deputies' faction was among the refuseniks. Its leader rightly believes that agreement can only be achieved on a specific issue. The Agrarian Party of Russia had reasonable objections. The court chroniclers have called them self-seeking. Perhaps because the agrarians are sounding the alarm? Spring is in full swing, and there are major difficulties with the sowing -- what will be left in the silos this fall?... So those who are not signing the red papers are people whose view of Russia is not conditioned by the Kremlin.
