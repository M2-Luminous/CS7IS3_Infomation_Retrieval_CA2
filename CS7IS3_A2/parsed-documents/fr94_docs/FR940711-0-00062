FR940711-0-00062 FR940711-0-00018 C. Executive Order 12612, Federalism The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined that the policies contained in this interim rule will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions, or the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Specifically, this interim rule will not substantially alter the established roles of HUD and the States and local governments, including PHAs, in administering the affected programs. As a result, the interim rule is not subject to review under the Order. D. Executive Order 12606, The Family The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this interim rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being and, thus, is not subject to review under the Order. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will result from promulgation of this interim rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns. E. Regulatory Agenda This interim rule was listed as item 1550 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on April 25, 1994 (59 FR 20424, 20440), in accordance with Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Justification for Interim Rulemaking In general, the Department publishes a rule for public comment before issuing a rule for effect, in accordance with its own regulations on rulemaking, 24 CFR Part 10. However, part 10 does provide for exceptions from the general rule where the agency finds good cause to omit advance notice and public participation. The good cause requirement is satisfied when prior public procedure is ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' (24 CFR 10.1) The Department finds that good cause exists to publish this interim rule for effect without first soliciting public comment, in that prior public comment is contrary to the public interest because immediate effectiveness of this interim rule will permit the Department to respond immediately to housing assistance needs brought on by natural and other disasters, housing needs resulting from emergencies arising from unpredictable and sudden circumstances causing housing deprivation or causing an unforeseen and significant increase in lower income housing demands in a housing market, and housing needs resulting from the settlement of litigation.
