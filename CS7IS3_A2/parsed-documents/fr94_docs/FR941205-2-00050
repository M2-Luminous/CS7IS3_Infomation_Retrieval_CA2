FR941205-2-00050 FR941205-2-00034 INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION [Finance Docket No. 32544 (Sub-No. 1)] Consolidated Rail Corporation, Trackage Rights Exemption, CSX Transportation, Inc. CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT), has agreed to grant overhead trackage rights to Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) on a portion of its Indiana Subdivision in Indiana and Jefferson Counties, PA, from its connection with the Ridge Subdivision at Ridge Branch Junction (milepost 26.6) near Creekside to a connection to be established at a point to be mutually agreed upon between milepost 41.5 and milepost 44.7 near Josephine. The trackage rights agreement provides for a 30-year term and a 30-year renewal option and is limited to the movement of limestone, limestone substitutes, ammonia, rail materials, transformers, and coal terminating at the Keystone Generating Station (Keystone) at Shelocta, PA. The trackage rights qualify under the class exemption procedures of 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(7) and ordinarily would have become effective 50 days after filing. However, they are related to two other transactions that applicants simultane-ously seek approval for as one integral transaction. 1 Accordingly, at applicants' request all three proceedings were considered together and the effective date of this notice of exemption necessarily was delayed. This notice of exemption will become effective on December 5, 1994, as will the related decision in Finance Docket No. 32544 and the related notice of exemption in Finance Docket No. 32544 (Sub-No. 2). 1 In Finance Docket No. 32544, Conrail proposes to lease from CSXT, for a 30-year term with an option to renew for an additional 30 years, a portion of the Indiana Subdivision from the connection with Buffalo & Pittsburgh Railroad, Inc. (B&PR), at DC Tower (milepost 0.0 at Cloe) to the connection with the Ridge Subdivision at Ridge Branch Junction (milepost 26.74). Conrail also proposes to purchase from CSXT a portion of the Ridge Subdivision, from its connection with the Indiana Subdivision at milepost 0.0 to the rail switch into the Keystone electric generating plant at milepost 5.83 at Shelocta. In Finance Docket No. 32544 (Sub-No. 2), Conrail will grant back to CSXT, for a coextensive period of time, trackage rights over the Indiana and Ridge Subdivisions that it is acquiring and leasing in Finance Docket No. 32544. The trackage rights on the Indiana Subdivision are overhead. The trackage rights on the Ridge Subdivision are both overhead and local, but the local trackage rights are restricted to limestone, limestone substitutes, ammonia, transformers and coal terminating at Keystone. The limestone and coal transportation will be further restricted to commodities originating at quarries or mines served by CSXT or short line railroads connecting solely with CSXT, or originating or transloading on The Three Rivers Railway, B&PR, Allegheny Railroad, Beech Mountain Railroad, West Virginia Northern Railroad, Elk River Railroad, or Strouds Creek & Muddlety Railroad. No traffic originating on lines owned or leased by Conrail may be transported by CSXT in local service under these trackage rights. The overhead trackage rights are restricted to movements to the portion of the Ridge Subdivision between Shelocta and Clarksburg and will terminate if CSXT abandons that portion of track. This notice is filed under 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(7). If the notice contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio . Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke will not automatically stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: John J. Paylor, 2001 Market Street_16A, Philadelphia, PA 19101&hyph;1416. As a condition to the use of this exemption, any employees adversely affected by the trackage rights will be protected under Norfolk and Western Ry. Co._Trackage Rights_BN, 354 I.C.C. 605 (1978), as modified in Mendocino Coast Ry., Inc._Lease and Operate, 360 I.C.C. 653 (1980). Decided: November 23, 1994. By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings. Vernon A. Williams, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29780 Filed 12&hyph;2&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7035&hyph;01&hyph;P
