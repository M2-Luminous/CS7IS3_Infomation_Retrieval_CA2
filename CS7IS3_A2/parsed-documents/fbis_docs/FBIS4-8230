We did not want to talk much about Gorazde itself. This is purely a military question, as Gorazde is not a protected zone nor has it been defined as such. Regarding its borders or its contents, according to international war law, this should be a strictly limited zone without any army apart from the United Nations Protection Forces [UNPROFOR]. The two commanders should sign an agreement on this. The Muslims have always refused to do so, hoping to expand the Gorazde zone right up to the borders of Serbia and Sandzak, to gain much more after such a military offensive, and to ensure a green line [zelena transferzala]. We briefed Mr. Churkin on our position, which is either war or peace. It cannot be a little bit of war and a little bit of peace. It cannot be war at Kupres, in Teslic, on Mount Ozren, in Doboj, along the corridor, that is, at Trebava, southward of Brcko -- everywhere where the Muslim forces are attacking us -- and in Gorazde, all until we set off into a counteroffensive. And when we set off into a counteroffensive, then (?everyone wants) to preserve peace and everywhere where Muslims still [word indistinct] for instance [name indistinct], (?Usora), and so on, one can calmly wage war there. Our position is that we want peace. Likewise, we said that our artillery is not shelling the town. Our aim is not the town's civilian targets. Our aim is to break up the Muslim offensive, the military defeat of the Muslim forces in Gorazde. You shall see; hardly a few days will pass when it will be clearly told in the West. Democratic forces in the West will clearly say what interfering in this war on the side of the Muslims means, what it means responding to calls by UNPROFOR observers in Gorazde itself who are probably being shelled by the Muslims and who are probably being threatened by the Muslims, but they are certainly not threatened by the Serbs. In any case, this is a very critical moment in our relations with UNPROFOR. We have suspended all relations with UNPROFOR. We do not know how we would and whether we would establish any relations in the future. Since the arrival of General Rose, these relations are marred all the time because Gen. Rose sometimes forgets -- as we have informed Mr. Akashi in several letters -- that he is not in the Malvinas [Falkland Islands] or in an English colony; he is on Serbian territory and should behave as someone who is impartial and who must respect this people and its dignity.
