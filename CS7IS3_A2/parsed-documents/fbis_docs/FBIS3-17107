In connection with the said appeal the Central Electoral Commission declares that: In accordance with Article 5 of the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea, the organization and activity of state authorities of the Republic of Crimea shall be based on a separation of powers, with actions in violation of this condition being deemed anticonstitutional. The organization of the work of electoral commissions is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Council of Crimea. The executive's demand for actions by the electoral commissions for which provision is not made by the Republic of Crimea law "Election of Deputies of the Supreme Council of Crimea" without the corresponding decision of the Supreme Council of Crimea is not based on law. Considering the difficulty of the elections conducted simultaneously by the electoral commissions of deputies of the Supreme Council of Crimea and the Supreme Council of Ukraine, the Central Electoral Commission calls the attention of the electoral commissions to the need for unswerving compliance with the Republic of Crimea Constitution and the Republic of Crimea law "Election of the Supreme Council of Crimea" and will adopt the necessary measures to ensure legality in their activity. Expressing a protest against the unfounded assertions of the president of the Republic of Crimea concerning the Central Electoral Commission's violations of legislation of the Republic of Crimea, the Central Electoral Commission appeals to the electorate, political parties, and other public associations of the citizens and the workforce to refrain from actions putting political pressure on members of the electoral commissions and to display forbearance and organization in order to ensure that the elections of deputies to the Supreme Council of Crimea on 27 March 1994 be held in an atmosphere of observance of democracy and in full conformity with the requirements of Republic of Crimea legislation. [Signed] Central Electoral Commission for the Election of Deputies of the Supreme Council of Crimea * * * We asked V. Alsufyev, chairman of the Central Electoral Commission, to answer this question: Does this statement mean deadlock and a boycott of the president's poll decree? "No, it does not. There is no deadlock and no boycott. A poll is possible. And the Central Electoral Commission is prepared to assist in its execution. But the execution of a poll, not a consultative referendum as signified by this word in the president's edict. The execution of the latter requires, according to the law, a special decision by the Supreme Council."
