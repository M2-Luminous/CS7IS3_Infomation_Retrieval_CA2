FBIS3-41474 "jpten003___94082" JPRS-TEN-94-003 Document Type:JPRS Document Title:Environmental Issues 7 February 1994 CENTRAL EURASIA UKRAINE Nuclear Experts on START-I Scientific, Ecological Aspects WS1901154494 WS1901154494 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Kiev UT-1 Television Network in Ukrainian at 1955 GMT on 18 January carries the program ``Nonnuclear Ukraine'' providing scientific and ecological justification for the signing of the tripartite U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian agreement by President Kravchuk. The program is attended by Ukrainian Academy of Sciences chairman Borys Paton, unidentified deputy chairman of the same academy, Viktor Zelenskyy, manager of the Academy of Sciences Institute of Physics, Nur Nigmatullin, first deputy chairman of the Nuclear Committee, Mykola Steinberg, chairman of the State Committee for Nuclear and Radiation Security, and Leonid Kapkan, head of the department at the Institute of Physical-Organic Chemistry. Borys Paton opens the program saying that the signing of the treaty in Moscow by President Leonid Kravchuk is ``an event with a historic meaning long-awaited by mankind.'' He points out that the legislature should promptly ratify the agreement, because otherwise, Ukraine will face ``political and economic hardships.'' Paton underlines that the issue of security guarantees for Ukraine has been finally resolved, following a long period of ``evading'' this problem by both the United States and Russia. Paton believes that readiness to grant Ukraine security guarantees facilitated the signing of the agreement. He emphasizes that Ukraine has been a merely nominal owner of, and has not exercised control over, the nuclear missiles deployed on its territory due to lack of necessary facilities and qualified personnel. In Paton's opinion, Ukraine has scientists, engineers, and military experts capable of dismantling the missiles in Ukraine. However, he points out that this would take a very long time and entail huge financial resources. Thus, the agreement, providing for involvement of international funds for the elimination of Ukrainian nuclear arms, will enable the elimination of the latter ``with an advantage for Ukraine.'' Paton concludes by saying that the Academy of Sciences staff positively assesses the signing of the agreement by the Ukrainian president and believes that the Supreme Council will ratify it. Viktor Zelenskyy enumerates the facilities and equipment necessary for launching nuclear missiles which are not available in Ukraine. These include tracking stations and tracking satellites. Neither does Ukraine have the software and computers capable of correcting missiles' flight paths. Thus, ``Ukraine has had a gun but has not known how to pull the trigger or where the bullet will fly.'' Adding to the discussion, Nur Nigmatullin says that it is ``practically impossible'' for Ukraine to create its own infrastructure for maintaining and servicing the missiles, and signing the agreement on eliminating the latter was the only sound resolution. Speaking of Ukraine's chances to build its own nuclear arms, an unidentified speaker points out that Ukraine is a state with highly developed industries. However, to produce nuclear arms it would have to train qualified personnel, conduct scientific research in the field of splitting the isotopes of uranium-235, and build reactors for producing plutonium and tritium. Ukraine's scientific potential permits this. A nuclear warhead is a very hi-tech product, and Ukraine having no experience in this field, would have to establish a design bureau and a research institute in the Republic and furnish them with equipment. Finally, the process would involve creating entire new industries. However, Ukraine's lack of test-ranges would still be the main factor precluding the building of nuclear weapons in Ukraine. Commenting on ecological aspects of nuclear arms stationing in Ukraine, Viktor Zelenskyy points out that the liquid propellant in Ukrainian nuclear missiles is ``enough to cover half of Ukraine with a 500-meter layer of a highly poisonous substance.'' Half of the Ukrainian population would die ``provided there is no wind or rain.'' Zelenskyy believes that President Kravchuk undoubtedly took the ecological aspect into account when signing the Moscow agreement. Adding to the discussion, Leonid Kapkan says that the maximum admissible concentration of the liquid propellant ``heptyl'' in the atmosphere is 1/10,000 grams per cubic meter, while ``hundreds of tonnes'' of the substance are stored in Ukraine. He points out that the Institute of Physical-Organic Chemistry, aware of the fact that Ukraine is a ``powerful'' spacecraft producer has developed a technology permitting the processing of heptyl into a harmless salt and, if needed, back into heptyl with losses not exceeding 15 percent of the substance. According to Leonid Kapkan, the technology developed by the Donbass Institute of Agroindustrial Technologies brought about a 50 percent increase in crops of wheat and barley in test-fields. Answering the moderator's question on what will happen if the legislature refuses to ratify the Moscow agreement, Mykola Steinberg, chairman of the State Committee for Nuclear and Radiation Security, says that maintaining and servicing nuclear arms is as complicated as producing them. The processes under way regarding warheads will make them worthless in the future. On the other hand, the expiration of the missiles' warranty time period will make them dangerous and extremely expensive to dismantle. According to Nur Nigmatullin, nuclear devices of Ukrainian-based warheads will be processed into fuel sufficient for six to seven years of the 10 Ukrainian reactors' operation. Nigmatullin points out that Ukraine will not receive this kind of fuel free; the costs will be some 30 percent lower than the current ones. Given the dramatic situation in supplies of power resources, including nuclear fuel, Ukraine will be able to save ``the badly needed billions of rubles.'' As a ``future user'' of this fuel, Nigmatullin appeals to the legislature to ratify the agreement, and assist nuclear power engineering in Ukraine that covers 35 percent of the demand for electric power in the Republic.
