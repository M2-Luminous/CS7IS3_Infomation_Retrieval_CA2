The pamphlet, a copy of which was sent to SAPA on Tuesday [22 March], reads: "Whiteman, with your lying tongue you stole our land, enslaved us, jailed us, tortured us, killed us. Now the time has come for us to take revenge. You will now cry tears of blood for your past actions". Another pamphlet being distributed under Azapo's name reads: "Whiteman! We don't care who you are, who you work for, what party you belong to, you are the people's enemy. You must die! Viva Azapo viva". Azapo said in a statement on Tuesday it rejected the pamphlets "with the contempt it deserves. Azapo distances itself from the pamphlet because it does not emanate from the organisation nor any of its formations. The bogus nature of the pamphlet is thereby proving that this is the dirty tricks and work of sinister forces who want to create an excuse for attacking Azapo members because of the organisation's unwavering commitment to expose and fight against a sell-out political settlement." The organisation was alerted to the distribution of the pamphlet by the South African Rail Commuter Corporation.
