The military panel found seven senior officers, including the military intelligence chief, responsible for the unprecedented assault on the northern Pooneryn army and navy complex on November 11, the sources said. Former army commander General Cecil Waidyaratne, who resigned at the end of December after taking responsibility for the attack, forwarded the findings of the inquiry to President Dingiri Banda Wijetunga on Sunday. "Yes. I took responsibility but not the blame. Like Jesus Christ, I had to take responsibility for the others. I was crucified, while others slept," Waidyaratne told AFP. He said the military panel appointed by him apportioned blame on officers found responsible for not preventing the debacle, but it was up to the government to initiate either court martial proceedings or take any other action. Military sources said the findings of the four-man court ran to nearly 200 pages and was a serious indictment of the military's field commanders leading the battle against separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). A lieutenant colonel, who was promoted full colonel for holding out against the LTTE for three straight days at Pooneryn, was also found to be partly responsible for the debacle, the sources said. The court of inquiry passed strictures against the northern commander Major General Rohan Daluwatte, chief of military intelligence Brigadier L. Balagalle, two other brigadiers, a colonel, a lieutenant colonel and a major. They said the military would have to rethink its war strategy against the LTTE following the report submitted by the court compromising three brigadiers and a colonel, the sources said. The LTTE is leading a protracted guerrilla campaign to establish an independent homeland in Sri Lanka's northern and eastern regions where the two million Tamil minority is concentrated.
