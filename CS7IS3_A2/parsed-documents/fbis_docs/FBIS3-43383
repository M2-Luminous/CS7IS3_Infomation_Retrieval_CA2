At the center of that address, which took place in the conference room of Hydro-Congo company, was the restructuring of the Congolese Armed Forces and their integration into development. Other issues were also examined at the meeting, in particular problems of security and keeping order. [passage omitted] Let us listen to the prime minister as he talked about the restructuring of the public security force and its present challenges: [Begin Yhombi-Opango recording] On the domestic field, our public force was not effectively prepared to face the new dangers that faced us, such as the massive distribution of weapons and of war munitions to the civilian population; the destruction and sabotage of public infrastructures and buildings; looting; barricades; dastardly assassinations; armed robberies; raping; and narcotics. All these crimes constitute for the public force and for the authorities challenges that must be met. Taking into account the [word indistinct] of the problems raised, the government was of the view that the reorganization of the public force, in view of the present constitutional and political situations, constitutes a decisive step towards the objectives we want to attain. This is why a document relating to this reorganization has been drafted and is currently being examined by the parliament. [end recording] The prime minister, Jacques Joachim Yhombi-Opango, also spoke about the recruitment of Congolese youths into our Armed Forces, a recruitment exercise which became a reality today as the president of the Republic, Professor Pascal Lissouba, signed the order for the recruiting of a contingent of 2,000 youths. Concerning this recruitment exercise, the prime minister informed the officers of the Brazzaville garrison about the objectives of this exercise. Listen to Jacques Joachim Yhombi-Opango: [Begin Yhombi-Opango recording] This recruitment will enable us to reduce or to solve the staffing problem and will also contribute to raising the number of junior officers within the public force. The Congolese Armed Forces alone will receive about 33 percent of the recruits. Any military force draws its ability from the enthusiasm, the spontaneity, and the commitment of the youths. The mission which the head of state has entrusted upon us is to replace our public force considerably with younger blood, in order to make it an efficient and result-oriented tool in the service of the nation.
