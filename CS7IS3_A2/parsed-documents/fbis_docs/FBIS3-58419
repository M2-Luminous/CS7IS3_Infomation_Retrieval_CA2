Lambeck: "Kohl: The Bundeswehr Will Retain 370,000 Men"] [Text] Bonn -- In view of the unstable situation in former Yugoslavia and the uncertainty surrounding the Russian reform process, Chancellor Kohl wants to maintain the Bundeswehr at its current level of 370,000 men. In an interview with the NEUE OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG, Kohl said that what remained crucial for him was "that our armed forces remain capable of discharging alliance responsibilities, are prepared for action, equipped to modern standards, and that we retain conscription." Freedom and peace could can still not be obtained free of charge, as the example of Yugoslavia shows. Setbacks in the reform process in Russia would have "unforese+eable consequences." Kohl therefore rejected "rash number games lacking sufficient thought" about the size of the Bundeswehr. In the Defense Ministry, Kohl's statements are being viewed in the context of Finance Minister's Theo Waigel's (Christian Social Union) announcement next week setting overall minimum expenditure for individual budgets. It appears that the defense budget is now taboo in the eyes of the chancellor. In the Federal Chancellery, it is also being said that Kohl is still convinced of the need for an effective military. Nevertheless, that does not mean that Volker Ruehe will receive more than the budget of 48.6 billion German marks [DM] that has been allocated for this year. However, according to information that DIE WELT has obtained from the Defense Ministry, if the budget of DM48.6 billion is not increased, the Bundeswehr will be reduced from 370,000 to 350,000 by the end of this year, because of a shortage of money. A reduction of 20,000 from the level of 370,000 is the limit for a "structurally neutral range" for the armed forces. What that means is that a reduction of 20,000 can be absorbed without having to change Bundeswehr structures or conscription being jeopardized.
