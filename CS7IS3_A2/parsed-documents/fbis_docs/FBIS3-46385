The basic guiding points for the adjustment of the policy to attract foreign investment are as follows: --Maintaining the stability and continuity of existing policies. --Gradually making industrial policy and taxation policy for foreign-funded enterprises converge with those for domestic enterprises, thus effecting fair competition and equal treatment. --Adapting relevant regulations to the requirements of GATT rules and international practice. Local policies for attracting foreign investment will also undergo major adjustments. Over the last 10 years and more, China's opening up to the outside world was mainly effected by its policy of opening up the coastal areas and offering favorable policies to coastal areas, special economic zones, and development zones. Henceforth, the same policies will be applied to various types of localities. New development zones will no longer enjoy favorable tax terms, which used to be the main attractive feature of the development zones. In backward areas, foreign-funded enterprises will be allowed to engage in simple processing, but foreign investment in such industries will be limited in the coastal areas and special economic zones. On the other hand, the Chinese Government will revoke special favorable policies applied to overseas Chinese investors and investors from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, and will revoke the policy of cutting taxes in half applied to some neighboring countries, especially the CIS countries. That is, the same policies will be applied to foreign investors from all countries and regions. In the future, the Chinese Government will open up markets to attract new and high technology and to attract investment from large transnational corporations. The Chinese Government will continue to encourage three types of foreign-funded enterprises to export their products, to effect import substitution, and to maintain the foreign exchange balance in their business operations. It will also formulate favorable policies to encourage foreign investment in agriculture, in the technological transformation of large and medium-sized enterprises, and in the construction of urban infrastructure.
