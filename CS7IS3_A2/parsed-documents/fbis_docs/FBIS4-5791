Security Council if there is no progress on the issue by early May, a top Japanese Foreign Ministry official said Thursday [14 April]. Hans Blix, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), made the remark in a meeting with Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito, the official said. Saito told Blix that Japan wants to seek a solution to the North Korean nuclear problem through dialogue, he said. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, declined to elaborate on the meeting. Blix is in Japan to attend an annual meeting in Hiroshima of the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum. He said in Hiroshima that the IAEA has sent a letter to North Korea asking that inspectors be allowed access to a radiochemical laboratory but that Pyongyang has not responded yet. IAEA inspectors were allowed into North Korea in March for their first look at nuclear facilities there in more than a year. But they were unable to determine if radioactive materials had been diverted to military purposes because North Korea blocked the inspectors from a key laboratory. North Korea says its nuclear program is peaceful.
