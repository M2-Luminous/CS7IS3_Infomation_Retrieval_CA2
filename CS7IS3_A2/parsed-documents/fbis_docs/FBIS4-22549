But For How Long?"] [Text] As we know, a few years ago, Ukraine's legislative base for investment was the most liberal in the whole CIS. But investors did not have the opportunity to rejoice for long: a series of government decrees and directives virtually nullified the laws passed by the Supreme Council, as a result of which the investment climate in Ukraine became intolerable. It seems that the government has now realized that investments are a necessary thing. Thus, there was recent approval for the "State Program To Encourage Foreign Investment in Ukraine," which so far has produced no impressive results, even though it came into force on 1 March 1994. Specialists believe that the program will begin to function in a real way after 1 April -- that is, when the benefits to investors that the program provides come into force. Thus, as of 1 April of this year, foreign investors will enjoy the following benefits: 1. Accelerated rates of depreciation on machiney and equipment. 2. Exemption from profits tax for a period that will depend on the size of the foreign investment: for investments up to and including $500,000 --one year; for investments above $500,000 and up to and including $5 million -- two years; for investments above $5 million and up to and including $50 million -- three years; for investments above $50 million --five years. 3. Tax credits on preferential terms on taxes that are subject to payment during the first three years of operation of enterprises with foreign investments. 4. A refund of 50% of the import duties paid on producer goods brought in from abroad and 100% of the duty paid on imported parts, accessories, and machine units for joint projects upon submission of evidence that these were used by an enterprise with foreign investment in its own production. This benefit is in effect for five years from the moment that the International Cooperation and Investment Agency approves the foreign investment project. 5. Credits on preferential terms granted by authorized banks from a special budget fund created for this purpose on the basis of a credit agreement, which must also be approved by the International Cooperation and Investment Agency and the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine. 6. Insurance for investment risks from a special budget fund for insurance guarantees. Observers believe that even with the existence of such benefits, there will be no flood of investments into Ukraine. No investor is going to bring his millions to Ukraine only to read in the newspaper some time later that these benefits have been abolished because of a decision to implement measures to stabilize the Ukrainian karbovanets or some other such eventuality. The government of Ukraine has already earned the reputation of being the most inscrutable government in Europe. For that reason, such guarantees can only be given by the president, and he has not yet said how long these benefits will remain irrevocable.
