ACTION: Notice; extension of delay of effective date of final rule. SUMMARY: Existing regulations require that a PHA or IHA not take any action to demolish or dispose of a public or Indian housing project or a portion of a public or Indian housing project without obtaining HUD approval under the provisions of 24 CFR parts 970 or 905, respectively. On November 4, 1993, the Department promulgated a final rule that clarifies that until such time as HUD approval may be obtained, the PHA or IHA must not take any action intended to further the demolition or disposition of a public housing project or a portion of a public housing project without obtaining HUD approval under 24 CFR parts 970 or 905, respectively. Furthermore, until such time as HUD approval is obtained, the PHA or IHA must prevent further deterioration of the physical condition of the project, other than deterioration incident to normal use, and is responsible under the ACC to continue providing emergency repair services and routine maintenance for occupied projects. On December 6, 1993, a notice was published to delay the effective date of the final rule from December 6, 1993, until February 4, 1994. This notice further delays the effective date of the final rule for an additional 60 days. EFFECTIVE DATE: Effective February 4, 1994, the effective date of the final rule published at 58 FR 58784 is delayed until April 5, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William R. Minning, Director, Policy Division, Office of Management and Policy, (202) 708&hyph;0713. The telecommunications device for deaf persons (TDD) is available at (202) 708&hyph;0850.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On November 4, 1993, at 58 FR 58784, the Department issued a final rule regarding required and permitted actions that a PHA or IHA may take prior to approval of an application for demolition or disposition of a public or Indian Housing project or a portion of a public or Indian housing project. The final rule had an effective date of December 6, 1993, and a notice was published in the Federal Register on December 6, 1993 (58 FR 64141) that delayed that effective date until February 4, 1994, because serious concerns had been expressed about the impact of some of the provisions of the final rule on residents and resident organizations. In the spirit of cooperation, the Department wishes to further delay the effective date of the final rule so that further review of this rule may be conducted. Accordingly, in FR Doc. 93&hyph;29687, published in the Federal Register on December 6, 1993, at 58 FR 64141, the effective date for the referenced final rule regarding the Public and Indian Housing Program is further delayed until April 5, 1994. Dated: January 26, 1994. Michael B. Janis, General Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;2389 Filed 2&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4210&hyph;33&hyph;M
