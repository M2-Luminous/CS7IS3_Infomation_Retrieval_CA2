Shumeyko told journalists that Zhirinovskiy "is adroitly using the national idea" to reach his own political ends. He said that after the disintegration of the Soviet Union many Russian people found themselves beyond Russia's boundaries and are extremely sensitive to the situation. In his address, Zhirinovskiy declared that "Russia has its own idea of democracy and the majority of Russians are against the country's participation in the Council of Europe and NATO". He stressed that Russia needs no "teachers of democracy" and added that "we have our own standards and we will not permit the West to experiment with Russia". Zhirinovskiy shocked the audience by saying, "NATO flyers are now bombing Bosnia, but it is not ruled out that a time may come when other pilots will bomb other targets". Before the beginning of the plenary session, Zhirinovskiy was so active in attracting the attention of reporters and cameramen to his own person that the chairman had to ask him to leave the room. He added that "the Council of Europe is not Hollywood, thank God". Zhirinovskiy's speech was repeatedly interrupted by outbursts of indignation, and when he finished the chairman of the State Duma's international affairs committee Vladimir Lukin said the other members of the Russian delegation do not share Zhirinovskiy's views.
