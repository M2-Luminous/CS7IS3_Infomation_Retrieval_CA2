FR940617-0-00138 FR940617-0-00026 S. Averaging, Banking and Trading (ABT) 1. Inclusion of ABT EPA proposed ABT for NO X emissions from large nonroad CI engines. This market-based incentive program is designed to provide manufacturers with flexibility in meeting the NO X standard while achieving a target level of environmental benefits. Many commenters supported the inclusion of ABT. Others opposed the program. One commenter believes that the program would be overly complex, difficult to enforce, and would decrease the effectiveness of the standard by increasing the overall emissions. EPA disagrees. The target level of environmental benefits was proposed with ABT in mind. In EPA's opinion, and as discussed in the NPRM, the flexibilities afforded by ABT are appropriate to achieve the 9.2 g/kW-hr NO X average emission standard and the resultant target 37 percent reduction in fleet emissions upon fleet turnover. EPA is confident that the target level of environmental benefits will be achieved by this regulation. 2. Participation of California-certified Engines in ABT EPA proposed that engines sold in California and subject to California emissions standards would not be included in the federal ABT program. EPA also proposed that engines sold in California but preempted from California regulation or not subject to California emission standards (primarily construction and farm equipment below 130 kW (175 hp)) be eligible to participate in ABT. One commenter preferred to have a 50-state credit exchange program which would include all engines shipped to all 50 states regardless of the state regulations. Other commenters believed that the engines subject to state regulations should be excluded from participation in the program. Also, one commenter preferred that all engines sent to California not be included in the federal ABT program and recommended the compromise of having a California-only averaging set. EPA believes that to maintain the effectiveness of the separate California and national emission standards, any engines both sold in California and subject to California regulations (or both subject to regulations and sold in other states that adopt California's regulations under section 209(e)(2)(B)) should not be allowed to participate in the federal ABT program. Although a 50-state scenario would reduce the tracking burden on manufacturers, reduced tracking burden is not a sufficient reason in EPA's opinion to include California engines. Because California does not allow ABT, all engines both sold in the California market and subject to California regulations will be at or below the NO X standard finalized by EPA today. Therefore, including these engines in the national average could cause the average emissions of engines in the other 49 states to exceed the standard. Finally, engines sold in California but not subject to California emission regulations are subject to federal regulations and, thus, may participate in ABT. 3. Power Ratings for Credit Calculations EPA proposed to calculate credits by taking the difference between the standard and the FEL, times the sales volume of engines participating in the program, times the power rating. The power rating was proposed to be the largest power rating within an engine family for those families using credits, and the smallest rating within an engine family for families generating credits. Some commenters claimed that the proposed method for determining the power rating for credit calculations translates into a significant (greater than 50 percent) reduction in the number of credits generated and an increase in the number of credits used. They recommended that families be divided into subfamilies, and the most environmentally-safe power rating be drawn from each subfamily for credit calculations. An engine family would have to consist of a broad range of power ratings to realize either a 50 percent reduction in credit generation or a 50 percent increase in credit use. EPA stated in the NPRM that it would not allow multi-configuration engine families to be arbitrarily divided into multiple engine families to maximize credit generation or minimize credit usage. However, in those specific cases where such a broad range of power ratings occur in one family, a manufacturer would likely be able to demonstrate, consistent with ยง89.116&hyph;96(d) of the regulations, that the expected useful life emission characteristics of some configurations within a broad engine family warrant a separate engine family designation. This would mitigate the credit reduction caused by extremely broad engine families while maintaining EPA's intent that subcategories not be established for the sole purpose of maximizing credits. 4. Discounting of Credits EPA's proposed ABT program did not include a discount on credits. The proposal did specify a first in, first out (FIFO) accounting system for credits used in averaging (see ยง89.204&hyph;96(b)); this effectively extends FIFO to banking and trading because in order to ultimately use banked or traded credits, they must be averaged. Some commenters approved of the absence of a discount on banked or traded credits. One commenter disapproved because discounting, which is included in the on-highway heavy duty averaging program, is viewed as ensuring that a tangible environmental benefit will accrue from a banking program. This commenter would prefer a reduction in available banked credits through discounting or the use of a last in, first out (LIFO) accounting system to mitigate this effect over time.
