He spoke at a news conference after the end of a military training session at the Yavor training ground of the Carpathian military district, in which the Air Force, artillery pieces and tanks took part. Along with the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, military attaches of a number of foreign counties watched the shooting practice. "The expenditures of 40 billion karbovanets, as calculated by some journalists, on the military exercise in these difficult days are still necessary," Kravchuk said. "If we want today to have 150 grammes of pork on our tables instead of 100 grammes, tomorrow we shall have no army and, consequently, no independence." Problems raised at the news conference included the stock-taking at the Black Sea Fleet, the creation of a special bilateral commission and the conversion of nuclear armaments in Ukraine. The president expressed satisfaction over the decision of the Central Electoral Commission of the Crimea to hold a social opinion poll instead of a referendum, as planned by Yuriy Meshkov. "The opinion poll will have no consequences, but will cost a lot of money," Kravchuk pointed out. Touching upon the forthcoming presidential elections in Ukraine, Kravchuk stressed again that he was not going to run for presidency and explained it by the absence of a new constitution, laws on the structure of the state management system and the status of the president, which the outgoing parliament failed to adopt. The Ukrainian president hopes that the elections will take place on 27 March, otherwise Ukraine will be swept by chaos.
