Their discipline is weak and they have links with both the illegal arms trade and other crime. The Foreign Ministry statement says that the Estonian police are investigating several cases of Russian servicemen selling their arms to criminals locally. The Estonian police confiscated 500 kilograms of a powerful explosive substance from a Russian junior officer in February 1993. It would have been sufficient to blow up the World Trade Center in New York. At the same location the police confiscated 12,000 cartridges that were intended for sale. Two months ago the police found a train standing near the [training] nuclear reactor at Paldiski [Russian naval base near Tallinn], which had been unguarded since November. There were numerous anti-tank shells in its 22 cars. Local people had already succeeded in emptying several of the wagons and had sold their booty. According to the Foreign Ministry, it is assumed that the weapons are now held by criminals, BNS [Baltic News Service] notes.
