Speaking at a press conference at the end of his visit, Qian termed his visit to Iran as "successful and fruitful," hoping that the two countries will promote their bilateral relation in various fields. "The Chinese and Iranian peoples shared historical and friendly relations and bilateral cooperation between the two countries has been well expanded in recent years," said the foreign minister, who arrived here Friday [4 March]. Trade between the two countries hit the historical height last year, he said, but "both the two sides believe that there are more potentials for cooperation in various fields." Iran, which is the bridge between Asia and Europe, has its strategic importance, said Qian, adding that Beijing-Tehran relation is based on mutual respect, mutual benefit and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. He believed that the friendly relations between the two Asian countries will help maintain peace and stability in the region. Referring to the result of his tour of five Asian countries, including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Iran, Qian said that Asian countries have many points in common despite their differences in religion, politics and culture. All these countries are trying to improve their economic situation and are ready for regional cooperation, the Chinese vice-premier said, adding that these countries share same or similar views on many important issues. He also announced China's readiness to expand friendly cooperation with these Asian countries. Asked about China's view on the report that Washington set the improvement of human rights state in China as the precondition for extending most favored trade status to China, Qian opposed any linkage between politics and trade, saying that they are two separate issues and there are no direct links between the two issues. On his part, Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati said that bilateral ties as well as regional and international issues were the main topics for Qian's talks with Iranian leaders. Iran and China have achieved a great deal of successes in their cooperation, particularly in economic cooperation, Velayati said. Trade between the two countries exceeded 700 million U.S. dollars last year, the highest in the history of the two countries. Iran and China share same or similar views on many regional and international issues, said Velayati, adding that relations between the two countries are based on independent foreign policy. He hoped that the bilateral relations will be further expanded.
