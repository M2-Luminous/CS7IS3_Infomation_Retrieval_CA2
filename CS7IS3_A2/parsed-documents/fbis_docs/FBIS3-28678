The ministry had urged that a tax cut proposal be combined with a revenue-boosting step to finance it. Fujii told reporters that Tuesday's agreement was not based solely on the ministry proposal, but did take it into account. He also said the whole amount of the tax cut will be funded by deficit-covering bond issues.
