Colombian oil sales to Cuba will start in July. We will sell them between 15,000 to 20,000 barrels a day; something like a third of what the island's consumes. [Mines and Energy Minister Guido Nule Amin] "What we are trying to do is establish commercial relations [with Cuba] similar to the ones we have established with other countries in the world." [Gutierrez] People here, however, see several stains on the business, not caused by the black gold per se. Cuba does not have a sound payment capability and experienced oil people do not like the agreement very much. [Former Mining Minister Juan Camilo Restrepo] "Colombia should not subsidize [Cuba] by selling oil cheaper than what can be obtained elsewhere. Second, the sale has to be carried out under strict banking and commercial conditions." [Gutierrez] The Cubans have presented the possibility of refining our oil in their country as part of their payment. [Former Mining Minister Guillermo Perry] "It depends on the efficiency of their refineries, how much they will pay for the crude oil, and the price we will get for products other than the gasoline we need." [Gutierrez] For others who know this business, the oil refinery should be done here. [Perry] "What Colombia needs is to have an export petrochemical refinery, and it should be established in the Morrosquillo gulf where the two oil pipelines merge." [Gutierrez] In addition to the economic issues, the political ones also cast doubts on this business. Colombia is seen as giving oxygen to the Castro dictatorship and this jeopardizes its commercial relations with the United States.
