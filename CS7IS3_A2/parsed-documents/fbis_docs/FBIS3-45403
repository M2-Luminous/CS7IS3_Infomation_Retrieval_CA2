Liu assured that China always insists on its national sovereignty, but it holds that disputes should be solved through diplomatic means and dialogs by leaders of the countries. Try Sutrisno stated that the exchanges of visits by senior officials of Indonesia and China will surely promote mutual understanding and further strengthen the already existed friendly relations between the two peoples and two armed forces. After briefing the Chinese guests on Indonesia's success of economic construction in the past 25 years and the tasks for the future 25-year long term economic development, the vice president stressed that the tasks need an environment of peace, stability in the world and in the Asian-Pacific region in particular.

He said with heavy economic construction tasks, China would develop friendly relations with all the countries in the world, neighboring countries in particular. Vice Chairman Liu and his entourage flew to Bali this evening after paying a visit to the Lastern Fleet in Surabaya.
