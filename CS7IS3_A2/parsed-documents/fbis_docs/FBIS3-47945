"If the political reform package failed to clear the upper chamber as the result of SDP legislators' opposition, I will take the responsibility as the SDP chairman, as our party would not be able to disclaim resultant political responsibility," he said. Murayama made the remark at a meeting of 73 legislators of the upper chamber, called one day before Friday's crucial vote that is regarded as make or break for the five-month-old administration of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. The upper house will hold a plenary session at 3 p.m. Friday to vote on the government-proposed package, upon which Hosokawa has repeatedly pledged to stake his political future. The wording "take the responsibility" was immediately taken as expressing Murayama's readiness to give up his chairmanship of the largest party in the ruling coalition in such an eventuality. Murayama pleaded with the legislators not to defect to the opposition side in voting on the package. On Wednesday, three SDP legislators vowed to vote against the package, saying its loopholes undermines the package's ability to scare legislators away from taking bribes, while asserting the proposed 274 single-seat constituencies would deal a heavy blow to the SDP in a next election. Five more SDP legislators have publicly voiced their opposition to the package, citing similar concerns about its possible adverse fallouts. At least three other SDP legislators have abstained from vowing to comply with the SDP leadership's instructions to vote with the coalition in Friday's vote. The coalition has only a slim majority in the 252 upper chamber. The majority is 126 votes, as its chairman Bunbei Hara is not qualified to vote. The opposition camp brandishes 117 seats. This means that defections of only nine SDP rebels to the opposition side could scuttle the package, unless similar defections on the LDP side broke up the LDP's unity. Murayama said, "I want you to hand down your final judgments on the package with an eye to the issue of what would happen to the relationship between the cabinet and our party and how our party would be pressed to account for the failure of the package" if the package got bogged down. The SDP, which has in the opposition for 38 years until the Liberal Democratic Party was ousted from power last August, finally could obtain six cabinet posts, including the office of minister in charge of political reform, in Hosokawa's 21-member cabinet. The SDP, with its 76 upper house legislators, secured its intra- cabinet presence after a July 18 general election by throwing its political weight behind Hosokawa's bid to form a coalition government. Murayama said Sadao Yamahana, a state minister charged with political reform, and other ministers may be expelled from the cabinet if the package were voted down.
