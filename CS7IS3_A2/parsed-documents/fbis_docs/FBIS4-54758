HOSPODARSKE NOVINY asked him in this context: [Francikova] How does your statement tally with some of the nonliberal measures that Slovakia recently introduced against the Czech Republic? [Magvasi] As far as the import surcharge is concerned, we introduced it because our economic situation at the beginning of the year made it necessary. We realize that it is not a liberal measure. The development [of the trade balance] has markedly improved, however, and, if this trend continues, we are ready to abolish the import surcharge by 26 June of this year. At that time, we will be conducting talks on it in the GATT Secretariat in Brussels. [Francikova] Do you consider fair, in this context, the introduction of certificates for imports of food from the Czech Republic? Slovak customs officials have been demanding these certificates as of 1 May. [Magvasi] I insist that the certificates are not an economic measure. We are concerned about the protection of consumers and, at the same time, about improving trade between our two republics. We did not violate the GATT rules, which demand that measures of this kind be announced some time before their introduction. We announced our intention at the beginning of the year, in the law on the state budget. [Francikova] Is it realistic to expect that a treaty on the mutual recognition of certificates between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic will eventually be signed? [Magvasi] We have succeeded in concluding a treaty on the mutual recognition of attestations issued by Czech and Slovak testing laboratories. According to the European norm, certificates are issued by national bodies of accreditation [akreditacni organy]. At the last meeting of the Customs Union Council, it was noted that the mutual recognition of certificates is conditional on changes to some laws. In a situation in which certificates are confirmed by bodies of accreditation, it is pointless to change any laws. [Francikova] In other words, you no longer envision the signing of a treaty on the complete recognition of certificates. [Magvasi] Time will tell.
