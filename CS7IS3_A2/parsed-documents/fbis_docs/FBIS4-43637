"We made a request to North Korean officials and we were granted without problem a two-week extension on the inspectors' visas which expire at the end of the month," Kyd said. He said that an IAEA request for visas for two new inspectors who would replace their colleagues has not yet been addressed. On Monday another IAEA spokesman, Hans-Friedrich Meyer, said that that the two inspectors supervising the Yongbyon experimental reactor must be replaced as they are working under difficult conditions. Some 8,000 spent nuclear rods were removed from the reactor before the arrival of the inspectors to supervise the process, but the rods are still too hot for any extraction of plutonium. Plutonium is a key ingredient to producing a nuclear bomb. Sources close to the Agency said North Korea has new fuel rods ready but there are no signs that it is planning to recharge the experimental reactor. They said Pyongyong wants to examine the reactor first, especially since some fuel rods had broken, causing a radiation leak. But it could be put back into service before the winter to help meet the country's energy needs. A crisis over North Korea's refusal to open its nuclear facilities to inspections was defused over the weekend after Pyongyong promised to allow fresh IAEA visits and offered to hold a breakthrough summit with South Korea, almost 50 years since the two were divided by the Cold War and the ensuing Korean conflict. The freezing of North Korea's nuclear programme and international inspection of its facilities is the main condition being set by the United States for dropping its threat of sanctions and returning to joint talks.
