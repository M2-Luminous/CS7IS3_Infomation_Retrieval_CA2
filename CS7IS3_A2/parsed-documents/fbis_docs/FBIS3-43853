Angolan circles have interpreted the move as a return to the days of the Russian-Cuban domination with dangerous consequences for Angola and its negotiating process. The cooperation accords were signed in Luanda yesterday by Venancio de Moura and Roberto Robaina, Fidel Castro's envoy and foreign affairs minister of the island of tobacco. Roberto Robaina carried a message from Fidel Castro which says Cuba is interested in sending occupation troops in exchange for Angolan crude. The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola will never tolerate this because it violates the New York Accord signed by Cuba, South Africa, and Namibia. The accord resulted in Namibia's independence and the withdrawal of 60,000 Cubans from Angola. Asked to comment on yesterday's accord, a senior Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] official said Cuba misses the profits it earned through the war it waged in Angola, but it should be reminded that the days of empires are over. Yesterday Western diplomats were cited by Johannesburg's Channel Africa as fearing the resumption of Angolan-Cuban relations could endanger the Lusaka talks. After having failed to recruit mercenaries of various nationalities, the Luanda regime has opted for a return of the invading Cuban forces which plunged the country into chaos over the 16 years of their presence in Angola. There is nothing more clear about Eduardo dos Santos' shady deals with Fidel Castro than the irony of the Angola-Cuba commercial relations which are nothing but military relations. The presence of Cubans in the ranks of the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] is a fact in Cunene and Huila Provinces. Americo Paulino, our correspondent in the region, has the details: Over 10 trucks crossed the Namibian-Angolan border between 12 and 13 January 1994, carrying a Cuban contingent. The trucks headed to N'Giva. Part of the Cuban contingent will be deployed in Huila to beef up FAPLA units (?stationed) along the Lubango-Cacula-Quilenges- Caluquembe axis. Other members of the Cuban contingent will be sent to Cuvelai to reinforce FAPLA units in the Jamba-(Catuca) region to occupy the Kuvango District and then head to Huambo. FALA's Operational Command for the independent Cunene region has questioned the remarks made by Alioune Blondin Beye, UN special representative in Angola, at a news conference. UNITA has a lot of respect for Beye who said Mr. Sam Nujoma, chairman of the South-West African People's Organization and president of the Republic of Namibia, has contributed greatly to the Angolan peace process. The question is: How can Namibia contribute to peace if that country is used as a springboard for foreign (?aggression)? FALA forces are aware of the MPLA-PT's Machievalian maneuvers to deceive the Angolan and international communities with its willingness to negotiate while Cubans enter Angola through Namibia.
