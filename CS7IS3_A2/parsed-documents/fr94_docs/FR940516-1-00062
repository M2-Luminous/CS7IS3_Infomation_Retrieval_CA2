FR940516-1-00062 FR940516-1-00005 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 63 [AD&hyph;FRL&hyph;4881&hyph;6] RIN 2060&hyph;AD97 National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants Epoxy Resins Production and Non-nylon Polyamides Production AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule and notice of public hearing. SUMMARY: The proposed standard would limit emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) from existing and new facilities that manufacture polymers and resins produced from epichlorohydrin feedstock, specifically, basic liquid epoxy resins (BLR) and non-nylon polyamide resins, also known as wet strength resins (WSR). The proposed standards implement section 112(d) of the Clean Air Act (Act) amendments of 1990, which require the Administrator to regulate emissions of hazardous air pollutants listed in section 112(b) of the Act. The intent of these standards is to protect the public by requiring new and existing major sources to control emissions to the level achievable by the maximum achievable control technology (MACT), taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reductions, any nonair quality and other air quality related health and environmental impacts, and energy requirements. DATES: Comments. Comments must be received on or before July 15, 1994. Public Hearing. If anyone contacts EPA requesting to speak at a public hearing by June 6, 1994, a public hearing will be held on June 15, 1994, beginning at 10 a.m. Persons interested in attending the hearing should call Ms. Lina Hanzely at (919) 541&hyph;5673 to verify that a hearing will be held. Request to Speak at Hearing. Persons wishing to present oral testimony must contact EPA by June 6, 1994, by contacting Ms. Lina Hanzely, Chemicals and Petroleum Branch, (MD&hyph;13), U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, telephone number (919) 541&hyph;5673. ADDRESSES: Comments. Comments should be submitted (in duplicate, if possible) to: Air Docket Section (LE&hyph;131), Attention: Docket No. A&hyph;92&hyph;37, U. S.
