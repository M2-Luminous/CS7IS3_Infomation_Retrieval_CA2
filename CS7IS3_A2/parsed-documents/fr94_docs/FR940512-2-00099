FR940512-2-00099 FR940512-2-00055 18. The applicants have made the following representations with respect to how securities to be sold to Hartford Life on Scheduled Account Distribution Dates and the Scheduled Account Termination Date will be selected by HIMCO. The applicants state that the management of assets pursuant to an agreement to provide a guaranteed return calls for the use of complex and sophisticated management techniques to make certain that cash flows will be available when needed. In particular, fixed-income assets must be selected with maturities and yields that will enable the insurer to match the maturity and yield of the guaranteed return agreement. To this end, securities are purchased in the expectation that they will be liquidated on a particular date in order to provide the cash necessary to satisfy the insurer's obligation to the contractholder on that date. Under the terms of Hartford Life's Synthetic GIC, the assets of the Account will be managed in accordance with these risk management techniques. There will be a specific, identifiable pool of assets that will be internally designated from the establishment of the Account for liquidation on each Scheduled Account Distribution Date (as well as on the Scheduled Account Termination Date, when all of the remaining assets will be liquidated). In general, the securities designated to be disposed of on a particular date will have maturities on or relatively soon after that date. From time to time, depending on prevailing market conditions, the assets in an Account may be ``rebalanced''_i.e., reallocated among the Scheduled Account Distribution Dates and the Scheduled Account Termination Date. (The applicants represent that the flexibility to reallocate the assets among the Synthetic GIC's maturity dates in the face of changing market conditions is essential to the effective management of investment risks under a guaranteed return contract.) At all times, however, all the assets in the Account will be designated for liquidation on a particular Scheduled Account Distribution Date or the Scheduled Account Termination Date. The assets that will be disposed of on each Scheduled Account Distribution Date and the Scheduled Account Termination Date will thus be those assets designated to be disposed of on the relevant date, and in most cases, this designation will have been made at the time of acquisition. Regardless of whether they are sold to Hartford Life or on the open market, the assets designated for disposition on each Scheduled Account Distribution Date and the Scheduled Account Termination Date will be disposed of on the relevant date at fair market value. The securities that will be sold to Hartford Life on the Scheduled Account Distribution Dates and the Scheduled Account Termination Date will be selected by HIMCO from among the securities designated to be disposed of on those dates, based on Hartford Life's needs for securities with specific cash-flow patterns and maturities for its general account portfolio. 19. The applicants represent that they recognize that HIMCO's ``rebalancing'' of Account securities could be viewed as involving a conflict of interest, in that HIMCO would be in a position to deprive the Plan of any return in excess of the Guaranteed Rate of Interest by targeting assets expected to appreciate for sale to Hartford Life on Scheduled Account Distribution Dates. 3 However, the applicants represent that there will be no realistic opportunity for abuse in the subject transactions for the following reasons: 3 The applicants represent that this concern will not be present in connection with sales of assets to Hartford Life on the Scheduled Account Termination Date because on that date all of the assets in the Account will be disposed of in any event. (a) The likelihood that the fair market value of the assets in the Account on the Scheduled Account Termination Date will exceed the sum of the Adjusted Book Value of the Account and the Book Value Assurance Charge will be negligible. The securities that will be purchased for the Account will consist primarily of fixed-income securities with limited potential for capital appreciation, and will generally be targeted to mature on or near the Scheduled Account Distribution Dates and the Scheduled Account Termination Date. Plans will not purchase the Synthetic GIC in the expectation of a return in excess of the Guaranteed Rate of Interest; instead, they will purchase it in order to receive a guaranteed return with the additional security that direct ownership of the underlying assets will afford. (b) Any potential for abuse will be offset by a countervailing interest on the part of Hartford Life in making certain that the value of the Account is adequate to meet its contractual guarantee on the Scheduled Account Termination Date. As noted above, any excess return to the Plan will be unanticipated and unlikely. Hartford Life, on the other hand, will bear the risk that the assets in the Account will be inadequate to provide the amount guaranteed on the Scheduled Account Termination Date. This risk will be minimized if the Account retains assets which are expected to appreciate. (c) As a practical matter, abuses on a scale sufficient to materially benefit Hartford Life and adversely affect a Plan will simply not be feasible. The need to manage the assets in the Account to achieve the Guaranteed Rate of Interest will severely constrict HIMCO's flexibility to manipulate the assets disposed of on Scheduled Account Distribution Dates. To systematically pick and choose those assets with a view to selling desirable assets to Hartford Life would seriously upset the predictability of cash flows available to meet subsequent guarantees, imposing unacceptable risks on Hartford Life that would far outweigh any potential benefit of such a scheme.
