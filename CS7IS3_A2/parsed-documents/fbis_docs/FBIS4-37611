Does the fear of an imminent war -- within three to seven years, as the prime minister put it -- justify or call for greater political compromises on Israel's part with regard to the Golan Heights? [Peres] I do not think that was what the prime minister meant. We make compromises not out of fear of war but because we want to attain peace. [Zissowitz] The prime minister's remarks sound like an attempt to prepare the people for a compromise on the Golan Heights. [Peres] Yes, that definitely must be done. We began talking about a compromise on the Golan Heights at the Labor convention on the eve of the last Knesset elections. We did not conceal our position. We stated it loud and clear, and there is no reason to change those positions. [Zissowitz] Does the fear of war determine or influence the positions presented by Israel in the negotiations and the pace at which it would like the negotiations to proceed? [Peres] I do not think so. I think that what influences them is the desire to reach genuine peace for both sides. Three situations are possible: war, peace, and no war and no peace, which is the current one. The current situation exacts a heavy toll -- first and foremost: a frenzied arms race. Some people estimate that the Middle East spent $1 trillion on arms during the last decade. This is really scandalous. This deprived children of food and youths of education. What for? In addition, there is suspiciousness, kidnappings, exchanges of fire. Although this does not directly apply to the Syrian-Israeli border, such a phenomenon exists in Lebanon, where the Syrians have a say in a variety of issues. [Zissowitz] You said we recently presented interesting proposals to the Syrians. Could you elaborate on those proposals? [Peres] No, I am afraid I cannot. [Zissowitz] Could you at least tell us through which channel these proposals were relayed, seeing that the Washington talks have not resumed? [Peres] It is a very specific channel. We submitted our views on the way to attain an arrangement with the Syrians to the Americans. I would like to reiterate that this arrangement consists of three interrelated and parallel issues: security, peace, and withdrawal. There can be no arrangement with the Syrians based on their demand that we first answer one question and then proceed to discuss other issues. They want us to first answer the question about a total withdrawal from the Golan Heights and then to proceed to discuss other issues. That is totally inconceivable! [Zissowitz] Is interesting proposals your description or that of the Syrians? [Peres] It is my description. I do not speak for the Syrians. [Zissowitz] Has there been any response on their part? [Peres] There has been no response conducive to a breakthrough. I think the Syrians want to pursue the negotiations, but their response has not been enough to enable us to launch real negotiations. We keep talking about the nature of the negotiations. After all, how can one normalize relations without normalizing the negotiations? Let us tell it like it is: In this day and age, negotiations are public. Today every citizen is a diplomat, and rightly so. He listens to the radio, watches television, analyzes what he hears, and wants to be sure. We are the representatives of the people. We are not a small ruling clique, as is the case in other places. [Zissowitz] Are there any secret contacts with the Syrians? [Peres] No, and I am sorry about that. This element is also missing. With regard to all the talk about credibility or about keeping the situation obscure: In all peace negotiations, there is a part that is covert and shrouded in mystery. It cannot be otherwise. All the initial positions cannot be revealed publicly. [Zissowitz] Has Israel proposed to the Syrians, via the Americans, to hold a secret meeting between the prime minister and President al-Asad? [Peres] I do not know about a secret meeting. After all, we say publicly and openly that we are prepared to hold a meeting at any level whatsoever, from the level of the president and the prime minister through the cabinet level; there must be a diversity of levels. Let me say this humorously: In the end, it is only the political level that is entitled to make mistakes. Peace cannot be attained without committing so-called mistakes -- that is, without raising new and creative ideas, without trying to look for ways to overcome various obstacles. Having taken part in the negotiations with the Palestinians, let me tell you that this means endless days and nights of working on different ideas, of confrontations, and of ups and downs. This is the way it is. This is the nature of negotiations, considering that we start out with very deep differences, with long-standing mistrust, with a suspiciousness that has almost become second nature, and with a great deal of skepticism on both sides as to whether genuine peace and a different type of relations can be attained. As far as I am concerned, I have no doubt that there is no alternative to peace, neither for the Syrians nor for us. [Zissowitz] The government today marks two years in power. Could you estimate whether the signing of a peace treaty with Jordan or with Syria can be expected next year? [Peres] Look, I cannot make any prophecies. At best, I can predict 50 percent of the story. I can reasonably assume that this is definitely possible, but I cannot say that with certainty. It is very hard to decipher what really happens in Syria or what goes on in the Syrian president's mind and heart, and it is even more difficult to guess or make predictions. [Zissowitz] Is a meeting with King Husayn or a visit to Israel and Jerusalem expected to take place soon? [Peres] I very much hope so. There are hardly any problems between us and Jordan that cannot be resolved. In my opinion, Jordan and Israel are wasting time and money for no reason. We could have made the economies of both countries prosperous and turned our border into a blossoming area. [Zissowitz] Well, let us look inward. After two years in power, what do you consider the government's most stinging failure? [Peres] I do not think there has been any stinging failure. Let me say it fair and square. Here we have an exceptional combination of three things: a peace process, continued immigration to Israel, and continued economic growth. This is an exceptionally strong combination. Forget the blaring headlines and empty talk. [Zissowitz] Nothing has failed? [Peres] That would be an exaggeration. There have certainly been failures, which is only natural. I am talking about the really big things. Paradoxically enough, I think today the Jewish people is experiencing one of its peaks, perhaps one of the highest in its history. On the other hand, it is facing great dangers. My God! At the peak of our strength, we are being threatened by dangers unprecedented in our history. Incidentally, these are more of a spiritual than of a physical nature. Our problem is the survival of our people and our Jewish identity in the face of assimilation and our shrinking numbers. I would even go so far as to say that while the Jewish state is experiencing spring, the Jewish people is experiencing autumn. [Zissowitz] Thank you very much, sir. [Peres] You are welcome.
