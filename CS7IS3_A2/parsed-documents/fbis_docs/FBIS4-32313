The state delegation at the Geneva negotiations [words indistinct], Prime Minister Silajdzic said, submitting the report on the talks with the international contact group. The delegation approached the talks with the demand that the principle of the preservation of the sovereignty of Bosnia-Herzegovina within its internationally recognized borders be respected, and that the occupied territories with the majority Bosniak and Croatian population be returned [words indistinct], the necessity of respecting the principles of the London conference, and the UN Security Council resolutions, Prime Minister Silajdzic said, adding: [Silajdzic] When it comes to concrete, territorial solutions, the state delegation presented the contact group with a map of the federation as determined by the Vienna agreement, at which the territories with the majority Bosniak and Croatian population are defined, amounting to 58 percent of the territory of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The contact group was presented with information and other convincing documentation on the justifiability of the solutions that we are committed to. Four, as for the issue of the so-called corridor, the state delegation presented a unified view that corridors are unnecessary as a lasting solution, since the territory with the Bosniak and Croatian majority and the territory with the Serb majority are a constituent part of the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina in which freedom of movement of people and goods must be provided and guaranteed in all the regions. Therefore, (corridors) are redundant. We presented the view that, if the issue of the corridors is to be discussed, then it must include a link between the central part of the federation and the Bihac canton. All the corridors must have an equal status regardless of for whom they are established and through whose territories they pass. Five, I particularly want to stress that the state delegation was very persistent and resolute in its view that the contact group could not attempt to open seriously the process of negotiations if, at the same time, the issue of measures to be undertaken in case of obstructions to the peace process is not solved. We asked openly and on several occasions: If the negotiations are obstructed, will the international community carry out air attacks and other military measures? Will it lift the arms embargo? Will it establish an effective control over the [Bosnia-Herzegovina] state border with Serbia and Montenegro? Will it tighten the economic embargo against the so-called Yugoslavia, and will it impose other sanctions against the side that is responsible for the failure of the peace conference, the peace initiative? We were told that our demands and proposals would be considered, and that we would soon hear the views of the contact group concerning these matters. [Hadziahmetovic] We have made it clear, Prime Minister Silajdzic continued, that we cannot consider as serious any proposal by the contact group unless it contains clearly defined intentions and guarantees concerning the implementation of the peace agreement. The state delegation reiterated the proposal for the Bosnian Serbs to join the federation under equal conditions, Prime Minister Silajdzic said, adding: [Silajdzic] In case such a proposal is again rejected, we presented the basic principles on which the internal organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina would be based. The proposal is based on the inviolability of the international subjectivity and the territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We would accept the internal transformation into a complex state, in which one part would be the federation and the other would be with the Serb majority that would have a high degree of autonomy and a permanently open possibility to join the federation. The central bodies of that state would be organized in a way that would express the constituent position of each [word indistinct].
