The first plot of state-owned land was leased out in the province in 1988. By the end of last year, the province had leased out 454 plots -- 635 hectares -- in cities and towns, and had received 5.4 billion yuan from the leases. In small towns and market places in the province, about 60 hectares of land were also leased, raising 200 million yuan. In addition, Fujian has approved opening up 101 square kilometers with total investment 2.65 billion U.S. dollars. For the development, the province set land price standards for leasing land in cities and towns. Some 53 counties and cities in the province have by now set up land price appraisal committees. The province also set up 13 land price appraisal centers and two specialized land asset markets. The Fuzhou specialized land asset market has completed appraisal of 60 specific land prices; the funds reached 1.3 billion yuan. Ye Wenjian, director of Fujian Provincial Land Administration, said that Fujian will perfect the system for setting standards for land prices and enhance supervision and control of land prices. He said that the provincial government will also formulate regulations to supervise and manage land-price agencies so as to promote normal exchanges in the land market.
