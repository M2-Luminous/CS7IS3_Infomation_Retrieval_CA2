Assessing relations between both states, Walesa said that "it is not so good that it could not be better." The president granted an interview to representatives of the Hungarian media in connection with an official visit to Poland by Hungarian President Arpad Goncz, which starts on Monday [28 March]. "I am going to call for jointly encouraging our governments and businessmen for greater cooperation; this has to be strengthened, and the visit is to serve this purpose," the president said when asked what he expected from Goncz's visit. Walesa did not rule out an increase in military cooperation between Poland and Hungary. "We cannot build any kind of third structure because neither the West nor Russia would be happy about it, but we have to say that, if our freedom and sovereignty are in danger, we will fight. There is no free Poland without a free Hungary," the president said. Asked to comment on his conflicts with parliament and on prospects of the present Sejm, the president said: "Such conflicts will always exist until we stabilize our political systems. The previous parliaments did not live through their full terms of office. If the public is satisfied with the present parliament, it will survive."
