A 1,700-word question and answer article on pages 8 and 9 rules on various issues raised by readers. One of them deals with the ruling highlighted on page 1, namely that betting on soccer matches is against shari'ah and appeals to "all Arab fans of soccer not to undertake this illegal gambling and to protect the traditions of Islam and its shari'ah and the Muslims' reputation in the world." The other rulings cover such topics as the use of foreign words such as "bye-bye" in Friday sermons, which is regarded as a sin; the illegality of marrying a stepdaughter; and the rules for marrying a divorced woman. Another ruling comes out against the use of any medicine where alcohol has been used in its manufacturing unless there is no alternative medicine. APPEAL MADE TO HELP MUSLIM REFUGEES A 100-word summary on page 1 reports on an appeal from the governing body of the Higher Islamic Council for Propagation and Relief to the heads of Islamic countries urging more aid to Muslim refugees, who make up more than 90 percent of the refugees in the world. The council also appeals to the leaders of the major powers, the pope, and the UN secretary general to take urgent action to stop the Serbian attacks on Bosnia's Muslims and lift the arms embargo imposed on the latter so that they can defend themselves. The appeal to help Muslim refugees is further elaborated on in a 900- word report by Jamal Salim on page 20. The report says the appeal calls for allocating fixed financial and material aid to help alleviate the sufferings of Muslim refugees and also appeals to rich Muslims to help their brothers. Council Chairman Shaykh Jad al-Haqq 'Ali Jad-al-Haqq calls on world Muslim relief societies "to visit relief sites for those harmed and for the needy and to give increasing care to modern field studies, to use documented data when making decisions, and to coordinate their work to save their efforts and avoid duplication." After calling for diversifying the types of relief, he underlines the importance of "abiding by humanitarian principles in relief without racial, religious, ethnic, or political affiliation discrimination and to be completely neutral." Dr. Farid Qirshi, chairman of the council's relief department, then reviews the council's achievements in Bosnia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Burma, Somalia, Sudan, Kurdistan, Sri Lanka, India, and the independent states and then details some of the projects that the council is preparing to help alleviate the suffering of refugees. YOUTH CAMP TO DISCUSS ISSUES FACING MUSLIMS A 150-word report by Muhammad al-Abnudi on page 2 says that the Abu-Bakr al-Siddiq Camp organized by the Higher Council for Islamic Affairs will be held in Alexandria on 19 July and will be attended by youth delegations from more than 20 Islamic countries. It adds that the delegations will discuss a number of religious and other issues facing the Muslim world, including the need to fight corrupt ideas. WRITER BERATES WEST'S STANCE ON ISLAM A 450-word article by Basyuni al-Halawani in the "With All Frankness" column on page 6 welcomes recent statements by Western officials that praise Islam, the shari'ah, and its tolerant principles, adding that these are a gain for Islam and the Muslims' just causes and could effectively help "rectify the wrong and misleading image that has been projected by the extremist groups through their rejected actions and alien ideas that have nothing to do with Islam at all." But he notes that these statements by Western officials do not reflect a clear Western stance on Islam and the Muslims' causes, adding that the Western media continues to implement a scheme to distort the image of Islam while Western countries are not changing their negative stances, which emphasize their support for all the extremist and racist movements against Islam. The writer then adds: "If it is the view of U.S. President Bill Clinton's adviser that Islam is a call for tolerance and dialogue and that it does not pose a danger to other nations and civilizations, then what has the U.S. Administration done to restore the Muslims' usurped rights and lift the yoke of the clear injustice imposed on our Muslim brothers in Bosnia-Herzegovina, India, Palestine, and other areas of conflict in the world?" He then criticizes Britain's attitude toward the Muslims' causes after citing Prince Charles' statements that Islam is full of the meanings of love, brotherhood, and equality. He adds that "while we are happy with these statements, we fear that they might be part of the constant deceptions and plots against the Muslim world," noting that the West alone cannot be blamed for this but also the "Muslim countries that have accepted the role of the spectator and have agreed to be pawns in a chess game controlled by the West." Noting that Muslims' conditions are getting worse, he urges them to return to Islam's principles and the shari'ah in their dealings and in resolving their conflicts. AL-GHAZALI URGES YOUTH TO DEFEND ISLAM A 350-word report on page 10 details a seminar organized by the Islamic and Arab Documentation and Studies Center in al-Fath Mosque in Ramsis [Cairo] under the slogan: "The role of the youth between the past and the present." It cites Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali as telling the participants that the nation needs the youth to hold the banner and defend Islam against the forces hostile to it. He adds that: "The Islamic nation is in dire need for those who will rejuvenate its religion and youth and this can only be done by renewing its faith, resources, and moral and material talents." He says that he is worried about today's youth who are led by their sexual desires while the nation needs the youth guided by faith and ideals. Another speaker, Dr. 'Ali Jum'ah, adviser to the World Institute of Islamic Thinking in Cairo, says that the problem today is that youth are getting science and data confused, believing that obtaining some data makes them scholars. WRITER CLAIMS WEST CONTINUES PLOTS AGAINST ISLAM A 450-word article by Majdi Salim in the "God is Merciful" column on page 10 argues that the West is continuing its plots against the Muslim world. He says that this plot is implemented on three tracks. The first one is the economic war that aims to "restrict our strength, exploit our natural resources, and limit our ability to use them to build an independent economic structure." He adds that the West uses people from among us as tools to implement this plot and to turn Islamic society into a consumer one. The second track is an intellectual one, where the West tries to impose its ideas and concepts on us "on the pretext of liberating our minds from restrictions and enlightening us to make us move away from Islam's tenets and our true religion, which represents for them the main obstacle in their struggle with the Islamic nation so that the Western way of life becomes ours, too." He argues that the West is also using tools from among us to achieve this aim. He then moves to the third track, which is the military one, citing the cases of Bosnia, Burma, Afghanistan, and now Yemen. He concludes that "this is a plot and we do not believe it no matter how much the West claims to support or back us and our only course is to hold onto the rope of God, understand, and get ready." UNIVERSITIES PREPARE SUMMER ACTIVITIES A 1,300-word report on page 19 by Salah 'Abd-al-Mu'ti details the programs prepared by various universities and colleges for their students during the summer holidays. Saying that the students are free to participate in the programs they like, the report adds that this year's plans include holding seminars and dialogues with students in the summer camps in addition to health enlightenment convoys that will travel to villages and action programs for students' participation in the development of villages. The report says that the Cairo University program varies between artistic, cultural, and sports activities and that part of these activities will tour the governorates. The report adds that al-Azhar University will organize religious enlightenment convoys that will tour the governorates, cities, and villages, especially in Upper Egypt, where leading teachers will lecture on the principles of religion and propagation. Meanwhile, Alexandria University will organize courses for teaching professional skills such as plumbing, tiling, and mechanics. Al-Minufiyah University's activities will focus on scientific training, such electronics, biology, and environment. Hulwan University's emphasis will be on various activities, such as computer training, the teaching of the English language, and chess tournaments. The report goes on to say that al-Minya University will focus its activities on combating illiteracy and opening summer clubs to attract the young, in addition to science courses and sports. Asyut University's main activity will be "the friends of the police program, which will be the first of its kind and in which 500 students will participate in cooperation with the security directorate." Other activities include a forestry project, combating illiteracy, electricity training, and manual handicrafts for female students. Tanta University, the report concludes, will focus on a health survey of the governorate. SAUDIS BUILD ISLAMIC COMPLEX IN UZBEKISTAN A 400-word report on page 21 says that Islam Karimov, president of Uzbekistan, agreed to a demand from rich persons from Mecca to allocate a piece of land measuring 20,000 meters in the middle of Tashkent to build an Islamic center complex. The report adds that the complex will include a mosque that can accommodate 10,000 worshipers, an Islamic clinic, an Islamic library, a workshop for girls, and an Islamic studies center. It notes that the first stage of the project has already started and that the overall cost will be around $5 million.
