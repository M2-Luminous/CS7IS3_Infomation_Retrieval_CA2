Both sides exchanged views on bilateral relations in a sincere and friendly atmosphere. After briefing Hata on China's current economic situation and the implementation of its reform measures, Zhu Rongji said: "We are confident that China will maintain a growth rate of 9 percent in the years to come. In the course of reform, China will try to protect foreign investor's interests. We hope the Japanese Government will continue to encourage and guide Japanese enterprises to invest in setting up factories in China. This is also one important way to enliven the Japanese economy." Hata said: "I feel relieved after listening to our excellency's briefing on China's current economic situation. The development of Sino-Japanese trade and economic ties has been rapid in recent years. This also demonstrates that China has made tremendous achievements in its economic reform. In my talks with leaders of other countries we have talked about China's economic reform. Japan will, as in the past, continue to support China's reform and open-door policy, and offer cooperation. This will not only benefit Japan and China but will also benefit the world." Hata reiterated Japan's support for China's bid to restore its contracting status within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. After the meeting, Hata hosted a banquet in honor of Zhu Rongji and his party. Participating in the meeting and banquet were other principal members of Zhu's entourage, including He Chunlin, deputy secretary general of the State Council General Office; and Chinese Ambassador to Japan Xu Dunxin.
