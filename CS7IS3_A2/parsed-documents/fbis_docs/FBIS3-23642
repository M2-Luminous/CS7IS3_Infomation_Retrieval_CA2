As reported in the 2 March edition of KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, on 28 February a concrete support of a 110-kilovolt power transmission line was destroyed by an explosion occurring in Ranskaya Volost of Latvia, 5 kilometers from the Skrunda Radar Station. This high-voltage line supplies the Skrunda Radar Station with power. According to Edgar Birkans, director of high-voltage networks, power transmission from Brotseny was cut off at 00.25 just after midnight on 28 February due to a damaged support. The RLS [radar station] was not affected, however, since it is provided with its own standby power system. The installation is supplied with power via two high-voltage networks emanating from Brotseny and Tukus. The damage was found during a morning troubleshooting foot tour. Birkans states that the damage, which affects only Latvia, is estimated to exceed 4,000 lats. The scene of the occurrence was inspected by a commission consisting of representatives of Latvenergo, Latvian criminal police, and the Skrunda Radar Station. According to the Press Center of the SZGV [Northwestern Troop Grouping], SZGV Commander Colonel General Leonid Mayorov discussed the incident with Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis. A letter requesting an investigation of the incident was sent to Yanis Skrastinsh, general prosecutor of Latvia. Laymonis Liyepinsh, chief of Criminal Investigation of the Police Department, said the occurrence will be investigated by the Kuldigskiy Rayon Prosecutor's Office. Bomb specialists have been dispatched from Riga. In addition, the Ministry of Defense and ZEMESSARGA is conducting a separate investigation. Their job of apprehending the offenders will not be an easy one. Laymonis Liyepinsh considers that a political flavor attaches to the explosion. At a 1 March press conference, representatives of the Tevzemey uk Brivibay, the nationalistic faction of the Latvian Sejm, were unanimous in describing the incident as a "provocation with far-reaching consequences." At the same time, Mr. Yakobson, consultant to the faction, went a step further by saying that "the explosion was arranged by Russia, or at least by those who stand behind her or wish to help her." Well, this sounds like the same old tune: Laying the blame on someone else. As for the explosion, the SZGV Press Center actually made a statement in the Latvian newspapers to the effect that the commission inspecting the scene has arrived at the official conclusion that the damage caused the transmission line constitutes an act of sabotage. Finally, Latvian specialists performed a very rapid, high-quality job restoring the damaged transmission line support.
