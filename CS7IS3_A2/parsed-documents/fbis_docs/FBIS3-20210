Along two sides are sitting the entire "state". State of Emergency Region Governor Unal Erkan, Diyarbakir Governor Ibrahim Sahun, Diyarbakir Mayor Turgut Atalay, Turkey's Director General of Security Mehmet Agar, Commander of the Seventh Army Corps Gen. Metin Saglam, Gendarmerie Law and Order Commander Gen. Hasan Kundakci, Second Tactical Force Commander Gen. Ergin Celasun, prosecutors, deputy provincial governors, high level security and intelligence officers. They are having dinner. There are television sets at both ends of the table. As they sip their raki, they watch the news bulletins from various TV stations. At the same time Mehmet Agar gives a live interview by telephone to the Show TV news program. Everybody is happy that the Newroz day passed without incident and make remarks in the vein of, "The separatist organization is no longer able to rally the people for mass action." TV programs in which the fact that there were no incidents is not underlined strongly enough, upset the viewers. After hearing the news about village guards celebrating Newroz in Cizre, they say, "Do not forget that until a few years ago those village guards were unable to go out on the street in Cizre. If they did, they were liable to be hanged upside down from the trees." In today's article I will not make any comments. I will simply sum up part of my impressions under the headline, "What is the state thinking in Diyarbakir?" Ozal Criticized Former President Turgut Ozal is being criticized for having prevented the state from taking strong enough action against the "Separatist organization" in the past, or for having failed to take it seriously, saying that they were "a handful of highwaymen". These words are quite interesting: "Remember the March 21 1991 Newroz day in Sirnak. From morning to evening it was impossible to remove the PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party) colors from the flag post in the city square. And the things that were done to the Ataturk statue there! Then came the 1992 Newroz. Demirel's prime ministry. The PKK was taught a lesson in Sirnak. The state displayed its might. Everybody saw that there's a price to pay for messing around with the state. Today, not the slightest sound was heard in Sirnak. Think of the change achieved in three years." A curious line is being drawn from Ozal to Demirel and now to Ciller. It is being stressed that in the fight against the PKK, Ciller is in great harmony with the security forces and the military. One of the officials says, "Ciller has grasped that situation. She saw how the security forces could be given the boost to morale that they needed. And this has been accomplished." And an interesting remark: "You may recall that once it used to be said that the Republican People's Party (CHP) plus the Army equals power. Now Ciller sees that and seizes on the idea." Greatest Boost to Morale How did Prime Minister Ciller inject the biggest boost to morale in recent times to those fighting against terrorism in the Southeast? There is a single answer to that question: "The removal of the Democracy Party (DEP) deputies' legislative immunity and their subsequent arrest. The security forces have been immensely pleased with these developments, in which Ciller herself played a major role. The people of the region could see the power of the state. Those who criticize this decision are not aware of the realities of this place. (Opposition Motherland Party leader) Mesut Yilmaz has been less active than Ciller on this issue." Somebody asks, "Can the amendments required be made in the Anti-Terror Law?" A curious reply comes: "Don't worry, they (the proposed amendments) will be passed." The Hot Summer Morale is indeed high. They say that heavy punishment has been inflicted on the PKK, especially in the past 12 months. "We do not provide too many photos and films of terrorists killed because the international community does not react favorably to such things," they add. The result of this punishment can be summed up as follows: "Fewer recruits to the organization, more information about the organization, a sharp decline in the logistic support for the organization, greater demand to become village guards." There will be formidable pressure on the PKK with the onset of spring. "Things have slowed down a bit because of the elections. You will see after April." They say this will be a "hot" summer, with the rural and mountain cadres, especially, being wiped out. The numbers of special operations teams are being rapidly increased, and these teams operate very effectively, they note. Officials keep stressing that the inhabitants of the region support the state and definitely do not desire separation. "Otherwise, you would not be able to achieve anything even if you set up 37 armies!" they say. Terror First The Show TV news bulletin featured an interview with Kemal Burkay! [Secretary General of Kurdistan Socialist Party, PSK] This drew comments such as, "Look at what Show TV is doing. They are launching Burkay. What is the need for that?" Expressing their displeasure, officials say, "Nothing can be done (on such issues) as long as the fight against the terrorist organization continues. First you must make that organization collapse. Then you can think of other things. If you tried to do that at this stage, there would be no end. Things would go on, as a chain. First the fight against terrorism." In the region "pro-state" and "anti-state" forces. Interesting analyses. One person says, "I felt that he was a Turk. I told him, Your eyes do not speak of treason'." It is said that certain complaints were voiced at the National Security Council meetings, to the effect that the judicial process in the region was not operating rapidly enough. Some 10,000 defendants, about 3,000 of them under arrest, are said to be currently on trial at the state security courts whose jurisdiction covers 11 provinces. They think that Motherland Party (ANAP) mayoral candidate Nurettin Dilek is likely to win the election in Diyarbakir, and the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) candidates in a few countries of Diyarbakir. There is a certain, unexpressed, feeling that it would be a good idea if the media did not write or broadcast anything about the region. Yet, they do take care to continue a dialogue with members of the press despite all the criticism they direct against the media.
