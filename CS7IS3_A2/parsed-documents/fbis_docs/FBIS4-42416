In particular the ICRC is concerned about laser weapons which can blind, arms using microwave and infrared technology, and allegedly nonlethal chemical weapons. The call for the ban came after an ICRC-organized meeting of experts Tuesday and Wednesday to consider the dangers of certain types of weapons, some of which have already been produced. The experts expressed concern at the possibility of such weaponry coming into the hands of terrorists or criminals, in particular in the case of laser arms. The experts will draw up a report detailing their conclusions, to be presented to a conference of government experts to debate amending the 1980 UN convention on arms. The conference will be held at the end of the year.
