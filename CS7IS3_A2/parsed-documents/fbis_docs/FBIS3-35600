Talk to the effect that Russia's foreign policy should be divided into "distant" and "close" has been going on for quite some time now. The absence of a corresponding committee in the Supreme Soviet brought about a situation where the leaders of the National Salvation Front were dealing directly (and in a rather peculiar way) with CIS and Baltic matters in parliament. In the Duma this mistake was happily avoided and the new committee has been "assigned" to the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] faction. Apart from the CIS, PRES also was placed in charge of committees on regional policy and local self-government. According to faction leader Sergey Shakhray, PRES intends to occupy all the leading positions in these directions, "traditional" for it, both in parliament and in the government. But as one can easily see, the promised "committee-ministry" linkage in the case of CIS affairs is not working out. PRES' wish to monopolize this area of foreign policy is hampered by the fact that in the government CIS affairs are administered by the Foreign Affairs Ministry. The new economy minister and PRES member Aleksandr Shokhin, however, is working in the government to have himself placed in charge of economic relations with the former USSR republics. But this is clearly not enough to coordinate the policy of the government and the parliamentary committee. More complications can be expected also from what can mildly be described as the painful relation of the Duma communo-nationalist majority to CIS problems, the "situation of the Russian population," and Russian foreign policy in general. A feeler put out by PRES leaders between parliament sessions was devoted to what is probably the most acute issue of policy with respect to the neighboring countries -- the situation in Crimea. Consultations by Konstantin Zatulin, PRES faction secretary and chairman of the committee on CIS affairs, with Ukrainian officials were held behind the Duma's back, and the committee was not called for that purpose because "the majority of deputies are currently away in their constituencies." The "placating statements" made after that apparently did not satisfy the nationalists, who are anxious to seize the peninsula from Ukraine. Before the Duma session resumes, hot debates on this issue are most likely. Should Yuriy Meshkov be elected Crimea's president, the nationalists supporting the leader of the Russian opposition during the election campaign will inevitably get an advantage. In any event, PRES leaders are to face a conflict with the Foreign Affairs Ministry which, as is apparent from Minister Andrey Kozyrev's latest statements, does not wish to give up the initiative to other Russian politicians in the neighboring countries. The ambitions by Vladimir Lukin, chairman of another parliamentary committee -- on foreign affairs -- are also aimed at curtailing the Foreign Affairs Ministry's powers. Therefore the erstwhile allies of Russia's Choice will apparently be seeking to take the bloc's existing levers of influencing the government course away from it. The experience of the Supreme Soviet shows that the size of democratic factions falls in proportion to the growing ambitions of their leaders. Foreign policy appears to be an ideal field for a clash of these ambitions. Which opportunity the communists and nationalists will seize with great pleasure.
