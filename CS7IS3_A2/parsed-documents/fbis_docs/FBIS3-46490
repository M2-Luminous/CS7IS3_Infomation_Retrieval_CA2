May the power of the three gems and all sacred things in the universe protect them and provide them with prosperity, happiness, and long life so that they will remain figures beloved by the Thai people forever. Fraternal Thai people, in 1993 the world situation has been improving steadily. This is because most countries have paid strong attention to the development of democracy and upholding human rights. At the same time, the arms race has been replaced by investment in economic benefits and improvement in the quality of life. This has resulted not only in happiness for the majority of the world's population, but has helped to steadily improve the international economy. Although the improvement of the international economy has not reached the level expected, it obviously exceeded that of the previous year. Regarding our country, although there were two major tragedies in the middle of 1993 which resulted in many deaths, the compassion and cooperation of the Thai people enabled the tragedies to be less severe than they might have been. The tragedies serve as valuable lessons for those concerned that they must be aware of their responsibilities and duties. The lesson is that if a problem is created, its effects will eventually surface. Fraternal Thai people, the general situation in 1993 was relatively peaceful and there was some progress. Data from the public and private sectors agree that the Thai economy was in a recovery stage. Economic growth increased in comparison with the previous year. This recovery demonstrates a degree of success of the government's efforts to tackle the continued recession, which resulted in reduced investment, as we all know. The government measures, however, particularly investment promotion measures and the development of Thailand into the regional financial center, as well as proper management of the capital market, have created confidence among local and foreign investors. This has resulted in private sector investment increasing 5.8 percent in 1993, compared with 0.9 percent in the previous year. A welcome point in this investment is that part of it occurred in the regional areas, corresponding with the government's prosperity distribution policy which the government worked on earnestly throughout the year. The statistics show clearly that after the announcement of the prosperity distribution policy, about 1,200 investors applied for investment promotion privileges, a three-fold increase over the previous year. Total investment was about 300 billion baht and generated nearly 300,000 jobs. Of this investment, 60 percent was in Zone 3, which encompasses 60 regional provinces. Another important measure in the prosperity distribution policy is the care for the farmers, who make up the poorest group of the population. Three examples of the government's concrete action in this regard are: First, the government carried out land reform, issuing land use documents to farmers for 4.5 million rai of land. This is more than the total land reform achieved in the previous 18 years. Second, the government increased the budget allocation for construction of small water sources from 3.3 billion baht in 1992 to 6.6 billion baht in 1993. This allocation will increase to 9 billion baht in 1994. Third, the farmers' production costs have been lowered by cutting the loan interest rate to 5 percent on average for farmers who joined the production structure readjustment project. Low-priced fertilizer -- about 25 percent cheaper than the market price -- was also supplied to farmers. Some 300,000 tons of this fertilizer were available in 1993, compared with 80,000 tons in 1992. Some 500,000 tons will be available in 1994. Fraternal Thai people, many foreign and local institutions in the government and private sectors predict that Thai economic growth will go even higher in 1994. I wish to say to you that although such growth figures are a good sign, the government will not be complacent and will try to spread this growth among people in all sectors. It will adhere to the policy of distributing prosperity to the regional and rural areas, as mentioned in its policy statement to parliament. It will do its best to make this increase in national revenue go to the people in the regional and rural areas so that they will be able to eventually help themselves. Therefore, the central task of rural and agricultural development in 1994 will be to adjust cultivation methods to meet market demands. This will raise the incomes of the farmers and reduce the risks associated with their occupation. The government has allocated 13.5 billion baht for this purpose in 1994. Some 40 billion baht will be allocated through 1996 for continued efforts in this regard. Farmers have called loudly for implementation of this program. In addition, the government will act to stabilize prices for major crops. Regarding social and environment development, the government will give assurances for the continued development of human resources and the quality of life. It has allocated nearly 100 billion baht for this purpose. Some 74 billion baht have been earmarked for health care. Some 23.5 billion baht will go for expansion of education opportunities. For environmental conservation, restoration, and development, some 11 billion baht have been allocated. Violators of environmental law and those who intentionally destroy environmental and national resources will be prosecuted. I have emphasized often that industrial decentralization must not amount to spreading destruction among the people in the regional areas. Regarding workers, the government established the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare in late 1993 to oversee and protect the benefits of workers, promote their welfare, and develop their skills. In 1994 emphasis will be given to the protection of child labor, woman labor, and Thai workers abroad, as well as arranging an appropriate social security system, as evidenced by the government's submission of the social security bill, the compensation fund bill, and the job placement and workers protection bill for the consideration of parliament. Fraternal Thai people, 1994 will be a year of hope for people around the world. In particular, the recent successful conclusion of the GATT negotiations can be regarded as a New Year gift for the whole world. This is because the GATT accord will enable trade to become more free, which will benefit every country in general. Thailand is expected to gain some benefits, but how much will depend on our ability to compete in the international arena. On the government's side, it will adjust the direction and mechanisms so that the country will be best able to compete. As for the private sector, whose adjustment is more rapid, I am confident that it has prepared to cope with the new international situation. Regarding the drought and water shortage which is the concern of everyone, I wish to emphasize that the government has prepared many measures. These measures may not be effective without the cooperation of the people. Therefore, to enable all of us to overcome this crisis, I wish to appeal to you to pay attention and cooperate with the measures which the government will announce from time to time. Regarding the drought, the government is grateful to the suggestions for long-term solutions to the water shortage which the king enunciated on his birthday anniversary, particularly the urgent projects to build dams on the Pa Sak, Nakhon Nayok, and Pak Phanang Rivers. I and the government will adopt these suggestions and pledge to the people that they will accelerate these projects. Fraternal Thai people, on the anniversary of the 50th year of the king's enthronement in 1996, the government has planned major celebrations, which the king has given the name: Kanchanaphisek. The government has appointed a committee to plan these honorable and customary celebrations. It will invite the people to participate in the creation of a memorial or other objects as gifts for the king. The government will make announcements soon on this matter. Fraternal Thai people, in 1993 the government spent considerable time explaining and solving various problems through the parliament and its mechanism. There were two ordinary sessions and two extraordinary sessions in the same year, which was unprecedented, considering that two annual budgets have to be deliberated in the same year. The government presented 48 bills for parliamentary consideration. Thanks to the cooperation of parliament, 29 bills were promulgated into law, which have contributed to the government's solution of the country's problems and to its national development efforts. In any event, the solution of national problems in accordance with the parliamentary democracy system may feel to some people to be too time-consuming. I wish to explain that it is not right to solve problems in a superficial and biased manner. The ancillary issues within the entire system must be considered in the search for long-term effective solutions. It is undesirable to enact a short-term solution to a problem which will invite negative repercussions in the future. The principle of righteousness must be upheld, although to do so may run against the prevailing current of thought. I am confident that if we solve problems basing the solutions on rationality and technical knowledge, we will be successful and see good results for the country in the long term. In any event, I agree that there are areas on which action has been taken that has not achieved the level of progress desired. This includes the solution of the traffic congestion in Bangkok. More than 400 additional cars enter the streets daily. For long-term results, there will have to be other solutions, not just limiting the city's growth. I pledge to march forward to effectively solve the outstanding problems and give the assurances that the government will administer the country honestly, keeping the interests and happiness of people in all sectors in mind. On this New Year, the cabinet and I invoke the power of the three gems and sacred beings, as well as the might of their majesties the king and queen, to provide each of you happiness and prosperity in 1994 and forever after. Goodbye.
