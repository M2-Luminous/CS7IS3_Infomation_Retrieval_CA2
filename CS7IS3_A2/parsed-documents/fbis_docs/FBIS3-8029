As we heard, the number of unemployed will probably exceed 3 million people today. So what does a labor minister actually do? [Miller] You know, as I was watching the press conference by [the former chief of the National Radio and Television Broadcasting Council] Mr. Markiewicz, a thought occurred to me that the situation has indeed deteriorated, except that is not a result of Pawlak government's measures, or even of the coalition's measures. I am sure it will not deteriorate further in the future but in order to be able to assess that, let us meet in a year's time and see what the results are. [Bober] What does a labor minister do? [Miller] He deals with [hesitating] providing protection for the process of transformations. Your colleague here in the studio was kind enough to mention my ministry's name. I would say my ministry's goal is to lessen the pain of the transformations, that is to say its goal is to make sure that the pain does not become unbearable and that it does not rise to a level where society refuses to give its consent anymore to the inherent cost of the transformations. [Bober] So the Labor Ministry deals with providing social benefits? [Miller] Not just that, but the ministry also makes efforts to establish a new labor regime which would be adapted to the market economy; it also tries to change the system of social benefits by conducting a deep reform of social benefits, and an active social policy. But I understand you are mainly interested in unemployment. Well, I have been trying to convince my colleagues in the government that if just one minister was charged to deal with unemployment and with fighting it, then of course nothing would ever change. I can remember a sentence spoken by [former Swedish] Prime Minister Palme in which he said that in his cabinet, every single minister is charged with unemployment. Perhaps that is somewhat of an overstatement but in any event, I have been trying to promote an approach under which every minister--in particular chiefs of economic ministries--while making various economic decisions, should be asking himself a question of what impact the decision will have on the unemployment situation. [Bober] I see. We will return to that theme but let us keep discussing the ministry's role for a while longer. Last year, the ministry devoted 3.5 trillion zlotys for [unemployment] benefits, training courses, and loans to the unemployed, while this year, there are plans for the figure to rise to 5.7 trillion, not counting the 1 trillion which you [addressing Miller] quote, stole, unquote from [Land Use Management and Construction] Minister Blida. Mr. Minister, these monies are not actually devoted to creating new jobs, but to the protections that you described, is that not so? [Miller] No, no, they are largely devoted to creation of new jobs. You mentioned the almost 6 trillion zlotys which is devoted to so-called active forms of fighting unemployment. What are these active forms about? They include public works, interventionist measures, gaining new skills, and loans to the unemployed--these are naturally the most efficient type of measures. The real drama is about [hesitating] the fact that out of the Labor Fund, 90 percent of the financial means were devoted to unemployment benefits up to now, and only 10 percent, which we talked about, to active forms of fighting unemployment. What I tried to do was to increase the amount [devoted to the active forms], that is to say to change the disadvantageous ratios there. If the Sejm adopts the budget draft, then we will be able to increase the figure of 10 percent to 13 percent. That, of course, is only a slight increase, but it is better than no increase at all. [Bober] I see. But the thing is, we are trying to use percentages as consolation here but my understanding is that during sessions of the Council of Ministers for instance, you meet with the other ministers. So how would you explain this strange situation where schools are educating future experts as we speak, but we already know at this stage that nobody will need those experts in a year, half a year, or two years? So the other ministries contribute to creating unemployment? [Miller] Yes, you are right on that point. I mentioned the economic ministries but you rightly noted that there is also the Education Ministry, but I must admit that there have been some changes occurring recently, I mean that ministry has taken counteractive measures against any further functioning of schools whose graduates are bound not to find jobs in the region--these are mainly vocational schools, ones attached to factories and plants. And of course, without a close cooperation.... [Bober, interrupting] I see. But my understanding is that there must also be some cooperation with the Finance Ministry since it has the means either to promote or restrict entrepreneurship through its tax system and financial arrangements. In a situation where tax thresholds are raised on a motion of the Finance Ministry, then what is the result of that? The result is that the so-called gray area widens, incentives to work disappear, there occurs a willingness to hide one's own income, but it does not serve at all the cause of development. [Miller] You are right in a way, but on the other hand, one cannot abandon the tax system completely. But I agree with you.... [Bober, interrupting] I am not in favor of such a move. [Miller] I agree with you that the tax system should promote entrepreneurship and that is why my view is--and we will submit such proposals--that one must widen the system of various [tax] breaks, especially for investors who want to invest in areas which are particularly endangered by unemployment, I mean in gminas [small administrative units] particularly endangered by unemployment. There are over 400 such gminas, out of the total of about 2,500. So you see it is a very [hesitating] serious problem. We must look for new kinds of measures, for instance such measures that create incentives to those workplaces which employ graduates. Let me cite for you a really tragic number: About 30 percent of all the unemployed are young people, less than 24 years old. That number indicates how big the drama and the phenomenon [of unemployment] really is. [Bober] The last report of the Business Center Club, which was released last week, suggests that there is... [Bober pauses] That Polish entrepreneurs can see a danger for the market economy. Now, if they can see a danger for the market economy, that means that they can see a threat for the industrial development in general. Again, the issue of creating new workplaces is being curbed, in a way. [Miller] I believe that these are all exaggerated.... [Bober, interrupting] Exaggerated? [Miller] Exaggerated fears concerning the question of how unemployment can be eliminated. I think that two conditions must be met; first, the economic growth. We have a 4 percent economic growth; however, economic growth alone is still too little.... [Bober, interrupting] Perhaps this is within the limits of statistical error? [Miller] In Spain, for instance, there is a lot of economic growth, but at the same time, 20 percent of the country is unemployed. Apart from the economic growth, there must be an active form of creating the labor market. That means.... [Miller pauses] I have already briefly discussed those active forms; however, I believe that we should take greater care of the regions threatened by unemployment as well as the social groups which are particularly threatened by unemployment. We should try to decrease unemployment there... [Bober, interrupting] I understand; however, Mr. Minister, do you think that your colleagues, industry minister, ownership transformations minister, are of the same opinion? Indeed, I must agree with the view that it is not your ministry that creates unemployment. It is, actually, the activities of these ministries that create unemployment. Are they aware of these simple economic interdependences? [Miller] You have placed me in a very difficult situation.... [Bober, interrupting] I want you to evaluate your colleagues. [Miller] If I mention one minister and not the others, they will be offended. However, I have gotten the impression, especially in the recent weeks, that this agreement is greater, especially with the industry minister and the ownership transformations minister. You have mentioned Minister Blida. I would like to comment on that. Our conflict lies in the following.... [Bober, interrupting] That you take money away and she gives it back. [Miller] 1.250 trillion zlotys are reserved for the implementation of a law that does not yet exist. This law on apartment rentals and expenditures will come into effect on 1 October this year--at the soonest. Until that time this money will not be used, probably to the satisfaction mainly of Minister Misiag--but not to my satisfaction. I suggest that this money be paid to people earlier; that is, the apartment allowances should be paid beginning on 1 April, once the budget is passed. The poorest families, which can obtain this money earlier, cannot wait until October, November, or December. [Bober] Mr. Minister, can you possibly precisely answer the question of when we will really be able to see new workplaces created? [Miller] Well, actually we still have two years to stop the process of increasing unemployment. It is worth recalling that it was supposed to amount to 400,000 when the process of transformation in Poland was just beginning in 1990. Why am I saying that we have two years? Because after that time, for demographical reasons, the number of young people looking for a job will rise dramatically. In line with some data, by 2010, in Poland there will be approximately 50 percent of the unemployed in the entire European labor market, with the exception of the states of the former Soviet Union. Therefore, we must make quite a fundamental breakthrough in this area over the two years; otherwise, we will not be able to control this process later on. [Bober] That means that it is difficult to say precisely when we will be able to see.... [Miller, interrupting] I believe that it will be in the middle of this year, in May and June. At that time the number, which has already amounted to 3 million, will start to drop. This is related to the fact that we will start large-scale welfare work, intervention work; second, I think that these harbingers of the economic recovery will result in rather positive results. [Bober] Thank you, Mr. Minister, for these explanations. They are not very comforting.... [Miller] They are just as they are.... [Bober, interrupting] However, it is not for this reason that we have invited you to the program. We rather wanted you to present the dangers of this situation, because it really is dangerous. [Miller] Yes, the situation is really very dangerous. I believe that, if possible, as early as this year the Sejm should adopt an all-national program of combating unemployment. Why all-national? Because this task exceeds the strength of one ministry, or even the government. The state must take advantage of all the instruments that it has at its disposal. [Bober] Thank you for these explanations. [Baczynski] Mr. Minister, I think that, contrary to what Andrzej Bober said, many economists would consider you an extreme optimist--if you assume that in the middle of the year unemployment will stop increasing. According to some forecasts, we will not manage to avoid the level of 5 million unemployed, or an index such as in Spain--over 20 percent. Professor Kabaj, among others, forecasts that already now, if we took into consideration the concealed unemployment, there would be at least 1.5 million or 2 million more unemployed than the statistics actually show.... [Miller, interrupting] According to other statistics, this unemployment is smaller than the number of registered persons. We simply have a margin of persons who register themselves on those unemployment lists for other reasons. [Baczynski] At any rate, we wish you good luck. [Miller] Thank you.
