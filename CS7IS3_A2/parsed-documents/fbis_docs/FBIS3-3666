The book "My Father Deng Xiaoping," written by Mao Mao, was published by the Central Party Literature Publishing House in September 1993. A mere one month after its publication, pirated copies appeared on the market as if they were legitimate. By February this year, over 100,000 copies of seven pirated versions had been discovered. These pirated books are of very poor quality and are riddled with errors, which has made the readers very unhappy and has caused the publisher and the author to suffer unjustified wrong. The Central Party Literature Publishing House has now been fully authorized by the author to look into this matter and has officially engaged a prominent lawyer to act on its behalf.
