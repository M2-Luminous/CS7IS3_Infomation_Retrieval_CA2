The first deputy chairman of the "Green World," Yuriy Samoylenko, said on that occasion that the association supported the statement and told HOLOS UKRAYINY about it on 24 February. However, a few days later, chairman of the "Green World" Mykola Korobko stated that his association did not and does not support anybody's demands for Yu. Kostenko's resignation. As regards Yu. Samoylenko, it appears that the Association's Green Council expressed no-confidence in him as far back as October 1993. However, that move did not receive much publicity. Another deputy chairman of the "Green World" Anatoliy Zolotukhin reported by telegram from Nikolayev, where he heads the association's oblast organization, about business relations with Yu. Kostenko and changes for the better at the Ministry of Environmental Protection. At the same time, he supported the renunciation of nuclear weapons. Minister Yu. Kostenko himself further specified that he never was against nuclear disarmament, but that it should not be detrimental to Ukraine. For example, if Russia takes the [nuclear] warheads, it should not leave behind the poisonous heptyl that is used as fuel for missiles. He also added that, today, concrete ecological deeds on the part of the "Greens" would be more useful than their opportunist political chatter.
