Several announcements were made regarding the Karabakh conflict, but no concrete documents have been signed. The agreements were mainly oral. One of the most important, is about creation and functioning of CIS peace-making forces. These were the most important problems discussed in St. Petersburg. I may add that I visited Moscow before the St. Petersburg meeting, and met the leaders of the Russian parliament. We discussed the details and ways of resolving the Karabakh conflict. This all has once again been confirmed in St. Petersburg. Active work will start in a few days, in order to support the efforts of the parliamentarians by actions of executive bodies."
