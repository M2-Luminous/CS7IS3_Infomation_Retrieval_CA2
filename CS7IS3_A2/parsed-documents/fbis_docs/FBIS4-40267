Against the general background of economic crises, the slow advancement of reforms, and the flourishing corruption and crime -- features that are more or less typical of all newly created states on the territory of the former USSR, Ukraine stood out as an island of stability and peace. This Ukrainian reserve and solid stability did not suit certain political forces outside Ukraine, in particular (and mainly) in Russia. Our northern neighbor does not want to content himself with the preliminary results of putting pressure upon Ukraine -- the constant inflating of the Crimean issue and the creation and exacerbation of the "Crimean problem." With the criminal experience gained in Karabakh, Abkhazia, and the Dniester Region, Russia is deliberately exercising it on the territory of Ukraine. Let us recall: From the very beginning of the war in the Dniester Region, Russian Cossacks were actively deployed there. Two years ago, during an exacerbation of the Black Sea Fleet problem, aliens with whips already marched through the streets of our Crimean towns. At that time, war could be avoided. However, since that time, training courses and marches of Russian Cossacks in the south and east of our country have been repeatedly held and formations have been created that adhere to the laws of the Russian Federation and protect its interests. A few days ago, paramilitary formations of the foreign state impertinently held their conference -- the so-called "great circle" -- on our territory; they guard the Crimean antistate and anti-Ukrainian parliament, and they make trouble and rape women. We demand that Ukrainian citizens be protected from corrupt and armed aliens. We stress that the formation, development, actions, and financing of the Russian cossackdom are under the immediate protection of the Russian Government. That is why we consider the Cossacks' arrival on our territory as Russia's interference in Ukraine's internal affairs. Particularly, since Ukrainian laws forbid the existence and stay of paramilitary public formations on our territory. We demand the following: 1) From Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs; to immediately submit a note of protest to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in connection with the deployment of Russian Cossacks in the Crimea and Russia's active interference in Ukraine's internal affairs; 2) From the Ministry of Internal Affairs; to expel Russian Cossacks from Ukraine and to put criminals from their formations on trial in accordance with the Ukrainian legislation; 3) From the State Committee for Borders; an urgent toughening of control over the situation at the border and the introduction of visas for entering Ukraine in order to put an end to the influx of criminals and to prevent the import of narcotics and weapons. The passivity of power structures in the given question will be regarded by the "Ukrayina" Democratic Association as an encouragement of anti-Ukrainian and pro-Russian forces and as the involvement of Ukraine's governmental circles in stirring up separatism in the state. The statement was adopted at the conference of plenipotentiary representatives of the Democratic Association "Ukrayina."
