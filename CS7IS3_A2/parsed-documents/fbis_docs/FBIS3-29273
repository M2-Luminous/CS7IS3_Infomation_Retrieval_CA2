The MOF also asked the Office of Bank Supervision, the Securities Supervisory Board and the Insurance Supervisory Board to regularly gather opinions from financial institutions on the attitude of inspectors. If inspectors are found to have been engaged in such irregularities as receiving kickbacks, influence-peddling and favoritism, they will be subject to disciplinary action, the MOF said. Heads of the three supervisory organizations will be directly involved in weeding out unethical and rule-breaking inspectors, the MOF said. Auditing departments will be under the direct control of the heads of these regulatory organizations. The MOF yesterday unveiled a program to reform financial market supervisory system as complaints have been growing over the attitude of financial inspectors. The action also follows a directive from Chongwadae last year, which called on the MOF to come up with ways of reforming the nation's financial supervisory organizations. But many analysts said the reform move may discourage inspectors from safeguarding the soundness of the financial system. When inspectors show an arrogant and high-handed attitude in their inspection of financial institutions, they will face reprimands, it said. To root out irregularities, the MOF has called on the supervisory organizations to stop engaging in "inspections for revelation or demonstration purposes," it said. The focus of the supervision will be placed on helping financial institutions improve their managerial performance or to take preventive action, the MOF said. Regulators will limit their inspections mostly to head offices and inspection of branches will be made on an exceptional basis. Inspectors will be discouraged from making personal visits to financial institutions and instead they will devote their auditing to combing through documents the MOF said. The three supervisory organizations will develop computer systems to expand document-oriented inspections of financial institutions, the MOF said. Regulators will no longer specify the degree of punitive action against junior staffers who are found to have violated rules. Instead, they will notify financial institutions of staffers who violate rules and permit financial institutions to take their action at them. The regulatory agencies will be told to bolster the function of units which solve complaints from consumers. For scientific and rational audits, inspectors will be given the opportunity to go overseas to observe practices in foreign supervisory organizations, the MOF said. The three supervisory organizations will soon initiate revamping of their units and structures for raising the degree of efficiency and modernization the supervisory system. The MOF's assistant finance minister will meet each month with heads of the three financial supervisory organizations.
