Narasimha Rao held talks at the White House today and both of them hoped a very close working relationship between the two countries. Clinton said at a joint news conference after their meeting that "today we began what I hope will be a very close working relationship as our two countries forge a stronger partnership." "Our nations share many common values," Clinton said, "We explored ways to deepen our ties and to expand cooperation." The President supported India's ambitious program of economic reform, saying that "this important reform plan will be the engine of growth in our relationships." The U.S. Commerce Department has identified India as one of the 10 biggest emerging markets around the world. The United States is now India's largest trading partner, shipping a record of 2.8 billion dollars in goods and services to India last year and buying 4.6 billion dollars in Indian goods. The Commerce Department estimates that U.S. exports to India could hit 5 billion dollars this year. The United States is also the largest investor in India. Of the 4 billion dollars in new foreign investment approved by the Rao government since 1991, 1.7 billion dollars have come from the United States. Indian Government officials have said that American firms invested more in India in 1993 than in the previous 45 years combined. Clinton felt pleased at the rapid expansion of trade and investment between the two countries, adding that "we are proud of that and we want that relationship to grow." Clinton acknowledged the two nations have some differences on human rights and nuclear non-proliferation. "We pledged to intensify our efforts to achieve a comprehensive test ban treaty and a verifiable global ban on the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons," he said. Clinton also told Rao that he hoped that India and Pakistan would continue their constructive dialogue on ways to resolve their differences, including their differences over Kashmir. Prime Minister Rao described his meeting with Clinton as "constructive, useful and candid as discussion between friends should be." "We reviewed the tremendous economic opportunities thrown up by the sweeping economic reforms in India," Rao said at the joint news conference. "The President and I agreed that we have an unprecedented opportunity to free India-U.S. bilateral relations from the distortions induced by the Cold War," Rao noted. The two leaders also agreed to increase the frequency of high- level visits and exchanges between the two countries. Clinton announced that he has asked Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary to visit India in July to further their talks on renewable energy. He will also send Commerce Secretary Ron Brown to India in November to promote further growth in trade and investment. Rao has invited the President to visit India at the time of his convenience and Clinton has accepted it.
