FR941021-0-00065 FR941021-0-00008 The Secretary finds that Wyoming's repeal of W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f)(i) satisfies the portion of 30 CFR 950.11(c)(3) discussed above. Therefore, he is approving the proposed amendment and removing the pertinent portion of the program condition. 3. Award of Costs and Expenses: Cap on Fees and Costs [W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(g)] Wyoming Enrolled Act No. 4 revises W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437 by repealing subsection (g), which provided that attorney's fees, expert witness fees or other fees or costs shall not exceed $50.00 per hour. As discussed in finding 7 of the January 24, 1994, Federal Register document (59 FR 3517), the Secretary did not approve the now-repealed provision because he found it to be inconsistent with section 525(e) of SMCRA. In addition, he modified the condition of program approval at 30 CFR 950.11(c) by adding a paragraph (3), which, in part, required that Wyoming revise its statute to authorize the award of all reasonably incurred costs and expenses without placing any inflexible limits on the meaning of ``reasonably incurred.'' The Secretary finds that Wyoming's repeal of W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(g) and its hourly rate cap satisfies the portion of 30 CFR 950.11(c)(3) discussed above. Therefore, he is approving the proposed amendment and removing the pertinent portion of the program condition. 4. Award of Costs and Expenses: General [W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f)] Wyoming Enrolled Act No. 4 revises W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) by replacing the term ``director'' in the phrases ``as determined by the director'' and ``as the court or director deems proper'' with the term ``council.'' As discussed in finding 1 of the January 24, 1994, Federal Register document (59 FR 3514), the Secretary did not approve W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) to the extent that it referred to ``the Director'' rather than ``the Council'' (the State's administrative review entity) because he found it to be inconsistent with 43 CFR 4.1291. In addition, he modified the condition of program approval at 30 CFR 950.11(c) by adding a paragraph (4), which required that Wyoming revise its statute to clarify that, with respect to administrative review proceedings, petitions for awards of costs and expenses must be filed with and reviewed and decided by the Environmental Quality Council, not the Director of the Department of Environmental Quality. The Secretary finds that Wyoming's revisions to W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) satisfy the requirements of 30 CFR 950.11(c)(4). Therefore, he is approving the proposed amendment and removing the pertinent portion of the condition of program approval. 5. Award of Costs and Expenses: Requirement for Establishment of Existence of Violation [W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f)(iii)] Wyoming Enrolled Act No. 4 repeals W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f)(iii), which allowed the award of costs and expenses from the State only if the person claiming eligibility for such an award establishes the existence of a specific violation of an applicable statute or rule. As discussed in finding 5 of the January 24, 1994, Federal Register decision document (59 FR 3516), the Secretary did not approve W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f)(iii) because he found it to be inconsistent with section 525(e) of SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 43 CFR 4.1294(b). In addition, he modified the condition of program approval at 30 CFR 950.11(c) by adding a paragraph (5), which required that Wyoming revise its statute to eliminate the requirement that the person establish the existence of a specific violation of applicable statute or rule as a prerequisite for awards from the State. The Secretary finds that Wyoming's repeal of W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f)(iii) satisfies the requirements of 30 CFR 950.11(c)(5). Therefore, he is approving the proposed amendment and removing the pertinent portion of the condition of program approval. IV.
