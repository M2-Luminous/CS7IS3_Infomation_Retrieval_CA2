According to the German Post Trade Union, the issue to be discussed in Cologne primarily was the adjustment of income and old-age pensions for postal employees in eastern Germany. The talks were accompanied by mutual accusations of the parties to the wage negotiations and by warning strikes of the employees in many cities. On Friday morning about 8,000 employees went on strike in 63 post offices and 44 telephone offices. As a result, the postal companies applied for injunctions against the warning strikes. Mr. Goerts, the chief negotiator of the employers, issued a statement saying that, by doing this, the postal companies are acting in the interests of their customers. "In particular now, during the vacations, thousands of applications for visas, airplane tickets, and other documents are stuck at the post offices." In a letter to Mr. Van Haaren, the chairman of the Post Trade Union, Post Minister Boetsch pointed out on Wednesday that the backlogs created by the strikes in the postal services have risen to 63 million letters. The trade union strikes have reached a scope that cannot be described with the term "warning strike" anymore. He, Boetsch, and "other people not directly involved" get the impression that the Post Trade Union is pursuing the wage negotiations "not in the usual way, that is, not oriented toward results and goals." Boetsch met with Van Haaren in Berlin late Thursday evening. Goerts announced that the companies have suffered damage running into three-digit million sums. Many customers are defecting to the private competition. Goerts accused the Post Trade Union of continuing its "political strikes" despite the latest rapprochement. Over the past days good results have been achieved regarding the integration and the protection of east German employees against dismissal. Mr. Heidorn, the chief negotiator of the Post Trade Union, accused the employers in Cologne of pursuing "political negotiations." By delaying and protracting the negotiations they want to postpone the talks until the planned decision about the postal reform in the Bundestag on 29 June. The trade union will think about extending the warning strikes. The prospects for coming to an agreement at the negotiations in Cologne on the weekend are "zero," Heidorn added. [passage omitted]
