FR940712-1-00036 FR940712-1-00011 Progress to Date: 982 occupied breeding areas were reported with an average of 1.02 young per occupied territory in 1993. Nesting is distributed over all 11 Southeastern States. The number of occupied breeding areas reached 601 in 1991 and has exceeded 600 for three successive years. Reproductive success for the years 1990&hyph;1993 averaged 1.53 young per successful nest (or 1.04 young per occupied territory), and 68 percent of the nests were successful in raising at least one young. Seven of eleven individual State goals have been met but these are considered guidelines rather than requirements. Existing habitat is deemed to be adequate to support and exceed overall recovery plan goals. Threatened goals have been met and delisting goals will be met in 5 years if the trend continues. Service Proposal: Reclassify to threatened. Southwestern Recovery Region Threatened Goals: 10&hyph;12 young per year over a 5-year period; population range has to expand to include one or more river drainages in addition to the Salt and Verde Systems. Delisting Goals: None given. Progress to Date: 29 occupied breeding areas were reported for 1993 with 27 young produced. Since 1988, the number of occupied breeding areas has increased by about 26 percent (six occupied territories) in the Southwestern Region. Nationwide, occupied breeding areas have increased by 62 percent (1540 occupied territories) in the same time period. Some of the increase in the Southwestern Region is due to finding previously unrecorded nest sites. Ten or more young have been produced every year since 1981. Productivity has increased 10&hyph;20 percent through the assistance of the Arizona Nest Watch program (Hunt et al. 1992). Information to date indicates that breeding has expanded beyond the Salt and Verde River systems. Eagles are now nesting in the Gila and Bill Williams river systems in Arizona and the Rio Grande in New Mexico. Thus, the threatened criteria have been fully met. The population remains small, localized, with variable productivity, and low adult survival. This population faces numerous and increasing impacts from a rapidly growing human population. These impacts include continued loss and modification of riparian habitat, disturbance at nest sites, entanglement of nestlings in fish line, and other human-caused influences. The Southwestern Recovery Plan is undergoing revision to incorporate new information gained from recent investigations by Hunt et al. (1992). This research indicates that birds dispersing into west Texas and Oklahoma are more likely to be bald eagles of the Southeastern Region population than those of the Southwestern Region. Thus, the revised recovery plan may propose the elimination of west Texas and the western panhandle of Oklahoma from the Southwestern Recovery Region. The plan revision will also consider the addition of southern Utah and Mexico. For the purposes of this reclassification proposal, however, the boundaries for the Southwestern Recovery Region will remain as stated in the recovery plan (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1982). That is, the Southwestern Region includes Arizona, New Mexico, and those portions of Texas and Oklahoma west of the 100th meridian, and southeast California within 10 miles of the Colorado River or its mainstem reservoirs. Service Action: Retain as endangered. Despite attaining all recovery plan goals, current information indicates that the population is at risk and remains in danger of extinction due to excessively low survival rates and the need for intensive management, particularly at nest sites. Mexico There are a small number of eagles nesting in Baja California and Sonora, Mexico. In January 1994, a minimum of eight active pairs were known with additional adults reported that may represent more active pairs with undetected nests (Henny et al. 1993, Service files). Productivity has been relatively high with more than 1.0 young per nest for those years that data have been collected (Henny et al. 1993, Service files). Although this population appears to be relatively stable, such low numbers are clearly not sufficient to prevent any sudden adverse environmental change to cause the extirpation of these few pairs. These birds are presumed to be associated with the Southwestern population and are considered in danger of extinction. Threats to these birds include loss of habitat and disturbance from human encroachment with the increasing population (particularly tourists and recreational housing development) and potential for inbreeding from such low numbers of breeding birds. In summary, the Service is proposing to reclassify the bald eagle from endangered to threatened in the Chesapeake and Southeastern Recovery Regions and those portions of the Northern States and Pacific Recovery Regions where it is currently classified as endangered. No changes are proposed for the Southwestern Recovery Region, where the bald eagle will remain classified as endangered. The Service is not proposing to delist the bald eagle anywhere in the lower 48 States at this time. The Service is also proposing to list those bald eagles in Mexico as endangered. On February 7, 1990, the Service published (55 FR 4209) an Advance Notice of a Proposed Rule (ANPR) to announce that consideration was being given to the possible reclassification or delisting of the bald eagle in all or part of its range in the lower 48 States.
