Consequently for the next six-year term, PAN is proposing a government platform to limit the executive's powers and an ample and in-depth reform of the Constitution and bylaws regarding at least 50 key areas of national aspects. If Diego Fernandez de Cevallos wins the 21 August presidential elections, he will stimulate during his first 100 days of government great respect for the separation of branches and the federal pact, and he will encourage through the proper legislative channels a reform of the fundamental Constitution articles, such as 27, 123, 115, 4, and others, as well as of basic laws, such as the Labor Law, the Law on the Congress of the Union, the Law on the Responsibilities of Public Officials, the Law on Foreign Trade, Energy, and National Fund for Workers' Housing. In addition, and as part of an in-depth administrative reform, he will take firm steps to reinforce the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, unincorporate the national railroads, dissolve the Agrarian Reform Secretariat, and create a national ombudsman's office for general rural development, a general judicial council, a federal education council, and a national housing committee. Regarding human rights, PAN and its candidate suggest reorganizing the national commission in charge of protecting personal rights. PAN and its candidate have also outlined the following government programs and plans: a national plan to lower the level of poverty; a national housing plan; a national plan for a balanced regional development; a new fishing strategy; and a national program for the industrial and commercial development of goods and services, among others. The PAN government proposal is included in its 1994 to 2000 political platform in which the party and its candidate propose four great challenges and five commitments "in view of the national situation, full of uncertainty and injustice." The challenges are: to stimulate the country's general development to improve the lot of 40 million poor Mexicans; to develop and reinforce national culture in a world inclined to globalization; to abolish the sociopolitical system of abuse, oppression, and impunity that has been imposed on Mexican society; and to establish a system of freedom and full social, civil, and political rights. The commitments are: to create a state of law; to establish a training-education system in the country; to develop a humane and modern economy; to provide the social and environmental conditions to give the Mexican people dignity and a high standard of living; and to practice an active international policy, aimed at the national common good, which stimulates the universal common good. For PAN, "it is not hatred, overflowing revengeful passions, a single-minded obsession to seize power, or the perversion of politics and corruption but, rather, respect for humans and love of the homeland and its virtues, and what can inspire programs to solve the country's problems." Genuine State of Law The result of an in-depth and extensive consultation among its more than 140,000 active members, PAN's proposal states that for the Mexican people the political system of the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] has reached "a dead-end" due to its marked corruption and simulation of legality. For this reason, this system cannot work in a state of law. Human and political rights are violated; the Presidency remains an "irresponsible" institution; the legislative branch does not perform its proper functions; the judicial branch is not autonomous; there is a "suffocating" centralism; there is no democratic electoral system; dehumanization, depersonalization, and depoliticization are reinforced through formal and informal educational systems; crime and corruption worsen. In sum, due to a lack of a state of law, the Mexican public administration is plagued with corruption. As a result, the public administration constantly affronts the people. The party believes the creation of a state of law should quickly be based on the following fields: political ethics; structure and form of the Mexican state's organization; how the people can participate; education and the formation of a democratic culture; civil security; and the fight against corruption. The strategies and guidelines PAN is proposing are aimed at protecting man's rights, given he is conceived until he dies. For this purpose, PAN will insist on the need to reform Article 4 of the Constitution and establish that every human being, due to his dignity, shall enjoy legal protection from the moment he is conceived. PAN's proposal will reject the legalization of abortion and suggest dispatching adoption procedures expeditiously. If he wins the presidential elections, Fernandez de Cevallos' administration will call a nationwide human rights conference aimed at revising the Constitution and laws and adjusting our national legislation to the international human rights framework, thus eliminating all reservations or incompatibilities with international human rights treaties and pacts signed and confirmed by Mexico. Fernandez de Cevallos' administration will strengthen and fine tune the government bodies created for the protection and promotion of human rights and will promote legal reforms to eliminate the authorities' influence on the labor unions' internal affairs, their records, changes in leadership, and right to strike. Other reforms will be made to guarantee respect for "broad" rights, such as calm, public peace, life in a healthy atmosphere and public decorum. The Constitution will be subjected to further reforms to limit the powers of the federal executive branch and to eliminate its "metaconstitutional powers." For example, the "secret allotments" granted the executive will be reduced. The Congressional Organic Law and corresponding Internal Regulation will be reformed to dignify the legislative branch and expand its powers to include, among other things, the investigation of serious and specific cases through special commissions. The judicial branch's autonomy will be respected, and a general judicial council will be created to execute a system of legal guarantees for appointments and impartial promotion for members of that branch, and to resolve complaints by individuals concerning the administration of justice. PAN will also offer political decentralization and respect for federalism. Thus, institutions and municipalities will be granted powers that have been inappropriately assigned to the executive. Decisionmaking will be federalized, and to this end a Federal Tax Council and a contingency fund will be created to provide timely help and resources for states and towns affected by natural disasters or acute economic problems. Municipal life will be respected and reforms to Article 115 will be promoted, thereby making it possible for municipalities to impugn laws and actions by state or federal authorities who violate their autonomy, deny, or withhold resources from them, and so that town councils can come together under the proportional system of representation with a dominant majority. The democratic formation of metropolitan councils will be promoted in cities and conurbations. The federal government led by PAN will take "firm steps" toward definitively establishing the legal foundations for fair competition for power. To this end, it will seek to establish actions for relief pertaining to electoral matters; to guarantee the impartiality of the electoral authorities; to punish behaviors that violate freedom and the secrecy of the vote; to establish equality in competition; to foster and regulate public debates between candidates and prohibit all parties from using the fatherland's colors and symbols on their emblems. Meanwhile, in addition to demanding the abolition of the party-government system and guaranteeing equitable, honest, and democratic elections, PAN will propose constitutional and regulatory reforms to establish referendums, plebiscites, and popular initiatives at the federal, state, and municipal levels. Freedom of expression will be protected and respected as a natural right and not as a state concession. The system of discretional concessions for radio and television stations that is in place will be replaced by a regulatory system of authorization. To guarantee citizens' security, constitutional and legal reforms will be pursued to make the Attorney General's Office autonomous; security and police corps will be reformed; the Ministerial Police Force will be created; a national security program will be designed; a national registry for police data will be established; and citizen public security councils will be formed. A federal code of administrative procedures will be created to reform the public administration. The Comptroller General's Office will perform internal public administration tasks, and the Chamber of Deputies Finance Accountancy [Contaduria Mayor de Hacienda de la Camara de Diputados] will conduct audits. The law on the responsibility of public workers will be made stricter and more effective, and the National Human Rights Committee will be authorized to receive complaints about government officials who adversely affect the rights of taxpayers and public service users. Likewise, the law will be amended to recognize the state's civil responsibility toward citizens and provide for their indemnification when required. New Relationship With The United States On the international front, PAN believes that Mexico does not have an overall political strategy to face the challenges posed by the new world order. Mexican foreign policy has been fashioned according to the regime's interests, not to encourage and defend national interests. This has resulted in the adoption of "shameful" positions with tragic results for the country. There has been a heavy bias toward the U.S. option, which prevents greater and more effective international pluralism. World changes have heightened the Mexican political regime's internal decadence, thus diminishing the country's negotiating capacity and the honorability of its foreign policy. PAN, therefore, includes in its government program a new foreign policy that will not be just a trade proposal. The new foreign policy will encourage review and renewal of diplomatic practices and will respond to national interests. It will be an active foreign policy not just a defensive foreign policy. PAN will struggle to become multi-directional and pro-Latin American. It will fight for overall reform of all multinational organizations, the formation of a world parliamentary assembly, a Latin American community of nations, and a Latin American parliament. In terms of Mexico's relations with the United States, PAN believes they must be renewed based on five points: respect between two democratic states, trade association, recognition of socioeconomic differences, coordination in the solution of conflicts, and vigorous defense of migrant Mexicans. PAN argues that Mexican diplomacy will no longer be an opportunity for prizes, political sinecures, or a pretext to send adversaries into exile. The Mexican foreign service will become professional and specialized. Lastly, with a PAN administration, constitutional reforms will be sought to broaden the foreign policy powers of the Chamber of Deputies as well as to create a legal framework that will allow control over economic and noneconomic aspects of NAFTA and which will protect national interest. PAN will oppose any NAFTA renegotiation that could reduce opportunities and benefits.
