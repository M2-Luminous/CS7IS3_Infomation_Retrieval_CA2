Rulemaking Action The amended Clean Air Act established a new submittal requirement with respect to various programs. Therefore, USEPA reviewed the State's submittal, to determine whether the State met the applicable requirements of the amended Act. The redesignation request can now be approved as meeting conditions of the CAA in section 107(d)(3)(E) for redesignation, since the State has submitted a schedule for implementing the contingency plan. The State has also met the terms of the May 26, 1988, SIP call for the Minnesota portion of the Duluth Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) consisting of St. Louis County, Minnesota.
