This news caused anger among the Serb fighters in the area of Benkovac who wanted to retaliate by attacking Croatian troops because of this barbarism. As ISKRA has learned from the Serb Krajina army liaison officer, Mladen Kalapac, the Serb side immediately reacted by demanding an immediate halt to the torching of the Serb villages. UN Protection Force representatives promised they would most urgently get involved in preventing the torching of the villages of Kasic and Islam Grcki.
