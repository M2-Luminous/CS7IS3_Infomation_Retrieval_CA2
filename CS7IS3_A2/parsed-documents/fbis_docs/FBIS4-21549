The conservative daily CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,200- word editorial entitled: "How Can They Threaten `War'?" Describing the "venomous remarks" made by the North Korean delegate during the eighth working-level contact that "Seoul is not far from here. If a war breaks out, Seoul will become a sea of fire and you cannot survive," as "shuddering," the editorial reports his remarks disclosed the "true color" of North Korea. The editorial expresses doubts that North Korea can hardly become a "dialogue partner" in peacefully resolving the nation's problems and that "no nation" in the international community "supports" the North Korean position. Stressing that the international community cannot have "perseverance" if North Korea persists in an "unreasonable policy" regarding North-South relations and the nuclear issue, the editorial notes that our side is "well aware" of North Korean capabilities and will take "resolute countermeasures" when North Korea commits an act of "disturbing" the peace of the world. The editorial urges the North to ponder "coolly" the consequences of its radical hard-line steps and to act with discretion. Otherwise, the "collapse" of the Kim Il-song system and "North Korean-style socialism" will be "expedited." CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,300-word editorial entitled: "We Reprove the Government." Defining the incumbent government's policies on diplomacy, security, reunification, and North Korea as a "comprehensive failure," the editorial calls on the Kim Yong-sam government to keenly realize the current "very serious situation," and reports that the North side's "intentional mockery and threat" including the "Seoul in a sea of fire" remarks made by the North delegate at "official talks" are the result of the government's "easy-going" policy on North Korea, which has been implemented for the past one year. Stressing that the security issue is the greatest national issue, which will go into "bankruptcy" even by "one error," the paper urges the government to have "a sense of shame" for the recent "blow" dealt by North Korea. Describing the current events as a "grave situation," the editorial criticizes the Kim Yong-sam government's appointment of "gentlemen," who lack the sense of reality and "practical experience," to the posts of handling the North Korean issues and of dealing with North Korea's strategy of "hiding a bayonet behind a smile." Assessing the "security-related ministers' conference" as a meeting of those who failed in working out proper measures against North Korea by using up all "cards," the paper strongly urges that the government should present "appropriate measures" instead of "prescriptions" made out after the patient has died. The moderate daily HANGUK ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,300-word editorial entitled: "Full-Scale Preparations Should Be Made for Provocation." Noting that the people are worried about North Korea's provocative remarks on war, the editorial stresses that high-level officials in charge of diplomatic and security affairs should "closely examine" the reason the situation has "worsened." Pointing out that the "attitude" of the government's diplomatic, unification, and security teams toward the North made the people "worry," the editorial criticizes "the nation-first policy," "national welfare theory" and "incoherent" diplomacy against North Korea, which invariably seeks "communization" of the South. The editorial reports that "opposition" of deployment of Patriot missiles to U.S. Forces in the ROK, which was expressed by the government claiming that this would "incite" North Korea, and the policy of separating the North Korean nuclear issue from "economic cooperation," were the result of the government's "inconsistent" policy. Stressing that North Korean military power, sought even amid severe economic difficulties, is still "enormous," the paper introduces that "three mechanized corps and tanks corps and two artillery corps" have been deployed within 80 km from the Military Demarcation Line. Noting it is important for the government to further strengthen its "security and defense posture" and for the people to heighten "vigilance" against North Korea, the paper urges the government not to assume a "wavering" attitude toward the North so the people will "trust" and "follow" the government. The independent moderate daily MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN publishes on page 3 a 1,100-word editorial entitled: "Where is North Korea Heading?" Expressing concern with the North Korean side's "radical remarks" on "willingness for war" made during the working-level contact, the editorial points out that one cannot understand such remarks with "common sense" and that the North Korean authorities are likely attempting to "gain time" for nuclear development. Stressing that "strong countermeasures" are the only solution to the problem, the paper calls on the government to strengthen diplomatic efforts to maintain an "international cooperative system" in the course of dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue and to prevent the situation from advancing to an "extreme phase." The editorial maintains that a "tight defensive system" should be established to cope with the "reckless challenge" by North Korea. The pro-government daily SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 3 a 2,300-word editorial, under the headline, "We Should Resolutely Respond to Threat on `Sea of Fire'." Saying that an "extremely serious situation" has developed following the North Korean delegate's remarks at the North-South contact, the editorial urges a reexamination of our own "internal posture" to cope with this situation. Assessing the purpose of North Korea's expression of a willingness for war as part of its "negotiation strategy" to strengthen its own system of rule, to provoke our "sense of anxiety" and create confusion within our society, and to "alienate" the ROK, Japan, and the United States in "international arena," the paper observes that the North's actions might have been prompted by our own "weak points" such as the slackening of security since the inauguration of the civilian government. Urging the government to reexamine the nation's overall security posture, the editorial particularly urges leading figures in society to encourage the people to "establish" a new outlook on the nation's security. Stressing that war can be prevented only by "advance preparations," the paper calls for strengthening internal unity to cope against any provocation. The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 3 a 1,200-word editorial entitled, "We Are Concerned With the Nation's Security." Noting that, regardless of North or South, all will be reduced to ashes if a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula, the editorial expresses "shock" at the North Korean delegate's remarks on Seoul becoming "a sea of fire," and points out that North Korea cannot evade the international community's "spearhead of attack." The paper, however, asks whether we are "willing and capable" of coping with such "unpredictable acts" of North Korea and whether we have enough arms to do so. The paper criticizes our diplomatic team as "too weak" to dissipate the uneasiness of the people, and as being "naive" and lacking in clear, firm principles. The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN publishes on page 3 a 1,300-word editorial under the headline, "Catastrophe in North-South Dialogue Should Be Avoided." Noting that hasty and narrow-minded people are worried about the possibility of war, the editorial writes that the South's "acute reaction" to the North's "bombshell declaration" on a readiness to answer dialogue for dialogue and war with war was responsible for the rupture in North-South talks. The paper then points out that the nation's "future" was now more likely to being a target of "bargaining" between big powers. Opposing an "extreme attitude" against the North Korea as ineffective due to the likelihood of North Korea further aggravating military tension in order to appease a public sentiment that will arise following economic sanctions. The paper implores the North and the South to agree to a working-level contact over the telephone as soon as possible and to resolve this problem through dialogue and discussion, as they would a "matrimonial quarrel."
