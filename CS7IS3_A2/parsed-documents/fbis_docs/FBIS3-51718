[Di Tella] The Foreign Ministry plays a marginal role in this issue because in some countries, not necessarily all neighboring countries, there are possibilities of subversive infiltration. We must follow political and socio-economic developments in Latin America closely, since they were the factors that triggered the crisis in Chiapas. Notwithstanding this, the president and all his cabinet think that the socio-economic and political situation in Mexico is totally different from Argentina. Our country's cultural, political, and socio-economic levels are more similar to those of Spain than to those of Mexico. [Santoro] How does the Foreign Ministry view the events that took place in Chiapas? As a revolt organized by marginal Indians or a return to guerrilla outbreaks in Latin America? [Di Tella] We believe that, besides socio-economic problems, the type of military organization and the hardware and weapons used by the Zapatist Army bear no resemblance to the ones illiterate and marginal people can manage to obtain. There is a very substantive organization that was mounted on the basis of a social problem. [Santoro] According to confidential information that you have received, does this Mexican guerrilla group have any international connections? [Di Tella] It has links to drug trafficking, which financed the purchase of those sophisticated weapons. The link between subversive guerrillas and drug trafficking has already been seen in Peru and Colombia. This may be a third case. [Santoro] Sources close to the presidency have stated that the government has a CIA report that contends that there are allegedly Argentine guerrillas actively involved in Chiapas ... [Di Tella] There is no CIA report. There was only an exchange of diplomatic information with the U.S. Department of State and other Latin American governments. [Santoro] Has the Mexican Government reported about the Argentines? [Di Tella] No, it has not. [Santoro] Well, then, what was the basis of the president's public assertion that there are Argentines [involved in Chiapas]? [Di Tella] (Silence). That was our first impression, but we had no confirmation. I can neither confirm nor deny it. [Santoro] Was that "impression" based on an intelligence source ...? [Di Tella] It was based on the fact that some people linked to Argentine guerrilla groups have been living in Mexico for a long time. [Santoro] Are your referring to Montoneros? [Di Tella] There are several groups that took refuge in Mexico. It is alleged that they have some links. As far as generic information, it is true, but we do not have precise facts to say that it is so-and-so or such and such a group that is operating there. The president has been concerned about the existence of that generic link for some time. [Santoro] Why for some time? [Di Tella] Because he knew that guerrilla groups had sought refuge in Mexico. [Santoro] But that was in the 1970's and now the Montoneros have broken up, unless we are talking about Enrique Gorraran Merlo and the All for the Fatherland Movement ... [Di Tella] I do not wish to discuss hypotheses. [Santoro] At least you can make it clear whether you were talking about current guerrilla groups or those that date back to the 1970's ... [Di Tella] To groups that operated in the 1970's. Many former guerrillas have entered the mainstream of politics in democracy, while others have not. [Santoro] You were detained during the military regime. Are you not afraid that stirring up "ghosts" of the past might spark a "witch-hunt"? [Di Tella] No, not in the least. Even though excesses were committed in the past, that does not mean that we cannot maintain order and security at present. Security forces can be put to good or bad use. They have been used appropriately since the reinstatement of democracy.
