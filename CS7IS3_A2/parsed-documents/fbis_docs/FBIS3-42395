Zuyev] [Text] Today, radar early-warning and control aircraft are an effective means of supporting combat operations, which is confirmed by the results of recent military conflicts. Therefore, many countries are working on creating new and improving existing radar early-warning systems. The Israeli firm Elta has developed a fundamentally new radar early-warning system, which has been given the name Falcon. The first experimental model is already undergoing ground and flight testing, and series production is scheduled to begin in 1994. The American Boeing 707 has been chosen as the platform for the new system. As Israeli military experts claim, the equipment for the Falcon system costs less than half the radar early-warning and control equipment installed on the E-3A Sentry. The radar antenna for the E-3A aircraft is positioned above the upper part of the fuselage, which disrupts the aircraft's aerodynamics. This adversely affects handling and stability (especially on takeoff and landing), as well as fatigue of mounting points, limiting aircraft operating life. The onboard radar of the Falcon system has six conformal antennas: One is located in the forward part of the fuselage, and the other five are positioned along a longitudinal line along the skin of the fuselage on the left and right sides and in the tail unit. The E-3A's radar for detection, discrimination, and classification of air targets requires two to three complete rotations of the antenna (about 30 seconds), but the new radar needs 2-4 seconds, which increases the accuracy of determining coordinates several-fold. If a target is maneuvering, the radar uses a special operating mode. Depending on the size, altitude, speed, and angular rotation of the target, the pulse repetition frequency is selected automatically, which makes it possible to classify the target (helicopter, fighter, transport, etc.). When radar early-warning aircraft is flying at medium altitude, the detection range is 150 km for a helicopter or cruise missile, 350 km for a tactical fighter, and up to 500 km for a bomber or surface ship. The Falcon radar's technical capabilities make it possible to obtain a high degree of accuracy in determining target coordinates in any, even extreme, weather conditions. The radar's operating mode with a variable pulse repetition frequency makes it possible to accomplish constant observation in a specific sector, which is very important when supporting combat operations in an individual areas. The onboard equipment includes the EL/L 8312 communications and electronic intelligence collection equipment, making it possible to detect mobile and fixed sources of radar emissions with a high degree of accuracy. The Elta firm has also developed several variants of onboard electronic warfare equipment for specific clients. In addition to NATO, states of the Middle East and Southeast Asia are showing an interest in acquiring the Falcon system. The radar early-warning and control aircraft based on the Boeing 707 has the following characteristics: 12,000 km flight range; 12-13 hours flight duration without aerial refueling; 40,000 kg payload. Its 33.8-meter long cabin accommodates 17 operators. The Boeing 757 and C-130 transport aircraft, which do not have great flight range, can also be used to house this equipment. Any airliner that can transport 50 passengers or 5 tonnes of cargo can be a platform for the Falcon equipment.
