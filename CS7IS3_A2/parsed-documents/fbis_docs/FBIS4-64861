An exchange of letters about the planned ceremonies, which in the German view have already been agreed on, has not been concluded yet, Government Spokesman Dieter Vogel told journalists on Friday [6 May]. This also seems to confirm the criticism of a celebration in Weimar expressed by Colonel General Matvey Burlakov, commander in chief of the Western Group, in an interview with DPA on Thursday. Vogel said the celebration in Weimar is just intended to recall the "century-old cultural cooperation," while the actual farewell ceremony for the soldiers will take place in Berlin, as demanded by Burlakov and agreed with President Yeltsin. However, the farewell parades for the Western allies and the Russian troops will indeed take place separately, the government spokesman stressed. The festive farewell to the U.S., British, and French soldiers will take place in Berlin on 8 September. John Major, Britain's head of government, has accepted Kohl's invitation. Yeltsin's official visit will begin in Bonn on 11 May; on 12 May, Ascension Day, Yeltsin will visit the Cathedral in Speyer, and on 13 May he will go to Stuttgart.
