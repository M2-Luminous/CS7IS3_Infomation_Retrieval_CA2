Members of the 7th Corps of the Muslim army early this morning carried out a fierce artillery-infantry attack on the Koscani plateau. The fighters of the Army of the Serbian Republic were ready for this attack. After fierce fighting, the Muslims were repelled, suffering major losses in manpower. On the Serbian side, several fighters were wounded slightly. NATO aircraft were again the allies of the Muslims, flying low over the combat area. It was quieter on other parts of the Srbobran front. In fact, this is only a brief lull before a new advance by Islamic fundamentalists. It is completely clear that the Muslim offensive, which started exactly seven days ago, will continue. Although the enemy suffered a large number of casualties in the first part of this offensive, the 7th Corps is persistently trying to take hold of Serbian territories, even if it means over the dead bodies of its soldiers. Although an air raid alarm has been sounded, the enemy artillery in Bugojno has not been pounding Srbobran today.
