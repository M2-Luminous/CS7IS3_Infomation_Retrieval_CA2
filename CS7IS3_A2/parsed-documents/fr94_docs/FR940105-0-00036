FR940105-0-00036 FR940105-0-00007 Based on discussions with PI-GRID, the Working Group anticipates six months will be required to establish and validate the common codes for a large majority of interstate pipelines. If the industry begins the coding process this winter, the Working Group expects the creation of a complete common code data base by the 1994&hyph;95 winter heating season. Under the proposal, all business will be transacted with pipelines using proprietary codes. Those wanting to use the common code will have to program their computers to translate between common and proprietary codes to communicate with pipelines. Pipelines will be required to verify and validate their proprietary code information to PI-GRID. The proposal also provides for ongoing assignment of new transaction points and modifications to existing points. The information for these revisions must be provided at least ten days before a new or modified code goes into effect. The Working Group states that, at this point, the demand for common codes is unknown; some parties using only one or a small number of pipelines may prefer to continue using proprietary codes. Given this level of uncertainty, the Working Group contends the code assignor process provides a number of benefits compared to a requirement that all pipelines adopt a common code. It provides a verified and validated common code system to those who need it, while ensuring that the costs of using common codes are borne by the users, not those still preferring to use proprietary codes. It will provide consistent communication between pipelines and customers using proprietary codes, avoiding the difficulties that would be created if business transactions and other customer contacts employed different coding systems. And, it will provide an initial first test of the level of demand for, and efficiency of using, a common code. Should a common code prove efficient, the Working Group expects the market to evolve to the point where common codes will be used for all communications. 3. Comments on the Working Group Filing Process Gas Consumers Group and NYMEX/Enersoft raise objections to the code assignor process. Process Gas Consumers Group objects to the shipper having the responsibility for maintaining a rather large data set on its computer and having to develop, or acquire from others, the ``intelligence'' needed to compare capacity release offers among pipelines to identify possible alternative transportation paths. 49 It maintains that the most burdensome task facing pipelines is verifying their proprietary codes and that including the common code in the capacity release data sets would not be particularly burdensome. It emphasizes that including such codes in the data sets would be for informational purposes only, and would not require the pipelines to conduct business using the common codes. 49 It also suggests that a common code system could include mile markers or other geographic location information so software could identify delivery points either upstream or downstream of a location. NYMEX/EnerSoft contend pipelines should not be able to require customers to communicate using proprietary codes, because users will then have to obtain translation software to convert the common codes to the proprietary codes. It maintains that having the pipelines perform the translation is preferable since there are fewer pipelines than market participants. The other commenters support the code assignor process. AER/MRT supports the use of proprietary codes for communication between pipelines and users, because use of one code will minimize the likelihood of miscommunication. It also argues requiring shippers to perform the translation appropriately requires those using common codes to bear the costs of that use. Gaslantic contends the Commission should ensure that initial and updated common codes are distributed on an open-access basis, and IPAA similarly supports the provision of the data base without cost. The National Registry suggests two clarifications. It is concerned about the possibility that PI-GRID, as code assignor, might delay distribution of the code in order to degrade the value of services provided by competitors. It suggests PI-GRID should be required to file a letter with the Commission when it has completed more than 90% of the cross-referencing for each pipeline and provide the code to distributors at that point. It further contends that information on the location of points (such as geographic coordinates or pipeline line number of mile marker) is critical, but that the proposed data sets requires this information to be included only when available. It maintains the Commission should clarify when this information must be provided, suggesting it should be supplied for path pipelines, but not for point-to-point or network pipelines. 50 In line with this request, it suggests the Commission require pipelines to include in their next Form 567 filing an identification of the proprietary point code associated with the points in the flow diagrams. 51 50 It similarly seeks clarification that available information will be validated and become part of the cross-reference table. 51 Form No. 567 is diagram of the operating conditions on the pipeline's main transmission system for the prior year. 18 CFR 260.8. 4. Commission Adoption of the Working Group Proposal Given the level of support for the code assignor process, the Commission accepts the Working Group proposal and will implement it by requiring pipelines to provide a mechanism through which any person can obtain a validated computerized data base that will provide the ability to convert from pipeline proprietary codes to a common code. The Working Group stated the code assignment process could be completed by the start of the 1994&hyph;95 winter heating season, and the Commission, therefore, will require the implementation of this approach by November 1, 1994. The Commission also will require pipelines to ensure that the common codes and data base, and any updates, will be provided without charge, except for reasonable distribution and handling fees.
