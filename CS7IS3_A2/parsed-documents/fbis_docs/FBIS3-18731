"There will be no stable and durable solution if the Serb community is not reinvolved" in the peace process, Juppe said, adding that France wanted to help in the move. Silajdzic said he would next visit Moscow and hoped the Serbs would rejoin the negotiations. "They are not excluded unless they exclude themselves," he said. The Bosnian prime minister said he hoped the Russians would work for a settlement involving the Serbs. Juppe meanwhile appeared to rule out the idea of French reinforcements for UN peacekeepers in Bosnia. "All French authorities consider that we cannot go beyond our present commitment. We are the first contributors. We have done our duty." French military sources said Monday Paris was considering strengthening its 2,300 soldiers in Sarajevo with a battalion of 800 men to help enforce a Security Council resolution that calls for restoration of basic services such as water and electricity in the Bosnian capital. France has a total of 6,000 peacekeepers in former Yugoslavia.
