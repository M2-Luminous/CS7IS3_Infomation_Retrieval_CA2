FBIS4-34045 "drlat115_c_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-115 Daily Report 12 Jun 1994 MEXICO PRI National Executive Committee Message on Chiapas PRI National Executive Committee Message on Chiapas PA1406141694 Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 12 Jun 94 p 20 PA1406141694 Mexico City LA JORNADA Spanish BFN [Message to the Mexican people from the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) National Executive Committee: "The PRI on Chiapas"] [Text] The National Executive Committee [CEN] of the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI], aware of the changes observed in the conflict unleashed by the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army] in the mountains of Chiapas, and in accordance with the demands made yesterday by our candidate for president of the republic, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, states the following: 1. We hereby express our concern over the EZLN communique which rejects the peace agreement proposed by the commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas on behalf of the government and which brings the dialogue to an end, even though the Mexican people have at all times supported the civilized position adopted by the government. 2. The PRI and all citizens of good faith urge the immediate resumption of negotiations and support for the Chiapas government in every way possible as the conflict enters a new phase. 3. We reiterate that a political solution is the only option that remains in keeping with our convictions, and that dialogue and concerted efforts are essential within the de jure state because, thanks to the efforts of generations, Mexico is a country of institutions and laws. 4. We agree with the government of the republic's statement, made yesterday, with regard to maintaining the cease-fire decreed on 12 January as a prior step toward total and equitable peace because a truce alone will not satisfy the hopes of the Mexican people, nor will it fulfill their desire for harmony. 5. We confirm our democratic conviction, proven by our decisive participation in the Agreement for Peace, Democracy, and Justice on 27 January 1994, which led to amendments of the general Constitution of the republic, the Federal Code of Institutions and Electoral Procedures, and penal laws by totally impartial electoral authorities and which allowed the Federal Electoral Institute to adopt measures to guarantee that the 21 August elections will be credible, honest, efficient, legitimate, and fully in keeping with the law. The PRI is unconditionally committed to perfecting the country's democratic life and confirms that violence is unacceptable because it is only through institutions that Mexico's problems can be resolved. 6. We agree that democracy can be achieved only if it is based on self-sustained and balanced development, national sovereignty, and social justice, and that it is time to deal more efficiently with social backwardness, regional injustices, and the unfortunate conditions experienced by many Indians. 7. We do not agree that hope for peace fostered in Mexico over the past few months has been thwarted. 8. We hereby confirm that the time has come for political tolerance; therefore, on Thursday 9 June, our candidate sent a personal message to the eight presidential candidates inviting them and the country's social organizations to a direct dialogue with a view to agreements that will support a national unity agreement for democracy, justice, development, and peace. 9. We would like to know why the federal government's goodwill, the protracted negotiations, the months that have gone by, the government's flexibility, and its genuine recognition of the unfair social realities that infuriate us all have proven insufficient. 10. We request that, in accordance with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's instructions, given yesterday, government offices and institutions vigorously and generously implement legal and institutional changes and a program that will increase the wellbeing of people in Chiapas, especially in the mountainous areas, and bring justice and spiritual peace to their homes. [Signed] CEN President Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza; CEN Secretary General Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu
