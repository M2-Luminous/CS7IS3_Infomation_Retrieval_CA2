The judiciary authority of the commission, empowered to call on the work of judiciary police officials "and all others for cooperation, as deemed necessary," will be enhanced by allowing the commission to set aside the official secrets act for matters pertaining to the Mafia, the Camorra, the 'Ndrangheta or any other criminal organization. Thanks to an amendment tacked on to the bill by the House Constitutional Affairs Committee, the official secrets act cannot be made to prevail against Anti-Mafia Commission investigations because the issues linked to Mafia-type organized crime activities are now giving equal standing with "facts of subversion in the constitutional sphere." The commission will be made up of 25 Senators and 25 members of the Lower House picked by the respective speakers on a proportional basis so that the strength of the parliamentary groups is reflected in the commission. The chairman will be installed by both speakers following agreement on a name. The basic duties of the Parliamentary Anti-Mafia Commission are to review legislation on organized crime, draft proposals and keep close tabs on the Mafia and similar organizations. The commission reports on its work to the full Parliament at least once each year and at any other time as required. Among the powers of the commission are those of conducting hearings for taking testimony and depositions, issuing subpoenas for reports and documents on investigations in course and establishing which reports or documents must remain in the realm of judiciary secrecy. A witness found guilty of perjury in testimony given to the commission comes under the criminal law provision which carries a sentence of from six months to three years in prison for this crime. The same sentence can be passed on those found guilty of violations of official secrecy applied by the commission to investigation documents. Handling coordination of the judicial powers of the commission and law enforcement services are one or more magistrates and one or more Interior Ministry officials, named respectively by the Justice and Interior Ministries, who sit on the commission. The commission's staff and premises are made available by the speaker of the Lower House and the bill for running the body is shared equally by the two houses. Commenting on Lower House approval of the legislation, MP Tiziana Parenti, a magistrate and in the running for the chair of the commission, spoke out on the need for a "firm response from the institutions to the renewal of Mafia attacks on the state." Parenti was apparently referring to the spectacular jail break Tuesday [14 June] of a Mafia boss detained in Padua, sprung at dawn by four men dressed as Carabinieri policemen, and the latest in a string of firebombings of Progressive and Democratic Party of the Left quarters in Sicily which came early this morning. A Progressive candidate for the post, Pino Arlacchi, said, "We are not concerned with arguments about the validity of state's witnesses and on less-harsh prison regimes. We are worried by the actions of the Mafia which seem to have been renewed with vigor in these days." The head of the Forza Italia caucus, Raffaele Della Valle, said the amendment on the state secrets act "sends an important signal to the nation because this shows that the government looks at the Mafia as the anti-state." In this connection an MP for Communist Refoundation cited what he said was the danger of "re-forging relations between the Mafia and the state" and declared, "Let's remember that before Falcone and Borsellino were killed by explosives, they had been slain by isolation," with reference to leading anti-Mafia magistrates murdered in 1992.
