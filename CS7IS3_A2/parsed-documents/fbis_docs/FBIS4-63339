The press service has been unable to specify when Russian- Ukrainian negotiations on the subject at the prime ministerial level will begin today. The political situation in the Crimea has been growing increasingly tense since the Crimean Parliament passed a law to restore the constitution of the Republic of Crimea adopted on May 6, 1992. The constitution provides for greater independence of the peninsula in relations with Ukraine. Kiev regards this move as a manifestation of separatism and a threat to Ukraine's territorial integrity.
