He noted that Tokyo now intends to achieve a solution to the problem of Pyongyang's nuclear program primarily on the basis of close consultations with the United States and South Korea. The Government of Japan, the member of the Foreign Ministry staff stated, also places hope in the upcoming session of the UN Security Council relating to this issue. On Monday, Tokyo officially announced that it is prepared to join in the sanctions against the Korean People's Democratic Republic, within the framework of its Constitution, if the United Nations agrees to this measure. Earlier, Pyongyang itself did, in fact, reject Moscow's proposal that an international conference should be held to settle the tension on the peninsula, having confirmed its intention to discuss with the United States alone the issue of its nuclear program and the possible complete withdrawal from the system of the treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. To all appearances, Washington is also taking a passive attitude toward Russia's initiative, although President Bill Clinton has also stated that it would possibly make sense to implement it if events were to develop in a certain way.
