His intervention came as the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, indicated that he would be writing to the Prime Minister in the coming days to seek an explanation of "key issues" in the document. In Belfast, more optimistic expressions have emerged from republicans who are considering the declaration. At a meeting of the city council this week, a Sinn Fein councillor, Martin O'Mulleoir, said that he believed the peace process could succeed. "We are hopeful that if properly managed a process to bring about a lasting peace, a permanent peace, can be established," he said. Direct dialogue with both the British and Irish governments would help clarify the numerous ambiguities in the document, he added. Mr Macnamara's call for such a process of clarification followed a statement on Tuesday [4 January] from John Hume MP, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, in which he suggested that the peace process would be aided by Downing Street offering to discuss the issues. Yesterday the Labour spokesman said he would be surprised if the Government was not already involved in exchanges with republicans via the secret channels of communications revealed last year. "The British and Irish governments should provide clarification of the Downing Street declaration if it's helpful in the quest for peace," he said yesterday during an interview on BBC Radio Ulster. He added: "But what is important is that clarification should not become negotiation." Mr Adams, who welcomed John Hume's plea for further contacts, yesterday accused the Government of "hypocrisy and cynicism." John Major, he said, "cannot complain about the caution with which Sinn Fein has approached the contradictions of the declaration if he refuses the very reasonable request to have these matters clarified. "There is a growing belief that the British Government do not want a positive response from republicans to this declaration but that they are seeking a public justification for a renewed onslaught on Irish nationalists. I will be writing to Mr Major in the next few days about these issues." Nigel Dodds, a Democratic Unionist Party councillor in Belfast, has in the meantime challenged the Prime Minister to reveal whether or not he is involved in secret discussions with Sinn Fein. In Dublin, the government is still considering whether or not to let the broadcasting ban imposed on Sinn Fein lapse later thus month. Some cabinet members believe that removing the long-standing restrictions would encourage the republican movement to take part in normal constitutional politics.
