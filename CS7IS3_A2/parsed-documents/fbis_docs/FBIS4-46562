Lieutenant General Aleksandr Tymko, Chief of the Border Troops Main Staff, Presents the New Concept for the Protection of the State Border"] [Text] Colonel General Andrey Nikolayev, commander in chief of the Russian Federation [RF] Border Troops, put the Concept for the Border Troops' Protection of the State Border, the RF Exclusive Economic Zone, and the CIS States' External Borders into effect 25 January this year after submitting it to the RF Government. This document is nothing new for the troops. May 1991 saw the adoption of the first concept defining reform of protection of the border and the USSR's economic zone. However it was not put into practice. The processes of disintegration made it necessary to considerably rework many of its provisions. In December 1992 a new version appeared -- with a purely Russian state "slant." But the fluidity of the geopolitical situation on the territory of the former USSR had an adverse effect on the previously established system of border protection and the domestic political situation in Russia changed so rapidly throughout 1993 that the second concept too suffered the fate of its predecessor -- it was no longer current. It became necessary to formulate a new concept to take into consideration current realities. Which are as follows. With the formation of the RF there have been radical changes in the status, position, and conditions for the protection of the State Border. Around 14,000 km of the over 60,000-km Russian border (over 80 percent of the land border) is in new positions that had not been prepared for service or formalized in international law. The RF Border Troops have lost around 40 percent of their ground-, sea-, and air-based forces and facilities along with prepared sites for their deployment and for the basing of naval and air-based forces, engineering and technical facilities, a well-oiled border infrastructure, training facilities, command and communications posts, barracks and housing, and virtually all the international communications posts in the west and south of the country. The Border Troops' combat capabilities have more than halved. Russia currently has one-half or one-third the amount of ships and launches as the United States and Japan per unit area of its territorial waters and exclusive economic zone. Limited use of ships owing to fuel shortages increases this gap still further. And the troops' lack of icebreakers virtually reduces to zero protection of the State Border and Russia's exclusive economic zone in the Arctic. An extremely grave situation has developed as regards troop manning, particularly in terms of the draft contingent. The troops lack a total of over 7,000 officers alone and around 20,000 drafted servicemen. Negative trends have also manifested themselves in the social sphere. To date over 10,000 officers and warrant officers in the Border Troops are without apartments, and the question of housing for the families of servicemen from the combined formations and units withdrawn from the Baltic states and Azerbaijan, and also from the newly-created checkpoints, is an acute one. In these conditions there was an objective need for the phased creation of the Russian Border Troops rather than for their reorganization -- a need reflected in the new concept. Revival could be said to be the main idea behind the new concept for the protection of Russia's borders. Revival of the Border Troops, revival of reliable protection of the Russian State Border and the external borders of the CIS states, and also revival of the actual prestige of border service. It was on this that President Yeltsin focused his attention in his speech 27 May this year during a meeting with the leadership of the Federal Border Service of the Russian Border Troops Main Command. The fundamental difference between the new concept and the previous ones is the fact that it allows for a change in the conditions of border protection to an extent consonant with the transitional period. Presumably in the event of a change of emphasis in Russia's domestic and foreign policy certain provisions of the latest concept will not be put into effect. However it will by and large remain effective. The concept stipulates that its main objective is to revive the Russian Border Troops and ensure the protection on the State Border of the vital interests of the individual, society, and the Russian state within the Commonwealth countries' overall collective security system. The concept is based on the principles of the peaceful resolution of border issues and the development of cooperation in guarding the borders of the Commonwealth states and the suitability of combat personnel and the numerical strength of the Border Troops with the tasks to be performed, current legislation, and Russia's international commitments and economic potential. Provision is also made for ensuring the personal safety of personnel and Border Troop formations, the centralization of their leadership, and the principle of one-man command on a legal basis. The concept lays down the main areas of the RF Border Troops' activity with consideration for the special features of the regions and the state's economic potential, along with their role and position in guarding the Commonwealth's external borders. In two or three years it is planned to create in all regions a Border Troop grouping disposed in depth, plus operational reserves, and also to form a system of material and technical support. Moreover a considerable increase in the troops' potential as regards the protection of the exclusive economic zone is envisaged. Combating intelligence and subversive activity by foreign intelligence services and organizations and also illegal actions by criminal communities on the State Border, and raising the quality of border surveillance and standards at border checkpoints to international norms and standards are priority areas in the Border Troops' activity of guarding the State Border. The "human factor" -- looking after troops and providing servicemen with social protection -- has been singled out as a priority area of activity. The creation of the CIS and the Economic Union, and the existence of "transparent" borders between the republics of the former USSR have also created new political realities, primarily a commitment by all Commonwealth states to ensuring a stable situation on the external borders. However, by no means all the newly formed states have an opportunity or the means to reliably protect their borders, which compels them to seek ways of pooling efforts to ensure their own security on their external borders. At present, in line with requests from the leadership of Armenia, Georgia, Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan], and Tajikistan, RF Border Troops are stationed on the territory of these states guarding their state borders with Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, and China, which are at the same time Commonwealth external borders. What is more, some Russian Border Troop officers and warrant officers are protecting Turkmenistan's external state borders with Afghanistan and Iran. Questions of pooling or coordinating efforts in the protection of external borders on the territory of the former USSR are being resolved in one way or another with Belorussia [Belarus], Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Uzbekistan with consideration for the special features of each state's approach to this matter. The role of the Russian Border Troops in guarding the Commonwealth's external borders is vividly manifested in Tajikistan. The Russian Border Troops in collaboration with troop contingents from other Commonwealth states are performing the tasks of stopping armed groups, weapons, munitions, and drugs penetrating the Tajik-Afghan border. This is having a positive effect on the stabilization of the situation both in Tajikistan itself and in other adjacent states. Existing Border Troop groupings will guard the border with consideration for special regional features in areas that coincide with the former USSR border, while this task will be performed by newly-formed Russian Border Troop groupings on borders with the Baltic States (as with distant foreign countries). In the Caucasus it is planned to guard the border in two positions: First -- on the CIS external borders (Georgia, Armenia, and possibly Azerbaijan); the second border protection line follows the Russian State Border, in view of the situation on the border and in adjacent regions. Our border with Belorussia will be guarded on the basis of a treaty, focusing more on guarding the external CIS border in this region. Our border guards will quite possibly guard this section of the CIS border jointly with Belorussia's border troops. The Russian-Ukrainian border will be guarded in line with the situation prevailing there, eventually on a joint basis with Ukrainian Border Troops. Our border guards also guard the external borders of Tajikistan and Kirghizia on the basis of a treaty. By and large emphasis is placed on a sensible combination of possibilities for safeguarding the state's security on its own border and the external borders of the Commonwealth. Thus memorandums have been signed on joint protection of the Commonwealth states' external borders in the Central Asian and Western regions. The question of signing a similar memorandum with the states of the Transcaucasus is on the agenda. The exclusive economic zone is guarded by formations of naval forces and aviation and coastal forces and facilities of the Border Troops interacting with the forces and facilities of RF ministries and departments. At the same time the main efforts are concentrated on inhibiting and suppressing illegal activity by Russian and foreign ships. The formulation and introduction of a state system to monitor and track the situation and identify ships by water area and by region is being organized. Over the next year or two we will seek the optimum scenarios for the protection of the State Border at sea by means of the comprehensive use of sea- and air-based forces and facilities in conjunction with land-based (coastal) components. Studies and experiments will be conducted into the creation of special sea-based formations of the Border Troops on a tactical and operational level. In the Arctic region protection of the border is being reorganized with consideration for the opening of the Arctic ship route to foreign ships in transit through Russian ports; operational activity is being improved and the basis of a unified system for monitoring the surface situation in territorial waters and ports is being outlined, for which a structurally complete Border Troop grouping is being created in the Arctic. Effective technologies are being introduced at RF State Border checkpoints, and the provision of equipment for all components of border control is being improved in order to detect and avert illegal border crossing by individuals and transport systems. At present a considerable proportion of the RF Border Troop grouping operates in areas of local wars and armed conflicts. The concept stipulates for the first time that under these conditions the State Border is guarded in collaboration with the forces and facilities of the RF and CIS states' Armed Forces and other troops, using forms and methods characteristic of border service and systematic combat operations by the troops with consideration for the special features of the prevailing situation. In some areas the Border Troops are switching to the defense and protection of Russia's State Border jointly with the Armed Forces. Steps are being taken to ensure the personal safety of the Border Troops. Practice shows that any scientific or practical idea and the most necessary and carefully conceived program will remain just a good intention if it is not backed up by material-technical and financial resources. The implementation of the concept necessitates the adoption of certain urgent measures at federal level to ensure the security of the RF on its borders and the external borders of the Commonwealth states. These measures could include the provision of amenities for troops on the new borders, the creation of the requisite infrastructure to ensure that troops are maintained on permanent combat readiness and are capable of performing their tasks of reliably guarding the border under varying conditions. The concept itself also includes a mechanism for the implementation of its main provisions. It envisages in particular the submission to RF legislative bodies of draft laws on the protection of the State Border, the exclusive economic zone, and areas of Border Troop activity; the publication of departmental statutory instruments by the commander in chief of the Border Troops; and the formulation and adoption of annual plans for organizational and other development of the Border Troops. Thus the establishment and formalization in international law of the RF State Border, the formation and provision of amenities for the troops on the new borders, their strengthening and development, manning, the intensification of their social protection, and also comprehensive material and technical support are the priority tasks in 1994. This year provision is being made for the formation of additional troop and operational groups, operational-troop departments, border detachments, individual border subunits [komendatury], a border control detachment and individual checkpoints, naval units and subunits, individual air squadrons, tactical reserves, and other units. By the end of the year the RF Border Troop grouping may have increased by 20,000-30,000 men. A considerable part of the concept is devoted to developing a system of legal and social protection for servicemen and other citizens involved in the protection of the State Border. Draft legislative acts designed to provide legal protection, establish guarantees and compensation, boost the standard of living of the servicemen, primarily those serving in subunits directly guarding the border and the exclusive economic zone, and develop a system of benefits with consideration for physical-geographical and other regional features have been outlined and formulated. Agreements are being drafted with Commonwealth states on matters pertaining to the legal status, material and financial support, benefits and compensation, housing, medical, pension, everyday-service and trade, and other kinds of support for RF Border Troop servicemen involved in guarding the State Border on their territories. The wide-ranging tasks envisaged by the concept can only be resolved if the troops are manned by professionally trained cadres. The phased transition to a mixed system of manning, including citizens from the CIS states coming to serve in the Russian Border Troops on contract, is a priority in manning and training of cadres and personnel for the Russian Border Troops. This is only possible once amendments have been made to current legislation. It is also necessary to formulate and introduce systems for the professional recruitment and assessment of the quality of cadres' activity, their transfer and promotion, and the provision of incentives for officer cadres' military-professional activity; to develop regional centers for the training of warrant officers (ensigns); and to improve the system of training for border guard officers. The formation of a Border Troops Military Academy will undoubtedly help resolve the problem of providing the troops with trained officer cadres. The question of creating a Border Troop Polytechnical Institute is being studied. Questions pertaining to the scientific study of problems of the theory and practice of guarding the State Border hold a special place in the concept. In its current state scientific support cannot be improved by cosmetic means. It must first be shaped into an integral system whereby any scientific idea that is of benefit to the troops finds someone to implement it and a customer. We have formed a complete system of scientific support which makes it possible to provide a comprehensive solution to all the troops' important problems based on in-depth scientific studies. The Center for Operational-Border Studies and the Border Troops Research Technical Center is intended to be an important component of the system of scientific support for the troops' activity that is being developed. In view of the fact that it is hard to predict the duration of the transitional period, it has been decided to implement the concept by formulating and adopting annual plans for the organizational and other development of the Border Troops. I would like to hope that the new document will be a real basis for our work of strengthening Russian statehood and defending the vital national interests of the RF and the Commonwealth states.
