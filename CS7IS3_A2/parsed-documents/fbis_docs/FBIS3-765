He told WEEKEND STAR that resistance to the homeland government had developed "organically". The ANC, he said, had attempted for some time to persuade the Bophuthatswana government "to be sensitive to the desires of the people by opening up the space for free political activity. "We thought that by doing so we would help Chief Lucas Mangope and his government to bow out gracefully," Molefe said. The homeland's rejection of offers made by the ANC had left the organisation with no option but to throw its weight behind the striking workers. Molefe said a powder keg had been simmering for a long time in the area, and shootings and daily arrests had provided the spark. The intervention of the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] in the crisis had resulted in the opening up of a climate for free political activity, he said. "It is important that we call on the Bophuthatswana security forces to co-operate with the people and the TEC, and to refrain from shooting their own people. This, we believe, will create the conditions for their speedy integration into the new defence force, police force and civil service," Molefe said. He further appealed to the public to refrain from the destruction of property. Businesses provided jobs, he said.
