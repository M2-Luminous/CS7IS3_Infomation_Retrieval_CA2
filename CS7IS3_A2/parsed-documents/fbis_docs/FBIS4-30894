FBIS4-30894 "dreeu105__a94007" FBIS-EEU-94-105-A Daily Report 29 May 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Chile's Pinochet Arrives on Unofficial Visit Chile's Pinochet Arrives on Unofficial Visit Dlouhy on Possible Arms Purchases AU3005083594 Prague CTK in English 1816 GMT 29 May 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU3005083594 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Prague, May 29 (CTK) -- Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy today told CTK that Chilean General Augusto Pinochet was considered in his country a "standard representative of certain circles" and if he came to the Czech Republic to negotiate trade deals he would not to take a stand on his visit. "That is the prerogative of other bodies in this country," Dlouhy said. He emphasized that he had neither been briefed on Pinochet's visit beforehand nor asked to meet or negotiate with him. He said, however, he did not rule out the possibility of his ministry, as the license administration, being asked to agree to arms exports -- but to Chile, not General Pinochet, he stressed. If Pinochet concluded the deals planned, according to valid Czech law the ministry would certainly take a position on it, Dlouhy said, adding that the ministry's position would not be absolutely dependent on whether it was Pinochet or someone else who negotiated the deals. What is important is not that it is Pinochet who is leading the Chilean delegation but that the delegation will come to buy Czech weapons, Dlouhy said. If Pinochet comes as an official representative of the Chilean Armed Forces then some contract would probably be agreed upon and the possible exports of armaments would have to be approved by the license administration, Dlouhy said. Consideration will be given to whether Chile is among countries to which the Czech Republic wants to limit arms exports to or not. "Chile is today a democratic country and I would therefore expect that the stand would be positive if the final user of weapons is clear. But I cannot say beforehand," he added.
