FR941107-2-00098 FR941107-2-00051 The State of Kansas submitted SPA 93&hyph;25 to increase the copayment amount for general hospital inpatient services and inpatient free standing psychiatric facility services from $25 to $325 per admission. The issues are whether Kansas SPA 93&hyph;25 adheres to the Federal law at section 1902(a)(14) of the Act (referencing section 1916 of the Act), as implemented in the regulations at 42 CFR section 447.54(c) and section 1902(a)(19) of the Act. Section 1902(a)(14) of the Act requires a Medicaid State plan to provide that premiums, deductions, cost sharing or similar charges be imposed only as provided in section 1916 of the Act. Pursuant to section 1916 of the Act, a State may impose nominal cost-sharing payments, such as deductibles, coinsurance, copayments, or similar cost-sharing charges on certain Medicaid recipients for some services. Current Medicaid regulations at 42 CFR section 447.54(c) define ``nominal'' for institutional services, as the maximum deductible, coinsurance, or copayment charge for each admission that does not exceed 50 percent of the payment the State makes for the first day of care in the institution. HCFA believes the State's proposed copayment does not conform to the regulation because the copayment is not institution and admission specific. Furthermore, the proposed $325 copayment amount is a fixed Statewide amount. The regulation limits the State plan to the maximum copayment amount per admission. Kansas believes that the regulations do not require institution and admission specific copayments. In addition, Kansas indicates that Federal regulations at 42 CFR 447.55(a) specifically allow the State to set a standard, or fixed, copayment amount for any service. Section 1902(a)(19) of the Act provides that the State plan must include safeguards to assure that services will be provided in a manner consistent with the best interests of the recipients. HCFA believes the State has neglected to include any analysis or data which determines whether any Medicaid recipients were dissuaded from even seeking the services because of the proposed copayment. Further, if recipients are deterred from seeking necessary medical services because they are unable to pay the copayment amount, regardless of the fact that such services could not be denied, a copayment amount such as Kansas proposed cannot be in the best interests of the Medicaid recipients. Kansas believes there is no regulatory requirement that a State undertake studies or surveys of the recipient population before it implements a copayment.
