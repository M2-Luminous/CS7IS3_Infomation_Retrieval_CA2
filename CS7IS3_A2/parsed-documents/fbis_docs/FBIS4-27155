"As Vietnam is learning from China, North Korea can and should learn from Vietnam," Han said in a luncheon address to an international workshop that opened here Friday. "It should because that is the only way out of its present predicament," Han told participants in the workshop titled "the durability and direction of the four remaining socialist countries: China, Vietnam, Cuba and North Korea." The sinic civilization, he said, is defined by Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism and Chinese ideograms. This "cultural edge," as he called it, is what made Japan the world's second biggest economy and the Asian dragons the envy of developing countries, he said. "What prevents Pyongyang from making the same choice as China and Vietnam? Perhaps its unique internal structure, such as its personality cult, and its presumed fear of the South may be the major causes," the foreign minister commented. "On the other side of the ledger, however, Pyongyang should know that it possesses a very powerful tool for its survival, namely, its common sinic cultural heritage." Whether North Korea chooses to learn from China and Vietnam will ultimately show in its attitude toward South Korea. But for now, Pyongyang chooses to depend on the United States. "This relationship... can evolve either toward an economic embargo or gradual improvement," he said. "It can go either way, depending on Pyongyang's fateful choice regarding its nuclear program."
