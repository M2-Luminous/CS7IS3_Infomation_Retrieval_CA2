FBIS3-54950 "drsov003_b_94037" FBIS-SOV-94-003 Document Type:Daily Report 5 Jan 1994 RUSSIA NATIONAL AFFAIRS Media Issues Radio Rossii Outlines News, Entertainment Programming LD0401145694 LD0401145694 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian at 1100 GMT on 1 January carries a recorded program with correspondents Aleksey Abakumov and Marina Khomutova; commentator Sergey Kotenkov; "Vesti" program director Aleksandr Nekhoroshev, until recently director of the Radio Russia News Service; and correspondent Andrey Vishnevskiy of Radio Rossii's "Intercept" service. Abakumov and Khomutova discuss the usual schedule of Russia's Radio News Service, which includes hourly news bulletins and news and analytical programs every four hours. They note that the News Service produces around 500 reports on various topics daily. Abakumov says: "If one wants to discuss the matter seriously, then news and programs on the national channel of Russia's Radio are only the visible part of the iceberg. The News Service also includes current information on the Nostalgy musical station of Radio Rossii; Voice of Russia, a radio station for listeners in neighboring and distant foreign countries; and the Intercept agency--simply speaking, a service of radio interception." Khomutova says they would like to give the listeners a better idea of Radio Rossii's studios and editorial offices. She says: "Let us begin with the `Voice of Russia', since there is a formal reason for this: This station celebrates its fifth anniversary of broadcasts 24 hours a day on short wave on 1 January. The majority of the listeners live in the near and far abroad. They are compatriots who have left their homeland temporarily or permanently due to different reasons. They also include those who studied and those who are currently studying the Russian language." Abakumov adds: "These call signals were broadcast on the air for the first time on 1 January 1991. At the time, we took over from the Russian World Service of International Moscow Radio. Voice of Russia is the only state radio station in the Russian Federation currently broadcasting in Russian for audiences around the world. A total of 10 million listeners in more than 60 countries can receive our programs on short waves." Abakumov then invites listeners to listen to a report by special correspondent Valeriy Gorkin. Gorkin says that a friend of his once said to him that he did not see the fruits of Gorkin's work, whereas he, as a press correspondent, did see the results of his work when he saw his name under even a small article. Gorkin says that, after 25 years of work, he continues to enjoy listeners' reactions to his work by receiving letters and telephone calls from many listeners. He thanks the listeners for their kind words about the Voice of Russia. Commentator Sergey Kotenkov then views political events that occurred in Russia in 1993--in particular, the people's behavior in the parliamentary elections in December. Khomutova and Abakumov then discuss Radio Rossii's Nostalgy and report that it is only heard on the FM band in several Russian cities and is still popular in Russia and in France. They add that it has been popular for a number of years. Khomutova introduces Nekhoroshev, until recently director of the Radio Rossii's News Service and currently the director of the "Vesti" program. He says that some are jealous of him moving to television. Khomutova says that his voice has become well known both to television and radio audiences. Khomutova then introduces correspondent Andrey Vishnevskiy, who explains Radio Rossii's Intercept service. Vishnevskiy says: "Listeners do not know us. We do not come on the air, with the exception of this brief appearance. We produce a bulletin that includes the most interesting and important reports of the world's leading radio stations. The bulletin consists of up to 20 printed pages daily. Our service, which has been independent for nearly three years, accepted a kind offer by Russia's Radio in December and has moved to in the Yamskoye Pole street. "We hope that the fact that we have lost independence to a certain degree will not lead to giving up the main principle of Intercept, which is well-known to our old subscribers. Information of the main radio services in the world should be delivered to them unchanged. Moreover, it is not important whether it is liked or disliked. Do you want to know what Radio Liberty, the BBC, `Voice of America' and another dozen foreign radio stations said a few hours ago? If you do, you should subscribe to Russia's Radio Intercept bulletins. It is very easy to do this: Just telephone the number 250-2398." Khomutova says that Abakumov has been appointed director of Russia's Radio News Service. Abakumov adds that actually he is combining his new job with that of being an announcer. Khomutova asks Abakumov to briefly tell the listeners about the News Service. Abakumov says: "News Service means five hours of broadcasting a day on the national radio channel. It means the most recent information about events in Russia and neighboring and distant foreign countries, in the political, economic, and social spheres, and on culture, sports, and the weather. Let us say we have quite a few reports by our permanent and free lance correspondents both in this country and abroad; news of major news services, our experts, and what we call reliable sources--leading Russian and foreign agencies and the hyrdometeorological center." Abakumov notes that all levels of the society are given a chance to express their views on the events in the country. All their interlocutors are always given respectable treatment. He says that all of what he has said has had some success, but much must still be done. His dream is to create the best news service in the world in the Russian language. Khomutova then says that today is not a day just for business but also for leisure. A sample recording of a Nostalgy program follows. Khomutova closes by saying it is difficult to tell the listeners about everything in 20 minutes but hopes that Radio Rossii has become closer to the listeners and conveys best wishes from all Radio Rossii's services.
