Unfortunately, this is not the first instance of Tunisian authorities hounding "malicious media." In the past few weeks, the BBC correspondent was expelled from Tunisia, while KUNA, the Kuwaiti News Agency, narrowly avoided having its local office closed. And what can be said about the many problems facing our Tunisian colleagues in exercising their profession, because they, just like the special envoys of the foreign media, are forced to work under close surveillance. What can be said also about the refusal to sell foreign newspapers, including LE MONDE, when their content is judged to be hostile. Does the struggle against religious fundamentalism justify the country's political life being suspended and the government being afraid of its own shadow? The resulting image does not fit with the one intended by the man who, in removing Habib Bourguiba from power on 7 November 1987, presented himself to his fellow citizens as "the man of change."
