Oktay added that, before the time of the present coalition government, this figure had been between 800-900, and that now, according to the report from the Office of the Chief of Staff, 22 terrorists were being arrested every day. Oktay denied the rumors that prisoners in Diyarbakir state penitentiary would be moved to another prison. He said that he was not at all satisfied with the conditions in Turkish prisons. He also stressed that, since terrorists were imprisoned in the province where they were sentenced, the government should increase the capacity of penitentiaries in areas where terrorism was most intense, because transferring prisoners was both difficult and dangerous.
