FBIS4-478 "drafr070_c_94016" FBIS-AFR-94-070 Daily Report 10 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Further on Mandela Address Further on Mandela Address MB1004172294 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1605 GMT 10 Apr 94 MB1004172294 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Report by Micel Schnehage] [Text] Johannesburg Apr 10 SAPA -- African National Congress President Nelson Mandela said he would seek another meeting with Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini next week despite the king's rejection of proposals to accommodate a Zulu monarchy after the April election. Addressing supporters at a rally to commemorate the SA [South African] Communist Party [SACP] Secretary General Chris Hani at Orlando Stadium in Soweto on Sunday [10 April], Mr Mandela said the Zulu king had been offered a status higher than the one he currently enjoyed under the present kwaZulu constitution. Mr Mandela said after King Goodwill had rejected the proposals put forward at an emergency leadership summit at the Kruger National Park on Friday, he had approached the Zulu monarch and asked him "do you want the same rights enjoyed by (Britain's) Queen Elizabeth?" He claimed the question had not been answered by King Goodwill. Turning to the security issue in kwaZulu/Natal, Mr Mandela said the ANC fully supported the state of emergency implemented on March 31 to restore stability in that province and to ensure a free and fair election in the region. Mr Mandela appealed to the masses to support police and South African Defence Force [SADF] actions in that region who "have a difficult task to ensure all people are disarmed". He said the purpose of security forces deployed in the province was to protect life and property and to ensure a free and fair election was conducted in the area. Mr Mandela said security operations had to continue under the current political climate in kwaZulu/Natal and appealed to the SADF and SA Police to "behave in a manner which will allow us to rely on them". He stressed the need for confidence in these forces who in the past had not enjoyed the support of the people because of senior members' involvement in violence and corruption. The ANC leader accused State President F W de Klerk of complicity in the violence in that region because of the involvement of the so- called third force in fomenting the violence. "De Klerk is part of the massacres in that region", he told a wildly cheering crowd of about 8,000 supporters. He urged the crowd to recommit themselves to peace and to end "finger-pointing" accusations for the violence in the country. "Each one of us must take responsibility to end crime and violence", he said. In further criticising Mr de Klerk and his National Party [NP], Mr Mandela said although recent election polls had indicated the ANC had lost support to the NP and the Democratic Party he again referred to the NP as a "mouse". "We are dealing with a mouse, the NP is a mouse and they think they can fight the ANC, an elephant". "If a mouse overfeeds it will gain weight, but it will remain a mouse" he told the cheering crowd. He noted that many South Africans were gravely concerned about the future of the country which was going "through a difficult time" and urged all South Africans to re-commit themselves to peace. Mr Mandela discouraged supporters from carrying weapons and said "neither we the ANC and the IFP should carry unlicensed weapons to prevent the killing of innocent people" and to ensure a free and fair election. Refer6ing to slain SACP secretary general who was gunned down by assassin Janusz Walus in his Dawn Park, Boksburg, home on April 10 last year, Mr Mandela said Mr Hani was a "true patriot" who died preaching peace. Mr Mandela told supporters the greatest tribute they could pay to Chris Hani's memory was to elect a democratic government in South Africa to provide "a better life for all". He said Mr Hani had died an untimely death but not in vain. Mr Hani, he said, stood for peace, democracy and justice which also underlined the ANC's policy. Two shots rang out as the rally ended but no incidents were reported in Soweto west of Johannesburg during the gathering. A police spotter plane and helicopter monitored the rally from above and a small SADF contingent presence was maintained directly outside the stadium. Security arrangements with the security forces had been discussed ahead of the rally to ensure it ran without incident.
