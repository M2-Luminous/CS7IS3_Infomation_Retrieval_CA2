Bekhter and Candidate of Technical Sciences Colonel (Retired) V. Lavrik under the rubric "IAS: Solution to a Problem Proposed": "Loss of Service Life Could Be Avoided"] [Text] It is well known that the utilization of aircraft equipment for its intended purposes is limited by its service lives (in hours, landings, actuation cycles and the like) and the stipulated overall time of service. The aggregate of these values describes the operability reserves of the hardware and its service-life potential. It may be realized--that is, turned into flying time--at a fully defined rate of operation, which is defined by the ratio of the service life and its corresponding time of service. Losses are inevitable at a lower rate of operation. This potential, taking into account hardware that is in storage, makes it possible to have, for instance, yearly flying time of 300--400 hours per aircraft in frontal aviation. The aircraft often actually fly about 100 hours, and the pilots 50--70, in a year. A small number of aircraft engines and assemblies moreover come in for repairs without a fully utilized service life, owing to the expiration of the overall time of service. What is the reason for that? First and foremost, of course, the decreased appropriations for defense and shortages of engineering and technical personnel, fuel and spare parts. But also the complexity, increased many times over under these conditions, of the tasks of command and control, requiring a systematic assessment of the factors affecting the rate of operation. The discussion here concerns new approaches to performing that assessment, making it possible to increase the effectiveness of the utilization of service-life potential. It seems at first glance that if the overall flying time of an aircraft is counted in hours, then there should be no fundamental difference between flying time and calendar time of service, and the reliability of the hardware could be assessed using either of those values. But that is not so. The extent of corrosion, aging and biological damage to the airframe depends on the calendar duration of operation, while overall flying time characterizes the operation of the hardware and its wear and tear and fatigue damage accordingly. A criterion that takes into account both accrued run time and time of service is thus necessary for a complete accounting of the whole spectrum of demands in effect. Since the aviation hardware is employed with interruptions, the extent of realization of the service life within the limits of a certain period of calendar time can be described by the average daily rate of its expenditure. The time of service (T) of an aircraft may be represented as the sum of the times of pre-operational storage (T<inf> st</inf> ) and actual operation. Expressing the latter in terms of service life as measured in accrued time in hours (&tgr;) and the average daily rate of its expenditure (&eegr;), we have: T = T<inf> st</inf> + (&tgr;/365&eegr;), years (1) We will put equation (1) into a form convenient for analysis: &tgr; = (T - T<inf> st</inf> )365&eegr;, hours (2) Whence it can be seen that an increased rate of service-life expenditure is necessary to provide one and the same accrued operating time when the storage time is increased. Two causes of losses are thus possible--owing to a low rate of expenditure of the service life, and owing to increased duration of pre-operational storage. For example, where &tgr; = 2,000 hours, T = 10 years, &eegr; = 0.3 hours/day and T<inf> st</inf> = 2 years, the service-life losses are 56 percent. They decrease with increases in the rate of operation, and rise with increases in the duration of pre-operational storage. If we take the storage period in the previous example as being equal to five years, the losses exceed 70 percent. The losses increase, at an unchanged rate of operation, with increases in the storage time. They can be reduced by extending the time of service, but at low values for &eegr; an increase in the time of service provides an insignificant gain. Where T is increased to three years and &eegr; has the same value (0.3 hours/day), the losses decrease from 56 to 40 percent. A lengthening of the time of service can therefore be justified only with a sufficiently high average daily rate of expenditure of the service life. How can losses of service life be avoided? An answer may be obtained by solving equation (2) for &eegr;. If a guaranteed running time &tgr;<inf> g</inf> for an aircraft engine is 2,000 hours, for example, and it was stored for three years before the start of operation (before expiration of the effective term of storage) with a guaranteed time of service T<inf> g</inf> of 10 years, the required average rate of expenditure of the service life should not be less than 0.78 hours/day; that is, the annual accrued running time should not be less than 285 hours. We would note that this methodological approach could also be extended to the case of the storage of items in a non-mothballed state on board an airframe, with their occasional testing under standard servicing procedures. If the item is a removable one and the testing is performed in the interests of ensuring its readiness for utilization, however, it must be taken into account that some of the service life will have been expended even before the start of operation. We will consider a more general case. We will assess the rate of expenditure of the service life of an airframe within the context of a whole operational cycle, with a regard for the hardware being in various states (use for its intended purpose, maintenance and restoration of operability, waiting in good working order, storage). The duration in each of them describes one of the operating properties of the airframe (failure-free operation, maintainability, operational feasibility, longevity) with a regard for the level of perfection of maintenance (TO) and logistical support (MTO), while the rate of expenditure of the service life reflects the manifestation of those properties as a whole. This value at the same time acts as an indication of the productivity of the airframe (in the form of flying time, for example, or the number of aircraft-sorties per unit time). The rate of expenditure of service life (K) in such a representation serves as a criterion of the operational technical quality: K = (T<inf> t</inf> /(T<inf> t</inf> + t<inf> r</inf> + t<inf> pl</inf> + t<inf> wm</inf> + t<inf> wls</inf> ))K<inf> year</inf> , (3) where T<inf> t</inf> /(T<inf> t</inf> , t<inf> r</inf> , t<inf> pl</inf> , t<inf> wm</inf> and t<inf> wls</inf> are the cumulative amounts of time the airframe is in flight, undergoing restoration of an operable state, planned maintenance, waiting for maintenance (airframe idle time for organizational reasons) and waiting for logistical support (idle time waiting for spare parts) over the span of a certain operating period, and K<inf> year</inf> is the work time utilization factor. The value T<inf> t</inf> is a measure of the usefulness of an airframe, and describes its failure-free operation. The duration of restoration (t<inf> r</inf> ) and planned maintenance (t<inf> pl</inf> ) reflects the expenditures of time to find and eliminate defects and maintain operability, and describes the maintainability of the airframe. One may judge the level of perfection of the TO and MTO by the values t<inf> wm</inf> and t<inf> wls</inf> respectively. The work time utilization factor K<inf> year</inf> shows what share of the year's time is relegated to the operation of the airframe, and what share to idle time during non-working time. K<inf> year</inf> = 1, for example, with around-the-clock work on the hardware. K<inf> year</inf> = 0.237 with an eight-hour work day and a 42-hour work week (yearly work time reserve equal to 2,080 hours). The following group of summary indicators, consistently revealing the effects of the characteristics described on the rate of service life expenditure, can be singled out from expression (3). 1. Where t<inf> pl</inf> = t<inf> wm</inf> = t<inf> wls</inf> = 0 and K<inf> year</inf> = 1, we obtain an indicator of reliability that takes into account the joint manifestation of the absence of failures and maintainability (K1). 2. Where t<inf> wm</inf> = t<inf> pl</inf> = 0 and K<inf> year</inf> = 1, we calculate the summary indicator of reliability and operational feasibility (K2). It reflects the likelihood of the airframe being in an operable state under conditions of idle time only for planned and unplanned maintenance. 3. Where t<inf> pl</inf> = 0 and K<inf> year</inf> = 1, we obtain an indicator that also takes into account the effects of the characteristics of the actual system of maintenance on the operational technical quality of the airframe (K3). 4. Where K<inf> year</inf> = 1 and all values in the denominator are not equal to zero, the effects of the system of logistical support are taken into account (K4). 5. Under the latter (paragraph 4) conditions but where K<inf> year</inf> < 1, we also obtain the idle time of the airframe in non-work time (K5). The indicators K1--K5 thus make it possible to calculate the rate of expenditure of airframe service life with a regard for its operational level, organization of operations on the equipment and the quality of the functioning of the system to supply spare parts. The unit of these indicators is an hour of flying time per hour of operation. By multiplying the value of K by the duration of the year in hours, we obtain the available yearly flying time of the airframe (T<inf> a</inf> ). We would note that the required value of the yearly flying time (T<inf> req</inf> ) for the complete consumption of the service life (R<inf> f</inf> ) is equal to the ratio of that service life to the corresponding time of service. The methodological approach set forth provides an opportunity to move to a determination of the value of the service-life potential of an airframe that could be realized over a designated span of time of service--that is, to an assessment of the attained rate of expenditure of the service-life potential of an airframe and its juxtaposition with the required one. That will now make it possible to predict the using up of the service-life potential and, where necessary, to make the corresponding corrections in the organization of IAS [aviation engineering service] operations based on a regard for the effects of the determining factors. We will consider an example of such an assessment. Table 1 presents the initial data, and Table 2 the results, for a comparison of two fighter aircraft, the domestic Su-27 and the F-15 of the U.S. Air Force.<sup> 1</sup> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Type: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Su-27 |F-15 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |T<inf> t</inf> , hours |5.9 |4.12 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |t<inf> r</inf> , hours |3.4 |3.23 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |t<inf> pl</inf> , hours |7.1 |1.12 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |t<inf> wm</inf> , hours |2.95 |5.44 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |t<inf> wls</inf> , hours |31.3 |5.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |K<inf> year</inf> |0.24 |0.31 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |R<inf> f</inf> , hours |4,000 |6,000 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |T<inf> req</inf> , years |25 |10 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Type: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Su-27 |F-15 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |K1 |0.63 |0.56 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |K2 |0.36 |0.49 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |K3 |0.31 |0.30 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |K4 |0.12 |0.22 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |K5 |0.028 |0.067 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |T<inf> a</inf> , hours/year|245 |587 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |T<inf> req</inf> , hours/y-|160 |600 | |ear | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The comparison shows that in operational suitability within the context of TO systems (under K3), the aircraft are roughly identical, with the domestic one better in reliability (K1) but inferior to the foreign in reliability and maintainability (K2) taken together. The F-15 has the higher quality level when the lesser idle time waiting for spare parts (K4) and increased value for K<inf> year</inf> (K5) are taken into account. The attained value for K5 allows the Su-27 to serve out its service life without losses (it has T<inf> a</inf> > T<inf> req</inf> ). It is easy to estimate that the losses of service life for the foreign model are about five percent, despite the fact that it is operated more intensively than the domestic one (K<inf> year</inf> = 0.31). The necessary reduction in idle time of the airframe for TO can be determined for the complete using up of the service life, and the corresponding measures developed with a regard for expenditures, according to the data cited. An analysis of operational suitability based on an assessment of the rate of expenditure of the service-life potential when putting new airframes into service is of particular significance. It is known that the technology for servicing and the organization of technical operations depends on the design features of the airframe as determined by its dedicated purpose and the quality of design engineering and production. By possessing data on the airframe and varying the requirements and their limitations, it is possible to substantiate the most acceptable variation, from the time standpoint, for technical operation and logistical support with a regard for the shortage of material and human resources. We turn our attention to another exceedingly important sphere of the possible application of such an analysis--the certification of product and production processes. Any product is valued markedly higher if it and the processes of its manufacture have a certificate of conformity--a document indicating that the given product and production are in accordance with certain requirements (standard, for instance). While the flight quality of an airframe is evaluated for conformity to the Uniform Standards of Airworthiness, the assessment of the level of operational excellence requires its comparison with competitive models of aircraft in the given class. The proposed approach provides that opportunity when determining the competitiveness of an airframe and substantiating its price for both the domestic and foreign markets. We have thus demonstrated that a sufficiently correct solution can be obtained for a whole series of tasks--such as determining the pattern of time expenditures for operations, predicting losses of service life and developing measures aimed at averting those losses and assessing the operational technical quality of airframes in service and under development with a regard for organizational, technical, economic and other factors and the certification of aviation hardware--on the basis of an analysis of the rate of expenditure of the service life of aviation hardware (service-life potential). The use of the results obtained makes it possible to increase the economic efficiency of aircraft operations virtually without any additional material expenditures, which is particularly important at the current time. Footnote 1. The initial data for the Su-27 were obtained according to the results of the initial operating period of that fighter in a military unit. The indicators for the F-15 aircraft describe it with a regard for various periods of operations and base areas. COPYRIGHT: "Aviatsiya i kosmonavtika", 1993.
