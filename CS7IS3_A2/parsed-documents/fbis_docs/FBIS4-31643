Military programs are to become more attractive. Kolodziejczyk told journalists that the agreement will enable the presentation of issues related to the Army "in a flexible way and in response to need, and not according to a rigid schedule." He added: "I think that a battle for television slots is a misunderstanding." Walendziak explained that military programs will be produced with "technological contribution from the Army". He said: "I am pleased about the agreement because there has been a lot of discussion recently about whether television is willing to cooperate with state institutions. Of course, it is willing, provided these institutions clearly express their expectations. The Ministry of National Defense is the first ministry to say very clearly what hopes it attaches to cooperation with television, and which has not tried to do this in a dictatorial manner," he said.
