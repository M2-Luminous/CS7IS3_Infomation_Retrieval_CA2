He said four bills had been submitted to the state law advisers for vetting. The measures would: -- establish the Judicial Services Commission, the body that would present the president with a list of ten nominees for the Constitutional Court, and set out the framework of the court; -- amend legislation on remuneration and service conditions of judges to bring the Constitutional Court judges into the net; -- establish the Office of Public Protector, as provided by the Constitution; and -- set out how the Human Rights Commission would operate and make the appointment of the commissioners possible. The spokesman said the bills were presented to cabinet by minister of justice Mr Dullah Omar, who regarded them as "of the utmost importance". He said he was unable to speculate when Parliament would deal with the measures. "Hopefully they will be able to fit it in fairly soon," he said. Members of the Parliamentary Secretariat said on Thursday morning that none of the standing committees that discuss legislation before it comes up for full debate had been named. They could not say when the committees were likely to sit on the justice department legislation, or on a number of other bills believed to be in the pipeline, including some constitutional amendments, police measures and "one or two education things". "We're just as much in the dark as everyone else," said a staffer. The committees would be able to discuss the legislation as soon as it was tabled.
