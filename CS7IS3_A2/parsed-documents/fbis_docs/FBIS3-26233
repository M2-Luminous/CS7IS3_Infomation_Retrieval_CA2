Analysts in the monetary sector observed the following characteristics of the foreign exchange transactions in Shanghai last year: 1. There was a boom of member brokers at the foreign exchange regulation center, from 15 at the time of founding to more than 40. Half of them are foreign financial institutions. A number of foreign banks carried out transactions at the center. 2. The volume of transactions in which Chinese and foreign member brokers represent clients to participate in foreign exchange trading exceeded the volume of transactions conducted between dealers themselves, thus playing a mainstay role in the exchange market. 3. Spot exchange dealings took up a large proportion in the total volume of transactions. 4. Though the exchange market price experienced big fluctuations, the rate stabilized at around one U.S. dollar to 8.70 yuan starting last August. According to statistics, last year's weighted mean was one U.S. dollar to 8.7207 yuan. 5. Investing enterprises from abroad sold more exchange than they bought. 6. The foreign exchange regulation market supplied 85 percent of the exchange used for import and export nationwide. Shanghai had a 20 percent share of this market. Members of the monetary sector pointed out: In a short space of five years after the Shanghai Foreign Exchange Regulation Center was founded, its annual transaction volume rose from $730 million to nearly 5.3 billion. This shows a strong growth momentum. They were convinced that with the opening of China Foreign Exchange Transaction Center in Shanghai in the near future, Shanghai's foreign exchange dealings will be more active and mature.
