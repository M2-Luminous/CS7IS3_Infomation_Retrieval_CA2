With the agreement disclosed recently, the false and deceptive nature of Japan's "three non-nuclear principles" has been dragged into the light of day, the analyst says, and continues: One year after Japan adopted "the three non-nuclear principles" it allowed the introduction into and passage through Japan of U.S. nuclear weapons. It is to convert Japan into a nuclear power with the connivance and cooperation of the United States that the Japanese ruling circles have left Japan as a nuclear base of the United States. Today Japan is accelerating nuclear armament behind the curtain of "the three non-nuclear principles." This is not merely suspicion. It has reached a danger line in actuality. As the recently exposed concealment of plutonium at the Tokai nuclear fuel factory shows, Japan has stepped up nuclear armament, keeping a large quantity of plutonium in concealment. Japan can turn into a nuclear power any moment. Japan, however, is now charging the Democratic People's Republic of Korea with "the nuclear issue." This reminds us of a thief afraid of his own shadow and shows Japan's shamelessness. It is a mockery of the Japanese people and the international community for the Japanese reactionaries to advertise the "three non-nuclear principles." The Japanese reactionaries had better act with discretion, clearly mindful that such acts of theirs as leaving the Japanese territory as a nuclear base of the United States and pushing ahead with the nuclear armament are foolish acts which will result in bringing a nuclear disaster to Japan again.
