The Yugoslav Information Ministry said that the architect of the program and governor of the National Bank of Yugoslavia, Dragoslav Avramovic, also attended the meeting. According to the presented data, the National Bank of Yugoslavia has so far purchased foreign exchange to the value of 502 million German marks while it has sold around 167 million German marks to citizens and firms during the same period. The meeting confirmed the strong determination that budget deficits should not covered by funds which have no foreign currency backing and that credits for the revival of the economy should not be approved if they are not covered as envisaged by the program. A real increase in production could be expected already this month, it was said at the meeting. Money supply is still below the optimum level as compared with the achieved social product and interest rates have stabilized at the level of nine percent a year which is in accordance with the stabilization program, it was said at the meeting. The meeting pointed at difficulties occurring in the implementation of the program, primarily in the domain of prices. The Federal Trade Ministry is in charge of analyzing price movements and urgently suggesting corresponding measures to the federal government.
