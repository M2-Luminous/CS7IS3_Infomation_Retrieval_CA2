In the next eight days, he will have his first encounter with Italy's Second Republic and its protagonists, he will shuttle from England to France, and will take part in D-Day commemorations on the anniversary of the Allied landings in Normandy. His aims? He has a professed one, and a covert one. The first is to reaffirm U.S. attachment to Europe and American interests in promoting East-West integration on the continent so as to gradually absorb postcommunist Russia. However, Clinton's secret dream is that his official trip may signal a reversal in the trend of his political fortunes at home. Whether right or wrong, the White House feels persecuted by a series of political mishaps which have beset it over the past five months. The red-light scandals denounced by Paula Jones, the Whitewater inquiry, the drop from 48 to 42 percent in popularity polls, the setback to health system reform as a result of the forthcoming resignation of Dan Rostenkowski, who was one of Clinton's key allies in Congress, the blunders in Bosnia, Haiti, and China -- all this has considerably weakened Clinton, who is now hoping that his own D-Day -- the beginning of reconquest -- will start in Europe. Will he succeed? Of course, the trip is organized in such away as to highlight his "presidential" role -- and his image as leader of the sole superpower -- as much as possible, particularly in TV coverage. Starting tomorrow, we will be seeing him in the Quirinale [president's palace] and the Vatican's halls. Against the background of Campidoglio Square he will speak to Rome's inhabitants about the liberation of their city. On Friday [3 June], he will pray at the Neptune Cemetery, where almost 8,000 American soldiers are buried and, on Saturday, he will pray at the cemetery in Cambridge. He will dine in full dress with the other 14 heads of state from countries that took part in D-Day. He will sail in yacht Britannia together with Queen Elizabeth. He will listen to early morning mass on the shores of Normandy. He will speak in the French Parliament, and will receive an honorary degree in Oxford. However, all these political show business events, useful as they may be in terms of impressing American audiences, will be accompanied by polemics old and new. Clinton is very much aware that, in the places where the rangers landed 50 years ago or where General Clark drove in his jeep, there are three political mines ready to go off and transform the trip into a fiasco. They are called: neofascism, abortion, and foreign policy. Journalists accompanying the presidential airplane will miss no opportunity to ask embarrassing questions, and Clinton may have to pay a high price for any thoughtless replies or blunders. "The President's mission is not an easy one," Republican Senate floor leader Bob Dole, who is one of Clinton's most uncompromising opponents, remarked in an interview with LA REPUBBLICA. The neofascism knot will inevitably come up at the American President's press conference following tomorrow afternoon's meeting at Palazzo Chigi [prime minister's office]. However, Clinton's discussion with Berlusconi will be focusing on much different matters, such as preparations for the G-7 summit in Naples, Russia's integration into Europe, the former Yugoslavia, the Middle East, and Italy's plans to reform the UN Security Council. Clearly, the occasion represents the United States' first act of "approval" of the center-right government. On the one hand, Clinton will utter words of encouragement to Berlusconi, but, on the other, he will have to justify his support for a government that includes National Alliance among its members. He will presumably repeat the same arguments that he put forward in an interview granted to two Italian TV networks: "People should be judged according to what they do, not according to labels. Let them govern and let us see what they are capable of." Again tomorrow, in the Vatican, Clinton will try to avoid stepping on the second mine, namely the abortion issue. In fact, Pope John Paul II has severely criticized White House policy -- both at the national and international level -- regarding termination of pregnancies. The third mine consists of foreign policy -- the Democratic administration's veritable Achilles' heel. Inevitably, all its weaknesses will be revealed during Clinton's tour. Only yesterday, in an article published in NEWSWEEK, Henry Kissinger, the guru of American foreign policy, charged the President with not having so far fulfilled the "global leadership vacuum which, should it persist, would condemn the United States to progressive international irrelevance." According to the former secretary of state, what is lacking is "a conceptual framework to manage the difficulties of the post-Cold War order." In his talks with Berlusconi, John Major, and Mitterrand, Clinton will confirm Europe's importance to the United States; he will speak of the extraordinary opportunity opening up in the coming years for "the integration of a greater Europe, from Portugal to Russia," to which Washington intends to make its own contribution; he will stress the "partnership for peace" concept and the need for greater cooperation between Moscow and the European Union. However, as Kissinger noted, this is still a lopsided, rather incoherent European picture, which is not linked to a strategic view of American interests. As a result, a crisis such as the one in Bosnia, rather than being a bench test of the new European-American cooperation, has become an excellent example of very bad diplomacy.
