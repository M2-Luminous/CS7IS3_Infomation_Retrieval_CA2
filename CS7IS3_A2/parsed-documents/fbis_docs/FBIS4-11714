During his African tour, Dr. Velayati will visit Guinea-Conakry, Burkina Faso, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Uganda, and Kenya. At present, the Islamic Republic of Iran has diplomatic relations with more than 20 African states, enjoying cordial and friendly ties with nearly most of the African countries. Subsequent to such ties, political and cultural teams have been exchanging visits, embarking on development of economic relations. It must be recalled that during the previous regime, on account of the posturings of the then ruling cliques, Iran did not enjoy good relations with most of the African states. As a result, the former regime had set up political and economic relations at a limited level with only a few African countries and in particular with the racist regime of South Africa. In the wake of the victory of the Islamic revolution in Iran, the Islamic republic's foreign policy gave priority to establishing relations with the Third World states, especially with the African countries. In this same connection, Iran has endeavored to increase its economic and cultural relations with them. Undoubtedly, continuation of this trend and regular meetings between the officials of Iran and these states confirm the reality that, due to common bonds existing between Iran and these countries in various political and commercial spheres, there is available considerable potential for enhancing and bolstering mutual ties. For instance, the six African states referred to earlier possess huge mineral reserves, such as gold, diamonds, silver, and iron ore, and also farm products like coffee, cocoa, tea, rice, sugar cane, and cotton. Therefore, they can forge good cooperation with the Islamic Republic of Iran in various economic fields. Reciprocally, there are useful experiences enjoyed by Iran in exploiting industrial and mineral raw material, and also in education, technical, and vocational training. These are some cases which provide suitable ground for expansion of cooperation and also cementing of ties by these states with Iran. In view of these points, political observers attach significance to Dr. Velayati's tour of these six countries. They assess the tour as beneficial to bilateral interests and also to further bolstering of political, economic, and cultural relations, besides a sustained cooperation with international circles.
