They were meeting with the French foreign minister and the French cooperation minister. Obviously a lot was said about the effects of the devaluation of the African Financial Community [CFA] franc. Nicolas Balique: [Balique] There were two leitmotivs during this meeting, which was attended by 20 or so ambassadors not only to francophone Africa, but also to anglophone countries, such as Nigeria and Ghana, and Portuguese-speaking countries, such a s Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde. First there was the follow-up to the so-called postdevaluation period. According to Mr. Juppe, the first results are promising for the change in parity regarded as essential, and which certainly does not mean any sort of abandonment by France. The French foreign minister added that some 6 billion French francs, out of the 12 billion scheduled for this year, had been released by the main partners of the CFA zone. The second aspect was the process of democratization. Here too encouraging signs were noted, in spite of some backward steps, especially in Burundi and Nigeria. The main thing, said Mr. Juppe at the closing ceremony of this third meeting of ambassadors -- coming after the ones in Tokyo and New Delhi -- is to keep heading toward democracy which is closely tied to the economic recovery of the countries involved.
