They have again today provided enough evidence of the fact that they have not removed all the weaponry to the distance required. This morning they fired with an antiaircraft machine gun from (Kromolje) at Brekin Potok, and small arms fire could be heard all day. This was particularly evident in Brijesce, Sokolje, Mijatovica Kosa, and Hotonj, while an antiaircraft gun from (Nadvozici) fired at (Visocje). The Chetnik snipers have been active in various locations, where they have been seeking out victims using weapons with silencers. According to reports, there have been no casualties so far, but this behavior by the aggressor warrants extreme caution.
