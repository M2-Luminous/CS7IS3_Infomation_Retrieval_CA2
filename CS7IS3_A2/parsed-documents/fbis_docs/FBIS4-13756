The memorandum reveals facts and puts some YSP leaders in the prisoner's dock. The following is part of the verbatim text of the memorandum, a copy of which was made available to AL-MUHARRIR: Apparently, great progress has been made in relations between the YSP and Saudi Arabia. There is much information about this issue. We have included the important parts in our memorandum to you No. 91, dated 23 February, following the important visit by YSP leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid to Saudi Arabia on his way home from Jordan. Pursuant to our instructions, and as is customary in dealing with such kind of political developments, a number of our aides have held several contacts and meetings with various parties. They have reached a conclusion including the following elements: 1. The progress made in relations between the YSP and Saudi Arabia constitutes a success for the great behind-the-scenes action of a number of Saudi businessmen of Yemeni origin from the Hadhramaut area. "It should be noted here that the Saudi Embassy in Sanaa was not aware of these relations." These men are affiliated with rich financial institutions, and have a strong desire to invest in the southern parts of Yemen and to impose economic control, through their interests, on these areas. They have found the current circumstances in Yemen and Saudi Arabia an appropriate opportunity. On the one hand, they seek to satisfy the royal family in Riyadh by weakening the position of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, on whom the Saudi regime seeks to take revenge due to his position during the Gulf crisis, and later his position on the demarcation of the Saudi-Yemeni borders, which the Saudis termed as inflexible and unyielding. On the other hand, this wealthy group believes that the current YSP leaders constitute the best group of men to deal with, especially since they were able to tighten their control on the southern areas of Yemen, and engaged in a big conflict with President Salih and his aides in Sanaa. 2. The thing that contributed to the success of these Saudi businessmen's efforts is that their Yemeni origins, particularly from Hadhramaut, are congruent with the affiliations of the most prominent YSP leaders. YSP leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid, Prime Minister [Haydar Abu-Bakr] al-'Attas, and Aden Governor Salih al- Siyali, who is very close to al-Bid, are all from the Hadhramaut region. The Saudi businessmen seek to involve the YSP deeper in the current conflict in Yemen even if this leads to the separation of the southern areas from the country as was the case before the Yemeni unity in Mayo 1990. If this turned out to be difficult, then, at least, the separation of Hadhramaut would be alright, along with the establishment of an independent state in it after annexing the al-Mahrah area similar to the other Gulf states, especially since the recent exploration of oil has encouraged such ambitions. We do not yet have sufficient and confirmed information about the YSP leaders' readiness to deal with this plan. There are only some signs and unconfirmed information about strong inclinations to respond to this plan by both al-'Attas and Salih al-Siyali. (It should be taken into consideration that in the case of such countries, personal inclinations of some strong political leaders can have a great impact on the general policy, particularly when there are adequate financial capabilities to support these inclinations). 3. The Saudi regime is exerting strong pressures and clearly encouraging the separation of south Yemen from north Yemen. The regime is supported in this regard by some Kuwaiti rulers. The reason here is self-explanatory and needs no further justification. These parties pin more hopes on the position of 'Ali Salim al-Bid and his role in achieving the separation plan than on the YSP itself. 4. It has recently been noticed that undeclared large Saudi aid has been flowing to the officials in the southern areas. The powerful Aden Governor Salih al-Siyali is the coordinator of these relations. He enjoys powers that go beyond the powers of any other governor. What attracts many people's attention is that al-Siyali spends money lavishly. It has become clear that the greatest part of these expenditures does not come from government sources; something which proves that the source of these funds is the secret Saudi financial aid. 5. The group from the southern Hadhramaut region exploits its current presence in the YSP leadership to escalate the Yemeni crisis in order to separate south Yemen and to establish an independent state. This issue has become a source of concern for the other YSP leaders some of whom are from northern areas. They began to realize that the Hadhramaut group has deceived them and involved them in this. For this reason, signs of an internal conflict began to appear, a conflict which is expected to escalate. Surprises are not ruled out.
