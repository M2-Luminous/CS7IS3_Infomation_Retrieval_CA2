According to the sources, Muwaffaq al-'Allaf, head of the Syrian delegation, demonstrated an encouraging approach, although there was no room to talk of progress. Itamar Rabinovich, the head of the Israeli delegation, told al-'Allaf that the two issues which the talks had focused on up til now -- the question of withdrawal and the nature of peace -- have already been sufficiently discussed and progress was made on them; therefore, Rabinovich would now like to move on to the issue of security arrangements on the Golan Heights. Israeli sources refused to interpret these remarks or to say whether they mean that Syria and Israel have already reached agreement with regard to withdrawal and the nature of peace. [passage omitted] The meeting between Ambassador Itamar Rabinovich and chief Syrian negotiator Muwaffaq al-'Allaf lasted approximately 90 minutes and dealt primarily with procedural issues. Rabinovich opened the discussion by expressing condolences on behalf of the Israeli Government over the death of Basil al-Asad, son of the Syrian president. Rabinovich later sought to discuss future security arrangements on the Golan Heights. It was reported that no progress was made on this matter and that there was no change in the Syrian positions. [passage omitted] The peace talks on the other tracks were scheduled to resume at around midnight, Israel time. Upon arrival in Washington, Elyaqim Rubinstein, head of the Israeli delegation to the talks with Jordan, said that he had brought detailed plans to fill the Jordanian-Israeli agenda with content in order to help transform it into a real peace agreement. Rubinstein was accompanied by experts in the fields of water, environmental studies, and economics. Major General Dani Rothschild heads the Israeli team to the talks with the Palestinians. Rothschild is supposed to negotiate opposite Sa'ib 'Urayqat, his Palestinian counterpart. Rothschild reiterated the prime minister's position that no progress can be made at the Washington talks before the problems holding back the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement are resolved. The Washington talks on the Palestinian track will focus on election modalities in the territories and the powers of the autonomy council. [passage omitted]
