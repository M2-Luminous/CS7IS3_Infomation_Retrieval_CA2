A. Gudayev, V. A. Treshchikhin; UDC 621.315.592] [Abstract]The effects were examined of low temperature annealing (T<100�)of chemically deposited PbS layers in an oxygen containing medium and in a vacuum, on the spectrum and value of photosensitivity, dark resistance, noise, etc. It was demonstrated that there exist a simultaneous close correlation between dark conduction of samples and their photoconduction. This correlation is explained by the charge transfer mechanism in media with strong spacial fluctuations of conduction. In view of the fact that despite strong changes in the photosensitivity value no significant changes occurred in the photoconduction spectrum during the process of low temperature annealing, it may be concluded that the absorption coefficient is not changing. Changes occur in the product of the parameters �_t_, where � is the conduction and _t_ is the life-time of the nonequilibrium carriers. In order to uncover which is the most contributing factor in the photoconduction changes: changes in the transport properties of the carriers, which affect the dark conduction, or changes in the life-time of nonequilibrium carriers, the dark conduction of samples and their photoconduction, as well as the photoconduction and the life-time of the nonequilibrium carriers was examined. These parameters were measured in a lot of samples with a large distribution of the photoconduction value. Samples with a higher conduction exhibited a higher photoconduction.
