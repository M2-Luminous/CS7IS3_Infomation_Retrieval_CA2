Can we expect Ukraine to have a future without serious changes in its rural communities? Can we move ahead in the market reforms and abandon these communities to be torn apart by central and local bureaucrats and to be destroyed by their own inner conflicts? Some kind of inner framework is still preventing the total ruin of the agrarian sector. Is it possible that the safety margin has not been depleted? My conversation with Vasiliy Tsyuroy, first deputy chief of the Vinytsya Oblast State Administration and head of the oblast department of agriculture and food, began with these questions. "All of that is true," Vasiliy Alekseyevich said. "Although the rural communities are on their last legs, they are still pulling the wobbly cart of our economy. No one else is pulling it--not the coal miners, the power engineers, or the machine builders, who are accustomed to treating even minor problems as absolute disasters. The rural communities are pulling the cart, and they are doing it in silence, possibly because they are aware of their duty and responsibility to the state.... "Do you remember all of the recent cases of the overt and covert deception of the rural communities? In response, they produced a harvest that broke almost all previous records! The farmers in the oblast produced, for example, 2.9 million tonnes of grain (the third highest yield in oblast history), more than 530,000 tonnes of sugar, more sunflowers, vegetables, and fruit than in recent years, and much more meat, dairy products, and various canned goods. "What did the peasants get in return? Not money, or equipment, or fertilizer, or gasoline or diesel fuel. Once again, they got nothing. But we are depleting their safety margin. When the long-suffering peasants' patience runs out, this will break the last cord that is keeping our rickety economy afloat." [Baras] Vasiliy Alekseyevich, Vinytsya Oblast has a special agrarian status in the republic. People have good reason to call it the "great granary" and the "sugar Donbass" of Ukraine. It is no secret that the oblast annually produces 14-15 percent of Ukraine's sugar, which is an extremely valuable, almost strategic product for our state. It accounts for an equally substantial share of the whole Ukrainian harvest and the output of meat, milk, fruit.... Is this not a strong argument for the government, the legislators, and the financiers?... [Tsyuroy] You know, this is one of those cases in which they are sawing off the branch on which they are seated. It does not take much of a brain to realize that you have to invest money if you want to develop production and get a bigger yield, but they are telling us that the state is too poor to invest in the rural community. At this time, you see, it cannot extend any credit to the agrarian sector either, because this would escalate inflationary processes. But can it at least pay for the work that has already been done? Apparently, it cannot do this either. Then what can the peasant rely on, if the state will not keep its promises, fulfill its obligations and agreements, or abide by its laws? Sugar refineries are now paying kolkhozes and motor vehicle enterprises in sugar, but the prices are set in Kiev. But why? Why should the Cabinet of Ministers, "Ukrsakhar," "Ukrmyaso," and other such bureaucratic superstructures, which essentially have not even lifted a finger to give the agrarian sector in the oblast a sense of state priorities, have total control over the results of peasant labor? Yes, we realize that these are state requisitions and that they have to be used to pay for petroleum products and other such resources, but who said that we have to give them to the state for free? How can there be any arguments about priorities when the state has treated and is still treating the rural communities so unscrupulously?! Tomorrow it will be time to go back into the fields. How will each peasant feel when he gets to the grain or beet field?! How can we explain to the machine operator that the state does not give a damn, to put it bluntly, whether or not the equipment is ready for the spring season?! I could talk about many things that are hindering the development of the agrarian sector and the whole oblast economy. They include the high percentage of farming products in the structure of the gross agricultural product, which requires higher material and labor expenditures. They also include the excessive plowing of the land (the ratio of plowed fields to all agricultural land is 17 percent above the republic average), which leads to erosion and to ecological and social problems. They also include the aging of our equipment, which is becoming increasingly difficult to replace or repair.... All of these things are naturally being discussed by the peasants today, and all of them create problems for us, but no one is listening to us.... [Baras] Nevertheless, even after political battles have caused many statesmen to lose their senses, life in the rural community goes on. In fact, it was able to enter a new phase of economic and agrarian reform during this difficult time. As far as I know, various forms of ownership are being established in the oblast, stock and shares are being issued in agricultural enterprises, some are being incorporated.... Many people, however, are worried about the future of the rural community. Will the prevailing form of ownership be collective or private? [Tsyuroy] Judging by all indications, collective farms will still be prevalent in the agrarian sector in the next few years. This is not a result of the conservative thinking of the farm chairmen, who supposedly do not want change. The fact is that kolkhozes and sovkhozes, with their infrastructure, microclimate, and production and consumer relations, represent the whole rural world, and their sudden elimination would be impossible and dangerous. People sometimes tell us that we conservative peasants are impeding reform. But why would they say that? We now have 677 kolkhozes, 85 interfarm enterprises, 114 sovkhozes, and 723 family farms in the oblast. I think the last figure could be several times greater if all of the declarative statements of legislators in reference to family farms could have been backed up by some material content. Even then, however, their contribution to the gross agricultural product would be negligible. On the other hand, the reform of the agrarian sector presupposes not only the development of the family farm, but also the conversion of collective farms. The administrators of these farms are using several different methods: Some are issuing stock in the farms, some are dividing the property and the land into shares, and the kolkhoz in Lipovka in Tomashpolskiy Rayon, which is headed by Ukrainian People's Deputy Nikolay Melnik, has been turned into a corporation. What all of these methods have in common is that the peasant has become the owner of part of the property and land of the kolkhoz and earns dividends for their use and a regular wage for his work. Meanwhile, all of the peasants on a single farm are still the collective owners of the property, which has allowed them to retain their customary way of life. What will happen in the future? If current processes continue in a non-coercive manner, the private and collective principles eventually will converge in the rural community. What I mean is that the interests of the peasant owner will be manifested more and more clearly on the collective farms, and the wish to unite in associations, unions, or firms performing specific services for farms on the basis of mutual interest and advantage will grow stronger on the family farms. This, incidentally, does not exclude the possibility of the coexistence of kolkhozes and family farms in their pure form. The processor of agricultural products works hand in hand with the producer. On the one hand, the oblast has 1,600 farms producing grain, sugar beets, and animal husbandry products, and on the other it has a food industry and processing industry constituting almost half of the oblast industrial sector. We could ask who makes a bigger contribution to the final output--the producer or the processor? Specialists have calculated that the labor of the rural producer represents from 70 to 90 percent of the value of the final product, but it is usually the processor who comes out ahead in mutual settlements. Not by his own design, of course, but through the good graces of "Ukrsakhar," "Ukrmyaso," and other such organizations and with the blessing of the Cabinet of Ministers and the legislators. In other words, the state is still imposing its own rules of play and deliberately putting partners in unequal positions. What kind of market relations are these? It is just another way of fleecing the rural community! [Baras] Yes, the rural community is in the throes of agony, along with the rest of our economy, but tomorrow it will be time to go back into the fields, and the grain farmer will not give up even in the face of futility. Will he really have to use the last bit of his strength to prove that Ukraine cannot survive without grain? Is there really no other method of keeping the rural community alive? [Tsyuroy] Reform. That is the only solution--the development of different forms of ownership, competition between them, purposeful state investments, the establishment of a balanced processing structure, and the institution of genuine market relations, and not relations controlled by Kiev--these are the means of rural recovery. On the other hand, we can rely on reform, but we also have to do our part. The peasant has to begin by giving up the expectation that the rural community will get equipment, spare parts, and petroleum products from central supplies. Otherwise, we will have no hope of emerging from this quandary. We are trying not to tempt fate. In the last two years the oblast assumed almost all of the responsibility for supplying the agrarian sector with spare parts, fertilizer, herbicides, and petroleum products. We will continue to do this. Equipment is a bigger problem because it has to come from Russia or Belarus. We managed to find a solution to this as well, however: Several dozen different types of machines and mechanisms, including silage harvesters, beet harvesters, and universal reels, and different accessories and spare parts will be produced here--at oblast enterprises, including those that worked for the military establishment of the former union. We have no other alternative at this time.
