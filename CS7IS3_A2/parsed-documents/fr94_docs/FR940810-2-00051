FR940810-2-00051 FR940810-2-00028 [Docket Nos. RS92&hyph;45&hyph;000, RP94&hyph;87&hyph;000, et al., RP94&hyph;346&hyph;000, and RP94&hyph;346&hyph;004] Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America; Redocketing Filings and Compliance Filing and Establishment of Restricted Service List August 4, 1994. Take notice that on July 19, 1994, Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (Natural) filed revised tariff sheets to be a part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Sixth Revised Volume No. 1 (Tariff), to be effective September 1, 1994. Natural's filing was originally docketed in Docket No. RS92&hyph;45&hyph;018, and is being redocketed as Docket No. RP94&hyph;346&hyph;004. Natural states that the purpose of the filing is to implement the Stipulation and Agreement on Gas Supply Realignment Cost Recovery between Natural and the Natural Customer Group as filed on February 1, 1994, and approved by the Commission with modifications on May 12, 1994. The tariff sheets modify two areas of the General Terms and Conditions of Natural's Tariff: Section 22, relating to rollover rights and Section 38, relating to recovery of gas supply realignment costs. Natural requests waiver of the Commission's Regulations, including the requirements to §154.63, to the extent necessary to permit the tariff sheets to become effective September 1, 1994. Natural states that copies of its filing were served on all parties to this proceeding, jurisdictional transportation customers and interested state regulatory agencies. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest this filing should file a motion to intervene or a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, in accordance with §§385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before August 19, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room. The Commission is redocketing the material in the record related to the instant compliance filing into Docket No. RP94&hyph;346&hyph;000. This material is listed in the Appendix to this notice. All parties in Natural's restructuring proceedings in Docket No. RS92&hyph;45&hyph;000 are automatically parties to the redocketed proceedings and need not file motions to intervene. However, due to the large number of parties on the service list in Natural's restructuring proceeding, the Secretary is establishing a restricted service list for the redocketed filings in accordance with §385.2010 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. The restricted service list will be the only service list maintained with respect to the redocketed filings. Parties wishing to be included on the restricted service list must submit to the Secretary of the Commission the names and addresses of the persons designated for service on or before August 19, 1994. Linwood A. Watson, Jr., Acting Secretary.
