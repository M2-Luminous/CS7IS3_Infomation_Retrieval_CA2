FBIS4-58626 "drnes088_p_94002" FBIS-NES-94-088 Daily Report 2 May 1994 SOUTH ASIA Afghanistan Rabbani-Gilani Rift Widens With Minister Recall Rabbani-Gilani Rift Widens With Minister Recall 94P50137A London AL-HAYAH in Arabic 2 May 94 p 8 94P50137A London AL-HAYAH Arabic CSO [Report by Ahmad Muwaf faq Zaydan] [Excerpt] Peshawar--Informed Afghan sources told AL-HAYAH yesterday that a deepseated difference of opinion had broken out between President Borhanoddin Rabbani and his foreign minister, Hedayat Amin Arsala, after the latter refused to respond to presidential instructions that recalled him to Kabul on 21 March. The foreign minister visited the Central Asian republics last week on what Rabbani described as "a personal visit that does not represent the state." This difference of opinion resulted from statements made by Seyyed Ahmad Gilani, the leader of the Mahaz-e Melli-ye Eslami [National Islamic Front], to which Arsala belongs. Gilani, in his statements, criticized Rabbani's steps to extend his administration, which ends in June according to the Islamabad agreement and the Mecca pact between the mojahedin groups. The relationship between Rabbani and Gilani became more tepid after the latter received a delegation of the coordination council opposed to Rabbani's rule in light of news about attempts by the opposition side to convince Gilani to join its ranks. The opposition, led by Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar, seized the opportunity at rapprochement with Gilani after the president's steps to dismiss the Afghan ambassador in Islamabad, Dr. Mohammad Roshan. It is well known that Roshan also belongs to Gilani's front. Sadeq Tashkari, the Afghan president's aide, told AL-HAYAH that Engineer Mokhtar is the ambassador's charge d'affaires. However, Roshan has not left the embassy and has refused to answer Rabbani's demand for his recall to Kabul in order to appoint him to the post of director of consular affairs in the Foreign Ministry. The opinion of observers is that if Gilani secedes from the Rabbani alliance, the latter may suffer a major blow since it would not leave anyone in his alliance other than the Ettehad-e Eslami led by 'Abd-Rabb Rasul Sayyaf, with some remaining neutral and the rest in the ranks of the opposition. Mas'ud Khalili, one of the commanders of the Jam'iat-e Eslami (led by President Rabbani) who lives in Kabul, comment on the subject. He told journalists, "This is a strange situation. It is up to the Gilani group to define its position. Is it still in the alliance or has it left?" Khalili did not comment on whether Kabul had appointed a new foreign minister or not. In addition, artillery battles continued between the opposition and government forces in the Afghan capital yesterday in which 70 people were wounded. [passage omitted]
