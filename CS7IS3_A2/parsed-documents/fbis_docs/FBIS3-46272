The income was a 20 percent rise over 1992, according to statistics released yesterday by Chinese customs authorities. Officials from the Customs General Administration (CGA) [as published] attributed the sharp growth in tariff income to booming trade, China's rapidly developing national economy and a change in the composition of imports. China's soaring domestic demand for imports was the major factor behind the rise in import tariffs, they said, adding that, excluding international aid and donations, China's imports of general merchandise last year rose 25.2 percent over l992. For example, steel imports rose to 30.34 million tons, up 327 percent over 1992; processed oil imports 17.48 million tons, up 128 percent; imports of automobiles or wheelbases by 310,000 units, up 47 percent; and imports of aircraft 129 units, up 79 percent. There was also a marked increase in the imports of Hi-Fi and TV sets from Japan and other developed countries as well as cars from the CIS republics. The officials also attributed the rise to CGA measures last year to improve customs inspections on imported goods and its crackdown on fake goods. Last year, import duties rose 19.58 percent over 1992 to reach 25.62 billion yuan ($2.94 billion), while export duties grew by 32.11 percent to hit 260 million yuan ($29.9 million).
