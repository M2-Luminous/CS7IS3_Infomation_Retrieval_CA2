Provincial party, government, and military leaders attended the ceremony, including Liu Fangren, Chen Shineng, Wang Chaowen, Long Zhiyi, Wang Siqi, Wang Guangxian, Hu Kehui, and others. They took lead in donating more than 10,000 items of clothing, more than 200 books, and 1,500 yuan in cash to the masses in Mashan and Yaoshan. At the ceremony, provincial party committee Deputy Secretary Wang Siqi said: I hope that party and government departments in various localities will strengthen organization and leadership, and that -- taking these donations as a starting point -- they will carry out education throughout the province on struggling hard, and practicing thrift, patriotism and collectivism. He also pointed out: At present, there are quite a lot of impoverished people in our province. Governments in all localities must fully realize the difficulties, importance, and complexity of work to support the impoverished. We must arouse our emotions, take real action, and use our heads to increase the weight of the work to support the impoverished. Only thus can we change the situation in the impoverished areas. Provincial party committee Secretary Liu Fangren and Governor Chen Shineng were interviewed by reporters. They said: On the one hand, the present activities to devote warmth to the masses in Mashan and Yaoshan have shown that our province is implementing conscientiously the policy of the CPC Central Committee. On the other hand, such activities are the common desire of the broad masses of cadres and people throughout the province. They have strongly promoted the work to support the impoverished throughout the province. There are 10 million people in our province who need support. In Mashan and Yaoshan, there are 300,000 poor people. If the work to support the impoverished in these two areas is carried out well, it can play the role of grasping the key point to promote the work as a whole. I believe that the broad masses of party members and cadres will participate actively in such activities to support the impoverished and aid households in need. While answering reporters' questions, they stressed: In carrying out such activities, we need a good plan. However, what is more important is that we need to work in a down-to-earth manner. The present donations are only part of the project to support the impoverished. We must help them develop and improve the quality of production and education, with the emphasis on development. It is necessary to solve the problem of impoverishment once and for all, and to help these impoverished areas develop their self-supporting capabilities and to survive. They emphasized: The activities of devoting affection are merely a good start in supporting the impoverished. There is much work to be done. The provincial party committee and government have the confidence and determination to carry out well the work to support the impoverished. After the ceremony, provincial party committee Secretary Liu Fangren and Governor Chen Shineng talked with responsible comrades of the office in charge of the activities, and asked them to contact one child in Maoshan and one in Yaoshan who were deprived of education, promising to subsidize them.
