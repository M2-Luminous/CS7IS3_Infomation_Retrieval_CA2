Harry Villega, chief of the political department of the Western Army. Good morning. I am reminded of Che, for Villega had much to do with Che's involvement in Bolivia. But we can discuss that some other time. Let us begin with the Western Army's combat readiness. The effort and commitment -- not only political commitment but also work commitment -- required to maintain an Armed Forces such as ours during such difficult times has always concerned me. We cannot afford to lose the commitment, spirit, and combat readiness of our troops and militiamen and of the people, in general, since this is the Armed Forces of the people in uniform. How has the Western Army maintained combat readiness? What initiatives has it taken to maintain such high combat readiness levels? [Valle] The commander in chief, the Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR] minister, and the leadership of the Cuban Communist Party and Government have always known this. The guidelines our commander in chief issued before the special period were aimed at finding cheaper solutions to maintaining our combat training and readiness level, in light of the fact that Cuba was heading toward an energy crisis that would affect every aspect of national life. We began to work on this immediately. Keep in mind that the special period began around the time the mission in Angola was ending. That is when we arrived in Cuba. From that point on, the Western Army engaged in those tasks with the other armies. Today, the people's combat training is more solid than ever. There is a certain amount of expertise involved in training regular troops for combat today, thanks to trainers who look for ways to improve combat training methods at integral training ranges and at relatively smaller ranges. Command and control exercises and training and general staff's and chief's exercises upgrade cadre training. We have managed to make the soldiers' overall training much more efficient and have increased the recruits' basic training time from eight to 10 weeks, allowing soldiers to arrive at their units with higher quality training. This has allowed us to maintain the Armed Forces' combat training and readiness levels despite the ongoing special period. [Cavada] Yes. Above all, the austerity and commitment to continuing the training and to not lowering the combat training and readiness levels has prevailed. I would like to discuss later the Western Army's 33 years and, specifically, how lately, due to the economic situation facing Cuba, the Army has engaged in productive tasks. Armies worldwide are unproductive state institutions which feed off the government and state budget. In Cuba's case, there has been a willingness and commitment to turn the army into a productive sector to benefit the army itself and the rest of the population.
