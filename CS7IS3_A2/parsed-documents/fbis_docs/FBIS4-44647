It is the middle of the night in the wood, but a strange electronic creature is spying on the secrets of nature. At first sight it resembles a camera mounted on a tripod, but there is something special inside those lenses and printed circuits. In the absence of light an infrared eye records details that not even the most sophisticated lens would be able to see during the day. Officine Galileo of Florence have jokingly renamed the nocturnal vision system an "electronic owl." Why is it different from all the others? Because the "electronic owl" does not act on reflected light as usually happens, but succeeds in capturing the radiation emitted by the subject. The glass lens has been replaced by an opaque germanium disk that helps in capturing wavelengths that are not visible to normal cameras. The images are then processed by a workstation, which reproduces the outline of the animals, their most secret habits, their movements, and their numbers on the monitor. This technology is also used in the military sector. Officine Galileo has applied it to firing and sighting systems used during the Gulf War. Above all, the system developed by the Tuscany-based company, does not annoy "the animals of the night." In fact, the animals are not aware of the presence of the electronic intruder and therefore their reactions are recorded without any outside interference. The "infrared owl" is just the first in a series of projects developed as a result of the reconversion of Officine Galileo's military sector production which accounted for 80 percent of its total production up to 1978. A system that combines a mix of leading-edge technologies, electronics, and computer science has been developed to safeguard against forest fires. Special cameras installed in various parts of the forest and connected to a computerized center, provide precious round-the-clock information on the area and sound the alarm in case of fire. The civil sector technology has another winning card: the multiple use of systems. For example, the fire watchdogs can also be used to transmit information of the state of health of vegetation and on pollution levels. Today, the majority of Officine Galileo's production is dedicated to civil systems (approximately 60 percent) and primarily for environmental protection. A bet that Officine Deputy Director Bruno Minguzzi comments on with a little bitterness: "There is still little awareness in connection with environmental protection and conservation. Programs are either not being launched or proceed very slowly."
