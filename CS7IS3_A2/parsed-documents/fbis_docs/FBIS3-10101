Colombia is studying the best options to sell oil to Cuba under international and commercial terms. This statement was made in light of the fact that Cuban exiles in the United States are discussing the possibility of boycotting Colombian products, which, according to Nule Amin, can only hurt small Colombian businessmen in cities in Florida. Nule Amin added that Colombia views with interest the possibility of trade with Cuba and sees no reason that Colombia cannot sell oil directly to Cuba. A review process of all the terms of the operation is under way, particularly issues regarding forms of payment. Nule Amin stressed that Cuba exports such products as sugar, fruit, tobacco, rum, and nickel. He added that with these exports, Cuba can guarantee payment for the fuel.
