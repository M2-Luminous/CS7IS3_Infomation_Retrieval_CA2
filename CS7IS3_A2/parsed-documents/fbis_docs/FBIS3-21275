This is a sign to which investors attach great expectations, hoping that it will lead the market out of the stagnation it has been experiencing for several months. AL-MAJALLAH has become certain that a number of transactions were concluded in recent weeks as a result of a 5-10 percent drop in land prices and a 20-25 percent drop in apartment prices, whereas investment real estate has maintained its high levels. Arab and foreign firms owned by Jordanians led the market activity in a step which has been characterized by observers as being within the framework of preparation for the post-peace era, which has entered the countdown phase. High-level economic sources expect great growth in the Jordanian building and construction sector in the foreseeable future. They expect this sector's contribution to the domestic product to exceed the figures recorded in 1992, amounting to 99 percent [as published], and to the added value, amounting to 164 million dinars [JD] ($237.8 million). This sector is characterized by the fact that it is interlocked with the other sectors. Nearly 15 percent of the gross domestic product is attributed to this sector. This real estate market activity coincides with the imminent implementation of the Jordanian five-year plan projects. This plan's investment program abounds with a large number of infrastructure construction projects. Construction sector experts assert that the volume of credit facilities provided by Jordanian banking apparatus units from the beginning of the year to the end of last August amounted to JD572 million, amounting to 21 percent and ranking second behind the commercial sector. Engineer Muhammad Ibrahim, a Jordanian real estate officer, believes that the banks' demands of real estate investors compelled the latter to reduce their prices in order to fulfill their bank obligations. The market responded promptly to this reduction, which amounted to nearly 20 percent in some cases, thus devouring investors' profits. Engineer Ibrahim expects that the building and construction sector's performance will improve with the inauguration of the economic activities of the Palestinian-Israeli accord, which will extend to the other sectors because of the link between the Palestinian and Jordanian economies. Engineer Muhammad Khayr Zayd al-Kaylani, a real estate investor and chairman of the Housing Real Estate Investors Association, does not agree with Engineer Ibrahim regarding the reduced prices' impact on the market. But al-Kaylani did agree that the market has been experiencing severe stagnation since last September because of political reasons, coupled with lack of clarity in the Jordanian economy's future trends and the state of anticipation and caution prevailing in the various sectors of the Jordanian economy. Al-Kaylani agrees that the market suffers from a surplus in housing apartments, noting that this surplus started to accumulate in the second half of this year. He added that 2.7 million square meters were licensed in 1990. The figure rose to 4.37 million square meters in 1991 and 6.5 millions square meters in 1992 as a result of the leap in demand for housing and land in wake of the return of 350,000 expatriates from Kuwait. Al-Kaylani added that the picture has changed this year, with the licensed area amounting in the first half of this year to 1.65 square million meters. The figure is expected to amount to 3 million square meters by the end of the year. Fawwaz Mahmud, the head of a business group, denied that there is a big surplus in housing apartments in the Jordanian real estate market. He asserted that the international apartment vacancy rate ranges from 7-10 percent to meet demand for relocation, seasonal tourism, citizens' needs to change their housing, and other reasons. Mahmud expects apartment prices to hold up, supporting his opinion with the statement that most of the building and construction industry raw material is imported from abroad and not subject to local market activity. He added that selling apartments at reduced prices means saddling real estate investors with losses. On his part, Isma'il 'Amr, director of the Amman International Real Estate Firm, expects the real estate market to move later, perhaps in 1995, because the market has experienced unprecedented construction activity and real estate investments amounted to JD1.5 billion ($2.2 billion). He added that this activity was not planned activity and that the fifth private sector took the initiative in this activity. Excess local liquidity, large and unstable demand for housing real estate, and limited investment opportunities in the Jordanian market added momentum to the construction activity. In the past 30 years the real estate market has experienced fluctuations, strangulations, and demand periods, spurred mainly by compulsory evacuations, political events witnessed by the region since 1967, the Lebanese war and the Kuwait war of liberation, and finally, the peace process and the Gaza-Jericho accord and the results they are expected to produce.
