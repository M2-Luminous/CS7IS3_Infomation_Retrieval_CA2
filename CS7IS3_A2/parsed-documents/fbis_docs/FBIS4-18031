Why?"] [Text] As the paper TRUD reported the other day, during a routine meeting between Boris Yeltsin and the staff of the Federal Counterintelligence Service (FCS), the president issued instructions for a probe of all officials of the president's apparatus, government apparatus, and all top power structures for corruption. When approached by IZVESTIYA, the FCS refused point-blank to comment on the subject -- even to provide information on whether the "instructions" were verbal or in the form of a document. The FCS Public Relations Center announced that no one would talk with us about the president's directive. The actual FCS chief, Sergey Stepashin, perhaps... Stepashin's day was described as "very busy," of course -- today and in the immediate future. But this report, made in passing, appears highly important and worthy of attention. And since there is no official informatiom to be had on the subject we will have to use guesswork. Hypothesis number one. The president really is intent on a "shake-up" at the top in order to fight corruption. The fact that there are indeed things to combat militates in favor of this scenario. Moreover, this kind of activity brings political dividends: Fighters against corruption invariably enjoy public esteem. But this tidy scenario is spoiled by the simple consideration that mass measures of a similar nature, embarked on on more than one occasion before, have generally got nowhere. They have been ineffective at any rate. And the people who thought up the latest "purge" are certainly aware of this. It occurs to one that these people had some special intention, somehwat different from the stated intention. What is it? Hypothesis number two. If one assumes that the president and his analysts are aware of the ineffectiveness of mass "purges," then one deduces that they are taking an interest not in all the "top structures of state power" but only a certain segment of them. Analysts tend to believe that it is likely to be the government apparatus. To be precise, Chernomyrdin's immediate entourage. The beginning of the year has clearly been marked by a strengthening of the premier's position. The January government reshuffle and the recent appointment of two new vice premiers graphically demonstrated the extent of the Cabinet of Ministers chief's independence. But the premier is finding a common language with parliament. At any rate, he is treated very fairly both in the Duma and in the Senate. His rating is steadily rising. Observers point out that the "Gazprom" concern could be significantly strengthened in the very near future -- if it succeeds in taking over part of the infrastructure and some of the oil refineries in Ukraine which are seriously in debt to the Russian oil industry. Clearly, this will also strengthen the premier's positions. If this scenario is correct, then, experts believe, the people bound up with the oil structures will have a claim to be "leading figures" in anticorruption cases. The reasoning behind this is that there have been more and more reports in the press of late about offenses being committed by those specializing in oil exports. According to this scenario, there will very probably be major oil scandals in the very near future. It is also thought that currently influential vice premier Oleg Soskovets could also feature in Chernomyrdin's "oil" entourage. He had had a lot of oilmen "attacking" him of late. Suddenly all the "attacks" stopped, Soskovets turned out to be their friend, and even arranged for some benefits for the oilmen. But there is also the suggestion that the cases of corruption will not result in serious scandals. The president's current instructions, made public quite deliberately in the media, will simply "frighten" certain people and do the job that way. Although it is not inconceivable that the fight against corruption could result in some government changes.
