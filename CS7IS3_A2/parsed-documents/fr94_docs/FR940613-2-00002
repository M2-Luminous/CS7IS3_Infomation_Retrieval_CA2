Background The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts (AOUSC) is responsible for the establishment of a program to facilitate the use of certified and otherwise qualified interpreters in courts of the United States. He must prescribe, determine, and certify the qualifications of person who may serve as certified interpreters in bilingual proceedings and proceedings involving the hearing impaired (28 U.S.C. 1827(b)). Whenever an interpreter is required for a person in any criminal or civil action initiated by the United States, the presiding judicial officer must utilize the services of the most available certified interpreter, unless no certified interpreter is reasonably available, or the services of an otherwise qualified interpreter. The AOUSC will provide the courts with a roster of certified, professionally qualified, and language skilled court interpreters selected on the basis of specific qualification criteria and/or the successful completion of written ad oral examinations. II. This Examination For Spanish language interpreter candidates, a comprehensive written Spanish/English examination testing bilingual proficiency in Spanish and English will be administered. For candidates in the Cantonese, Mandarin, and Korean languages, a written English examination testing proficiency in English will be administered. Successful candidates will be invited to sit for the second part of the certification examinations, an oral examination. The oral examination will test, in simulated settings, the applicant's ability to: (1) interpret precisely from source language to English, in consecutive and simultaneous modes; (2) interpret from English to the target language in consecutive and simultaneous modes; and (3) perform sight interpretations. The oral portion of the examination does not necessarily require previous experience in court interpreting. Applicants who successfully complete the written examination will receive notice of the time and place of the oral portion of the examination. For Arabic, Hebrew, Italian, Mien, Polish, and Russian interpreter candidates, a written English examination testing proficiency in English will be administered. The second part of the qualification process as a professional or language skilled court interpreter will require the candidate to provide additional qualifications and credentials or perform back translation exercises successfully. All of the examinations are developed and administered under contract by the University of Arizona. The written portion of the examination does not require a special knowledge of legal vocabulary.

Applicants must identify the testing location which they desire to use to use for taking the written examinations.

Exam Procedures Each applicant will receive an admission ticket to the exam shortly before the exam date. It will list the exact location of the exam. Each applicant must present the admission ticket and a photo identification: driver's license, passport, work/student identification, etc., to be admitted to the exam. III. Qualifications Sucessful completion of the written examination is the first step in the process of receiving certification or ``otherwise qualified'' status. There is no formal educational requisite, either in languages or interpreting, for successfully completing the written examinations. However, the difficulty of the written examinations are at the college degree level of proficiency in both English and the target languages. Successful completion of the oral portion of the examination normally would require prior training or professional experience in simultaneous and consecutive interpreting and sight translation. Qualification as ``otherwise qualified'' will require additional credentials and experience as an interpreter. IV. Duties Certification or ``otherwise qualified'' status will not necessarily lead to full-time employment as a staff or contract interpreter. Most of the requirements for court interpretation services in the Federal courts are met by independent interpreter contractors on an as-needed basis. However, where full-time interpreters are needed, only certified interpreters are eligible for appointment. As the federal courts require full-time salaried interpreters, these interpreters will be chosen from the eligibility lists. The annual salary range is JSP&hyph;10 to JSP&hyph;14 ($31,898&hyph;$76,733) for full-time salaried interpreters. For certified interpreters who provide services as independent contractors, the fee is $250 per day. Court interpreters perform all or some of the following duties: (1) Interpret verbatim in simultaneous and consecutive modes a foreign language into English, and vice versa, at arraignments, preliminary hearings, pretrial hearings, trials, and other court proceedings; (2) transcribe and translate electronic sound recordings; and (3) sight translate or translate in written form technical, medical, and legal documents and correspondence for introduction as evidence.
