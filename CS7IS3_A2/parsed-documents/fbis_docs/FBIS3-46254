Mrs Chan was responding to comments by the Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Lu Ping. Mr Lu questioned the legitimacy of the Secretary for Constitutional Affairs, Michael Sze Chocheung, to represent the people of Hong Kong at the British Foreign Affairs Select Committee (FAC) meeting. Noting that Mr Sze had been asked to represent Hong Kong people at the FAC meeting, Mr Lu said: "How many people in Hong Kong regard this `faithful' follower (of Governor Chris Patten) as a Hong Kong `person'?" Responding to the comments, Mrs Chan said: "I very much hope that both sides could deal with matters (of substance) instead of targeting the individuals."
