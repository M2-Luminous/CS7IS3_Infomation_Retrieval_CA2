This week the newspaper KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI published a report from a press conference held by Ukrainian Defense Minister Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy: In this own words, Mr. Radetskiy wouldn't want to have to liberate Crimea like the Americans did Kuwait. This happened not long before the presidential elections in Crimea. On the backdrop of the command-and-staff exercise held by the Ukrainian Armed Forces from 24 to 27 January, the general's uplifted spirits evoked a response from the Black Sea Fleet press center. "The absence of such a desire on the part of General V. Radetskyy (to transform Crimea into Kuwait.--Author) inspires great hopes for maintaining peace and stability in Crimea," read a statement by the Black Sea Fleet press center. In this case "the Black Sea Fleet command doubts that the general could become a Schwartzkopf, despite the fact that the army has nurtured many handsome, young and promising generals. Operation Desert Storm, which General Schwartzkopf led, occurred in a totally different situation, and it had nothing in common with the well publicized statement `Crimea will be Ukrainian or a desert'." Moreover "the Desert Storm peacekeeping action was carried out under a well-tuned command and control system using common terminology, and it was supported by the military-economic potential of 14 states. On the other hand...the Ukrainian Armed Forces do not have a unified command and control system, and assimilation of military terminology is one of the problems. The fact that participation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Kiev was treated by the troops as an exercise inspires confidence in their peaceful nature," the Black Sea Fleet press center subtly notes. Another unique message came to Black Sea Fleet chief of staff Petr Svetashov in the form of a telegram from Ukrainian Navy chief of staff Aleksiy Ryzhenko: "We will consider the Black Sea Fleet marine brigade to be a FOREIGN FORMATION on Ukrainian territory." "This `gift' is dedicated to the brigade's exercises," explained acting chief of the Black Sea Fleet press center Andrey Grachev to MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS. "It's as if we don't have the right to conduct exercises without giving advance notice to the Ukrainian side. But there isn't a single document that foresees such a thing in relation to what is still the Russian-Ukrainian Black Sea Fleet." The Yalta agreement, which declared the Black Sea Fleet to be Russian-Ukrainian, and approved subordination of the fleet's main command to two presidents, was and remains the sole legal basis for actions of the Black Sea Fleet. To its deep misfortune the staff of the Ukrainian Navy has no right to "consent to" exercises or display any other such attention to units of the Black Sea Fleet. It is altogether difficult to count the number of "petty" accusations that have been levied against the Black Sea Fleet by Ukraine. Ask Black Sea Fleet commanders why they buy uniforms in Russia, and watch their eyes pop out: "If Ukraine can't make uniforms, are you saying we should go naked?' is the reply. According to our unofficial data, by the way, General Radetskyy himself bought eight pairs of uniform trousers for 8,000 rubles, and is now going around in a Soviet officer's uniform. By the way, the Black Sea Fleet itself gets little pleasure from this "war." The Massandrovskiy Russian-Ukrainian Protocol of 1993, which transfers the Black Sea Fleet to Russia in exchange for cancellation of part of Ukraine's debts, has still not been ratified. The Black Sea Fleet remains in limbo. Black Sea Fleet servicemen are not protected by a single law, inasmuch as "they don't belong" to either country, and Russian-Ukrainian dual citizenship still doesn't exist. Despite all of this, 95 percent of the officers feel themselves to be Russian citizens. Wages have not been paid to servicemen since December. But it would be more than immodest to talk about the collapse of the navy: The Black Sea Fleet took second place among all fleets of the former Union on the basis of the year's results. Black Sea Fleet ships proved their combat capability when they evacuated 60,000 refugees from Poti. * * * At his first press conference Yuriy Meshkov, the newly elected president of Crimea, announced that a referendum on self-determination will be held in Crimea in March. It became known to us from unofficial sources in Kiev that in response to such actions by the Crimean side, Ukraine will not ratify the agreement to remove nuclear warheads from Ukrainian territory.
