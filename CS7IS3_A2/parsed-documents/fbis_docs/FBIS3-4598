Minister Yi Yong-tok told the National Assembly's committee on foreign affairs and unification that the urgent problem of separated families should be solved along with the North Korean nuclear issue. North Korea, in talks with the United States on Saturday, agreed to permit inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on March 1 on condition that South-North contacts on exchanging special envoys are held in early March. During the 1950-53 Korean War, about 10 million people were separated from their families and have since not been able to meet with relatives on the other side of the divided peninsula. Yi also said the government will strive to solve pending inter- Korean issues like the nuclear problem through direct talks, considering public opinion which holds that South Korean efforts alone have been insufficient. The special envoys to be exchanged will deliver personal letters from their respective presidents and discuss major issues and the holding of an inter-Korean summit, according to the NUB minister. In particular, the envoys will seek a breakthrough in the nuclear problem, normalized implementation of the South-North basic agreement and a joint declaration on denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, Yi said. On the possibility of an inter-Korean summit, he said: "There is no change in the government position that the nuclear problem should be solved first. The summit meeting will discuss broadly all issues including the nuclear problem, but this means basing such discussion on prior settlement of the nuclear problem." Yi expected that the third round of high-level talks between North Korea and the United States may focus on North Korea's complete return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and Pyongyang's demand that Washington refrain from using nuclear weapons first. "Conclusion of a peace treaty between Pyongyang and Washington and improvement of bilateral relations are also expected to be dealt with at the third round of talks," Yi added. But North Korea, Yi said, will likely try to retain its "special position" of having suspended its withdrawal from the NPT while trying to use the IAEA's special and routine nuclear inspections and complete return to the NPT as negotiating cards at the talks with the United States.
