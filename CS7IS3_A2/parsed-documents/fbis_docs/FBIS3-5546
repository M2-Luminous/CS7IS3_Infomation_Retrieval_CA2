This is approximately by ten thousand less than during the last year. More than 92 thousand schoolchildren have stopped attending their lessons for the current schooling year. Such a weakening children's interest in study is being promoted by a number of objective and subjective factors. Among them one can see such as a formalistic attitude to the teaching in schools, low level professional skill of some teachers and at last financial difficulties arising in the transition period to a market. Last winter some 86 schools had to cease their studies due to the absence of heating supply to their schoolbuildings. For many of schools in the countryside there is a serious lack of teaching staff.
