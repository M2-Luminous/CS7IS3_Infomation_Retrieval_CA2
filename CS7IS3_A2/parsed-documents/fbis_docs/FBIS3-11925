A report appearing in the newspaper FOLHA DE SAO PAULO discloses that Cardoso has already advised President Itamar Franco of his intention to participate in the elections. The report adds that the minister has told Franco he would use the weekend to hold final consultations with his family. Cardoso's decision was confirmed by Pedro Simon, Senate government spokesman, who believes the minister will be a strong contender. "If today, Cardoso is obtaining a 12-percent popularity rating at the polls with the inflation rate at 40 percent, then most surely, when inflation falls to 12 percent, Cardoso will receive a rating close to 40 percent," Simon has said. Simon also disclosed that Franco, who discussed the issue with Cardoso on 24 March, has promised the finance minister that his resignation would not entail changes in the current cabinet or the country's economic program. The minister is the mastermind behind the economic adjustment program, which has been being gradually implemented since this past December and which entered its second phase three weeks ago with the introduction of a new economic modifier, the real value unit (URV). With this program, which is scheduled to be completed in a month when the real, a new monetary unit on par with the U.S. dollar, enters into circulation, Brazil is seeking to balance its public finances, which currently have a $22.10-billion deficit. The program also seeks to cut the inflation rate, which surpasses 40 percent monthly. "Whatever decision I may make, it will be based on my conviction that it is best for the economic program as well as for the country," Cardoso told "FOLHA DE SAO PAULO." A commentary that appeared in the same newspaper states Cardoso will officially present his resignation on 29 March and that the minister will be replaced by Pedro Malan, president of the Central Bank of Brazil. The report adds Malan will in turn be replaced by Public Debt Negotiator Persio Arida. Cardoso's candidacy is being promoted by the country's business sector as well as by leaders of several political groups interested in offsetting the presidential aspirations momentum of Luis Ignacio "Lula" da Silva, head of the socialist Labor Party. For the past year now, da Silva has led public opinion polls with a 30-percent preference, and he stands out as Franco's most likely successor during the general elections scheduled for 3 October.
