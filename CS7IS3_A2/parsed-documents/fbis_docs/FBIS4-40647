They are well aware that, out of the six registered candidates, only incumbent Prime Minister V. Kebich and A. Lukashenko, a former state farm director and former chairman of the Supreme Soviet Anticorruption Commission, have the best chance of success. Clearly pressuring them, Z. Pozniak, leader of the Belorussian [Belarusian] People's Front [BPF], has been making great advances recently. Head of a rural club, a professional photographer, theater expert, and archaeologist, he entered the political scene in the late eighties on the wave of revelations about Stalin's crimes. He became well known throughout the region for discovering and publicizing the site at Kuropaty near Minsk where NKVD prisoners were gunned down. Pozniak has irrevocably chosen the path of nationalism. This method has already worked well on the territory of certain republics of the former USSR and has yielded its adherents good dividends. Nationalism is the last phase of communism, the last attempt by an obsolete ideology to rid itself of responsibility for the past. It is always foreigners who are to blame -- that is every nationalist's conviction. Nor does it take long to work out who those foreigners are -- the Russians. In Belarus, which has always lived in the closest union with Russia -- the two peoples were united by the deepest ties of kinship -- this niche naturally remained unfilled. Pozniak filled it and tirelessly set about exposing "imperial Russia" and the "imperial Russian people" who brought to Belarus nothing but an "anticulture, boorishness, dissoluteness, drunkenness, Russian foul language, idleness, hatred, and lies." Who forms the basis of the support of the BPF and its leader Pozniak? There is the community of dilettantes in various spheres of intellectual activity, first and foremost in science and art. As a rule, these people are from an urban background and their knowledge of life comes from the communal kitchens and from narrow gatherings of like-minded people who are alienated from the profundity of a world culture which seems hostile to them and who assert their national culture at the level of amateur folk events. There is another force on which the BPF leader is undoubtedly counting -- the steadily growing stratum of society's dregs, whose only occupation since the very beginning of perestroyka has been to huddle together at rallies and processions and, with raucous cries, voice the "people's" indignation. This is not just the lumpen proletariat, but a special variety of it -- the lumpen intelligentsia. From their midst emerged a belligerent and fairly well organized detachment -- the Belorusian Association of Servicemen -- which donned uniforms and was not averse to a little saber rattling. Small businessmen have been infiltrating this circle, making money from the rampant rise in prices and the customs barriers which operated until recently in the east. The national card is also keenly played by the men of letters, who want to preserve the privileges that they enjoyed in the communist era -- the enormous print runs which no one ever bought, the royalties, and, most importantly, the attention lavished on them by the authorities. It is typical that the culture minister in Pozniak's "shadow" government has been publicly stating that the Russian language should be excluded from school syllabuses and could be "temporarily banned" altogether, that the publication and study of Russian writers should be stopped, and that such an "anti-Belarusian" work as Glinka's opera "Ivan Susanin" should be removed from the stage. And, of course, the "foreigners" should be thrown out. To these people a foreigner is anyone who uses Russian. "There is no place for them on Belarusian soil. These people should be sent back to Russia. The Russians and Belarusians are different people." Yet it is Russian that the bulk of the Republic's population speaks! Just who are these foreigners who have filled our land? For a long time now the Vietnamese have only been seen trading in the market places and the Chinese have not reached Belarus yet. The Americans and other Western "staffers" are only to be seen at the BPF's headquarters and hardly constitute a "foreign work force." It is more likely that they provide work for others. So the logical question to put to the zealous presidential contender is this: If the inscription "nationality" is to be removed from Belarusians' passports, will he not introduce the inscription "native language" so as to immediately determine who is a citizen of Belarus and who is a foreigner? And will this paragraph not be ratified by the law barring certain people from certain professions, which is already tacitly operating in some parts of our country now? Five years ago no one could even have conceived that many of the newspapers and magazines in Belarus would be filled with anti-Russian articles or that an entire congress of writers would stand to greet with rapturous applause a presidential contender who insulted a fraternal Slav people with these words: "This is a rag-bag of a people without a clearly defined national territory, alternating with Finno-Ugric, Turkic, Mongol and other enclaves, and scattered among colonies in Siberia and Asia. Its dominant consciousness is not national but imperial in essence...." And the presidential contender's special wrath is aroused by a Russian minister's statement that "they intend to defend the rights not just of the ethnic Russians but of the Russian speakers...." It goes without saying that Pozniak calls the existence of the Russian state itself into question. Indeed, in the presidential contender's mind it no longer exists. "Siberia, Central Asia, the Caucasus, the Far East, Ukraine, Moldova, and Belarus must find their own paths.... The creation of a Russian national state is not ruled out," Pozniak graciously adds. His hatred of Russia and the Russians knows no bounds. But is it only the Russians? Pozniak's ideas extend even further: "...The question of the return of the east Belarusian lands will be raised again. Along with the questions of compensation for the Chernobyl disaster, the USSR gold reserve, property abroad, and so forth. Further efforts will be made to...create a Baltic-Black Sea association of states and, in the long term, of all the states of East and Central Europe -- the former `socialist camp' -- apart from Russia." He is categorically opposed to any unification of the currency system between Russia and Belarus and promises that "a stable Belarusian currency will be introduced. That will stop inflation and the rise in prices. It will fill the stores with high-quality goods." Pozniak has been intimidating the voters by saying that "Russia will wage an economic war aimed at destroying the republic's economy." Recently some Moscow newspapers have begun claiming that Z. Pozniak had a drastic change of attitude toward Russia on the eve of the presidential elections. Would that it were so. Here is his statement to a correspondent from SOVETSKAYA BELORUSSIYA (9 June 1994): "Your view is wrong. Russian policy toward Belarus has not changed for centuries. Therefore, my attitude toward that country is unchanged, too. Russia, as a vast Eurasian state with an imperial history and ideology, still exists, no matter how it is dressed up -- it was, is, and will remain the enemy of our Belarusian independence and our freedom. We must proceed from this incontrovertible truth and it alone when building our real state relations with the East." Pozniak has mounted his favorite hobby horse and, spurring it on with nationalist and anti-Russian ideas, is clearly setting his sights at the presidency. But is he not overestimating his own chances of success?
