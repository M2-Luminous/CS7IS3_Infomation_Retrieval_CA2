"Malaysia," he went on, "considers that the countries concerned should show reason in settling the problem of the Korean peninsula and not cause a war. If any party resorts to a means of high pressure, a war would break out in that region and it would affect the security of the Asia-Pacific region." "Malaysia hopes the countries concerned sit at a negotiating table and resolve this issue in a peaceful way and opposes any country building up nuclear weapons or increasing nuclear capacity," he said.
