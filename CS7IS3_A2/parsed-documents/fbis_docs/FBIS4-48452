An announcement ending the NPKF's brief and inglorious life can be expected as early as next Tuesday after the cabinet meets in Cape Town. The actual disbandment could take place on June 2. "Its disbandment is under consideration. I can't give an indication when an announcement can be expected but it could be soon," Defence Ministry spokesman Maj Charl de Klerk said. He said there was still a number of technical considerations, such as how NPKF members would be accommodated at their forces of origin. NPKF spokesman Col Connie van Rensburg said the NPKF was waiting for an official announcement on its future. Asked whether it would be retained in another form, Col van Rensburg said: "I personally very much doubt it." The NPKF was established in February. It was seldom out of the headlines as reports of ill-discipline and insubordination among the peace-keepers became commonplace. In military and political circles it was called the "national peace-keeping farce". It was intended to keep peace during the election period. But after a disastrous first outing on the East Rand during which award-winning photographer Ken Oosterbroek was killed, the NPKF was withdrawn to barracks. Col van Rensburg said the South African National Defence Force [SANDF] had already said it could accommodate about 1,200 members of Umkhonto We Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC armed wing] who comprise the non-statutory component of the NPKF. The Umkhonto members could be taken in at the SANDF assembly point at Wallmannstal, north of Pretoria. The matter was discussed at a meeting of the Joint Military Command Council [JMCC] in Pretoria on Wednesday morning. The JMCC is overseeing the restructuring and rationalisation of South Africa's statutory and non-statutory forces. Col van Rensburg said the original agreement was that the 2,800 members of statutory forces would be returned to their forces of origin, namely the South African Police, the Transkei Defence Force and the Venda Defence Force. He said legislation providing for the establishment of the NPKF in the form of the Transitional Executive Council act was no longer valid after the inauguration of President Nelson Mandela last week. Technically, the NPKF was now a non- statutory force. Its members at De Brug in the Orange Free State and Koeberg in the Western Cape were sitting around doing nothing. He said training had stopped and the inactivity had potentially demoralising consequences.
