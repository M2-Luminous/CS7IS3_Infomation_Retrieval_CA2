Pointing out that the imperialist reactionary forces are still threatening mankind with nuclear weapons going against the trend of the present times, the article says: The United States continues the test and production of nuclear weapons and is bringing dark clouds of nuclear war, having deployed nuclear weapons and their means of delivery in many parts of the world. Nuclear threat is coming from Japan, too. It is no secret that Japan, the only nuclear victim in the world, is now working with extra zeal to become a nuclear power. Japan which has stockpiled large quantities of plutonium can turn into a nuclear power any moment. The outcries of the Japanese ruling quarters over the DPRK's "nuclear issue" are intended to justify their moves to be a nuclear power. It is a common task of the world people to build a peaceful new world free from nuclear weapons by smashing the nuclear war moves of the imperialist reactionary forces. The world peaceloving people should build a peaceful world without nuclear weapons with a united struggle.
