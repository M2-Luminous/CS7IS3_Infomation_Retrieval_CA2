During his conversation with journalists Yushenkov underlined that "there is an ethical aspect in Fedorov's decision because he has been elected on Russia's Choice federal list and has not informed members of the faction about his decision." Commenting on rumors stating that Gennadiy Burbulis also intends to leave the Russia's Choice faction, Yushenkov indicated that Burbulis faces the same ethical problem because Burbulis was also elected to the State Duma from the list of the Russia's Choice bloc. There will be quite another situation if the Russia's Choice faction itself adopts a decision to be divided into two factions in order to receive an additional vote in the State Duma Council and in order to help the deputies group Union of December 12 receive the necessary number of members (not less than 35) so this association can be registered. Yushenkov reported that a session of the bureau of Russia's Choice faction had discussed this issue but Sergey Kovalyov, Boris Zolotukhin, and several other prominent members of this faction opposed its division into two factions. As a result of this discussion, Yushenkov reported, the faction has increased the number of its members from 76 to 78. However, now its number is 77, as Fedorov has left the faction. Yushenkov underlined that there exists such a point of view which was expressed yesterday that after Yegor Gaydar leaves the government, many members of the faction would deem themselves free of any obligations to Russia's Choice and can adopt a decision to leave this faction. The same day prominent lawyer Andrey Makarov, a member of Russia's Choice, reported to INTERFAX that he had left the faction and joined Union of December 12. Makarov refused to explain his move, stressing that an official message would be made public on Tuesday evening.
