The premier will visit Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan from April 18 to 28, a diplomatic source said. The visit will be the first visit by a top Chinese leader to a country belonging to the Commonwealth of Independent States since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. A visit by President Jiang Zemin to Russia could happen in the fall, the source said. The high-level visits are seen as resulting from China's determination to engage in economic and trade activities with its neighbors, especially in light of recent frictions in Sino-U.S. relations, analysts said. The trip will be the first overseas visit for Li since going to Vietnam in November 1992. Li's trip, which originally included a trip to Mongolia, was first scheduled for April last year, but was canceled after he had a heart attack. Mongolia is presently consulting with China for a visit by Li in June or July, the source said. Trade, especially in oil and oil exploration, will be the main theme of the trip, the diplomat said, with a 90-member Chinese ministerial and business delegation expected to accompany Li. A border agreement with Kazakhstan will also be signed, he said.
