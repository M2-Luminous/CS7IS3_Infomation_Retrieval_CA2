First, involved are materials whose degree of poisonousness--that is, toxicity--in larger concentrations are by no means lower than some well-known chemical weapons. The second reason is strategic and long-term interests that the developed Europe and United States want to realize in these regions. Without denying the long-accepted general definition of war as the continuation of politics with different means, one should still recall the fact that there are means, the use of which is not permitted in war or peace. Involved are, among others, chemical-biological combat means that, due to their known and potential effects, represent a great danger for modern civilization. [passage omitted] Chemical weapons have been used in local wars. They are even used today in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, where, in their attacks on Serbian positions, Izetbegovic's mujahedins are reportedly using ammunition charged with poisons, most probably produced in one of the existing factories of chemical products, pesticides, or detergents. Of course, it is difficult to predict the extent of an ecological catastrophe in the event that cisterns with chloride explode or if chemical plants in Tuzla or factories of mines and explosives in Vitez and Gorazde are deliberately destroyed. Therefore, we cannot be calm over the recent discovery of a large quantity of lethal chemicals in the neighboring Albania. There are ever louder rumors that something similar may have been delivered to some western regions of the former Yugoslav federation in exchange for diplomatic and military aid in the forced secession from the mother country. All this directs one to the justified suspicion that Germany and other developed countries are not instigating the present reorganization of the Balkans from the well-known geostrategic reasons alone but are rather ensuring room for dumping chemical and radioactive waste as far as possible from their own threshold and under someone else's carpet.
