He stressed that Poland has placed Latvia and the other Baltic countries among top priorities of the Polish eastern policy. He disclosed that he and his Latvian counterpart Georgs Andrejevs discussed the possibility of creating a promotion centre for the three Baltic countries in Gdansk in the near future. According to Olechowski, Polish-Latvian trade exchange is insufficient at present, especially that Latvia has already regulated its currency issues and there are no problems in mutual payments. Rear Admiral Romuald Waga, commander-in-chief of the Polish Navy, told reporters that his talks with the defence minister of Latvia focused on Polish technical assistance for Latvian Armed Forces in organizing communications and trainings. He disclosed that the sale of Polish arms to Latvia in exchange for the overhaul of marine engines in Latvian shipyards is also being considered. Reporters learned that Latvia was interested in the purchase of naval guns.
