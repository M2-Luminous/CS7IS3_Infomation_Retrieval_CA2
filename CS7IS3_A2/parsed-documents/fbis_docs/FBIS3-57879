In any case, Bern reacted strongly to the expulsion by France to Tehran of two Iranians wanted by the Swiss justice authorities for the murder in April 1990 -- in Coppet, close to Geneva -- of Kazem Rajavi, brother of the people's Mujahidin leader. Following an oral demarche, the Swiss Government repeated its protest in writing on Friday, 31 December. In a memo sent to the Quai d'Orsay [French Foreign Ministry], he regrets the fact that France respected neither the European Convention on Extradition of 13 December 1957, nor the convention of 27 January 1977 on the repression of terrorism. Bern felt that this was "a flagrant violation of international law." "The French attitude surprised us even more since, until that time, our two countries had always cooperated perfectly in the area of extradition," said the spokesman for the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, Juerg Schneeberger. Thus, Switzerland agreed to hand over to France two Iranians accused of participating in the murder on 6 August 1991, near Paris, of the Shah's former prime minister, Shahpur Bakhtiar. Arrested a short time later in Geneva, the first suspect, Ali Vakili Rad, was extradited on 27 August 1991, while the second suspect, Zeyal Sarhadi, who was apprehended four months later in Bern, was extradited in turn on 26 May 1992. These extraditions caused a diplomatic crisis with Iran, which lead Bern to temporarily close its Embassy in Teheran. "The Incident Is Closed" Bern was expecting a reciprocal gesture in order to get back two of the presumed killers of Kazem Rajavi. The arrest of Mohzen Sharif Esfahani and Ahmed Taheri on 17 November 1992 in Paris was the fruit of a long and patient inquiry undertaken by the Vaud judge, Roland Chatelain, who also handled the Bakhtiar case. Despite the objection by the Iranian authorities in response to the repeated demarches, the judge never relaxed his grip. "What I am interested in," he explained, "is arresting all the killers, because I cannot allow Switzerland to be used with impunity for settling political matters in this way." Since the beginning of the inquiry, judge Chatelain has pointed out that "one or more Iranian departments are directly involved in the murder of Kazem Rajavi." His investigation also allowed him to notice that in cases where Iranian opposition members are murdered, there are "common parameters" and "meticulous preparation." The day after the arrest in Paris of the two Iranians suspected of killing Kazem Rajavi, the Swiss authorities used two arrest warrants issued by the Vaud judge as a basis for submitting a formal request for extradition to France. Last 10 February, the Paris Court of Appeal, approved the request. On 18 November, Switzerland was officially informed that the French government had approved the extradition. On 3 December, during a visit to Switzerland by Francois Mitterrand, the matter was not even raised since it was manifestly clear to the Swiss Government that the extradition of the two Iranians was imminent. So, while everything had been set in place to receive the two suspects, sources in Bern said, on Wednesday [29 December] the Embassy in Paris was informed that they would not be handed over to Switzerland -- before learning the next day that they had already returned to Iran. Caught unaware, Switzerland could only express its disappointment. "This incident does not mean that the excellent relations with France will be called into question," Mr. Schneeberger said nevertheless. "Due to the lack of an authority of recourse from the diplomatic point of view, this affair is considered closed." Perhaps this conclusion suits everyone.
