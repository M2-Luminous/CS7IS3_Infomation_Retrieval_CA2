FBIS4-55099 "dreeu090__a94010" FBIS-EEU-94-090-A Daily Report 9 May 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Coalition Partners React Coalition Partners React AU0905183494 Prague CTK in English 1704 GMT 9 May 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0905183494 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Prague, May 9 (CTK) -- The proposal of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) Executive Council that the government should return to churches certain property which serves their mission and goals, at the same time saying that no further "law of a restitution nature" will be adopted, is basically opposed by none of the remaining three coalition parties. Jaroslav Orel, spokesman for the Christian Democratic Union- Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL), told CTK today that he considered the proposal to be a fundamental and positive change in the ODS's stand on the issue. He said the ODS had approached the principle ``to return all the property which was illegally confiscated and those to whom it is offered should "wisely choose which property they are to claim." [quotation marks as received] The KDU-CSL is interested in ending restitution, which would be a clear signal from the coalition to the whole country that it will always defend the inviolability of private property. The KDU-CSL rules out any financial compensation, which would burden taxpayers, and believes that the rights of the people who obtained their property in good faith should not be put in question while ending restitution. Chairman of the Christian-Democratic Party (KDS) Ivan Pilip told CTK that although the KDS supported the ODS's proposal it believes that "the entire problem could by no means be solved in such a way." He said that only property which belongs to the state could be returned through a government decision and that the economic position of the Church in society could hardly be settled without a law. The Civic Democratic Alliance believes that extraordinary property transfers should be ended as soon as possible, which is a pre-condition for the necessary stabilization of ownership relations and for an agreement on a definitive stop to restitution. Representatives of the coalition parties will deal with restitution issues on Tuesday [10 May].
