The resolution--expressing support for His Eminence Imam Khomeyni's justified stand on the need for the elimination of the Zionist regime from the world map and following the esteemed leader's stand--has emphasized: The solution to the problem of Zionism and uprooting of this cancerous tumor will not be possible except through continuation of the armed conflict. The resolution, in part, says: What is tragic in the wake of this painful development is the fact that global arrogance--led by America and criminal Zionism--has declared the occurrence of this tragedy as solid preparation for continuation of the compromising talks and has expressed the need for speeding up the sell-out plan. In the conclusion of the resolution, the deputies of the Islamic Majles have called upon our country's noble and revolutionary people and all freedom loving people and Muslims of the world to pour out the fire of their revolutionary wrath and anger against the usurping Zionism, through enthusiastic participation in rallies of the international Jerusalem Day, and to repay their debt to the unjustly shed blood of the innocent Palestinians by chanting slogans of death to Israel and death to America.
