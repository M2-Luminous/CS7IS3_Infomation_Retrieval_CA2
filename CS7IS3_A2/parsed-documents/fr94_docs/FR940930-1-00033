FR940930-1-00033 FR940930-1-00013 There is no substantive change in this section other than to accommodate the merger reflected in the proposed §1608.5. The prohibition on candidacy for partisan elective public office is still applicable only to Corporation employees and staff attorneys. Section 1608.7␣Prohibitions Applicable to All Attorneys This proposal incorporates the relevant language from the current definition of ``legal assistance activities'' deleted from §1608.2 into paragraph (a). Further, paragraph (a), together with paragraph (b), makes explicit what is not restricted by the Act, both with respect to individual attorneys and recipients. First, consistent with the provision of the LSC Act that restricts these activities, the proposal makes it clear that recipients' non-LSC resources are not restricted, so long as they are used by attorneys who receive no LSC funding. Second, this section would apply to all attorneys employed by a recipient as well as PAI attorneys who are providing recipient supported legal assistance to the recipient's clients. However, an attorney may do the activities regulated by this section on ``his or her own time.'' For an attorney employed by a recipient, that means any time outside of normal working hours (e.g., evenings, weekends, and leave time) so long as the attorney is not representing or providing legal assistance to the recipient's clients. Thus, an attorney employed by a recipient should not transport a recipient's clients to the polls on a workday, even if it is in the evening outside of normal working hours, if he or she could be presumed to be working for the recipient. But that same attorney could take leave to do so, or could do so if clearly identifying him or herself as a private citizen rather than as a legal services attorney, because the attorney would clearly be doing it on his or her own time. For a PAI attorney, it means any time that the attorney is not actually working on PAI activities. Thus, a PAI attorney could participate in political activities as a regular part of his or her private practice, so long as the activity is not done while providing PAI services supported by the recipient. The restriction would not affect any other paid or pro bono work that the PAI attorney does. Finally, paragraph (b) makes it clear that an attorney is free to contribute his or her own funds, including those derived from a salary from the recipient, to political activities. Paragraph (c) is added to clarify the scope of the statutory restriction regarding voter registration activity. Clearly, Congress intended to prohibit legal services attorneys, while working on program time or using LSC resources, from participating directly in voter registration drives that could easily be tailored to achieve some partisan political purpose. However, the restriction applies only to attorneys and not to recipients specifically. Legal services programs are often requested by public officials to place nonpartisan information regarding voter registration procedures and qualifications in their waiting rooms to encourage voter registration among the clients. While many programs permit the materials in their offices, many others are hesitant to do so. In light of the developments such as the new ``Motor Voter Registration'' law and the fact that the LSC Act does not restrict voter registration activity by recipients, the regulation should state clearly that engaging in nonpartisan activities, such as making available nonpartisan voter registration information, is permissible. Section 1608.8␣Enforcement This section is proposed to be deleted. The current language refers to the enforcement provisions in §1612.5. However, the enforcement provisions of Part 1612 were removed from §1612.5 and are currently found in §1612.12. Regardless, the Committee believes that the enforcement procedures dealing with other matters are not appropriate for this part and has decided to deal with compliance issues outside the context of this rule.

Nothing in this part is intended to prohibit an attorney from providing any form of legal assistance to an eligible client, or to interfere with the fulfillment of any attorney's professional responsibilities to a client.
