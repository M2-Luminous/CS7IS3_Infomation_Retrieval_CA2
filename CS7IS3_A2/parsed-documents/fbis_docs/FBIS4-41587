Earlier on May 28 Armenian troops attacked the village of Gunnet in the Sadarak Region and moved 1 kilometre further into Nakhichevani territory. Armenians seized several strategically important hills and shelled the region centre of Sadarak. As a result five Azeri soldiers have been wounded and several housings have been damaged. However, after that attack the representatives of Armenia and Nakhichevan reached the agreement banning escalation of tension on the border. Resumption of aggressive activities shows that Armenia's authorities ignore the efforts by the international organizations aimed at restoration peace in the region. The press service of Supreme Mejlis of Nakhichevan calls on the world community to exert pressure in the Republic of Armenia to stop its aggression against Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic.
