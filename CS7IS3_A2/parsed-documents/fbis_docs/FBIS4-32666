Martino arrived in Belgrade earlier in the day for a brief working visit. After the meeting, Buha told a press conference that he had conveyed to Martino the Bosnian Serb stand that it was necessary to accept that Bosnia's three sovereign peoples were entitled to freely decide about their future. It was made clear to Martino that the international community had to admit at last that an independent Bosnia-Herzegovina is no more than a fiction, Buha said. The Serb side said to the Italian delegation that the international community had got entangled in a net from which it can hardly free itself without new ideas, said Buha. The Italian delegation's insisting on getting first-hand information on the Bosnian Serb views of the solution to the Bosnian conflict is interpreted by Bosnian Serb officials as showing Rome's obvious intention to play a more active role in the Bosnian peace process. Assessing the results of his talks with Martino and his aides, Buha said that the first impression was that they were people prepared to work without prejudice. Bosnian Serb Vice-President Biljana Plavsic, who also attended the talks, said after the meeting that the talks with the Italian foreign minister had come at the right time. She apparently had in mind some important forthcoming meetings, including the summit of the Group of Seven most industrialized nations and Russia on July 8 to 10. There are indications that the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina will be decided at this meeting.
