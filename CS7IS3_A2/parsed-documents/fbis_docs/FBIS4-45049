We can no longer avoid a discussion of this question. The facts established on the ground by the PLO require a prompt reaction, including deeds, so as not to leave an opening for clarifications two or three years hence that might jeopardize the integrity of the City of David that has been reunited. Israeli policymakers must know and understand that what is not accomplished today they will not be able to accomplish at the time of the discussions on the final agreements between Israel and the Palestinians. It is no longer possible to sweep under the carpet the basic disagreements that separate Israel and the Palestinians. In fact, Yasir 'Arafat repeated his clarification that he is leading the way to the liberation of Jerusalem from the hands of the "Zionist conquerors." He also appointed a special minister for Jerusalem affairs. Recently Faysal Husayni declared that "we will open additional political institutions in Jerusalem." The PLO is not satisfied with "Orient House," which has become the focus of international political activity. This organization is seeking to set up further centers in the city in order to demonstrate, by so doing, PLO sovereignty, without considering Israeli warnings nor the unequivocal declarations that all of Jerusalem is the capital of Israel for eternity. Under these circumstances it is "time to do" in order to foil the PLO plots aimed at redividing the City of David and setting up the capital of a PLO state in it. This is the time to declare to the PLO leaders that under these circumstances Israel will be forced to void the agreement she gave upon the signing of the Oslo accord, that it is the legislative and administrative body of the Autonomy, or more correctly of the sovereign Palestinian entity in Judea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip. From the beginning it was a mistake to agree that the Palestinian residents of Jerusalem would be permitted to vote and be elected to the entity that engraved on its flag the redividing of the city. Furthermore, the government also did not stand by its initial obligation that the residents of East Jerusalem would not be permitted to be elected to the Palestinian authority. They would only be permitted to participate in the elections via ballot boxes that would be placed outside Jerusalem, such as in Ramallah, Bethlehem, etc. Thus the first concession led to further concessions. It caused complications that are some day likely to seriously affect full and complete Israeli sovereignty over the city of the kingdom and the Temple, toward which the eyes of all Israel are raised in prayer and belief that it is ours for eternity. But we will not dwell on mistakes connected with the past; we will turn our attention to the facts on the ground that should alarm us to dangers lying in ambush at the entrance to the eternal capital of the people of Israel and the State of Israel. Indeed, there exists a broad national consensus among the people of Israel and in the diaspora on everything connected to the integrity of Jerusalem. However a consensus alone is not enough. If it is not accompanied by deeds, it has no value. When the time comes, it also will not save us in the great struggle for Jerusalem. Nowadays, when Israel still rules in Judea and Samaria and the Palestinian entity is restricted to Gaza and Jericho, we have the strength in our hands to determine on the political battlefield everything connected with the integrity of Israel. That will not be the case when the sovereign Palestinian entity expands to the gates of Jerusalem and its environs. Then we may no longer have the upper hand. It is thus better that things be clarified already now, before we approach implementation of the second phase of the "Oslo Agreement", by which all the "conquered territories" will be transferred to Yasir Arafat's command. Lately, we have gotten better at recognizing the head of the PLO and his intentions with the entry of the "Palestinian police" into Gaza and Jericho. The leaders of the Palestinian police declared upon entering those cities that they were headed for Jerusalem in order to establish the capital of Palestine there. Because words are not enough for them, there is no choice but to stop them while they are still at the start of their journey. In this connection it is important to pay attention to the words uttered this week by Teddy Kollek, the former mayor of Jerusalem, on the program "Popolitiqa" on Channel 1 of Israeli television. He said unequivocally that "Orient House" must be shut down because this house has turned into a focus of anti-Israeli political activity leading to a redividing of the city. If Teddy Kollek has come to that conclusion, despite the fact that he is not considered a part of the "radical right," nor one of the faithful of the "whole Land of Israel," it is the duty of the prime minister and the members of his government to pay close heed to these words. The government also must not be permitted to turn a blind eye to the PLO flags flying over East Jerusalem, nor to the offices that this organization is hurriedly erecting while ignoring Israeli authority and law. Yasir 'Arafat responds by waving the letter in his hand containing the Israeli obligation to discuss the future of the city, but there is nothing in it to prevent the Government of Israel from removing the PLO and its political institutions from East Jerusalem. Israel is the owner of the entire city, including all its subdivisions without exception, even those populated by Palestinians. There is no other sovereign beside her. And a sovereign must behave as required in order to prevent the establishment of facts on the ground that contradict laws existing since the unification of Jerusalem. Israel must demonstrate her sovereignty over all subdivisions of the city. We must also stop giving "good advice" to "tour guides" to fold up the Israeli flag when they arrange excursions for tourists and others in the eastern part of the city. Whosoever folds up the national flag of the State of Israel in East Jerusalem only encourages those who have evil designs against her to fly the Palestinian flag on the main road of the City of David. Moreover Israeli authorities are, for some reason, ignoring the close connections between the Palestinians in East Jerusalem and the sovereign Palestinian entity in Jericho. Those ties augur no good for united Jerusalem. Thus they must be stopped as quickly as possible. The battle for the integrity of Jerusalem is but an inseparable part of the large battle being waged meanwhile behind the curtains around the question: Will an independent Palestinian state arise between the Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea alongside the State of Israel? The campaign is not easy, especially after the Rabin government signed the agreements with the PLO that contain no clear and unequivocal answer to the question: Where is the State of Israel headed? The government preferred, for some reason, not to discuss now the tough issues, as they are termed by those involved in the talks with the PLO, since discussing them would likely destroy the agreement. It is hard to understand what Rabin's brain trust gained by avoiding the tough issues. They certainly brought no profit to the people of Israel. Wittingly or unwittingly Israel has played into 'Arafat's hands and enabled him and his entourage to strike a stake for an independent Palestinian state in large parts of the Land of Israel. The are exploiting the agreement to get set up in the field, to establish as many facts as possible, each of which is consistent with the clear Palestinian intention to establish a sovereign country within the next two to three years under Arafat's presidency. As is his wont, 'Arafat is repeating the things he said secretly in Johannesburg and is now declaring openly that he is following in the footsteps of the founder of Islam, Muhammad, who, in his day, voided an explicit agreement that he had signed with members of the tribe of Quraish. In other words, the PLO does not see itself obligated by its agreement with Israel, and when the time is ripe, it will announce its nullification. And we will be left holding that same piece of paper. Yet there are those among us who congratulate themselves that there has been a breakthrough on the road to peace... There has been no breakthrough on the road to peace. There has been a breach in the wall protecting unified Jerusalem. If we do not go up on those walls to strengthen them in order to prevent the enemy from redividing the eternal city that the people of Israel have clung to for thousands of years, then Jerusalem is likely to become a "sacrifice" on the "altar of peace" that the Rabin government set up by signing the agreement with Yasir 'Arafat. It is not enough to declare that the Palestinians can forget Jerusalem. In order for them to forget Jerusalem, we must remember well the oath of the generations of David, king of Israel: "If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, may my right hand be forgotten." Whoever does not remove Jerusalem from his heart, cannot, must not be permitted to go on with his daily agenda while ignoring what is happening in the eastern part of the city. He cannot ignore the increasing political activity in "Orient House," which continues to function with no interference. Certainly he cannot reconcile himself to the establishment of further facts on the ground, as expressed by the opening of PLO political institutions on the outskirts of the city that is entwined with the lifeblood of Israel from days of yore, since King David purchased it from the Jebusite. But the Rabin government is conducting a policy of amnesia. On the one hand it remembers Jerusalem and swears loyalty to her. On the other hand it forgets what it must do to preserve the integrity of the City of David. It declares day after day that Jerusalem will not be divided. At the same time Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres passes along a letter to the head of the PLO in which he promises that "there is something to talk about" even on the issue of Jerusalem. Not just that but he even attached a copy of his Knesset speech in which he referred to Jerusalem in order to placate the PLO. In light of all the above, there is a growing fear that the Rabin government is not at all excluding the possibility of concessions, even in everything having to do with the integrity of Jerusalem. What Rabin does not say aloud, his "poodle" Peres says in public. According to him, a functional compromise can be reached on a political rather than physical division of Jerusalem. A wall will not be built, but the city will be divided between Jews and Palestinians. But, despite the efforts of the government to avoid actions to prevent the establishment of PLO facts in Jerusalem, it cannot hide what is happening there from the eyes of the public. The people of Israel remain faithful to the oath of generations not just not to forget Jerusalem but, in the end, to raise its voice to force the government to act immediately for the peace and integrity of Jerusalem. If we remember Jerusalem and concern ourselves with her integrity, only then is there a prospect that the Palestinians will be forced to forget Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine. Seek the peace of Jerusalem.
