FR941025-0-00003 FR941025-0-00001 In a volume filled container, fairly uniform size kiwifruit are loosely packed without cell compartments, cardboard fillers or molded trays. Handlers may ship volume filled containers marked by either the appropriate count or net weight of kiwifruit. Handler shipments are based upon the preference of the receiver. Volume filled containers marked by count will not be affected by this change. Also, containers of less than 10-pounds or more than 35-pounds net weight will not be affected by this revised weight standard. Thus the industry will continue to have the flexibility to utilize containers of different weights for a variety of buyer preferences. Last season the industry standardized the weight of all volume filled containers of kiwifruit designated by weight at 23-pounds net weight of kiwifruit unless such containers hold less than 10-pounds or more than 35-pounds net weight of kiwifruit. The industry has since learned that the recognized world standard for volume filled containers of kiwifruit is 10-kilograms (10-kg) net weight which is equal to approximately 22 pounds. The industry has also become aware that neither foreign nor domestic buyers wish to pay more for a 23-pound box than for a 22-pound (10-kg) box. As a result, California marketers selling 23-pound containers have been disadvantaged in both export and domestic markets compared to marketers from other countries selling 22-pound (10-kg) containers of fruit. The change to a standard container weight of 22-pounds net weight will enable the industry to mark volume filled containers both in terms of a unit of measure in pounds and with a metric weight. Standardizing the weight of volume filled containers marked by weights recognized in the world market will standardize marketing practices for the kiwifruit industry. The committee considered immediately standardizing the minimum weight for volume filled containers at only 22 pounds (10 kg) rather than at 22 pounds or 23 pounds. However, all committee members were in favor of allowing handlers to continue to also pack or ship to the 23-pound standard for the 1994/95 season to enable handlers to utilize existing inventories of boxes and labels. Thus the requirement to ship only 22-pound net weight containers will be effective for the 1995&hyph;96 and subsequent seasons. This final rule will impact all handlers in the same manner. The same size container currently used for the 23-pound standard can be used for the 22-pound (10-kg) standard. It is anticipated that only a small number of packages will be shipped in 23-pound containers during the 1994/95 season. This is because handlers shipping 23-pound containers have already expressed the concern that they do not receive a price premium for the extra pound of fruit in each container. This concern will be remedied by deleting the preprinted marking of 23 pounds, relabeling the container to read 22 pounds, and filling the container with 22 pounds of fruit. This change will impose some minimal costs on those handlers who choose to print new labels or convert 23-pound volume filled containers into other types of containers. However, the overall benefits to the California kiwifruit industry by standardizing volume filled containers at 22 pounds (10 kg), with the option of using existing labels and boxes for the 1994/95 season, will more than offset the costs imposed on handlers. Reporting Requirements Paragraphs (a) and (b) of ยง920.60 authorize reporting requirements for kiwifruit handlers under the marketing order. Pursuant to ยง920.160, the marketing order requires a Beginning Inventory Data form to be filed with the committee by each handler no later than five days after all fruit has been packed for the season, or such other later time as the committee may establish. This information includes beginning inventory by container type and by fruit size. In 1990, the California Kiwifruit Commission, hereinafter referred to as the ``State commission,'' adopted the Kiwifruit Inventory Shipment System (KISS) form. The KISS form is comprised of three sections: (1) The ``KISS/Add Inventory'' requires all handlers to report their beginning inventories by size and container type. Inventory includes all fruit packed at harvest; (2) The ``KISS/Deduct Inventory'' requires all handlers to report fruit lost in repack, fruit repacked into another container type, and adjustments to decrease posted inventory; and (3) The ``KISS/Shipments'' requires all handlers to report shipments by size and container type. All three sections of the KISS form will be filed with the committee, on or before December 5th, or such other later time as the committee may establish. Subsequent KISS forms, including all three sections, will be filed with the committee by the fifth day and again by the twentieth day of each calendar month, or such other later time as the committee may establish. The adoption of the KISS form by the State commission resulted in redundant reporting requirements in the kiwifruit industry. The KISS form collects the same information as the Beginning Inventory Data form. This information is used to verify the total amount of fruit available for shipping, to calculate statistics, and to determine if assessments billed match reported shipments. In an effort to eliminate the redundant reporting requirements, the committee recommended that the Beginning Inventory Data form reporting requirement be deleted from paragraph (b) of ยง920.160 and the KISS form reporting requirements be added. This rule is intended to enable kiwifruit handlers to efficiently file one form to meet the requirements of both the State commission and the Federal marketing order. Deleting the requirement for the Beginning Inventory Data form in paragraph (b) of ยง920.160 and utilizing the KISS form will eliminate the submission of duplicate information.
