Those who participated in the summit were: His Excellency El Hadj Omar Bongo, president of the Gabonese Republic; His Excellency Professor Pascal Lissouba, president of the Republic of Congo; His Excellency Ange Felix Patasse, president of the Central African Republic; His Excellency Anatolio Ndong Mba, deputy prime minister, representing the president of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea; and His Excellency (Luc Ayan), president of the Economic and Social Council, representing the president of the Republic of Cameroon. Following their informal Libreville summit relating to the setting up of an economic and monetary community of Central Africa, with a view to giving a new impetus to the subregional integration process, the UDEAC Council of Heads of State has decided to officially launch CEMAC by signing today the treaty instituting this organization. The main mission of this organization is to promote the harmonious development of member states, within the framework of the establishment of two unions, namely the Economic Union of Central Africa, in abbreviation UEAC, and the Monetary Union of Central Africa, UMAC. In each of the two fields, member states intend to promote the already existing cooperation between them to the status of a union to achieve the process for economic and monetary integration. Concerning agreements on UEAC and UMAC, the heads of state decided to set up a committee of plenipotentiaries composed of the ministers in charge of economic development problems, finance, external relations, justice, the UDEAC secretary general, and the governor of the Central Bank of Central African States [BEAC], both of whom will be rapporteurs to the committee of plenipotentiaries. This committee is assisted by a group of experts to be named by it. It can call on, at any time, any external person, in view of the competence of that person. While awaiting the establishment of these new bodies, the heads of state decided to settle all or part of arrears owed the UDEAC general secretariat. They called on the staff to resume work immediately. The heads of state exchanged views on the economic situation of the subregion since the devaluation of the CFA franc and reaffirmed their desire to make coherent their economic policies. For this purpose, they reviewed a number of projects on integration, in the areas of land, river, and air transport, and with the aim of easing the landlocked conditions of some member states. They also reviewed projects in the areas of electric power, fishery, and animal breeding, strengthening trade exchange between UDEAC member states, in particular, the assessment and management of human resources, the handling of science and technology in order to introduce innovation as a dynamic factor of development, as well as the fight against desertification. To this end, they authorized the secretary general and BEAC governor to expand studies as soon as possible. The heads of state have decided to summon a top-level meeting of the CEMAC after all member countries must have concluded their programs with the IMF. This meeting, to be attended by all financial backers, will assess the compensation measures following the devaluation and ways of revamping the economies of the subregion. [passage omitted] The term of office of the UDEAC deputy secretary general having come to its end, the president of the Gabonese Republic will propose another candidate for this post. The Council of Heads of State congratulated Mr. Ambroise Ndoyi Bongo for the work done during nine years in the service of the Union and wishes him courage in his future duties. [passage omitted] The heads of state made it a point to thank warmly their peer, President Idriss Deby, the Government of Chad, the Chadian people in general, and the people of Ndjamena in particular, for the brotherly welcome and the African hospitality given them and their delegations during their stay. For 1994, the chairmanship of the UDEAC Council of States 1994 will be assumed by His Excellency Paul Biya, president of the Republic of Cameroon. The next regular meeting of the Council of Heads of State will be held in Yaounde in December 1994. Issued in Ndjamena on 16 March 1994. Thank you. [end recording]
