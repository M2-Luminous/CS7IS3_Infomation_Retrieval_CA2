"Their threats to form special units for the Crimea are real", the aide told TASS on Tuesday. According to Baksheyev, neither Ukrainians nor residents of the Crimean Republic are interested in aggravating tensions around the peninsula. People who benefit from these tensions are not numerous but they "stir up trouble immensely", he added. "Kiev has nothing to wory about", he went on saying. "The Crimea does not look for separation, it just wants to build relations with Ukraine on a treaty basis". On the contrary, the situation will be destabilized if President Kravchuk imposes his direct rule on Crimea, Baksheyev stressed.
