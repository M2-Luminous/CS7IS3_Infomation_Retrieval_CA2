Some personages within Britain's industrial, commercial, and political circles have even publicly demanded that the "Hong Kong governor be replaced" and maintain that only by doing so will Britain's and Hong Kong's long-term interests be safeguarded. On 7 February, given deteriorating Anglo-Chinese relations, the "Anglo-Chinese Trade Group 48" announced its decision to cancel a scheduled visit to China by a heavyweight British trade delegation led by British Trade and Industry Secretary Michael Heseltine this coming fall in a bid to avoid embarrassment. It was reported that the "Anglo-Chinese Trade Group 48" had originally decided to send a total of 24 economic and trade delegations to China this year with the aforementioned high-level delegation comprising the chief executives of some 100 major British firms being the most important. The delegation was originally scheduled to visit China in late September of this year to promote the sale of UK-made technology and equipment to China and was scheduled to visit Beijing, Shanghai, the Three Gorges of the Chang Jiang, Tianjin, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen, as well as some other places in China. As Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten has submitted the first part and plans to submit the second and last part of his political reform package to the Legislative Council in early March [as received] and have them ratified for official enforcement this coming July, the Chinese side is expected to react strongly to the governor's decision. Thus, it would be inappropriate for British business leaders to visit China under such an "atmosphere." Not long before, Bailiren [4101 4409 0088], president of the "Anglo-Chinese Trade Group 48," had publicly accused John Major's government of ignoring the views and jeopardizing the interests of the UK business community, saying that the way in which the government had handled the Hong Kong question had undermined Anglo- Chinese trade relations, that the government had failed to see the adverse effects of Chris Patten's political reform package, and that it is not worthwhile for the government to risk everything on Chris Patten's political reform package. He also made it clear that the UK business community would not give its support to Chris Patten, stating: "We want to see him removed from office; the sooner, the better." In the meantime, many of Britain's industrial associations and chambers of commerce have also started demanding that John Major's government take measures to remove the obstacles hampering Anglo- Chinese relations and to explore ways to enter the China market. At an annual meeting of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce held on 28 January, 1994, Mr. Carter, chairman of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, told British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, one of his distinguished guests at the occasion, that diplomats should make redoubled efforts to promote foreign trade and support businessmen in expanding exports to China. As the British Government's position on the question of Hong Kong has already undermined Anglo-Chinese relations, he added, some of the Anglo-Chinese economic cooperation projects previously agreed upon by the two sides were now in danger of being frozen or scrapped. Moreover, he said, the UK business community will inevitably lose business opportunities in China. Mr. Carter stressed that China is now the biggest market in the world. [sentence as received] It would be terribly wrong for Britain to shoot itself in the foot and undercut its own competitiveness at this moment. Therefore, he noted, the British Government should reexamine its policies. At a large exhibition, entitled "Hong Kong's Achievements," which was held two months ago, John Major was asked by more than 300 influential businessmen from all over the world how he would, in his capacity as prime minister, try to protect the interests of the British business community in Hong Kong and China, as well as in Asia as a whole. What merits attention is that China has repeatedly expressed welcome to British businessmen and has invited them to invest in and discuss trade. In fact, the total volume of Sino-British trade reached $3.59 billion in 1993, up 86 percent over the previous year, only slightly lower than the increases registered in Sino-German trade and in the volume of trade between China and some West European countries. Nonetheless, since Britain has adopted an unfriendly and noncooperative attitude toward China on the question of Hong Kong, Sino-British economic and trade relations are bound to be adversely affected in the long run. Beijing officials have already stated that the Chinese side is unwilling to see this and should not be held responsible for such a scenario. UK officials and the business community concede that China has thus far shown no signs of discriminating against the UK business community. However, any country or region will try to select firms from a friendly country as its business partners so long as it can offer prices which are not higher and possesses technology which is not inferior to those offered by firms from other countries in the bidding process. Some UK newspapers, including "THE OBSERVER," "THE DAILY TELEGRAPH," and "THE SUN," have published commentaries, saying that Britain has underestimated the indignation of China's local governments on the question of Hong Kong, and the majority of China's imports, worth about $700 billion in all, will be purchased by local governments over the next seven years. Should Britain try to encroach upon Chinese sovereignty and violate agreements reached with China in the past on the question of Hong Kong, they asked, how could Britain expect the Chinese to be friendly to it? They argued that as Germany has entered the China market and France has stopped arms sales to Taiwan in an attempt to restore friendly relations with China and increase exports to China, there is no reason for Britain not to do the same.
