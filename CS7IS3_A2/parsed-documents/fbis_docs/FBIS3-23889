While attempting to organize resistance to the representative of power, Geliskhanov related, five of Suleymenov's guards were disarmed along with him. And on that same day, all six of them were taken to the Groznyy investigative detention facility, where Suleymenov, representing the republic procurator general, Sheripova, was accused of "leading an illegal armed grouping on the territory of Chechnya." A couple of days before his arrest, as we know from the press service representative under the Military Council of Field Commanders of the Chechen Republic, Zambek Aliyev, Ibragim Suleymenov had advanced a number of demands for the current republic leaders, among which the first and most categorical was for the retirement of President Dudayev and the application against him of proceedings of the shariat or civil (the accused's choice) court. Another condition of the former Chechen parliamentarian was the return and distribution among the republic's population of the monetary funds (about a billion dollars) kept in foreign bank accounts and belonging, the accused thinks, to the people of Chechnya. Suleymenov is known to the authorities also from the events of 16 December in Groznyy, when he, along with other field commanders of the opposition armed forces, appeared in front of the presidential palace and delivered an ultimatum, the edited version of which differed considerably from the February demands. During those days, official Groznyy gave the appearance that it fully understood the patriotic feelings of the "youth" (with whom the 45-year-old Suleymenov was included) who were disturbed by the state of affairs in the republic. To a question from a NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent to the chief of the Department of the Press and Information of the Chechen Republic, Movladi Udugov, as to why the accusation of "leadership of illegal armed formations" was leveled against only one of the so-called "field commanders" who were freely handling the armed group (according to unofficial information, there are more than a hundred of these "private" militarized formations in the republic), the answer was that other such, for example, as Shamil Basayev or Ruslan Gelayev, who fought at the Abkhazian front in a special regiment under the president of Chechnya and were "discovered" on 16 December in Suleymenov's company, have quite legitimate grounds for being called commanders, since they serve in the presidential regiment, which today the authorities have put to work guarding facilities of the petroleum industry complex. A highly placed bureaucrat categorically denied the information from the opposition press service regarding the training maneuvers of the armed opposition begun in N rayon in Chechnya on 4 February. It is Udugov's conviction that maneuvers as such cannot take place, since the republic army and Ministry of Internal Affairs are monitoring the situation, and participation of combat helicopters in maneuvers, as the press service under the Military Council of Field Commanders reported, could not go unnoticed. At the same time, the Security Service of Chechnya has almost no doubt that arms are being delivered to Suleymenov and "his ilk" from the arsenals of Russia. The chief of the Department of Press and Information of the Chechen Republic, who is unfamiliar with the political situation of the arrested commander, also denied the opposition's reproaches for the organization by official Groznyy of a "slanderous campaign" against Suleymenov which took place in republic mass media. Suleymenov, the opposing side related in return, has nothing to do with drug trafficking, which President Dudayev's supporters are trying to pin on him, and he certainly is not known for pro-Russian or pro-communist sympathies. The opposition, having lost in Suleymenov one of the significant opponents to Dudayev's regime, made a statement from which it can be clearly seen that "twists" of the future fate of the president of Chechnya will be determined by the measure of his prudence. Moreover, on 10 February there began a census of the population in the republic, whose purpose was to clarify "how many Chechens live on earth" (Udugov). To do this, he said, emissaries from Groznyy traveled to all continents of the globe. But in the republic, M. Udugov noted, the census involves not only Chechens but also citizens of other nationalities. According to the observation of specialists of Chechnya, the number of these people decreases by a factor of 1.5 to two with each succeeding census, and the current authorities of Chechnya intend to put an end to this vicious tendency. To this end, Udugov explained, 23 February--the day of the 50th anniversary of the deportation of the Chechen people--will be declared not a day of mourning but a nationwide celebration of rebirth. The 23d will coincide with the opening in Groznyy of a memorial complex composed of the tombstones defiled during the years of Soviet power in Chechnya. On that same day there will be a demonstration of the new military uniform of the Chechen Army, and the possibility of a festive military parade cannot be ruled out. The unification of the Chechens and other peoples of the Northern Caucasus was the subject of a conference in Istanbul (Turkey) in which representatives of Chechnya participated as well. Participants in the meeting, who were protected by the Turkish authorities (among those present were the chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Dagestan, the vice president of Kalmykia, the heads of the Cherkess and Chechen community, and according to certain information, a representative from Georgia also visited Turkey as an observer) opened in Istanbul a "Caucasian Mission" whose elected president is a citizen of the Chechen Republic, the businessman Akhmet Khildekharoyev, who is the official representative of Chechnya in Turkey. The purpose of the meeting, in Udugov's words, was to strengthen the ties of the Caucasian peoples of Russia and the republics of Transcaucasia with Turkey.
