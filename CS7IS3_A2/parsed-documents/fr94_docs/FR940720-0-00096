In §80.93, the first sentence of paragraph (a)(3)(ii) is revised, and paragraph (a)(3)(iv) is added, and paragraph (c)(9) is revised as follows: §80.93 Individual baseline submission and approval. (a) *␣*␣* (3) *␣*␣* (ii) Petitions, `showings,' and other associated proof may be submitted to EPA prior to submittal of the individual baseline (per paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section). *␣*␣* * * * * * (iv) Petitions submitted prior to the deadline for baseline submittals shall be submitted to the EPA at the following address: Fuels Studies and Standards Branch, Baseline Petition, U.S. EPA, 2565 Plymouth Road, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48105. * * * * * (c) *␣*␣* (9) Other baseline information. Narrative discussing any aspects of the baseline determination not already indicated per the requirements of paragraph (c)(8) of this section shall be provided. * * * * * 22. Section 80.101 is amended by revising paragraphs (e)(3), (f)(4)(i), (f)(4)(ii), (g)(1), and (i)(1) introductory text to read as follows: §80.101 Standards applicable to refiners and importers. * * * * * (e) *␣*␣* (3) California gasoline as defined in §80.81(a)(2); and * * * * * (f) *␣*␣* (4) *␣*␣* (i) If the total volume of the conventional gasoline, RBOB, reformulated gasoline, and California gasoline as defined in §80.81(a)(2), produced or imported by any refiner or importer during the averaging period is equal to or less than that refiner's or importer's 1990 baseline volume as determined under §80.91(f)(1), the compliance baseline for each parameter or emissions performance shall be that refiner's or importer's individual 1990 baseline; or (ii) If the total volume of the conventional gasoline, RBOB, reformulated gasoline, and California gasoline as defined in §80.81(a)(2), produced or imported by any refiner or importer during the averaging period is greater than that refiner's or importer's 1990 baseline volume as determined under §80.91(f)(1), the compliance baseline for each parameter or emissions performance shall be calculated according to the following formula: E:GRAPHICSER20JY94.003 where CB i =the compliance baseline value for parameter or emissions performance i B i =the refiner's or importer's individual baseline value for parameter or emissions performance i calculated according to the methodology in §80.91 DB i =the anti-dumping statutory baseline value for parameter or emissions performance i, as specified at §80.91(c)(5)(iii) or (c)(5)(iv), respectively V 1990 =the 1990 baseline volume as determined under §80.91(f)(1) V a =the total volume of reformulated gasoline, conventional gasoline, RBOB, and California gasoline as defined in §80.81(a)(2) produced or imported by a refiner or importer during the averaging period (g) *␣*␣* (1) (i) Simple model calculations. In the case of any refiner or importer subject to an individual refinery baseline, the annual average value for each parameter or emissions performance during the averaging period, calculated according to the following methodologies, shall be less than or equal to the refiner's or importer's standard under paragraph (b) of this section for that parameter. (A) The average value for sulfur, T&hyph;90, olefin, benzene, and aromatics for an averaging period shall be calculated as follows: E:GRAPHICSER20JY94.004 where APARM=the average value for the parameter being evaluated Vi =the volume of conventional gasoline or other products included under paragraph (d) of this section, in batch i PARM i =the value of the parameter being evaluated for batch i as determined in accordance with the test methods specified in §80.46 n=the number of batches of conventional gasoline and other products included under paragraph (d) of this section produced or imported during the averaging period SG i =specific gravity of batch i (only applicable for sulfur)
