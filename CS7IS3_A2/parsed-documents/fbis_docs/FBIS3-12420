Joining in the statement were Labor, the Likud, Meretz, SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim], the National Religious Party, Tzomet, YI'UD [Independent and Democratic Israel], Moledet, and United Torah Jewry. The HADASH [Democratic Front for Peace and Equality] and the Arab Democratic Party submitted a different draft proposal which was rejected by a vast majority. [passage omitted] Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that several of the Meretz faction members did not participate in the vote while other Meretz members abstained due to their opposition to the clause in the announcement which takes exception to any generalizations or sweeping blame against certain sectors, including the settlers.
