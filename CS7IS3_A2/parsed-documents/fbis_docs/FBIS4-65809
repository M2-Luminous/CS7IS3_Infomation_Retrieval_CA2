The nonproliferation of nuclear mass destruction weapons, which Washington has put at the center of its foreign policy, is increasingly ill-fated. The failed attempt to make North Korea rejoin the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty] and to include India and Pakistan in a regional conference emphasizes the lack of concept that the current disarmament policy suffers from. This was expressed by India's Prime Minister Rao, among others, during his visit to Washington, when he criticized that moral leadership is claimed by those who demand from others what they themselves are not prepared to do. Although the U.S. Administration is calling on the nuclear have-nots to join a discriminating nonproliferation regime, it is by no means planning to scrap the U.S. nuclear weapons altogether. The Geneva UN Disarmament Conference may be seeing preliminary talks on the renunciation of the use of nuclear weapons against nonnuclear states; however, talks on extending the nuclear deterrent in the sense of Klaus Kinkel's nonproliferation policy failed because the nuclear states rejected an expansion of multilateral defense obligations. Bilateral talks are no longer about arms testing but "only" about deploying operative arms systems. Clinton's advisers know very well that a nuclear condominium in South Asia and the Far East makes nonproliferation more difficult. However, sobered by the experience in Bosnia, Somalia, and Haiti, the Pentagon is preparing a counter proliferation initiative -- although modestly funded at a mere $450 million -- in case the non-proliferation talks fail. Just as Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative was to protect the United States from a strategic first blow, Clinton's program of Counter Proliferation is taking a unilateral course of its own. According to a few critical voices in the U.S. Congress, this could lead to an unpredictable nuclear race, as a result of which the world would face more than the 15 states that are known as possessing nuclear weapons today. The annual meeting of the UN Disarmament Commission in New York was aiming at a clear signal toward an unconditional and unlimited extension of the NPT in April 1995. But instead, reaching a consensus was prevented because there was no clear definition of the objectives of disarmament. This gives rise to the question whether the current nonproliferation regime is fit to survive. Although the nuclear states basically share the view of nonnuclear states that nonproliferation is inseparably linked with nuclear disarmament, the codifying of an international agreement to eliminate nuclear weapons arsenals, which has been demanded by several states, and the direct coupling to nonproliferation of nuclear weapons still fail to take place.
