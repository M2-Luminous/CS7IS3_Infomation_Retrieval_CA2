The article says: The soldiers of the great general Kim Chong-il are steadfast revolutionary fighters safeguarding the party and the leader with their lives and pure revolutionaries who think and act in accordance with the ideas and intentions of the party and the leader. They are also indomitable fighters who consistently share life and death, sweets and bitters with the party and the leader in any circumstances. Referring to the noblest ideological and moral traits of general Kim Chong-il's soldiers, the article says: Characteristic of the ideological and moral traits of our revolutionary soldiers is, above all, that they have the unshakable revolutionary conviction and will to believe in and follow only the great general Kim Chong-il. Their belief in the great general Kim Chong-il is the part and parcel of our revolutionary soldiers' ideological and moral traits. Ours is the inexorable belief that as long as we are guided by general Kim Chong-il we are sure to win. Ours is the unshakable determination to fight on, entirely entrusting our whole destinies to the party and the leader. Ours is the revolutionary principle which will never change in any adversity. This conviction is the most solid and noblest ideological sentiments which we have consolidated on the basis of our deep understanding of the greatness of general Kim Chong-il through our life experience. Another characteristic of the ideological and moral traits of our revolutionary soldiers is that they cherish revolutionary fidelity to the great general Kim Chong-il. The soldiers of the great general Kim Chong-il have a warmer sense of obligations than others to repay the benevolence of the party and the leader. Their fidelity is a sincere and pure one emanating from the minds of the soldiers who always deeply cherish the love and benevolence of the illustrious leader. It is a noble spirit of devoting their all to repay even a little the benevolence of the party. Characteristic of the ideological and moral traits of our revolutionary soldiers is also that they have a revolutionary view of life that they can lead a worthy life only when they fight under the guidance of the great general Kim Chong-il. Our view of life is the steadfast revolutionary creed that they should feel honored to live or die on the road of revolution following the illustrious leader, and the life-giving water exalting human dignity and life forever. Living in luxury or riches cannot be a happiness for them and a life, however long it may be, cannot be called an eternal life. Their happiness and eternal life lie in living a worthy life under the loving care of the party even if they lived a day. Now, our country has a great army of loyal revolutionary soldiers who share views and the same destiny with the great general Kim Chong-il. The entire Korean people are all revolutionary soldiers of general Kim Chong-il.
