Mr. Hong said that the 3,000-kilometre-long coastline in Fujian was ridden with smuggling activities, with the smuggled items switched from the traditional ones of cigarettes, alcohol and native products to drugs, pornographic articles, electric appliances and cars. All such smuggling was conducted in a much more concealed way and with greater cunning. Worse was the involvement of some Sino-foreign joint-ventured enterprises in the smuggling in the name of imports of raw and processed material. They smuggled car parts and electric appliances hidden with normal import items making it difficult for customs to discover. Mr. Hong saw smuggling following several ways. First, the smuggling groups tended to be well organized and covering wider areas, including Hong Kong, Thailand, the Philippines and South Korea. Second, the areas at home included in smuggling activities extended from the coastal areas along Fujian, Zhejiang and Guangdong in the past to wider areas. Third, the equipment involved in smuggling tended to be modernized, with speedboats capable of sailing at up to 40 sea miles per hour as well as advanced communications devices. Since there was a shortage of input of resources into the fight against smuggling, the equipment used by marine anti-smuggling teams in the Mainland was old-fashioned when compared with that employed by the smugglers. Mr. Hong said he was convinced that the state should earmark part of money put at hundreds of millions of renminbi resulting from the seizure of smuggled items every year to strengthen the marine force to counter smuggling at sea.
