SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The Secretary is proposing to amend 34 CFR Part 682 of the Department's regulations to reflect certain policy decisions made during development of regulations for the Direct Loan Program. As required by section 492(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, (HEA) the Secretary convened a negotiated rulemaking committee to develop proposed rules for the second and subsequent years of the Direct Loan Program. During the negotiated rulemaking process, the Department, at the request of the negotiators, agreed to make changes in the FFEL Program to conform to policies and procedures adopted in the Direct Loan Program, wherever possible, to provide a consistent approach in both programs. In addition, some of these changes are necessary to ensure that the terms, conditions and benefits of FFEL Program loans and Direct Loans are the same, in accordance with Section 455(a)(1) of the HEA. These proposed regulations reflect those changes that would affect the FFEL Program. In addition, the Secretary invites comments on other provisions of the FFEL Program regulations that should be revised to conform with the Direct Loan Program provisions. The proposed Direct Loan Program regulations were published as a separate Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on August 18, 1994, 59 FR 42646. This NPRM also proposes to delete certain regulatory provisions in 34 CFR Part 682 which duplicate or conflict with other regulations. Specifically, the Secretary proposes to delete regulations governing the determination of a student's withdrawal date and institutional refund policies.
