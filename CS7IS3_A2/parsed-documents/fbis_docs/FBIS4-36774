In a statement to MENA in Tripoli this evening, al-Ghuwayl said he was trying to contact other lawyers connected with the case to make the necessary arrangements to contact the Lebanese judiciary and obtain the details of Sha'ban's confession. He noted that he would then rearrange the documents of the two Libyan suspects' case. Ibrahim al-Ghuwayl added that any negative reactions to the confessions made by Yusuf Sha'ban prove that there is a prior design against his clients. He said that in his capacity as coordinator of the defense team representing the Lockerbie suspects, he will contact Counselor Philip Khayrallah, director of the Lebanese Criminal Department. Referring to news agency reports saying that in his confessions, Yusuf Sha'ban asserted that he possesses complete information, al-Ghuwayl said his two clients have a legitimate right to learn the contents of Sha'ban's confessions with the aim of revealing the truth. Al-Ghuwayl added that he will ask the Lebanese judiciary to give him the opportunity to follow up Sha'ban's interrogation. He pointed out that this can be done with the help of Lebanese and Arab legal experts, representatives of the Arab Lawyers Association, and representatives of the UN Human Rights Commission. He announced that he will inform the Lebanese Government of the name of the lawyer who will carry out the necessary legal measures on his behalf.
