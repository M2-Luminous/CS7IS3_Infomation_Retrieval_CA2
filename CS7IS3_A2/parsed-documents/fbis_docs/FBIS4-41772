However, Lukashenko called rumors that he wanted to kick out the whole state apparatus if he is elected groundless. "85 per cent of government employees and law enforcement personnel -- the police, the KGB, the Interior Ministry, the procurator's office -- are respectable and honest people," he announced at a press conference in Minsk on Monday. With the exception of the top military and civilian brass, Lukashenko and his team are "ready to work and cooperate" with government employees. That statement also concerns the republic's industrial managers, whose enterprises will be given up to January 1, 1995 to "function normally." If they are not capable of meeting that deadline, "the heads will be fired," Lukashenko explained. The Belarusian candidate refused to exclude the possibility that he would invite one of the members of the current government to fill the prime minister's seat, if he is elected.
