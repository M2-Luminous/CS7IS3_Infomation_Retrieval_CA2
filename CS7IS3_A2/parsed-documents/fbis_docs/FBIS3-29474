The scandal follows revelations in the Indonesian Parliament that Bapindo, the state-owned development bank had lent U.S.$430 million to Eddy Tansil, a businessman who heads the Golden Key group of companies. Legislator A.A. Baramuli, who belongs to the ruling Golkar [Functional Group] party, told MPs that the money had not been repaid and was now one of 49 cases of bad or doubtful debts amounting to billions of dollars owed to state banks. The loan was apparently made to subsidiaries of Golden Key for the construction of petrochemical plants in the West Java city of Cilegon. Hutomo Mandala Putra (Tommy), a son of President Suharto. was chairman of one of the subsidiaries and his Humpuss Group a minor shareholder at the time the loan was made. Last week, General Sudomo, former coordinating minister of politics and security and now chairman of the president's Supreme Advisory Council, said he had recommended that Bapindo lend money for the project but that neither he nor his family had any personal financial interest in it. Gen. Sudomo had earlier strongly criticised the MP who revealed the loan details claiming that he had violated bank secrecy laws. A series of current ministers, including Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammed, Governor of the Central Bank Sudrajat Jiwandono, and Bapindo executives have appeared in parliament denying knowledge of the loan or refusing to answer questions about the matter. Their reticence has led to parliamentary calls for revision of the bank secrecy laws. J.B. Sumarlin, finance minister at the time the loan was granted in 1992 also denied that he had any personal interest in the project or that he had recommended it be granted when he was a commissioner of Bapindo. Mr. Hutomo admitted he had pushed Bapindo to make the loan for the project but said that Humpuss had now sold its shareholding in the Golden Key subsidiary because it realised that the plant would cost double its planned budget. Mr. Tansil has claimed that he is servicing the loan, but there appears little evidence that the money has been used to import equipment for the plant, the reason for the loan according to a letter of credit issued by Bapindo. Both Mr. Tansil and another Golden Key director have been banned from leaving Indonesia. Foreign bankers say that the scandal points to the way influential people can ignore laws and regulations set up by the Central Bank and how state banks have been powerless to reject requests for loans from such people. The loan to Mr. Tansil violated Bapindo's legal lending limit at the time and Mr. Tansil had been taken to court earlier for non-payment of loans to foreign banks. "He is well known to Bank Indonesia," a foreign banker said, adding that normal credit risk evaluations were clearly not made. The Golden Key case is not the first time that Mr. Hutomo has been involved in borrowing from state banks for failed projects. In 1991, he borrowed U.S. $400 million from the central bank to establish a monopoly over the clove trade, which subsequently collapsed. Last year, the government ended the practice of so-called "memo loans" -- funds granted on the basis of a memo from an important individual -- from state banks under a programme backed by the World Bank to recapitalise the major state banks.
