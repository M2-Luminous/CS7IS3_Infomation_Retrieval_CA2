FR941117-0-00196 FR941117-0-00013 Some commenters were concerned that permitting issuers and obligors to send any notices or information they wished would flood the repositories. Given the fact that event notices generally are short, it appears that the repositories would be able to handle the flow of notices. The Commission will, however, monitor developments in this area. Some commenters expressed concern that the event described as ``matters affecting collateral'' was too broad. 122 In response to such observations, that reference has been revised to reflect more clearly the types of events relating to collateral that could affect the creditworthiness of the security being offered. For instance, the item was not intended to require disclosure in the event of a drop in revenues or receipts securing payment. Rather, as more clearly indicated in the revised amendments, it is intended to encompass the release, substitution, or sale of property securing repayment of the securities being offered. 123 122 See, e.g., Letter of ABA Business Law Section; Letter of ABA Urban Law Section; Letter of NABL; Letter of NCHFFA; Letter of New York State Housing Finance Agency; Letter of Orrick Herrington. 123 See Rule 15c2&hyph;12(b)(5)(i)(C)(10). Commenters also questioned whether the event relating to adverse tax opinions or events affecting the tax-exempt status of the security would include events not specific to an issuer, such as tax law changes which may affect a multitude of issuances and which are broadly reported. 124 They argued that there is no need for each issuer to make that disclosure, which may overwhelm the repositories. The amendments do not include a uniform requirement for notification of events having widespread impact that are widely reported. Frequently, individual issuer disclosure may not affect the total ``mix'' of information available to investors, for example where Congress amends tax rates or alternative minimum tax rules that could affect an investor's yield. On the other hand, it may not be clear, absent individual disclosure, which classes of outstanding securities are affected by the general events, for example, where the tax law change affects a particular type of municipal security or financing structure. 124 See, e.g., Letter of ABA Urban Law Section; Letter of Kutak Rock; Letter of Orrick Herrington. It is possible that an ``event'' affecting the tax-exempt status of the security may include the commencement of litigation and other legal proceedings, including an audit by the Internal Revenue Service, when an issuer determines, based on the status of the proceedings and their likely impact on holders of the municipal securities, among other things, that such events may be material to investors. Commenters expressed concern that the party providing the undertaking may not have knowledge of the occurrence of events affecting other parties that might be called for by the provisions of the rule. 125 This concern should be addressed by the revised approach of enabling the parties to the transaction to determine who will provide the undertakings. For example, in the conduit context, the covenant could be provided by the person that is committed by contract or other arrangement to support payment of debt service, rather than the conduit issuer. 125 See, e.g., Letter of First Southwest Company; Letter of New York Dormitory Authority; Letter of the Treasurer of the State of North Carolina; Letter of City of Pullman, Washington. The timing for providing the notification has not been changed from the Proposed Amendments, which required that the notice be provided on a ``timely'' basis. The amendments do not establish a specific time frame as ``timely,'' because of the wide variety of events and issuer circumstances. In general, this determination must take into consideration the time needed to discover the occurrence of the event, assess its materiality, and prepare and disseminate the notice. A new paragraph has been added to the amendments 126 that would require a Participating Underwriter to reasonably determine that the undertaking includes an agreement to notify the appropriate repository if the annual financial information is not provided in the stated time frame. Given the expressed concerns of some commenters regarding the difficulty that they would face in determining whether an issuer or other person was in compliance with any of its undertakings, 127 this provision will help inform market participants if annual financial information for such persons has not been made available in the agreed upon time frame. 126 See Rule 15c2&hyph;12(b)(5)(i)(D). 127 See, e.g., Letter of Gust & Rosenfeld. 3. Location of Undertaking in a Written Agreement or Contract The Proposed Amendments called for the undertaking to be contained in a written agreement or contract for the benefit of holders of municipal securities. Commenters provided a variety of views as to where the undertakings should be memorialized, who should be parties to such undertakings, and the need for flexibility to modify undertakings in the future. Commenters suggested, for instance, that the undertakings could be included in the trust indenture, bond resolution, ordinance, or other legislation, a separate written agreement, or the underwriting agreement or bond purchase agreement. As discussed in the Proposing Release, many offerings of municipal securities are issued pursuant to a trust indenture setting out the covenants of the issuer for the benefit of the holders of the municipal securities. If there is no trust indenture as part of an offering, as is the case with general obligation and certain other types of bonds, there may be a bond resolution, ordinance, or other legislation. Most commenters addressing this issue considered the trust indenture, bond resolution, ordinance, or other legislation to be appropriate for undertakings to provide secondary market disclosure, because they would create a direct obligation by issuers to bondholders. 128 Commenters also suggested the use of a separate written agreement between the issuer and the trustee as an appropriate method of memorializing undertakings. 129 128 See, e.g., Letter of Merrill Lynch. Certain commenters considered that undertakings in a trust indenture could prove inflexible, as well as difficult to modify if they became inappropriate in the future. Letter of ABA Business Law Section. Other commenters considered that the issue of flexibility could be addressed through careful drafting. Letter of Morgan Stanley; Letter of Rauscher, Pierce, Refsnes, Inc. 129 See Letter of Chapman and Cutler (suggesting that an agreement could be made between an issuer and a trustee or between the issuer and a NRMSIR); Letter of Rauscher, Pierce, Refsnes, Inc. These commenters noted that such agreements provide flexibility for the future modification of the type, timing, or presentation of secondary market disclosure, as well as remedies in the event of a breach of the agreement. Several commenters suggested that the inclusion of the undertakings in an underwriting agreement or bond purchase agreement would be sufficient for purposes of Rule 15c2&hyph;12, 130 though another commenter suggested that a promise running to the benefit of the underwriter, whether in a bond purchase agreement or in a separate agreement, would be enforceable by existing and future bondholders only on the basis of a third party beneficiary theory, the availability of which may vary from state to state. 131 130 See e.g., Letter of Mudge Rose. 131 See Letter of Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley also suggested that an underwriting agreement was an unsatisfactory vehicle for undertakings to provide secondary market disclosure because an underwriter of a specific bond issue should not be the recipient of a long-term contract of this type. See Letter of Morgan Stanley. Other commenters agreed that undertakings should be for the benefit of holders of municipal securities, and that there should be no requirement that undertakings be made for the benefit of Participating Underwriters. See, e.g. , Letter of Merrill Lynch (noting that ``the holders of the securities have the greatest interest in enforcing the covenant to provide information and are in the best position to evaluate whether affirmative efforts to enforce the covenant should be undertaken'').
