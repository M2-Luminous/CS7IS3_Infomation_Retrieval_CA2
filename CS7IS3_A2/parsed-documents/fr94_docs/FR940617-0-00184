(d) Report the specification range of the fuel to be used under paragraphs (b)(2) and (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section in the application for certification in accordance with §89.115&hyph;96 (a)(8). §89.331&hyph;96 Test conditions. (a) General requirements. Calculate all volumes and volumetric flow rates at standard conditions for temperature and pressure (0 ○C and 101.3 kPa), and these conditions must be used consistently throughout all calculations. (b) Engine test conditions. Measure the absolute temperature (designated as T and expressed in Kelvin) of the engine air at the inlet to the engine, and the dry atmospheric pressure (designated as p and expressed in kPa), and determine the parameter f according to the following provisions: (1) Naturally aspirated and mechanically supercharged engines: E:GRAPHICSER17JN94.008 (2) Turbocharged engine with or without cooling of inlet air: E:GRAPHICSER17JN94.009 (c) For a test to be recognized as valid, the parameter f shall be between the limits as shown below: E:GRAPHICSER17JN94.010 Appendix A to Subpart D_Tables Table 1._ Abbreviations Used in Subpart D 1␣ 1␣ CLD Chemiluminescent detector.
