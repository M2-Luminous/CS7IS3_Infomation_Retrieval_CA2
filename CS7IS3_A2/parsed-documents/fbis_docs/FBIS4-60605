Head of the company's international relations Ghanimifar Mohabat Ghanimifar, in an interview with the English daily `TEHRAN TIMES' which appeared Monday, noted that OPEC and non-OPEC members have cooperated closely in order to stabilize prices so that neither producers nor consumers incur losses. The extreme winter conditions in the northern hemisphere have lowered oil reserves in industrial nations of the west including the United States, he added. Since many western countries are slowly recovering from recession and economies seem to be speedily improving, the demand for oil is bound to increase, Ghanimifar remarked. "Furthermore", he said "OPEC countries have been producing according to agreed-upon quotas during the past few months, as a result of which markets have not been flooded with supplies". The approach of Saudi Arabia and Iran after certain OPEC sessions has been constructive and had definitely contributed to price increases in international markets, he continued. Referring to fighting in Yemen, political unrest in Nigeria and low North Sea reserves as elements affecting the market, Ghanimifar said that the stock market speculations and share sales may have been another reason for the price hike. Consumer countries are worried that the agreement reached between OPEC and non-OPEC producers could result in producers' monopolizing the market which was rejected by Ghanimifar. He also mentioned that in the very near future, Iraq will once again be able to sell oil and saturate the market at which point greater cooperation on adjusting and staying within quotas will be needed. He concluded by suggesting that cooperation between the oil producers should be initiated long before the market begins to dictate its terms on prices.
