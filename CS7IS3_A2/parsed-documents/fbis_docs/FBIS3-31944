I also want to report that this morning's transportation service was very scarce. Very few vehicles were operating. The people going to the various voting centers in the capital to vote are doing so timidly. We have an interview with Jose Pinzon, secretary general of the CGTG [Guatemalan Workers General Central Organization], who will give us his opinion about what is happening at Parque de la Industria. [Begin Pinzon recording] There is an average of three voters per voting booth. We have toured the place. The CGTG is an observer in this popular consultation event. At the voting booths we have visited, there is barely an average of three voters per booth, meaning, there is no enthusiasm. The people of the capital are stating no opinion. We do not know what is happening at other voting places, in the downtown area. We are going there. Anyhow, I believe the people are pessimistic and frustrated about the reforms to the Constitution, because they believe they have not been prepared clearly or honestly. We do hope the people vote, to decide their own future in this issue. It is not good for the people to abstain from participation. They have been invited to abstain, but we believe this is negative, because to abstain from voting favors the reforms to the Constitution and this would be fatal to the Constitution, which has always represented some kind of social pact among Guatemalans [sentence as heard]. If this social pact is reformed, the pact would be broken. We do not think it is positive to remain home. [end recording]
