In a car accident last Thursday, Horn suffered a fractured cervical vertebra, a broken wrist, and concussion. Now he is being treated in a Miskolc hospital. Commenting on the Socialist success, Horn said that those who offer authentic policies are accepted by the people. He felt genuine change was badly needed in Hungary and could only occur if the Socialists won the May 29 second round too. Horn denied the rumour that the MSZP would nominate Gabor Kuncze, prime minister candidate of the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), for the prime minister's post. "This idea was not raised at all in the party. The prime minister will be chosen by the winner of the elections," Horn said.
