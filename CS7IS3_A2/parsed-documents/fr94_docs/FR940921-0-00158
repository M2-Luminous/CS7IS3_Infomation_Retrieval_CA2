FR940921-0-00158 FR940921-0-00017 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) published a final rule on December 21, 1990 (Docket HM&hyph;181; 55 FR 52402), which comprehensively revised the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR; 49 CFR parts 171 to 180) with respect to hazard communication, classification, and packaging requirements based on the United Nations Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods. A document responding to petitions for reconsideration and containing editorial and substantive revisions to the HM&hyph;181 final rule was published on December 20, 1991 (56 FR 66124). On October 1, 1992, under Docket HM&hyph;181 and HM&hyph;189, RSPA issued additional editorial amendments to the December 21, 1990 final rule (57 FR 45446). A petitioner to the October 1992 final rule stated Special Provision B65 in 49 CFR 172.102 was inconsistent because the first sentence specified only a DOT 105A500W tank car, while the second sentence pertained to the remarking of a DOT 105J500W tank car to a DOT 105J300W tank car. RSPA revised this special provision in the September 24, 1993 final rule to clarify that the DOT 105A500W tank car is the only authorized tank car for hydrocyanic acid, aqueous solutions and hydrogen cyanide, anhydrous stabilized [58 FR 50235]. However, the second sentence incorrectly referenced a DOT 105J tank car. Therefore, in this final rule, RSPA is correcting the second sentence in Special Provision B65 to prescribe the remarking of a DOT105A500W tank car to a DOT 105A300W tank car. One rail carrier stated its belief that the regulations adopted under the December 21, 1990 final rule allowed rail cars moving under their own momentum to strike placarded flatcars, including flatcars loaded with placarded transport vehicles, freight containers, and bulk packagings. In order to clarify this matter, RSPA issued a correction in the Docket HM&hyph;181F final rule that amended the rail car handling requirements in §174.83(b) [58 FR 50237]. RSPA explained that the change was being made so as not to allow an over-speed impact of any rail car transporting a Division 1.1 or 1.2 explosive, a Division 2.1 flammable gas (in a class DOT 113 tank car), or a Division 2.3 poisonous gas. Additionally, RSPA explained that in order to clarify these handling requirements, §174.83(b) was being restructured to reflect the regulatory language that existed prior to December 21, 1990. After publication of the September 24, 1993 final rule, several commenters noted that §174.83(b) prohibited rail cars containing all Division 2.3 poisonous gases from moving under their own momentum, as opposed to only those containing Division 2.3 Hazard Zone A materials. Commenters further noted that the rule did not prohibit the movement of rail cars under their own momentum for Division 6.1 Packing Group I Hazard Zone A materials. A notice of proposed rulemaking published on July 12, 1993, under Docket HM&hyph;181F (58 FR 37612), proposed revisions to §174.83(b) applicable to Division 2.3 Hazard Zone A and Division 6.1 Packing Group I Hazard Zone A materials; however, in the final rule, paragraph (b) was rewritten for clarity and did not reflect accurately the applicable categories. Therefore, this final rule amends §174.83(b) to correct these omissions. RSPA also is amending §174.83(b) to clarify that handling restrictions apply only to loaded rail cars transporting a Division 1.1 or 1.2 explosive, a Division 2.3 Hazard Zone A gas or a Division 6.1 PG I Hazard Zone A material. The handling restrictions will still apply to all class DOT 113 tank cars (both loaded tank cars and those containing a residue) that are used to transport a Division 2.1 material, because of the design of the inner tank supporting system (see §§172.203(g)(2), 179.400&hyph;13, and 179.400&hyph;26(d)). Summary of Regulatory Changes by Section Section 172.102. Special Provision B65 is amended by changing the tank car specifications referenced in the second sentence to read ``DOT 105A500W'' and ``DOT 105A300W'', respectively. Section 174.83. Paragraph (b) introductory text is revised to clarify handling restrictions and to prohibit rail cars transporting a Division 1.1 or 1.2 explosive, a Division 2.1 flammable gas (in a class DOT 113 tank car), a Division 2.3 Hazard Zone A gas or a Division 6.1 PG I Hazard Zone A material from moving under their own momentum, from being coupled into with more force than is necessary to complete the coupling, or from being struck by any other rail car moving under its own momentum. Changed Legal Citations On July 5, 1994, President Clinton signed H.R. 1758_now Public Law (Pub. L.) 103&hyph;272_``a bill to revise, codify, and enact without substantive change certain general and permanent laws, related to transportation,'' including the HMTA. Public Law 103&hyph;272, 108 Stat. 745 (1994). The purpose of Public Law 103&hyph;272 was to ``clean-up'' related Federal transportation laws and restate them in a format and language intended to be easier to understand without changing substantive content. Consequently, Public Law 103&hyph;272 revised, enacted and codified provisions of the Federal hazardous materials transportation law, now found at 49 U.S.C. 5101&hyph;5127. At the same time, Public Law 103&hyph;272 also repealed the original statute. The legal citations that appear in this document reflect the non-substantive changes made by Public Law 103&hyph;272. Regulatory Analysis and Notices A. Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures This final rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and, therefore, was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. The rule is not considered a significant rule under the Regulatory Policies and Procedures of the Department of Transportation (44 FR 11034). The original regulatory evaluation has been reexamined but not modified. The changes made under this final rule provide clarification and will not result in an adverse economic impact on industry. B. Executive Order 12612 This final rule has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 (``Federalism''). Section 5125(b)(1) of Title 49 U.S.C. expressly preempts State, local, and Indian tribe requirements on certain covered subjects unless they are substantively the same as the Federal requirements. Covered subjects are: (A) The designation, description, and classification of hazardous material; (B) The packing, repacking, handling, labeling, marking, and placarding of hazardous material; (C) The preparation, execution, and use of shipping documents related to hazardous material and requirements related to the number, contents, and placement of those documents; (D) The written notification, recording, and reporting of the unintentional release in transportation of hazardous material; or (E) The design, manufacturing, fabrication, marking, maintenance, reconditioning, repairing, or testing of a package or container represented, marked, certified, or sold as qualified for use in transporting hazardous material.
