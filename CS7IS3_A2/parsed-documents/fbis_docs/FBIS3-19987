[Gunel] As a socialist, I am sure the right thing to do is to solve our country's problems on a legal democratic level within the framework of a party like ours. The DEP was founded on 7 May 1993. Since that day it has been attempting to pursue a policy based on the following principles: 1. The party recognizes that the Kurdish people have been defamed, persecuted, and exploited as part of official ideology for 70 years, and that the Kurdish problem must be solved in a democratic, peaceful, and legal manner. I do not think there can be any democracy and human rights without a solution to the Kurdish problem in this country. 2. Ever since the Ottoman Empire, democracy has never been practiced as a way of life in Turkey. But we want to practice it. 3. The party is aimed at putting an end to the increasing exploitation of the working class and working people. Just as with the HEP [People's Labor Party], the DEP also sees a link between the national democratic struggle of the Kurdish people and the economic and political struggle of the working class. Therefore the DEP is in favor of the unity of all democratic forces, and is of the opinion that the various problems can only be solved when taken together. Even so, we are often presented as a single party that acts exclusively for the sake of the Kurdish question. Since the formation of the HEP, the Turkish state at last has a party that opposes official ideology without hesitation. The parties that consider themselves leftist have never consistently opposed the repressive policy that intimidates the Kurds. The state realized that the HEP would mark the beginning of a new era, and it attempted to strangle the new movement. One method of doing so was to confront us in the media with the "specter" of the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] and isolate us from the remaining circles, from the progressive left, democratic forces, and working class. The local government elections of 27 March at last gave our party the opportunity to present our policy directly to the people. But the state had already prepared its own strategy. First, the chief of the General Staff informed the political leadership that the preconditions for holding the elections were missing in the east and southeast of the country, and that, therefore, the elections should be abandoned in those areas. But they failed to convince the politicians, because the discontinuation of the elections in the provinces would have constituted a state weakness, showing that the state no longer had any control over a certain part of the country. Therefore the politicians refused. [Maxton] It would also have shown once again that this part of the country is virtually divided. [Gunel] Yes. The second method against us was our exclusion from the elections. We had started a peace campaign. Because of a declaration that our Central Executive Council had adopted during the election campaign, court action to ban our party was commenced, with this action having no basis in existing legislation. The purpose of this was to disband the party and found a new one. At the same time, our supporters were supposed to think that we would not be able to take part in the elections because of our termination and turn to other parties. But because even this was not enough and the DEP announced that it would take part in the elections in spite of everything, a third method was utilized. Mainly in the east and southeast, the chairmen and members of all our regional subcommittees were pressured to resign. We have documents and letters from the chief of staff to party members, chairmen, and ordinary members containing threats of murder and kidnapping. When election candidates stepped forward despite these threats, goverment people went to each village in which we could expect to gain votes and threatened to burn down the entire village if we won the elections, or to kill one man for each vote cast in our favor. Despite everything, we said that we would take part in the elections, even if it meant winning few votes. But on the night after we had presented our candidate to the public, on 13 February, 320 of our candidates, including the candidate for the mayorship of Diyarbakir, were arrested. They were not only tortured, but also threatened with death if they maintained their candidacies. Finally, highly explosive charges were laid at our district offices in Mamak and Yenimahalle, the provincial office, and our party headquarters. The explosion attempt occurred at a time when two parliamentary deputies, two acting chairmen, and two acting general secretaries were present. This was a deliberate attempt to kill them. Apart from that, an attempt was made on the life of our general secretary at 01:30 in the morning. He was lucky to have survived. [Maxton] The DEP had trouble finding candidates. Does that apply to all provinces in varying degrees? How many candidates did you want to have, and how many did you find? [Gunel] We had problems almost everywhere. I think the DEP could have found at least 15 to 20 candidates everywhere. Even the state and Turkish public opinion know that no party would be successful in the provinces apart from the DEP. [Maxton] How many candidates did you manage to find under the conditions in force? [Gunel] We had 70 mayor candidates for the large urban centers. Together with the smaller districts, we had a total of 390 candidates. Under normal conditions we would have had 380 candidates for the large centers and 1,800 candidates for city councillors instead of the normal 800. The candidates who were too scared to campaign thought not only of their own lives, but also of the lives of their children and relatives, and of the danger that their villages might have been burned. [Maxton] How many candidates do not actually belong to the DEP? For instance, the candidate for mayor of Diyarbakir is not a DEP member. [Gunel] About half the candidates do not belong to the party. Our method of selecting candidates differs from that of other parties. Our candidates were selected by the party headquarters, but on the recommendations of local party organizations, even taking the will of the local populace into consideration. We found seven candidates for the post of mayor of Diyarbakir, including the chairman of the Medical Council and a member of the Chamber of Genetic Engineers. Diyarbakir has a Democratic Platform consisting of 42 groups and societies who pursue politics at a distance from the parties. The Democratic Platform, in collusion with the local population, suggested the director of the Emlak Bank as a candidate, and we accepted him. [Maxton] On 16 or 17 September some mayors went over to the DEP, so the DEP had mayors for the first time. Were they able to bring about an understanding of communal politics, or were they not even given the chance to do so? [Gunel] Our friends had no chance whatsoever of presenting our communal policy. From the day they transferred to the DEP, their private houses and village halls were fired upon, and they themselves were arrested or interrogated. Not a single one of our mayors was able to sit in his office for as much as one day. One of them was the mayor of Lice, whose office was destroyed. The mayors of Silvan and Kozluk were immediately taken into police custody. Apart from that, since transferring to the DEP, our mayors have not received a single penny in financial support from the state. The mayor of Kozluk said recently that whereas the other mayors had already received their payments for 1995, he had not even received some of the money he was owed in 1992. Therefore we have no chance of offering financial support. In any case, the population of this region is no longer so concerned about support, they are more concerned about staying alive without being murdered, tortured, or expelled. So we do have a communal political program for the region, but we have not been able to implement it yet. [Maxton] The SHP [Democratic Populist Party], which differs from your party on several points, is pursuing a similar policy of decentralization and democratization. Are you holding talks on this subject? [Gunel] As far as declarations are concerned, even the ANAP [Motherland Party] is proceeding the same way we are. One can even say that ANAP is further ahead in this respect. But I very much doubt if these parties have much respect for the protection of human rights. When someone deprives someone else of his natural right, the right to life, how can he then say "man's water should be pure and his streets clean?" The protection of life comes first. Only then can one do something about living standards. [Maxton] Were there negative reactions to the DEP's decision to withdraw for the elections? Originally there was merely talk of withdrawing from the elections in Kurdistan. [Gunel] On the contrary, the general impression is that the reactions were positive. Even those who at first wanted to vote SHP are now saying that they woid vote for us as a protest against the arrests. I think we are capable of influencing 60 percent of our electorate. The remaining 40 percent will vote differently through fear of punishment. Even in this phase we will have little chance of publicity. But when we do reach our voters, I think they will all either boycott the election or deliberately cast invalid votes. On 9 March, our party congress will decide what to do next, and the party organizations will comply with what has been decided. I think this protest will be effective, and that we will succeed in convincing Turkish and international public opinion that these elections are illegitimate. The illegitimacy of the elections will be a subject of discussion from the very first month onward, and Turkish public opinion will become increasingly convinced that they are not legitimate, not only because of the persecution, but also because the DEP is the only party that can legitimately lend political expression to the situation of the Kurdish people. If the DEP cannot take part in the elections, then they cannot be legitimate elections. [Maxton] A debate has been going on inside the DEP for a long time now on whether or not the party should take part in the elections on account of the persecution. For a long time, the majority believed the DEP should take part. What national or international organizations have you requested support from in holding free elections? What assistance has been offered you? [Gunel] When the General Staff issued the first statements that the preconditions for holding the elections were missing, and later when the DEP was barred from the elections, and later still when all the other parties united against the DEP, we realized that we were facing very undemocratic measures against us. But we still hoped for a change during the election period. In addition to issuing a resolution to take part in the elections, our party congress called upon both sides to introduce a cease-fire at least during the elections. [Maxton] But as far as I know, this appeal for a cease-fire hardly appeared in the press, except in the pro-Kurdish paper GUNDEM. [Gunel] It received a brief mention in CUMHURIYET and AYDINLIK. Although we are acquainted with the right-oriented structures of the state, we still believed that a cease-fire would occur. However we decided that we would pull out of the elections on 26 March if the state continued with its persecution, murders, and threats. All the same, we have made all the preparations to take part in the elections, providing everything -- flags, loudspeakers, and handouts, even buses. [Maxton] The DEP Deputy Sirri Sakik is supposed to have said on 3 March: "We have withdrawn from the elections in order to protect our people." Following the DEP decision to withdraw form the elections, the PKK announced that it agreed with the DEP decision and called for an election boycott. Now, election boycotts are illegal in Turkey. Will there not be harsh measures against those who do not turn out to vote, especially in the Kurdish areas? How will your people be protected then? [Gunel] Further developments are yet to be discussed. But I can already say that we do not consider it expedient to take part in illegitimate elections. But in any case we will seek paths of action that are not harmful, and we will put pressure on people not to vote if such pressure might be harmful to them. The PKK is a different party with different methods and reaches its decisions according to its own political perception. [Maxton] You will probably find it very difficult to influence the state, but you might be able to make an appeal to the PKK through the media or some other channel. [Gunel] No, in fact it is very difficult for us to make contact with the PKK. But in the cities we are organized as a legal party within the framework of the law in force, and theoretically we should have access to the state. In any case that is our duty, and we are doing our best to make the state see our way of thinking. On the other hand, the PKK, with its methods of action, has completely outlawed itself from the system, and makes its own decisions internally, quite independently of the state or other institutions. As part of our peace campaign and in connection with the elections, we have called on both sides to cease fire, telling them that the bloodshed must stop and a peaceful solution must be found. We actually approached both sides with our message, and for this very reason a court action has been undertaken against us, on the grounds that we are equating the state with the PKK. Had we known what would happen, we would have addressed the appeal only to the state! [Maxton] Soon after the DEP began to explain to the public why it felt obliged to withdraw from the elections because of the persecution, the PKK renewed its threats against Turkish parties. Does that have a negative effect on the DEP's attitude? [Gunel] The PKK has its criteria for judging what is to the advantage of the Kurds and what is to their disadvantage, and is of the opinion that the struggle is to their advantage. I am not saying whether or not that is correct, but whenever you have asked us, as DEP members, about the kidnapping of journalists and the PKK resolution about the banning of parties, we have always said that existing problems cannot be resolved by the use of force, but only by political means. [Maxton] But that segment of public opinion that sympathizes with the Kurds has not received any positive influence. [Gunel] The segments of Turkish and international society that sympathize with us have never really tried to understand us. The state and our own problems and deficiencies have prevented us from expressing ourselves properly. But society has also failed to inquire whether we are really the way the state makes us out to be. We have always been viewed in a biased manner either as a Kurdish party or as a legal branch of the PKK. If society considers our declarations correct, it should cease making its solidarity with us dependent on the PKK's conduct. It should criticize the PKK directly, not us. [Maxton] The state's intimidation of the DEP is well-known and documented. On the one hand, the state is calling upon the Kurds to defend their rights not with force, but through democratic methods; on the other hand, almost every single Kurdish organization and institution has been closed. In the end, on 2 March even the parliamentary immunity of the seven Kurdish deputies was abolished. That shows that the state does not give the Kurds much of an opportunity for political expression. [Gunel] We in the DEP have always believed that despite all intimidation, problems must be resolved by political means and legally. But how much longer will this be possible if sooner or later all the people who share this principle are wiped out or pressured into thinking differently? There will be a demand to lift the parliamentary immunity of remaining deputies. So far, 75 of our party colleagues have been murdered, but we have not given up. Even if all our deputies or we ourselves are in prison, it is still expedient to continue at this level. But that only applies as long as we are not used as a label like Kurdish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin, and as long as we are able to propose our own solutions. As long as these possibilities of action have not been taken away from us, we will continue on our course. [Maxton] Several new voices have recently made themselves heard inside the SHP, which until recently was not very positively rated as a part of the government. SHP chairman Karayalcin discovered, somewhat late, the existence of depopulated villages and mentioned the danger of a "putsch by civilian forces." Apart from that, almost every single SHP deputy voted against lifting the parliamentary immunity of the Kurdish deputies. Do you think this signifies a certain breakthrough? [Gunel] Right now Turkey is experiencing the greatest economic and political crisis in its history. If a coalition of parties that represent apparently opposite political streams, Left and Right, is built, the resultant force can then be teamed up with the government in order to contain the Kurdish problem and the problems of democracy at least for a while. In view of the urgency of the problems, it has not been possible to prevent daily demands from receiving loud publicity. The daily costs of the war cannot be borne by the budget. They worsen the economic crisis and cause a deterioration in the economic situation of poor people. Apart from that, the war is limiting the effect of democracy. In view of all this, lifting parliamentary immunity can be viewed as no more than the drop that has caused the barrel to overflow. We are mainly concerned with the economic costs of a dirty war that is being waged allegedly "in defense of the state, democracy, and the people." [Maxton] What information do you have about the current situation of the arrested deputies? [Gunel] As far as we know, they have not been subjected to physical torture yet. But they are surely under psychological torture, and we also consider ourselves to be under such torture. The very arrest of these deputies and the fact that they have been deprived of their belts, shoelaces, and ties, as though they would commit suicide, plus the allegations (since denied by diplomatic sources) that some of them applied for political asylum abroad -- all this is a deliberate insult that we view as a form of psychological torture upon us. Other things might also be happening, suggested by the fact that our deputies have not been allowed to issue statements to the police. If Tansu Ciller weeps before the eyes of the entire population, it shows how much pressure is being brought to bear against her. We have no way of knowing how this pressure is applied, and by whom. Perhaps Tansu Ciller thinks that she behaved incorrectly under this pressure, and that she might be subjected to more of it. We must observe coming developments. World public opinion, which until now has judged events in Turkey in a biased manner, through the eyes of the Turkish authorities, seems to be reconsidering its attitude and is trying to make a contribution to democracy in Turkey. We are doing our best to remain calm despite all the intimidation, and will never resort to violent methods of solving problems. But if the state's pressure increases, we cannot assume any responsibility for future developments. [Maxton] What exactly do you expect from the Turkish parties on the one hand, and European governments, parties, and organizations on the other hand? [Gunel] Because we were already aware of these dangers, we have been telling Turkish human rights associations, trade unions, and democratic organizations, as well as European governments and human rights organizations, to send observers to monitor elections in Turkey. We know that delegations of observers are already being formed in Europe. But parliamentary speaker Cindoruk, who normally appears as a democrat, considered the sending of observers as an insult to "democratically governed" Turkey. Even in Turkey delegations of observers have been formed. Now that we, the DEP, cannot take part in the elections, they have lost their legitimacy. With this opinion we wish to make a contribution to democratization, and we hope that European governments and organizations will also call for a cease-fire, an end to the bloodbath, and a peaceful democratic solution. We do not want individuals to receive protection. We have begun to act at a legal political level, even though we know the risks involved. Even today we do not fear trials, arrests, and executions. Instead, we shall continue our democratic struggle. We do not intend to flee, but we expect the Europeans to realize that violations of human rights in Turkey have reached such proportions that there is no more democracy in this country, the elections are illegitimate, and the DEP is waging a just struggle. We do not want any asylum or personal protection. [Maxton] That means you want support so that you can continue to be politically active on a legal level in this country. [Gunel] That is right. We do not know what may develop. Some 50-60 people are dying in this country every day. This massacre of Turks and Kurds, soldiers, guerillas, and villagers must be stopped. We are prepared to pay a high price for this, if necessary. The arrest of our parliamentary deputies is also a price we have paid. But the killing must stop.
