But leaders of the Japan New Party (JNP), headed by Hosokawa, said Hosokawa and coalition partners will not appear before the committee unless it votes again on the resolution to summon the former prime minister. The JNP claims the committee's decision to summon Hosokawa is "invalid" because of improper parliamentary procedures. Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], reiterated at a press meeting Monday that Hosokawa does not have to testify in the Diet about his suspected financial deals. He also said the lower house Budget Committee's decision was invalid, violating parliamentary rules. Secretaries general of the coalition parties will make a final decision at a meeting slated for Tuesday morning, parties sources said. However Tsuruo Yamaguchi, chairman of the lower house Budget Committee, and opposition parties have rejected another call on the resolution to summon Hosokawa, saying that no improper procedure occurred in the decision. At a session of the Budget Committee last Thursday, Yamaguchi declared that his panel unanimously approved a proposal to summon the former prime minister. Observers said if Hosokawa fails to appear before the Diet committee, the opposition camp would intensify criticism against him for covering up suspicion over financial irregularities. They added if Hosokawa rejects the Diet testimony, the Liberal Democratic Party and some members of the Social Democratic Party [Social Democratic Party of Japan] would add pressure to submit a no-confidence vote against the cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. Refusing to give Diet testimony without a legitimate reason is punishable with a fine or imprisonment of up to one year by a two-thirds majority of committee members, according to Diet testimony law. Hosokawa's questionable deals were partly responsible for his April 8 announcement of his resignation as prime minister. Hosokawa's former financial secretary appeared before the budget panel Wednesday to say Hosokawa has indeed paid back a loan of 100 million yen borrowed in 1982 from the scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin trucking firm. The secretary, Masatoshi Miyama, denied allegations that Hosokawa may not have paid back the 100 million yen loan and that it was received as a secret political donation.
