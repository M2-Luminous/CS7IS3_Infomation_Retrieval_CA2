Peres made clear, however, that "the details will be known only when the investigation has been completed." Peres condemned the presence of Nazis in Argentina, saying "assassins must be punished wherever they might be because the law does not give anyone a license to kill another human being." Peres said he is "against all assassins in history." The Israeli foreign minister held a news conference at Government House after his one-hour meeting with President Carlos Menem. Peres briefed Menem on the status of the Middle East peace process since the historic signing of an agreement with the Palestinian people. Peres said he started a round of briefings with U.S. President Bill Clinton "and wanted to end it with President Menem." His meeting with the president was possible because the plane carrying the foreign minister from Santiago to Madrid made a technical stopover at Ezeiza Airport, which gave Peres a chance to request an audience with President Menem. Peres said the peace process with Yasir 'Arafat's Palestinians "was achieved and is irreversible." He also said that his intention was "to move forward and not backward." Peres recognized that the signing of the agreement's first chapter with the Palestinians "was not an easy matter. We had problems, but I think it is a great achievement." Peres said Israel "is negotiating with Syrians, Jordanians, Lebanese, and also with Palestinians on the issue of autonomy" because we want "to create a new way (of life) in the Middle East where security for the four nations will be guaranteed, permitting the development of an economic system that will allow these nations to improve their future prospects within the boundaries of respect for human rights and freedom."
