In an interview outside a small rural church near the kwaZulu capital Ulundi, where he attended a Good Friday service, the IFP president said if the summit went ahead it would take place in a "sour atmosphere", following Thursday's declaration of a state of emergency in Natal/kwaZulu. There was uncertainty after the declaration whether the meeting would go ahead but Mr Buthelezi indicated it appeared to be on and said he held out hope "otherwise I wouldn't be going". However, threats by Mr Mandela to confine the kwaZulu Police to barracks and Mr de Klerk's "appalling and shameful" decision to declare an emergency were not conducive to good negotiations, he said. The summit was to have taken place last week, but King Zwelithini pulled out because of the killing of his subjects in Johannesburg on Monday. Mr Buthelezi said on Friday he had begun to doubt the state president's integrity. While commending Mr de Klerk for his reforms, he said "the extent to which he has capitulated to the ANC worries me". "I've begun to question his integrity. He's disappointed me." Mr de Klerk was supposed to make a decision on an emergency from security information but instead he had been compelled to do so by the Transitional Executive Council [TEC], charged the IFP leader. "For TEC, you must read ANC." Mr Buthelezi alleged Mr de Klerk was handling the situation unfairly, because he had said nothing about the ANC's hidden arms caches but was worried about Zulu traditional weapons. Mr Buthelezi repeated that it was "not normal" for elections to be held under a state of emergency. The IFP leader, who is also kwaZulu's chief minister, expressed despair at the turmoil engulfing South Africa, saying the country was experiencing the "worst of the worst". "I can't prophesise what will happen, but what's worse than what's already happening?" Mr Buthelezi said it was difficult to say what might happen if a settlement was not reached to accommodate him and his supporters. But, he would continue to act as before: "For decades I've been practising resistance politics, by that I don't mean taking up arms...but people on the ground are very angry. I don't want to speculate or predict how their anger will be expressed on the ground."
