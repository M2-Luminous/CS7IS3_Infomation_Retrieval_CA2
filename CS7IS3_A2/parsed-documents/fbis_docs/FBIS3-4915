A 22-year-old Thai, Natachai Jencharoenwatama, stood proudly next to Korean cadets on the campus of the Air Force Academy in Chongwon, North Chungchong Province, Tuesday as a member of the 46th class. Natachai, born in Kanchanaburi, was selected as one of 14 cadets given the privilege of studying abroad while a freshman at the Thai Air Force academy in 1992. He arrived in March last year and took a one-year Korean language course at the Seoul National University Language Institute before moving on to the North Chungchong campus in January. He underwent five weeks of basic military training and tried to get used to the unfamiliar language and environment. "I like chicken and pork, but I don't know about kimchi yet," he said in broken Korean. Natachai has four years of regular courses still ahead and will most likely get used to kimchi and many other things Korean by then. "I'm prepared to learn the advanced studies and skills of the Korean Air Force to be an excellent Thai hawk," he said. The Korean Air Force Academy said it will continue to open its doors to foreigners as well as recruit female cadets from next year.
