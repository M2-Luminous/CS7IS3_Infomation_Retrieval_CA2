Respecting the lofty idea of His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, king of the Kingdom of Cambodia [KoC], the two national institutions of the KoC, namely the National Assembly and Royal Government of Cambodia [RoC] sent a high-ranking delegation led by Samdech Chea Sim, chairman of the National Assembly; Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, first prime minister and co-commander in chief of the Khmer Royal Armed Forces [KRAF]; and Samdech Hun Sen, second prime minister and co-commander in chief of the KRAF, to attend, at the king's Chhanghsu-on Palace in Pyongyang, a round- table meeting with Khieu Samphan, head of the Party of Democratic Kampuchea [DK] or Khmer Rouge, on 27 May. II. The participation by the high-ranking KoC delegation, which is the legal and legitimate representative born from the will of the people and in line with the Constitution dated 25 September 1993, constitutes a symbolic gesture and displays; A. The respect for the idea of the king, father of the nation, who has always strived to seek peace for the Cambodian people with whom he has always sympathized. B. The political will for peace of all KoC national institutions desiring to achieve peace and national reconciliation, without thinking of their superiority in power, so as to enable all national forces to jointly strive to develop the country for the well-being of the people in general, for the prestige of the KoC, and for ensuring national and territorial unity, sovereignty, national independence, and territorial integrity of the KoC. III. Immediately after the meeting began, the high-ranking representatives of the KoC totally and unconditionally agreed with the lofty idea of His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, that is: 1. They voiced support for and firmly pledged to follow the policy of peace and national reconciliation of our revered king, to maintain national and territorial unity without territorial division and seceded zones, to preserve and defend the territorial integrity, sovereignty, and national independence (?recognized internationally). 2. The top representatives of the KoC, namely the National Assembly and royal government, fully accepted the king's proposal for a cease-fire on the spot to begin at noon on 15 June with monitoring by an inter-Cambodian committee on this cease-fire. IV. Unfortunately, the king's proposal of the cease-fire schedule, which has been accepted unconditionally by the KoC's national institutions, was rejected by Khieu Samphan despite an energetic appeal by the king and repeated pleas by the two supreme patriarchs and Venerable Patriarch Mongkoltepeacha and Venerable Patriarch Khousananda. V. The king, venerable patriarchs, and the KoC national institutions time and again expressed their fervent desire to achieve national reconciliation and peace most longed for by the Cambodian people, but the Khmer Rouge representative only came to the roundtable, sitting before the face of the king and in the presence of monks from the two Buddhist sects, in order to continue his maneuvers to continue the war and shed the blood of fellow Cambodians by raising the same old argument, such as calling on the foreigners whom he has always opposed to arrange peace for Cambodia. This runs counter to the will of the people and the king, who correctly realize that the problem among the Cambodians can be resolved among the Cambodians themselves without need for help from foreigners.
