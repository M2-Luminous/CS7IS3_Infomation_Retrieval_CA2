FR941103-0-00062 FR941103-0-00009 G. Test Procedures and Standards Under EPA's I/M rule, the SIP must include a description of each test procedure used. The SIP also must include the rule, ordinance or law describing and establishing the test procedures. The Maine I/M SIP revision obligates the State to perform transient exhaust emission testing using the IM240 driving cycle. In addition, the State of Maine has stated that it will follow procedures in accordance with EPA's guidance document entitled, ``High-Tech I/M Test Procedures, Emission Standards, Quality Control Requirements, and Equipment Specifications.'' The State will be requiring IM240 tests on 1968 and later model year vehicles in the area. This model year coverage complies with EPA's I/M regulation. In addition, the State of Maine will require evaporative emission testing of fuel system integrity and functionality for 1981 and newer vehicles. The test procedures are set forth with specificity in the I/M Request For Proposal (RFP) which the Maine I/M contractor is required to abide by. In approving this action, EPA expects Maine to amend these procedures to ensure that the latest EPA procedures will be used in the program, if the EPA guidance is revised in the future. H. Test Equipment Under EPA's I/M rule, the SIP must include written technical specifications for all test equipment used in the program and address each of the requirements set forth at 40 CFR 51.358. The specifications must describe the emission analysis process, the necessary test equipment, the required features, and written acceptance testing criteria and procedures. In its July 21, 1994 submission, Maine provided written equipment specifications as contained in EPA's IM240 Guidance and the appendices of EPA's I/M rule. The Maine SIP submissions and their appendices address the requirements in 40 CFR 51.358 and include descriptions of performance features and functional characteristics of the computerized test systems. The necessary test equipment, required features, and acceptance testing criteria are mandated by the RFP and contract. I. Quality Control Under EPA's I/M rule, the SIP must include a description of quality control and recordkeeping procedures. The SIP also must include the procedures manual, rule, and ordinance or law describing and establishing quality control procedures and requirements. The Maine I/M SIP narrative, the RFP, and the contract included as part of the Maine July 21, 1994 submittal contain descriptions and requirements establishing the quality control procedures described in accordance with the federal I/M rule and are consistent with EPA guidance. These requirements will help ensure that equipment calibrations are properly performed and recorded and that the necessary compliance document security is maintained. The Maine SIP complies with all specifications for quality control set forth in ยง51.359 and appendix A of the federal I/M rule, and EPA's technical guidance. J. Waivers and Compliance Via Diagnostic Inspection Under EPA's I/M rule the SIP must include a maximum waiver rate expressed as a percentage of initially failed vehicles. This waiver rate is used for estimating emission reduction benefits in the modeling analysis. Corrective action must be taken if the waiver rate exceeds that estimated in the SIP, or the state must revise the SIP and claim emission reductions accordingly. The SIP also must describe the waiver criteria and procedures, including cost limits, quality assurance methods and measures, and administration. Lastly, the SIP must include the necessary legal authority, ordinance(s), or rules to issue waivers, set and adjust cost limits as required, and carry out any other functions necessary to administer the waiver system, including enforcement of the waiver provisions.
