Reacting to a NEWS AGENCY OF NIGERIA (NAN) report on a fresh attack by Cameroonian gendarmes on Nigerians in the Bakassi Peninsula in south-eastern Akwa Ibom State, Akinyemi said the "Maroua Declaration" signed by former Nigerian head of state Yakubu Gowon and President Ahmadu Ahidjo in the 70s, should be revisited. "Arising out of that (declaration), where is the boundary? Asked Akinyemi, who as director-general of the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs, was a member of a Nigerian task-force set up in the late 80s "to examine and prepare a report on the Bakassi Peninsula in all its ramifications". The former minister said that both countries could use the various organs set up for conflict resolution in the world. "But until it is resolved, if they (Cameroon) put their troops there, you put your troops there, too", declared Akinyemi, whose comments were reported by the press in Lagos on Thursday. NAN reported Tuesday that some 18,000 Nigerians had been forced to flee their homes in the latest gendarmes' attack. Nigeria responded to a similar attack last December by deploying troops to the Bakassi Peninsula. Foreign Minister Baba Gana Kingibe also visited Cameroon over the incident, after which both counties agreed to set up a joint patrol to stem future border clashes.
