FR941206-0-00097 FR941206-0-00013 These regulations established uniform requirements for all laboratories regardless of location, size or type. In developing the regulations, we included requirements that would ensure the quality of service and be in the best interest of the public health. We recognized that a rule of this scope required time for laboratories to understand and to implement the new requirements. Therefore, certain requirements were phased-in and given prospective effective dates. We also planned to address comments on the February 28 rule and make modifications, if necessary, in a successor final rule. On January 6, 1994, we published a final regulation in the Federal Register , at 59 FR 682. This revision to the February 28, 1992 rule extended the time for individuals to meet the educational qualifications for a cytotechnologist by either completing a training program or being certified by an approved organization. These changes were made to prevent the loss of qualified personnel in the field of cytotechnology and to allow the Department the time necessary to recognize organizations that certify cytology personnel. In the February 28, 1992 regulations, there are three prospectively set dates that need extensions to prevent disruption in implementation of the CLIA requirements. At §493.855, Standard; Cytology: Gynecologic examinations, we required the laboratory, by January 1, 1994, to enroll each individual engaged in the examination of gynecologic preparations in a PT program approved by HCFA. At §493.1202, Standard; Moderate or high complexity testing, or both: Effective from September 1, 1992, to September 1, 1994, we established quality control (QC) requirements for high complexity or moderate complexity tests including less stringent requirements for unmodified, moderate complexity testing cleared for commercial distribution by the FDA. At §493.1203, Standard; Moderate or high complexity testing, or both: Effective beginning September 1, 1994, we established a mechanism for laboratories using commercial, non-modified tests to fulfill certain QC requirements by following manufacturer's instructions that have been reviewed and determined by the FDA to meet applicable CLIA QC requirements. At §493.1443, Standard; Laboratory director qualifications, until September 1, 1994, an individual holding a doctoral degree may qualify with either (1) board certification, or (2) two years of laboratory training or experience, or both, and two years of experience directing or supervising high complexity testing. After September 1, 1994, all individuals qualifying with a doctoral degree must have board certification. For each of these requirements, we allowed what we considered as adequate time for laboratories to enroll personnel in a HCFA-approved cytology PT program, for manufacturers to obtain a QC review from the FDA, and for individuals to obtain certifications, given our planned publication date of the final regulations. However, approximately 16,000 comments were received on the February 28 rule, which required reevaluation of numerous provisions. As of January 1994, no cytology PT program had met the requirements for HCFA approval, we have not yet been able to implement the FDA review of QC instructions, and we do not anticipate that a final rule will be issued prior to the September 1994 date affecting the board certification requirement for an individual with a doctoral degree to qualify as a laboratory director. Therefore, we need to extend these prospectively set dates to allow time for laboratories and individuals to meet the CLIA requirements. In the regulations published on February 28, 1992, we established a pathway at §493.1483 that allows an individual to qualify as a cytotechnologist if she or he is certified in cytotechnology by an HHS-approved agency. In the preamble to this rule, we are announcing HHS approval of an agency to certify cytotechnologists. In this rule we also address the comments we received in response to two major areas: Effective dates for implementation of the requirements mentioned above and approval of an agency to certify cytotechnologists. The comments on implementation effective dates focused on the need for phase-in periods, feasibility of achieving compliance with the requirements by the end of the phase-in periods, and alternatives to the phase-in periods. The comments on the cytology qualification requirements included recommendations that HHS approve an agency that certifies cytotechnologists.
