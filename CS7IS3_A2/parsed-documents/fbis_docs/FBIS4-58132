Diplomatic sources said Jordan will continue to send low-key participants to the multilateral talks until action was taken on the siege of al-'Aqabah. This is the second time that Jordan will be staying away from active participation in the Middle East multilateral talks since it announced that rejoining the talks hinged upon an end to interceptions by Western warships of al-'Aqabah-bound vessels. The naval inspections, which are part of the enforcement of sanctions against Iraq, have cost the Kingdom $1.3 billion in extra freight and delays caused by diversions of ships from the port of al-'Aqabah.
