He was told that there was no permanent job in that office. There were only two part-time jobs available there. Clinton offered to hold the two posts. This might symbolize Clinton as a hard worker or a monopolizer. This event happened about 30 years ago. He is now occupying the White House as head of a world superpower. The world is now demanding that Clinton work hard. We simply want him to take up the greatest and most challenging job, that is to use his power to end the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Clinton once wrote: "A leader will only be useful if he or she is strongly determined to confront any issue. We cannot accept a policy marginally or are reluctant to act as this will cause politics to lose its essence." During a meeting with Clinton yesterday, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir gave a viewpoint that contradicted the U.S. action regarding the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Will Clinton be able to fulfil the demand? We are confident that Clinton, being the first U.S. President elected in the post-Cold War era, will be able to fulfil the wish of the international community without much ado. We abide by the principles that Clinton belonged to a generation that grew up during the Cold War era and that realized how a superpower rivalry could bring the world to destruction. He was already aware that wars had brought about the worst effects the world can experience. Why, however, has he acted so weakly? Clinton should know that the current generation should not be forced to tie itself to the mood [preceding word in English] and events formed in the superpower political arena. The entire world is being haunted by fears of worsening wars. The international community wants a world that is reliable and capable of ensuring the welfare of mankind. They want strong, noble world leaders capable of telling the truth. We want to see Clinton, being leader of a superpower, to give the the world a greater sense of security. Is he capable of leading the world or is the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina too great to resolve? Does he remain a "monopolizer?" As Clinton was once a strong supporter of Jimmy Carter's human rights policy vis-a-vis the refugee issue, this is time for him to prove his commitment by settling a greater issue -- brutal persecution, rapes, and murders. We want Clinton to fulfill the demand of the international community. We want the United States to rethink and work for the welfare of the rest of the world. The United States should use this opportunity to restore its image before the international community. The United States should change its policy of seeing a problem on the basis of potential profit to one based on humanity. The policy that arms sales are more important than human lives means that the United States has no respect for the international community. It would be useless for Clinton to say that education should be available for all human beings, if Bosnian children were unable to study because school buildings had been destroyed and it was dangerous to go to school. The United States should not deceive the world by distorting facts about the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. If this continues, a proverb that "a nation creates a war to gain wealth, while an anti-war nation in fact creates a war" is correct. The slogan "Make Profits Out of War" is nothing new in the superpower context. As explained by Dr. Mahathir, the United States should use its power and influence to end the brutalities in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
