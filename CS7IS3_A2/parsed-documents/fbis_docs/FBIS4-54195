"We are determined to implement the next elections for the House of Representatives under a new system," said Yuji Tsushima, a lower house member of the primary opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), in reading the group's statement. The move comes in response to unabated calls from the LDP and the second largest opposition Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ] for a general poll under the current multiseat electoral system after passage of the fiscal 1994 national budget. At a news conference, Tsushima, chief initiator of the signature drive, lashed such calls, saying, "it is never pardonable to try to see a general election held under the multiseat system." The legislators aim to collect signatures from the majority of the 511 lower house members by June 10 as the first step to cap years of political reform efforts, he said. Their action follows a demand earlier Thursday from a private panel on reform that the next general election be held under the new system combining single-seat constituencies with proportional representation. The committee for the promotion of political reform, formed in 1992 by industry, labor and media leaders, has supported lawmakers of all parties who seek to revamp the nation's political system and eradicate corruption in public life. In January the Diet legislated a package of electoral reform bills replacing the current multiseat system in the lower house with a combination of 300 single-seat voting districts and 200 in proportional representation. An independent panel of experts is currently splitting up the nation's multiseat constituencies into single-seat electorates and is likely to decide shortly on guidelines for the demarcation. However, the LDP has threatened to submit a no-confidence motion against the cabinet of prime minister Tsutomu Hata after the Diet approves the budget, and the SDPJ has shown interest in jumping on the bandwagon. The LDP holds 206 seats in the lower house and the SDPJ has 74 against 178 in Hata's coalition, the first minority goverment in 39 years. The SDPJ's Masao Sakon hinted he and other party lawmakers who support the signature drive may have to leave the SDPJ if its leadership moves to cooperate in bringing down the Hata government in a no-confidence vote. "If such a situation arises, we may have to make a certain decision," he said. Tsushima also explained their move stems from their political morality, noting that nearly all Diet members were elected after vowing to achieve political reform
