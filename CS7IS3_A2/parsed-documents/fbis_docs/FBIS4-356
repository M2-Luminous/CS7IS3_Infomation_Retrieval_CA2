[passage omitted] Youth Minister Seth Sendashonga, a member of the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] political bureau, said that under the law it was difficult to replace President Habyariman, but that politically the problem could be solved. Mr. Seth Sendashonga said that President Habyarimana's party, the Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development [MRND] would provide two candidates, one of whom will be chosen in accordance with the provisions of the peace accord. Mr. Seth Sendashonga was also asked about those persons who say that the plane might have been shot down by the RPF. Seth Sendashonga said the RPF held in contempt the shameful act of killing people in that way. He said the RPF had fought a tough war and had done enough to prove its power. He said that a peace agreement had been signed and that things were almost coming to a conclusion. So there was no reason for the RPF to kill Habyarimana.
