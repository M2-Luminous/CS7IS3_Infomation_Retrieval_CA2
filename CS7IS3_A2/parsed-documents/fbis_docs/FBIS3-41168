This is the response of the secretary general of the Narcotics Control Board, Gen Chawalit Yotmani, to Khun Sa's promise to stop growing poppies and operating heroin refineries. Khun Sa's self-proclaimed "Independent Shan State" in Burma is considered illegal, and Thailand cannot cooperate with him, Gen Chawalit said. Khun Sa still produces heroin and is the key man behind the narcotics trade, and Thailand will continue its suppression policy against the drug, he said. He dismissed Khun Sa's claim that heroin is refined in the Golden Triangle but not in areas under his control. There are 15-25 heroin refineries in Burma, Gen Chawalit said.
