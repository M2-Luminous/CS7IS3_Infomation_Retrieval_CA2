What is your opinion? [Watanabe] The LDP leadership will move in that direction. In case the House of Representatives is dissolved, the LDP could not fight in general elections without spending money. I think that no bank would lend 10 billion yen to the LDP. The LDP is prepared to fight in the general elections. At the present stage, I would like to refrain from commenting on the LDP's plan to submit a no- confidence motion against the Hata cabinet to the Diet. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] You are advocating plans to forge a conservative-conservative coalition. [Watanabe] I intend to talk candidly with any politicians who share my political belief about how to run the state and handle the political situation. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Do you think the ruling parties will propose to the opposition parties to hold talks to discuss how to form a new coalition government after the 1994 budget is passed in the Diet? [Watanabe] There is a possibility of the ruling parties first holding talks with the opposition Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ. If Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], Komeito, and the Democratic Socialist Party believe that they will be able to break the present political deadlock and carry out their policies after forging an alliance with the SDPJ, then the SDPJ would return to the ruling coalition. If those ruling parties have no intention of forging the alliance with the SDPJ, the SDPJ will not return to the ruling coalition. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Will the ruling parties approach the LDP for an alliance if they fail to forge an alliance with the SDPJ? [Watanabe] Yes, they will approach the LDP. Their approach may trigger debates in the LDP and stir up the LDP. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito, once said, "I am not sure whether we can reach a policy consensus with all members of the LDP." What do you think of his comment? [Watanabe] If he thinks that the LDP is divided over policies, no alliance can be forged between the ruling parties and the LDP. A minority of LDP members share my political belief. If the LDP is unable to shape its own policy consensus, it will not be strange if the ruling parties seek an alliance with some LDP members who share their policies. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] If the Kono leadership rejects an offer from the ruling parties for policy consultations, how will you respond to the rejection? [Watanabe] The LDP should hold intra-party discussion on the offer. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Mr. Watanabe, will you quit the LDP? [Watanabe] I will not break away from the LDP so lightly. I need not leave the LDP. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Speaking on a television talk show, Mr. Ozawa has said, "If I am asked to apologize for what I have done, I will apologize." What is your comment? [Watanabe] I take his statement as an indication of his eagerness to look for a way to break the current political deadlock and for a policy consensus after putting aside his personal feelings. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Does the LDP have a blueprint for an LDP-SDPJ coalition? [Watanabe] If there is no decision about who will become the prime minister and what the coalition will do, such a coalition would immediately collapse.
