President Museveni has close ties with the anti-government Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and his call for a foreign role is likely to have a strong impact on it. The rebels have condemned the United Nations for all but pulling out of Rwanda when the killings began in early April, and then planning a return which could halt the rebel advance through the country. President Museveni condemned the current government in Rwanda for its involvement in the slaughter but called on foreign countries, and the UN, to understand the real nature of the crisis before sending in troops. "The international community -- some of them don't know that it is the policy of government (in Rwanda) to use genocide as an instrument of eliminating opposition. I think if there was that understanding then the view of the situation would change. "Everybody would know that it is a criminal band, just like the Nazis, (which is responsible for the killing), and then the whole international community would hunt them down," he said in his first interview with a foreign newspaper since the Rwanda crisis erupted on April 6. "But I think there could be a basis for some limited involve ment; for instance, on purely humanitarian issues -- distributing food, rescuing civilians threatened by the massacres promoting a dialogue among the parties -- for a limited period, not indefinitely, and without attempting to influence the politicians of the countries." He stressed that the RPF should accept such an intervention, as its forces could not move quickly enough to save lives still under threat from government death squads operating in the capital and the south and west of the country. "The RPF needs to give the chance to the international community. Because now people think it,s merely a struggle for power by the two groups." The UN secretary-general, Butrus Butrus-Ghali and the Americans have discussed the Rwanda crisis with President Museveni. Uganda has been accused by the Rwandan government of supplying the RPF with arms. This has been denied by President Museveni, whose close ties with the RPF stem from the support its personnel gave him during the civil war which brought him to power in 1986. But his approval of an intervention stems as much from concerns about the Rwanda crisis spilling over into neighbouring countries, particularly Burundi, as it does from the impact on Rwanda itself. "The Rwandese parties, and the parties in Burundi, must know that mismanagement in their countries also affects other countries. So they cannot say their problem is entirely internal... Genocide isn't part of internal affairs. Internal affairs is how you govern yourself. But genocide has never been part of internal affairs." The impact of the failure of the American-led UN military intervention in Somalia last year continues to dominate discussions about the appropriate response to crises. "One weakness of international involvement is that they don't talk on the basis of justice," the Ugandan leader said. "They don't ask the question of who is right and who is wrong in this case. They just come and want to smother the problems -- to put a canvas over rotten eggs. And as long as the smell in the room is suppressed then the problem is solved."
