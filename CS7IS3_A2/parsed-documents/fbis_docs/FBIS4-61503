When discussing the condition of the Russian speaking population in the Baltic countries, the Russian foreign minister noted, both sides came to the conclusion that this is an all-European problem and it must be settled in strict accordance with the norms of the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and the generally recognized human standards. In reply to a question why Estonia does not wish to follow the Latvian way in the talks with Russia, Carl Bildt said that the situation in Estonia was more complex. However, he noted, with a goodwill [as received] from both sides it is possible to reach a compromise. At least, the conclusion of a package of agreements between Russia and Latvia may serve an example for other states. The Russian foreign minister and the Swedish premier drew attention to the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina which sharpened again. According to them, the world community should take urgent constructive measures so that the situation around the town of Brcko did not get out of control. Otherwise, it will be practically impossible to return to the peaceful development of the events there. Andrey Kozyrev and Carl Bildt believe that their working meeting in St. Petersburg was a success. They stated that similar dialogues should be continued.
