FR941216-0-00064 FR941216-0-00015 39 CFR Part 111 Domestic Mail Manual Revisions to Implement Changes in Postal Rates and Fees AGENCY: Postal Service. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: As announced elsewhere in today's Federal Register , new domestic postal rates and fees will take effect on January 1, 1995. Implementing standards for these rate and fee changes have been developed and are set forth below. Although they are to take effect on January 1, 1995, comments on these standards are solicited, and any proposed changes will be considered and acted upon as appropriate. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 1, 1995. ADDRESSES: Mail or deliver written comments to the Manager, Mailing Standards, USPS Headquarters, 475 L'Enfant Plaza SW., Washington, DC 20260&hyph;2419. Copies of all written comments will be available for inspection and photocopying between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, in Room 5610 at the above address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Leo F. Raymond, (202) 268&hyph;5199. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On December 12, 1994, the Governors of the Postal Service allowed the changes in rates and fees contained in the Opinion and Recommended Decision of the Postal Rate Commission in Docket No. R94&hyph;1 to take effect under protest. The Board of Governors ordered these changes into effect at 12:01 a.m. on January 1, 1995. More information about Docket No. R94&hyph;1 and the process that produced the Governors' action is contained in the notice mentioned above, published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register . Accordingly, the Postal Service has amended its Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) standards to incorporate these revised rates and fees. A complete revision to DMM Module R, Rates and Fees, appears below, and will be included in DMM Issue 48, to be published in early 1995. Since Docket No. R94&hyph;1 did not include changes in mail classification or in the content (other than the monetary value) or structure of postage rates and fees, no other DMM revisions are necessary to implement the Governors' decision. The Postal Service has also amended its domestic mailing statements to reflect the revised rates for postage; a complete set of those forms follows the DMM revision. Nonsubstantive format changes have also been made at this time, primarily to accommodate inclusion of a Centralized Trust Accounting System (CTAS) identification number on permit imprint mailing (&hyph;N and &hyph;R suffix) statements and to amend how postage is reported for postage affixed mailing (&hyph;PC suffix) statements. The revised DMM standards, a revised Notice 123, Ratefold, the revised domestic mailing statements, and miscellaneous implementation instructions for postal employees will be contained in a special Postal Bulletin being issued in the near future. In addition to copies prepared for standard distribution to postal employees and public subscribers, bulk quantities of the special Postal Bulletin are being provided to most post offices. Production and distribution of the special Postal Bulletin and the revised mailing statements began immediately following the Governors' action to implement revised domestic rates, so copies of these documents should become available in late December or early January. While each receiving postal facility will determine and manage redistribution of the special Postal Bulletin, interested customers may contact the manager, business mail entry, for the district in which they are located. (A list of these persons and the ZIP Code areas they service is contained in DMM G042.) Until the new mailing statements are available, the current versions may be used with appropriate amendments, or the illustrations of the revised forms (published in the special Postal Bulletin) may be photocopied and completed. List of Subjects in 39 CFR Part 111 Postal Service. For the reasons discussed above, the Postal Service hereby adopts the following amendments to the Domestic Mail Manual, which is incorporated by reference in the Code of Federal Regulations (see 39 CFR part 111).
