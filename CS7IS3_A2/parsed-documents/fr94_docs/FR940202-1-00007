FR940202-1-00007 FR940202-1-00003 The FAA recognizes that the proposed modification would require a large number of work hours to accomplish. However, the 5-year compliance time specified in paragraph (d) of this proposed AD should allow ample time for the synch-lock installation to be accomplished coincidentally with scheduled major airplane inspection and maintenance activities, thereby minimizing the costs associated with special airplane scheduling. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1.

To ensure the integrity of the fail safe features of the thrust reverser system, accomplish the following: Restatement of Actions Required by AD 92&hyph;03&hyph;03: (a) For airplanes equipped with Pratt and Whitney JT9D&hyph;7R4 series engines: Within 60 days after the effective date of this AD, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 3,000 flight hours, perform the tests, inspections, and adjustments described in Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;78&hyph;0054, dated December 13, 1991. (1) Following any maintenance action that could affect the thrust reverser system: Repeat the tests, inspections, and adjustments required by paragraph (a) of this AD on the affected engine, prior to further flight, in accordance with the service bulletin. (2) Thereafter, following any maintenance action, continue to perform the repetitive tests, inspections, and adjustments required by paragraph (a) of this AD on the affected engine at intervals not to exceed 3,000 flight hours. (b) For airplanes equipped with General Electric CF6&hyph;80A series engines: Within 60 days after the effective date of this AD, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 3,000 flight hours, perform the tests, inspections, and adjustments described in Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;78&hyph;0053, dated December 13, 1991.

(2) Thereafter, following any maintenance action, continue to perform the repetitive tests, inspections, and adjustments required by paragraph (b) of this AD on the affected engine at intervals not to exceed 3,000 flight hours. (c) If any test, inspection, and/or adjustment required by paragraph (a) or (b) of this AD cannot be successfully performed, or if any test, inspection, and/or adjustment results in findings that are unacceptable in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;78&hyph;0054, dated December 13, 1991, or Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;78&hyph;0053, dated December 13, 1991, as applicable, accomplish paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this AD.

No more than one thrust reverser on any airplane may be deactivated under the provisions of this paragraph. (2) Within 10 days after deactivation of any thrust reverser in accordance with this paragraph, the thrust reverser must be repaired in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;78&hyph;0054, dated December 13, 1991, or Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;78&hyph;0053, dated December 13, 1991, as applicable; the tests and/or inspections required by paragraph (a) or (b) of this AD must be successfully accomplished; and the thrust reverser must then be reactivated.
