In a commentary, NUB spokesman Kim Yong-ki recalled that the ROK Government has already made clear its position that holding a national meeting on 15 August is not at all conducive to the solution to the nuclear issue and to the improvement in the South- North relations. He emphasized that if North Korea really takes the nation into consideration, it should show all sincerity in solving the nuclear issue.
