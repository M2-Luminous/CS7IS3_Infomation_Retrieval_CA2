FR940503-2-00031 FR940503-2-00028 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Finding of No Significant Impact for the Urgent-Relief Acceptance of Foreign Research Reactor Spent Nuclear Fuel AGENCY: United States Department of Energy (DOE). ACTION: Finding of no significant impact. SUMMARY: In compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., the Council on Environmental Quality's implementing regulations, 40 CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508, DOE's implementing procedures, 10 CFR part 1021, and Executive Order 12114, Environmental Effects Abroad of Major Federal Actions, the DOE has prepared an Environmental Assessment (DOE/EA&hyph;0912, April 1994) to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of the proposed urgent-relief acceptance of foreign research reactor spent nuclear fuel. The Environmental Assessment analyzed the potential environmental impacts under the proposed action of accepting up to 409 spent nuclear fuel elements from eight reactors in Europe for storage in an existing DOE wet storage facility to meet the urgent needs of certain foreign research reactor operators and to avoid failure of a key United States nuclear weapons nonproliferation objective of minimizing and eventually eliminating the use of highly enriched uranium in civil programs worldwide. Specifically, the Environmental Assessment analyzed the potential impacts of transporting the spent nuclear fuel elements by commercial or chartered vessel from eight reactors in Europe to any one of five ports of entry in the United States (Wilmington, North Carolina; the Army Military Ocean Terminal at Sunny Point, North Carolina; Charleston, South Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; and Jacksonville, Florida), off-loading the spent fuel at the port of entry and transporting it by truck or rail to the Savannah River Site, near Aiken, South Carolina; and storing the spent fuel there until decisions are made regarding interim storage and ultimate disposition. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act authorizes ultimate disposal of the spent fuel in a geologic repository. In October 1993, DOE provided a draft Environmental Assessment for comment to the States of Georgia and South Carolina, and the Commonwealth of Virginia, and interested individuals and organizations. In February 1994, DOE provided a revised draft Environmental Assessment to the States of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and to individuals and groups known to have an interest in the proposed action, and requested that comments on the draft Environmental Assessment be submitted by March 7, 1994. On February 10, 1994, Federal, State and local government representatives, citizen groups, individuals and members of the international community attended a meeting in Washington, DC, to present their views concerning the proposed action. DOE also held public meetings in communities potentially affected by the proposed acceptance of foreign research reactor spent fuel. On March 18, 1994, the comment period on the draft Environmental Assessment was extended until April 8, 1994, to provide an additional opportunity for stakeholders to provide comments. The Environmental Assessment has been revised, where appropriate, to reflect comments received during the comment period.
