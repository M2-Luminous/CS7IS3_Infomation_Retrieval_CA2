FBIS4-555 "drafr071_a_94023" FBIS-AFR-94-071 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Zaire Opposition Coalition Expels UDI for `Betrayal' Opposition Coalition Expels UDI for `Betrayal' AB0804114594 London BBC World Service in English 1705 GMT 7 Apr 94 AB0804114594 London BBC World Service English BFN [From the "Focus on Africa" program] [Text] It will appear that the Zairian opposition Sacred Union is not as rock solid as it used to be. One of the parties in the coalition has been kicked out and it is partly over the leadership of Etienne Tshisekedi who is locked in a struggle with President Mobutu over who should be Zaire's prime minister. From Kinshasa, (Makele Urung) telexed this report: After a meeting that stretched late into the night, the Sacred Union general assembly delivered its chilling verdict. The centrist Union of Independent Democrats, UDI, supported largely by businessmen and technocrats, was no longer part of the opposition coalition. The party was accused of betraying the spirit of the national conference and of violating the principles of the Sacred Union alliance. The expulsion was clearly an attempt by hardliners within the alliance to discipline the troops for daring to challenge the claim of opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi to the post of prime minister. In this regard the UDI is accused of having made two mistakes. First, it did not join a mass opposition walkout in Parliament last week in protest against the adoption of a constitutional article which allowed candidates other than Etienne Tshisekedi to stand for the premiership. The UDI then added insult to injury by helping to launch the URD [Union for the Republic and Democracy], which is an opposition subplatform widely seen as a challenge to Tshisekedi's authority. Tshisekedi supporters have other strong reasons to suspect the UDI. The party's leading light, Kengo wa Dondo, is being tipped as a potential prime minister if in the end Tshisekedi agrees to step down. Already the opposition press has launched a bitter campaign against Kengo who is the son of a Polish father and a Rwandan mother. The press says he is not a true Zairian and therefore he's not suitable for the post of prime minister.
