These reports state that two Libyan officers and a third person left for Jordan following the failure of this attempt and contacted the U.S. Embassy in Amman. The two officers escaped across Libya's borders with a neighboring country on their way to Amman where they were joined by a civilian who was outside Libya when the detentions that followed the failed attempt were carried out. Two of the escapees belong to the al-Wa'ir clan, one of the most influential clans in the Libyan Warfalah tribe. Libya demanded that the two officers be handed over, but the Jordanian authorities informed it that they were not in Amman. Actually, they had been transferred to a U.S. base in Germany where they were subjected to intense interrogation by U.S. agencies before being allowed to contact their friends in the Libyan opposition. Libya, however, has denied any connection with the assassination of the Jordanian diplomat and has described reports linking it with the incident as an attempt to undermine its relations with Jordan.
