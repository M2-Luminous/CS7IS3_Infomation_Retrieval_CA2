He made the statement Tuesday at the opening of the session of the new parliament elected on 7 March. Addressing deputies, the president said that Kazakhstan has for the first time a professional parliament. He expressed hope that all branches of power would cooperate constructively. Nazarbayev favored the need for further constitutional transformations, including the restructuring of parliament into a two-house one, granting it right to impeach the president and granting the prime minister the right to dissolve the legislature. Earlier the head of state met a large group of deputies. The president's spokesman, Nurlan Danenov, told Interfax that deputies and the president have similar stands on many points. Nazarbayev favored at the meeting the introduction of private property and the equality by law of those nations living in the Republic. The institute of strategic studies under the president published in an Alma-Ata [Almaty] newspaper an analytical forecast of the future new parliament. It says that the parliament may work before the presidential elections of 1996 or more if pro-government deputies close their ranks, form a large faction and will successfully confront the opposition. Analysts believe that pro-government deputies ("People's Unity of Kazakhstan" Union, leader--Nazarbayev, deputies elected on the ticket offered by the president, and leader of bodies of power) may agree to concessions to the opposition. Presidential experts also forecast that if the pro-government faction is not formed, part of the deputies, if pressurized by the opposition in adopting laws, may leave the parliament. If so, a question could be raised about early elections.
