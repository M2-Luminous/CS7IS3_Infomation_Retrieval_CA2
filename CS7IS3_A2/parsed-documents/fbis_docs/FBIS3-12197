In a statement to AL-JUMHURIYAH published today, 'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur said that this outrageous massacre shows the impossibility of coexistence between the Palestinian Arab people and the Zionists who usurped their land. The NPPF secretary general called on the political forces and parties and human rights committees in the Arab homeland and the world to denounce and condemn this crime which the Zionist enemy would not have dared to perpetrate without the colonialist U.S. collusion with the Zionist enemy, and the continued U.S. support to enable it to carry out aggressions against the Palestine question, people, and civilization. 'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur hailed the glorious sacrifices of the Palestinian Arab people, and expressed pride in the righteous martyrs and victims of the criminal act which was perpetrated by the Zionists against Palestinian worshipers at the Ibrahimi Mosque in the blessed month of Ramadan. He noted that the escalation of the intifadah in the occupied Arab territories and the Palestinian people's continued confrontation of the colonialist Zionist schemes inside and outside the occupied territories constitute the only way to achieve the Palestinian people's national and inalienable objectives, and not the capitulatory framework in which the Zionists and colonialists have found their defeated dreams of entrenching their occupation of Palestine. Concluding his statement, the NPPF secretary general stressed the support of Iraq, the NPPF parties, and the Iraqi people, under the leadership of President Saddam Husayn for the Palestinian Arab people's struggle to restore their national inalienable rights in their homeland.
