U.S. State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said the expulsion of a Russian resident from the United States on Friday [25 February] was entirely justified. He was referring to the the espionage case of former CIA counter- intelligence officer Aldrich Ames, who the U.S. alleges had been a long-term underground member of the Russian intelligence service. "By contrast," McCurry said, "the expulsion of the U.S. diplomat from Moscow is purely an act of unjustified retaliation." He reiterated that Washington reserves the right to take further action if there are others implicated in connection with the case of Ames, who was allegedly paid more than 1.5 million dollars for collecting vital CIA operational and personnel information for Moscow. "We will continue to assess, as that investigation and prosecution develops, what further measures might be necessary," McCurry added.
