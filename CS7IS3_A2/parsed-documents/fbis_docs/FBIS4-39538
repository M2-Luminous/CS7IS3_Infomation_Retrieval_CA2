Approximately 40 Kyrgyz entrepreneurs and leaders of various firms and companies flew into Brussels and then into Paris from Bishkek in the presidential aircraft along with 10 officials. While the president was engaged in big-league politics, they insistently sought partners and tried to set up business contacts and to sign contracts. The matter hardly got as far as contracts, however, although Akayev did bring the "new Kyrgyz" with him to no avail. In my view, he needed these fellow travelers for propaganda purposes above all. He wanted to show Europe the new form of the Kyrgyz economy in the flesh so as to convince it that reforms are taking place in the Republic not just in words but are giving rise to market structures and a stratum of entrepreneurs prepared to cooperate on equal terms. Of course, this is just one of the arguments. The stability of the national currency -- the som -- and the lowering of the rate of inflation, which has now stayed below the 5-percent level for more than one month, proved no less important. But the main trump card was the carefully elaborated three-year program for deepening economic reform, which has been rated highly by international experts. But the decisive assessment and, accordingly, the size of the funding had to be determined by a meeting of the World Bank's Consultative Group on Kyrgyzia, where the program was defended by Akayev himself. According to preliminary estimates by Kyrgyz specialists, if that defense succeeded, the delegation could have collected $350-$400 million from various sources of funding. The result exceeded expectations. The preferential credits, investments, and free aid allocated totaled $550 million for the coming conventional fiscal year (it begins 1 July, so Kyrgyzia managed to enroll almost at the last moment). Participating in the meeting, in addition to the organizer, were representatives of the IMF, the European Bank for Reconstruction, and Development, the Asian Bank, the Islamic Bank, and a number of other organizations and donor countries. The participants' contributions differ in size and terms. A sizable proportion of the credits, for example, has been allocated for 40 years with a 10-year deferment and at an almost symbolic interest rate. In order to successfully realize the funds allocated and extend the reforms' funding, serious projects for cooperation with foreign firms are needed. A whole package of agreements in this regard was signed in Belgium and France. Kyrgyzia's proposals elicited considerable interest among businessmen here. In particular, it is proposed to jointly work deposits of nonferrous metals, to extract rare-earth elements and bauxites, to deliver wool and cotton, to produce telecommunications equipment, to produce uranium, to process agricultural produce.... In general, emphasis is placed on setting up joint ventures in Kyrgyzia, which would like to become a supplier of all sorts of output to Central Asian countries. "We are virtually on the Great Silk Road," Akayev remarked, "and this is a very convenient position for winning a market in a vast region." But Kyrgyzia clearly will not be able to exploit this opportunity by relying only on its own efforts, and so it is opening the door wide to cooperation. Of course, potential partners need reliable guarantees. Many are still scared off by political and economic instability in the region. Agreements on mutual protection for investments are one such guarantee. Another, in Akayev's opinion, is the fact that Kyrgyzia has joined the "Partnership for Peace" program, which happened at NATO headquarters in Brussels. Will Kyrgyzia's participation in the "Partnership for Peace" program not complicate its relations with Russia, which, as is known, takes a special, complex approach to this NATO initiative? This question hovered persistently in the background at the ceremony at NATO headquarters and was asked at the final news conference. S. Balanzino, deputy and temporary acting secretary general of NATO, at once specified that it was a question not of any terms advanced by Russia but of the parameters of its participation in the program, which are still under discussion. Askar Akayev supported that wording and declared that he voices full solidarity with the position of Russia, which, in his opinion, must participate in the program on different parameters to, let us say, Kyrgyzia or any other CIS country. Only in this case, he said, will the program play a role in ensuring peace and security in the CIS. As for Kyrgyzia, according to Akayev, it is now reckoning on certain material support from NATO, above all, in conversion. In his opinion, the possibility of consulting and cooperating with NATO countries in the event of a threat to the Republic's territorial integrity will be important.
