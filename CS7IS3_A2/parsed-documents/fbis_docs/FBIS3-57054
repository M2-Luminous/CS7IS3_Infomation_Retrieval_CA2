In This Struggle It Remains Unclear at Present Who Will Be Able To Break the Ural Range"] [Text] Yekaterinburg -- Many local analysts regard the change of governor in Sverdlovsk Oblast as a victory for one commercial and industrial clan over another. The 14 January announcement that the oblast's former government was resigning en masse was no coincidence. Yeltsin's decision to dismiss Rossel is thereby disputed. The conclusion: The Ural lobby is heterogeneous, and a new breed of politicians have emerged who can dictate their will not only in the government but also to the president himself. The working career of Aleksey Strakhov, the oblast's new governor who has replaced Eduard Rossel, is quite standard: student construction detachments; the territorial administration of the State Committee for Material and Technical Supply; Yekaterinburg City Hall. Recently he preferred to be the first deputy, in other words to control the essence of things while staying in the shadows. The rapid finish by the "gray horse" came as a complete surprise to the oblast's population.... Such a "demarche" by Yeltsin also came as a surprise to Eduard Rossel, who believed that the writing and publication of the constitution of the Ural Republic gave unlimited power to him and to those close to business circles. Yes, Rossel's protectionism with regard to firms such as "Inter-Ural" (90 percent of copper exports) and "Ural-Titan" (32 percent of all the world's titanium) gave Eduard Ergartovich the right to consider that he was de facto both the export-industrial leader and the political leader of the Urals. The draft constitution of the Ural Republic assigned to him his own security council, his own militia, his own court, his own banking support, his own foreign economic relations department.... That is, Eduard Rossel was becoming Akinfiy Demidov [18th-century industrialist] under the living Peter.... But, if you recall, Peter I sent Captain Tatishchev to found Yekaterinburg (to counteract the mayhem of the Demidovs). Now, 271 years after the Demidovs' dominion in the Urals, history has repeated itself. It seems that the former governor did not attach great significance to Yekaterinburg City Hall's attempts to win back its agreed rights. Meanwhile, Yekaterinburg's industry, real estate, and advertising space are worth many firms blessed by Rossel. Yekaterinburg's struggle against the arrogance of the oblast authorities began long ago. I believe that Arkadiy Chernetskiy and Aleksey Strakhov, first deputy head of Yekaterinburg, absolutely disliked the idea of the Ural Republic, in which they could remain "responsible for the capital's sewers." A huge proportion of the oblast center's real estate, including that leased by foreign consulates, would then have become the republic's property. Now the entire government of Sverdlovsk Oblast is following Rossel in resigning! Yeltsin is being given to understand that, along with Rossel, he "dismissed" those who had been responsible for finances, transport, health care, and trade in the oblast ever since Boris Nikolayevich was first secretary here, in the Urals. Today it is stupid not to admit that the oblast lived thanks to these officials' years-long experience and colossal connections! The president's circles believed that an opposition to the old industrial-monopoly and commercial clan would come into being in Yekaterinburg thanks to Strakhov's promotion. Such a struggle is better than one between the region and the center. Boris Nikolayevich is now getting -- in the person of Rossel and his business circles -- not only a sovereign-economic opposition but also a tough political one. It is paradoxical but, having previously overcome the Moscow lobby, Yeltsin came right up against the Ural lobby. Evidently, he must understand that this will be the case with every territory where "loyal colleagues and friends" remain. Within a matter of days Eduard Rossel created the "Ural Transformation" nonparty sociopolitical association to nominate its candidacy for the Federation Council. Rossel is cunning when he calls his association a "nonparty" one. He simply did not want to associate his name with the Party of Consolidation, whose representative is Aleksandr Tikhonov, leader of the "Inter-Ural" Joint Venture. Precisely this party elaborated the new "Regional Development Concept," and it has the backing of the "Industrial Union" with the aggrieved military-industrial complex. "Ural Transformation" can be nonparty only in the sense of the treasury ruble's transformation into the nontreasury dollar.... The fight to the death is continuing. I believe that Sverdlovsk Oblast's old government will flow into the new commercial structures and substructures of Rossel's business circle. Strakhov will have a hard time. The monopoly will endeavor to leave him in the role of the oblast's chief supplier, for they never lived in the age of competition and will never tolerate it! In the Federation Council Rossel will promote the principle of Russia's territorial division as a counterweight to national-territorial division and might become a Russian national hero. What will the nonparty Yeltsin do in this situation?
