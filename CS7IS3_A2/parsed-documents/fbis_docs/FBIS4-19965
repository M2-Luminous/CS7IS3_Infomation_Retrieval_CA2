U.S. President Bill Clinton seems to have finally brought himself to push this through NATO. No matter how much Bill Clinton rejects this, Bosnia is becoming a touchstone for his leadership abilities. The situation in the former Yugoslavia is extremely complicated and risky. However, it is the job of the U.S. President to take resolute action and risks if necessary. The Clinton Administration has given way to local chiefs of bandits in Haiti and Somalia. If it does not cope with the Bosnian Serbs -- even if it were to withdraw while giving weapons to the Muslims -- the judgment on its competence will be passed.
