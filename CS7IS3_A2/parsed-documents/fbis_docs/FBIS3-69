Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-28MAR94-CHINA NPC Work Report Reflects Difficulty in Reform Implementation SUMMARY The Government Work Report delivered by Premier Li Peng at the recent National People's Congress (NPC) in Beijing indicates that despite the resolve of party reformers to push ahead with senior leader Deng Xiaoping's new wave of market reforms they have yet to make significant progress in some of the most difficult areas of the reform agenda--price, investment, and enterprise reform. Although party reformers appear to retain the edge in pushing forward Deng's reform agenda, they will be hard pressed to find solutions to China's current economic problems that do not conflict with market principles and that will deflect political pressure coming from Deng's hardline opponents. END SUMMARY Delivered by Li on 10 March, the work report sought to portray Beijing as moving ahead on the far-reaching market reforms prescribed by the authoritative decision of the Third Plenum last November. Calling 1994 a year in which the Chinese economy has "continued to maintain its growth momentum" and an "important" year to "press ahead with reform," the report reaffirmed the course of comprehensive market reform charted by the plenum as the "general blueprint" and "program for action" for creating a "socialist market economic structure" (Beijing radio, 10 March). It went on to claim that fiscal and tax reforms, as well as reforms in investment, finance and foreign trade, had "in the main been promulgated" and are "proceeding quite smoothly." Modest Progress in Financial Reform In an apparent effort to demonstrate concrete progress in fulfilling some goals of the plenum, the work report emphasized recent changes in the method of financing the deficit--a first step toward transforming the People's Bank of China (PBOC) into an independent central bank along Western lines--and further reforms of the fiscal and tax systems that reduce the burdensome fiscal and welfare obligations of state enterprises. For example, the report declared that the government "will solve its deficit this year by issuing state bonds," giving "favorable treatment" to those who purchase them, and "will no longer make overdrafts from banks." Suggesting that reformers are already moving ahead in this area, a 10 March report in Zhongguo Tongxun She, a PRC-affiliated Hong Kong-based wire service, claimed that the PBOC recently refused a loan to the Ministry of Finance to clear the national debt. It went on to quote Politburo Standing Committee member and PBOC head Zhu Rongji as saying that "no bank should be treated as a teller or an accountant for the government." The work report also highlighted fiscal and tax reforms that were introduced after the plenum to ease the market transition of state enterprises by reducing their enormous financial and welfare burden. Echoing media commentary on tax reforms promulgated in January, the report declared that "beginning this year" the State Council will exempt state enterprises from taxes levied to finance energy and infrastructure projects and from the "budget regulatory fund." According to Jingji Ribao on 4 January, these financial obligations have accounted for 25 percent of enterprises' after-tax profits. The work report also pledged to "actively advance" social security reform, both to "ease the burden" of "social welfare projects" such as medical care and housing and to enable enterprises to "compete in the market on an equal footing." Suggesting that the government will exert greater pressure on unprofitable enterprises, the report announced that a "special fund" will be established to "consolidate bankrupt enterprises" and "reset tIe their workers." Slow Movement on Price, Investment Reform Despite these efforts to demonstrate progress in some aspects of the agenda pushed forward by the reformers, the report indicated that at least for now they have backed away from such controversial and potentially destabilizing proposals as price and investment reform. Apparently reflecting leadership concern over mounting inflationary pressures, the report took a considerably more cautious approach to price reform than the plenum last fall. It pledged simply to "appropriately adjust"- -that is, to increase by administrative fiat--the prices of grain, cotton, and energy "this year," a move that stands in sharp contrast to the plenum decision's statements on price reform. The decision stated that the "main tasks" in price reform are to further "decontrol the prices of competitive commodities and services" while "adjusting government-set prices" for only "some" prices and to "establish a mechanism in which prices are set mainly by the market." The decision also called for other price reform measures not reiterated in the NPC report, such as "abolishing the double-track price system for capital goods as quickly as possible" and "accelerating the marketization of the prices of production factors." Underscoring the leadership's concern that removing price controls now might spark social unrest, the report went on to warn that in carrying out price reform, officials must "consider the ability of enterprises and the masses to cope with the consequences" of reform. In an apparent reference to the sharp rise in grain and edible oil prices occurring late last year in major urban centers, the report pointed out that "special attention" must be paid to "controlling increases" in the prices of "basic consumer products" and services that are "closely related to the masses' daily lives." Similarly alluding to leadership worries over social discontent arising from the effects of price reform and fast growth, the report, and Renmin Ribao editorials on the NPC on 13 and 18 March, reiterated media slogans carried in PRC media since the first of the year warning that the push for "reform and development" must be balanced against the need for "social and political stability." The report also indicated that the leadership has backed away from the plenum's commitment to market-based reforms in the investment system, at least in the short term, falling back on traditional socialist measures to rein in what it said was the current "reckless" investment in capital construction projects. Although giving a nod to market-based principles that restrain irrational enterprise investment--a major component of the plenum-approved reforms--the report made clear that for now the leadership will rely primarily on efforts to fine tune the existing state bureaucracy to curb excessive and unprofitable capital expenditure. "This year," it said, investment reform will focus "mainly" on the establishment of a "National Development Bank"--one of several socialist style "policy- lending" banks mandated by the plenum to fund "major state construction projects according to a unified plan." The bank, it explained, will "provide a steady source" of investment funds and "check inflation and investment expansion through the balancing of capital." Similarly, the report reflected continued leadership reliance on administrative fiat to curb current investment excesses, falling far short of far-reaching plenum guidelines on investment outside the state planning sector. The plenum decision had stated that "competitive project investment" should be "decided by enterprises themselves" on the premise that they "bear any risk involved" and had called for the establishment "commercial banks" that would provide credit for such investment and would "assume sole responsibility for profits and losses." However, although the work report urged that "a [market] mechanism for restricting investment" be established by making "investors and banks responsible for investment risks," it went on to simply issue a series of administrative orders, declaring that the state "will not permit" investment capital to be derived from "diverting circulating funds or borrowing money," that new projects "must not begin before necessary funds are available," and that the state would "no longer approve the establishment of new development zones." Apparently reflecting these pressures on the leadership to resort to administrative measures to stem economic overheating, the government has already taken several steps to control inflation and excessive investment. A 1 March Renmin Ribao commentator's article stating that the State Planning Commission had promulgated new regulations to prevent price gouging was followed by the announcement of a nationwide "price inspection" to be carried out in March to "ease inflationary pressure" (China Daily, 8 March). Earlier in the year, during a financial work conference in January, Zhu Rongji also unveiled policies that impose strict limits on credit and investment (Xinhua, 19 January). Difficulty in Enterprise Reform Most likely reflecting these and other obstacles to more rapid reform, the work report implied that progress toward the enormously complex plenum goal of restructuring state enterprises into quasi-public corporations based on various types of share holding arrangements has not met reformers' expectations. Although pledging to "experiment" with new forms of enterprise organization as required by the plenum, the report echoed the cautious tone of Li Peng's remarks to a national economic work conference held shortly after the plenum (Xinhua, 1 December 1993), reiterating Li's observation that enterprise reform is "both the focus and the difficult part of reform" and emphasizing that creating a "modern enterprise system" is "complicated work." Suggesting that the leadership has not reached a consensus on the specifics of the new enterprise structure, PRC media since the plenum have carried a steady stream of articles advocating a variety of positions on share holding, managing state assets, leasing, and related issues. Implications The NPC work report's reaffirmation of the ambitious market-based reform goals approved by the Central Committee's November plenum suggests that party reformers retain the political edge in pushing forward senior leader Deng Xiaoping's aggressive policy agenda. At the same time, the report also indicates that the reformers have made little concrete progress in implementing this agenda and have resorted to traditional administrative means rather than market-based methods to control economic overheating. Inflation, unrestrained investment, and other potentially destabilizing consequences of the reform drive have again put the brakes on the pace of change and no doubt have given party hardliners an opportunity to challenge Deng's authority and restrict the pace and scope of his program. Although pressures to create a more stable and productive economic system through fundamental market reform still appear to favor the reformers' position, they will be hard pressed to find solutions to China's current economic and social problems that are consistent with marketizing the economy and that will undercut criticism from Deng's conservative rivals.
