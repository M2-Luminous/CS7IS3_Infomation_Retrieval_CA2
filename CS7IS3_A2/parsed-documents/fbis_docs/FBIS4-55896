Silajdzic, in a television interview Sunday, questioned the UN's credibility saying that "in terms of Gorazde, where everything had started off well with a NATO ultimatum, these UN measures were successful in delaying everything to the point where it has practically become a joke. If they are not capable of doing something in Gorazde, how could they on a larger scale," he said, adding that as a result the Bosnian government would cautiously enter into the next round of negotiations.
