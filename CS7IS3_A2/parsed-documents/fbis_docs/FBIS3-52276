They managed to cross what the enemy and its agents call the border strip in southern Lebanon as well as the enemy's security fences. They arrived in northern Palestine and the Dan area and clashed with a mechanized military patrol in Upper Galilee in a heroic and daring operation that continued from 0300 to 0430 on 30 December 1993. They destroyed an enemy military vehicle, killing or wounding some of its occupants. This forced the enemy to use a large number of its troops as well as airborne paratroopers in the operation. The statement issued by the Fatah Movement, the General Command of the al-'Asifah Forces, added: The enemy has admitted that the operation took place, acknowledged that it suffered some casualties, and attempted to minimize its losses, as usual. However, it has repeatedly said through its news media that it is the first operation of its kind for a long time in which our heroes have managed to breach the Zionist entity's security fences. During the heroic clash with the enemy, three fedayeen were martyred. They are the following: Patrol commander heroic martyr Lieutenant Ahmad Amin Qa'qur, born in 1971, Amman, he hailed from Tarqumiyah, Hebron; heroic martyr 1st Sergeant Ashraf Hammad Mansur, born in 1970, Dar'a, he hailed from Beersheba; and heroic martyr 1st Sergeant Ahmad Rafiq al-Mallah, born in 1973, Nahr al-Barid, he hailed from 'Illar, Tulkarm.
