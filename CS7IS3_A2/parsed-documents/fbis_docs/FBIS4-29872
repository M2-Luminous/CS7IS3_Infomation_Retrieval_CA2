FBIS4-29872 "dreas120_a_94013" FBIS-EAS-94-120 Daily Report 22 Jun 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Hata: Yen's Rise Caused by `Speculative Buying' Hata: Yen's Rise Caused by `Speculative Buying' OW2206033794 Tokyo KYODO in English 0306 GMT 22 Jun 94 OW2206033794 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said Wednesday that the yen's sharp rise against the U.S. dollar stemmed from speculative buying. "The yen's appreciation is speculative," the premier told reporters in the Diet building and predicted the speculative mood will not last long. Hata called an emergency meeting of key cabinet ministers at noon on Tuesday to exchange views on the Japanese currency's surge. Attending the meeting were Hata, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, Economic Planning Agency Director General Yoshio Terasawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai. "I think it's important for the cabinet to grasp the situation properly," Kumagai told a news conference. The top government spokesman said the government should take necessary measures to spur domestic demand and boost the nation's sluggish economy so as to stem the yen's rise against the dollar. The dollar opened at a postwar low of 100.35 yen in Tokyo on Wednesday, down 1.80 yen from Tuesday's closing rate of 102.15 yen. The dollar's opening plunge against the yen followed its overnight nosedive in New York, where the currency temporarily hit a postwar low of 99.85-95 yen on reports of a widened U.S. trade deficit for April. The dollar's previous global low was 100.40 yen recorded in Tokyo on Aug. 17, 1993. The U.S. currency ended New York trading at 100.10-20 yen, regaining the 100 yen level on technical buying amid fears of central bank intervention.
