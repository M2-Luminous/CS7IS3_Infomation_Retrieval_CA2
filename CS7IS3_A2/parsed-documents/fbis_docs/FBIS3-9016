[Gembicky] Mr. Moravcik, the coalition method of government is demanding because various political entities will directly influence it or will enter into it. Some of the parties -- mainly the centrist ones -- do not yet have clear-cut policies, which may make things difficult for the future prime minister, not only in seeking a compromise but also in ensuring that the cabinet functions efficiently as a unit. In this context, some experts are wondering whether the new government will be able to function as a compact unit or whether it will be divided department by department in accordance with the strength of the political parties, movements, and factions that entered into it. In your opinion, what would be the most effective way of reducing this handicap? [Moravcik] We have to place emphasis on forming a collective that is mutually compact. That means that we are not attaching importance to allegiance to individual parties and groupings but to ensuring that a homogeneous collective is formed, which would provide a guarantee that not only the real obstacles but also the diverse points of view will be overcome, that there will be unity, and that compromises will be sought. [Gembicky] What mechanism for a coalition agreement among the ruling entities have you decided to embrace? [Moravcik] The basis for this coalition mechanism is and will be consensus. I firmly believe -- and up to now we have always succeeded -- that we will achieve a consensus, although it seems rather unusual. However, it has a very important side effect. It will help to unite the very divergent or disunited entities on our political scene. That is extraordinarily important for Slovakia at the moment. If we succeed, we can lay the foundations for a new political culture, which would be a good sign for Slovakia's political future. [Gembicky] What positive activities undertaken by the previous cabinet would you like to follow up on, what would you like to improve, and what would you like radically to change? [Moravcik] In my opinion, what was positive about the previous cabinet was its industriousness and assiduousness. We would like to inherit these qualities. However, they should not be undermined by the lack of a concept. That means that we should see to it that a firm line is established and that stress is laid on its execution. We would definitely like to improve this. [Gembicky] Following your naming as prime minister-designate, you emphasized economic recovery as a priority for making your government's activity more efficient. How will that be projected into the mechanism for the functioning of the government and for the considerable personnel changes in the crucial economic departments? [Moravcik] The team of economic ministers will actually be completed in the next few hours. Those negotiations are the most demanding because we all feel that the composition of the team is the pivotal point of the entire strategy from which the new government wants to proceed and that it wants to present to the parliament in April in its policy statement. For that reason, the negotiations have not yet been completed and, in this sphere, we are much more interested in the expertise than the political allegiance of the candidates for the ministerial posts. [Gembicky] Do you consider it essential -- and you personally, Mr. Moravcik -- for your government to be only a temporary one or would it not bother you if it were in office until the end of this electoral term? [Moravcik] We will keep to the generally accepted political agreement. The concept for the new government's work is based on this and, according to it, elections must be held this fall at the latest. We have sufficient means for pushing for elections at the end of September or the beginning of October. This is, in our view, the optimum date and we want to do everything to ensure that it is adhered to. [Gembicky] How do you view effective cooperation within the trio of the most senior constitutional officials -- the president, the National Council of the Slovak Republic [NRSR] chairman, and the prime minister? [Moravcik] Regular meetings and an in-depth discussion on the most important issues before a decision is made is the basis for good cooperation. I think it could be a fundamental course of action that would guarantee the harmonization of cooperation and collaboration among the representatives of the aforementioned most senior constitutional institutions. [Gembicky] On the basis of a political decision, however, the outgoing government refused to administer the affairs of the individual departments until a new government is appointed. What if NRSR Chairman Ivan Gasparovic, for instance, were to be governed by the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia's [HZDS] new political decisions and were to refuse to take part or if, as the case may be, he were to make effective cooperation in the president-parliamentary chairman-prime minister triumvirate difficult? [Moravcik] At the moment, we are proceeding from the view held by those of us participating in the formation of the new government that as far as the National Council chairman is concerned, it is necessary to respect the fact that the HZDS has the strongest deputies' club. Therefore, we also intend to accept the fact that the chairman of the Slovak parliament is also from that club. Naturally, if cooperation were to be impeded and if it were necessary to alter this informal principle, then we have sufficient means for ensuring that we alter this situation. [Gembicky] In your opinion, what kind of coordination should there be in foreign policy between the Castle, the government, and the Foreign Ministry, an area in which there have recently been, to a certain extent, glitches? [Moravcik] I think that favorable prerequisites will now be created for ensuring that cooperation among all these constitutional entities is harmonized. I am well acquainted with the situation in the Foreign Ministry. My views on foreign policy are identical -- in the fundamental principles -- with those of the president. That is, there is a fundamental prerequisite for ensuring that our cooperation runs smoothly. Incidentally, this is merely a question of maintaining the best possible mutual connections, relations, and coordination. The means for doing so are in our hands.
