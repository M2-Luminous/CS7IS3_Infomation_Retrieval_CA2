The extravagant Father Georgi Gelemenov, leader of one of the dozens of phantom parties who owes his popularity only to his scandalous statements and unexpected political turns, has declared a war on the Gypsies. Naturally, the Gypsies also declared a war on the racist-Christian Democrat. Ethnic tension in Plovdiv and other cities is increasing. Without underestimating the power of the authorities or overestimating the possibilities of the "skinheads," there is no guarantee that bloody ethnic clashes will not take place in Bulgaria in 1994. There is, however, two sides to the coin. By their inactivity in anything related to resolving the Gypsies' social problems, the state institutions are facilitating the growth of the crime rate among them and the emergence of racist moods among a part of the Bulgarian society. This is a fertile soil for the growth of political adventurists of the ilk of the aforementioned priest. One way or another, Bulgaria is not immune to the xenophobia virus. This allows other interested groups to implement their political ambitions under the noble slogan of fighting against chauvinism and racism.
