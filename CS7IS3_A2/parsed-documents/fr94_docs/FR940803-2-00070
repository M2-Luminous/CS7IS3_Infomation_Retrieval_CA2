SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public Reference Branch. Applicants' Representations 1. The Trust is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company. GFI is the investment adviser to the Trust. The Trust seeks long-term growth of capital primarily through investment in equity securities. Income is a secondary objective of the Trust. When the Trust commenced operations, it stated in its prospectus that, as a non-diversified investment company, the Trust could concentrate investments in individual issues to a greater degree than a diversified investment company. 2. The Board of Directors of the Trust has taken several steps in order to seek to reduce any discount between the trading price of the Trust's shares and the Trust's net asset value. The Board of Directors of the Trust has authorized the purchase of Trust shares in the open market whenever a discount of 10% or more exists. Additionally, the Board has adopted a ``10% payout'' policy. 1 while the Board of Directors of the Trust believes that the adoption of this policy has ameliorated the discount at which the Trust's shares trade, GFI, in managing the Trust's assets with a view toward assuring that the Trust will be able to meet its 10% payout policy on a consistent basis, has diversified the Trust's investments to a greater extent than required under the Act and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. 1 Pursuant to this policy, the Trust makes quarterly distributions of $0.25 per share following each of the first three calendar quarters of each year and an adjusting distribution in December equal to the sum of 2.5% of the net asset value of the Trust as of the last day of the four preceding calendar quarters less the aggregate distribution of $0.75 per share for the most recent calendar quarters. 3. Multimedia was incorporated on March 31, 1994 and filed a notification of registration on Form N&hyph;8A on April 8, 1994 to register under the Act as a non-diversified closed-end management investment company. Multimedia filed a registration statement under the Act on Form N&hyph;2 on July 8, 1994. The Trust owns 10,000 shares of Multimedia's common stock, constituting all the issued and outstanding shares of the common stock of Multimedia. 2 These shares were issued in respect of the Trust's contribution to Multimedia of $100,000 of initial capital. The person who currently serve as directors of the Trust are the directors of Multimedia, and the principle executive officers of the Trust hold the same officers with Multimedia. 2 Applicants received a non-action letter with respect to section 12(d)91). See The Gabelli Equity Trust, (pub. avail. April 1, 1994). 4. Multimedia's primary investment objective is long-term growth of capital. However, unlike the Trust, which attempts to achieve this objective by investing primarily in a portfolio of equity securities of companies in a wide variety of industries, Multimedia will concentrate its investments in common stock and other securities of foreign and domestic companies in telecommunications, entertainment, media, and publishing industries. 5. The Board of Directors of the Trust has approved, subject to exemptive relief and subsequent shareholder approval, the contribution of up to 10% of the Trust's net assets (but in any event not less than $60 million in order to satisfy the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange) to Multimedia. It is anticipated that the contributed assets will consist largely or exclusively of cash and short-term fixed income instruments. All the shares of the common stock of Multimedia then will be distributed by the Trust as a dividend to its shareholders at a rate of one share of Multimedia Trust common stock for every ten shares held of the Trust. The contribution of the Trust assets to Multimedia and the subsequent distribution of Multimedia shares to the Trust shareholders is referred to herein as the ``Transaction.'' Application will be made to list Multimedia's shares for trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 6. GFI will serve as investment adviser to Multimedia. The advisory fee structure for Multimedia will be the same as that approved by the Trust shareholders at the Trust's 1994 annual meeting of shareholders held on June 27, 1994. 3 3 Under the investment advisory agreement between Multimedia and GFI, GFI will manage the portfolio of Multimedia and also oversee the administration of all aspects of Multimedia's business. The investment advisory agreement will provide that Multimedia will pay GFI a fee computed weekly and paid monthly at an annual rate of 1.00% of Multimedia average weekly net assets. 7. The Board of Directors of the Trust believes that the Transaction will result in the following benefits to Trust shareholders: (a) Shareholders will receive shares of an investment company with a more concentrated portfolio and a different risk-return profile than the Trust; (b) shareholders will acquire Multimedia shares at a much lower cost than is typically the case for a newly-organized closed-end equity fund since there will be no underwriting discounts or commissions; and (c) Multimedia will distribute substantially all of its annual net income and capital gains to shareholders at year end, and consequently Multimedia may be more fully invested in equity securities than the Trust. Multimedia does not intend to adopt a dividend policy similar to the Trust's 10% payout policy. The Board of Directors believes that the benefits of the Transaction outlined above outweigh the costs of the Transaction.
