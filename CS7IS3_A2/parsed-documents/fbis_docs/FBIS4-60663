We will now go over to our political correspondent Shlomo Raz in the broadcasting van at the Ramat Aviv Hotel in Tel Aviv: [Raz] Addressing Labor's Political and Social Forum -- this time devoid of any puns -- the prime minister referred to a series of political issues on the agenda. With Jerusalem increasingly becoming the top item, it is important to hear what the prime minister had to say in view of the agreements signed with the PLO. [Begin Rabin recording] I have no doubt that there have been several phenomena in Jerusalem through the years where it would have been better if it had not taken place. I believe we will take steps to enforce what is written in the Declaration of Principles, to the effect that all the centers of government of the Palestinian Authority should be located in Jericho. That is what we both agreed to and committed ourselves to in writing, but I will not elaborate on how and when we will do that. [end recording] [Raz] The consultation summoned by the prime minister yesterday should be noted in this context. The unpublicized session summoned to discuss one issue only: how to tackle the PLO's desire to establish political facts in Jerusalem. Israel plans to tackle the issue by imposing clear-cut restrictions on the Palestinians. Another issue raised by Yitzhaq Rabin was the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. [Begin Rabin recording] The current situation in the field is reasonable. For example, if they imprisoned the Palestinian officer who would not let Brigadier General Doron Almog travel in the Gaza Strip, I think it is a good response. In view of all sorts of reports, I would like to clarify that to the best of my knowledge -- and we will yet check this thoroughly -- not even one Palestinian from the territories has joined the police force without our approval. We did not approve the return of some deportees proposed by them, and our lack of approval prevented their return. [end recording] [Raz] Rabin was referring to reports that Uri Magidish's murderers had been inducted into the Palestinian police, and he proceeded to deny these reports. The prime minister added -- and I have heard him say this more than once this week -- that the Palestinian police takes the job seriously. For example, the Palestinians stationed 70 more policemen than Israel had actually demanded at the Erez checkpoint. The prime minister disclosed that Israel would lend metal detectors to the Palestinians for the simple reason that security is important to us. The prime minister did not say even one word about Ari'el Sharon's announcement that he intends to run for the premiership. Journalists were waiting outside to get his reaction and ask him juicier questions, such as who will be the next health minister, but the prime minister would not humor them and hastened to leave the place. Earlier in his public address, the prime minister also referred to the negotiations with Syria and Syria's intransigent position. [Begin Rabin recording] Today, even in my view -- for which you are upset with me -- the gaps between Syria and us are still broad and deep. This was the situation before, and it remains unchanged. [end recording] [Raz] That is what the prime minister had to say with regard to the negotiations with Syria which are scheduled to gather momentum in two weeks, when the U.S. secretary of state arrives for yet another tour in the Middle East. The prime minister spoke about the spread of fundamentalist Islam throughout the Middle East and outside. He gave the example of Holland, where 10 years ago there was only one mosque and today there are dozens. The prime minister said he also discerned fundamentalist Islam among Israel's Arabs, but he went to great lengths to put it in the proper proportions.
