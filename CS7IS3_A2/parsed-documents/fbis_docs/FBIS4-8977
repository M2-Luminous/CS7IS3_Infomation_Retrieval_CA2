The president decided to accept it because "one does not refuse to meet organized social forces of over five or 10 persons." The president's spokesman stated that the meeting will be held today at 1700. As it seems, the subject of the meeting will be the conflict between the coalition and the Belweder. At noon, the president is supposed to meet with Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy. Commenting on the proposal of amending the Small Constitution, Lech Walesa said in an interview for the PAP press agency that he cannot underestimate an initiative that "may be a great fire. Therefore, I must sometimes, at the beginning, strike in such a way as to make everyone think." The president also said: "I will not do anything that would show that I am violating the law. I will ask the people whether the Basic Law and the political system of the country may be changed when some political group is built for two hours.... I will establish a force that will not allow this to happen, and it was in this sense that I said this force will resolve the parliament. It will be entitled to that. It is in the interest of the state and in the interest of each of us to see to it that any accidental changes in the system do not take place.... I reacted in this way in the name of responsibility for the future of the state." Asked about his reaction to the self-governmental elections ordered by the prime minister, Lech Walesa stated that Waldemar Pawlak should not have done this because the deadline for signing the electoral law is 21 April. He said that it was the first time he had to complain about the prime minister, and he points out to him that one should not act this way. The president also announced that, starting on Friday, he would go to the field, he would discuss all these issues with people, and he would persuade them to force their deputies to resolve problems well and logically. "We would like to tell the president about the intentions we have when we are resolving a dispute between the supreme authorities of the state," said SLD Spokesman Zbigniew Siemiatkowski--"a dispute that, as a consequence, may paralyze them and cause imponderable results." Siemiatkowski would not confirm that the meeting, proposed only by the SLD (the club of the Polish Peasant Party--the PSL--has not invited the president to a talk so far), proves that the SLD is carrying the burden of the conflict with the president. He also said that a meeting with the entire club does not rule out the possibility of talks in a smaller group; he did not want to discuss any conditions or limits of the compromise that the SLD is willing to reach. He stressed that there will be no preliminary conditions on which both parties would be ready to meet. According to the SLD spokesman, the prime minister had to schedule the elections for 19 June because it was the only possible date. It is unofficially evaluated in the Sejm that today's meeting proves that the parties to the conflict want to reach an agreement. This would mean that it would not be necessary to amend the Small Constitution, and the president may unblock the issue of the nomination to the vacant posts in the government. A meeting of the governing coalition was scheduled to take place on Tuesday [19 April] evening. The plans were complicated by the prolonged session of the government. Nonetheless, late in the evening, in the premises of the Office of the Council of Ministers, there was a meeting of the representatives of the coalition, including Aleksander Kwasniewski, Jozef Oleksy, and Jerzy Szmajdzinski of the SLD, as well as the PSL's Jozef Zych. Journalists did not receive any information on the subject of the talks.
