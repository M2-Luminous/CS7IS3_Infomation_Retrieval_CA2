FR940506-1-00021 FR940506-1-00010 (a) Take no action. If the Coast Guard fails to take any action, the numbers of vessels stolen and the incidence of vessel fraud involving altered HINs will continue to increase. In addition, the development of VIS requires a means for identification of each vessel and proof of vessel ownership. Use of the 19 character HIN and a COO requirement appear to be the best way to accomplish those requirements. Many of the States and many law enforcement agencies support the proposal for a 19 character HIN and NASBLA, the National Boating Safety Advisory Council (NBSAC) and the National Association of Marine Investigators (NAMI), all support Coast Guard adoption of the 19 character HIN. The Coast Guard has also received numerous complaints from owners who are unable to register their vessels because they do not have a COO. (b) Initiate a rulemaking to: (1) Amend the HIN regulations in 33 CFR part 181 to require additional information about the vessel to be reflected in the HIN and add a requirement for a check digit to aid in the prevention of fraud, thereby expanding the current HIN format from 12 to 19 characters; and (2) Require manufacturers and importers to complete a Builder's Certification. Expanding the HIN to 19 characters would provide the best means of developing a vessel identifier for VIS and help to discourage and detect alterations of HINs through inclusion of the check digit. While requiring all vessel manufacturers to provide a completed Builder's Certification would have the advantage of utilizing one form for all vessels whether documented, numbered or titled, it would prove overly burdensome to many manufacturers and importers. The Builder's Certification is designed for use by those documenting a vessel under 46 CFR part 67. Obtaining endorsements for documented vessels requires detailed information about the vessel, including the country in which the vessel and its major components were manufactured. Since a COO does not satisfy these documentation information requirements, it is not accepted as evidence of ownership for the purposes of documentation. The Builder's Certification satisfies documentation requirements, but would require information well beyond what is needed for VIS purposes and it would be overly burdensome to require manufacturers and importers to complete a Builder's Certification for every recreational vessel. The estimated reporting burden for the Builder's Certification is 30 minutes, while the estimated burden to complete the COO is five minutes. Therefore, requiring a Builder's Certification is not the preferred alternative for establishing the chain of ownership for the purposes of VIS. (c) Initiate a rulemaking to: (1) Amend the HIN regulations in 33 CFR part 181 to require additional information about the vessel to be reflected in the HIN and add a requirement for a check digit to aid in the prevention of fraud, thereby expanding the current HIN format from 12 to 19 characters; and (2) Require manufacturers and importers to provide a completed COO for each recreational vessel they manufacture or import. This is the preferred alternative. This alternative would provide VIS with the preferred 19 character HIN as well as the best method of establishing the chain of ownership for VIS purposes through the COO requirement. The COO requirement would provide all the information necessary for VIS and would take just five minutes to complete. Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small business that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). The proposed regulations will apply to the following small entities: Small manufacturers building vessels, small importers importing vessels and State issuing authorities. There are reporting requirements associated with an expanded HIN that could be more burdensome to small entities than to the larger volume manufacturers, especially in the calculation of the check digit. Eighty percent of the new recreational vessels manufactured annually are build by 20 percent of the industry. These are large companies with engineering departments that are equipped with computers and the expertise to understand and properly encode the additional characters and the check digit. The majority of the recreational vessel manufacturers, however, are small volume builders who may have a more difficult time implementing the regulations and making the necessary calculations to determine the check digit. When using simple arithmetic, those calculations may take as long as 15 minutes per vessel. The Coast Guard has developed a computer program which calculates the check digit which is available to any vessel manufacturer with a computer. The Coast Guard has also developed several work sheets to help determine the HIN for a vessel and the worksheets are also available. Therefore, preliminary analysis indicates that a 19 character HIN will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
