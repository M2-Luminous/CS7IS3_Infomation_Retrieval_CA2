Alexander Aguirre, DILG undersecretary for peace and order and a member of the panel, told the CHRONICLE the issues to be resolved by the technical and ad hoc working committees of both panels between now and the second week of February were: Muslim representation in government, defense, administrative systems, economic and financial systems, and education. Aguirre said the issues were raised during a five-hour meeting between the two committees at the MNLF headquarters in Barangay [village] Timbangan, Indangan, Sulu last Tuesday. In that meeting, Yusbar Jamil, the Indonesian Embassy's Councilor-Minister, and Indonesian Ambassador Rajab Azzarouo [as published], acted as moderators. Batangas Representative Eduardo Ermita, vice chairman of the government panel, headed the government's group of technical committees while MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari himself was Ermita's counterpart. Aguirre said the technical committees of both panels would be holding a series of meetings in Manila, Zamboanga City and Cotabato City to hammer out a common stand on the issues. The technical committees' output will then be submitted for review and final approval by the government and MNLF peace panels after the second week of February, in time for the resumption of formal talks in March. "The peace process is on course and there are positive indications that true reconciliation will be achieved," Aguirre said, adding that the recent meeting in Sulu was "cordial and conciliatory." The undersecretary also said there was a need for both panels to reconcile differing views on autonomy, which though granted under the Constitution, was interpreted differently by both sides.
