He told reporters after meeting with both Bosnian and Serb officials: "I regret to tell you that these discussions have not reached an agreement yet." "The major difference is that the Bosnian side wants to have the withdrawal of artillery, mortars and other heavy weapons out of range of the city of Sarajevo and be placed under UNPROFOR (UN Protection Force) control. This is not acceptable for the Serb side," Akashi said.
