Zhang Siqing said criminal cases nowadays involve increasingly large amounts of money, and the number of major and extraordinarily serious cases are multiplying. From January to September 1993, cases involving more than 10,000 yuan each that procuratorial organs placed on file for investigations accounted for 60 percent of all cases placed on file during that period; and 77 cases of corruption and bribery involved over 500,000 yuan. Hence the numbers of these two categories of cases are double and triple the figures for the same period of 1992 respectively. In terms of sectors of origin, more cases took place in monopolized sectors, such as the sectors of banking, railway transport, capital construction, and land project examination and approval. Hot-spot economic construction sectors, including the negotiable securities, stock, and real estate markets, have seen some new forms of criminal offense. The number of collective crimes has increased, with a remarkable increase in the number of cases involving collaboration between both those from within and without an organization, between people from different trades, and from different areas. Cases of graft and bribery occur frequently in localities and departments seriously suffering from evil trends and, very often, a single case taken up by a procuratorial organ may expose a series of new cases. The nature of cases can be a mixture of graft and bribery, smuggling, tax evasion, favoritism and cheating, dereliction of duty, harboring of evildoers and covering up of evil deeds, forgery of documents, and so on, and it is pretty common that a single case involves several crimes and many persons, or a single crime involves many offenders.
