CONTENTS: 1. Muslim Brothers, Labor Party Youths Arrested 2. Government Campaign Against Muslim Brotherhood Criticized 3. Muslim Brotherhood Deputy Guide Defends Group MUSLIM BROTHERS, LABOR PARTY YOUTHS ARRESTED An unattributed 120-word report on page 1 of AL-SHA'B says that "within the framework of the mounting government campaign against the Muslim Brotherhood, the security forces have arrested eight brothers. They were brought before the prosecution, which ordered that they be detained for 15 days." Among the imprisoned brothers is Ibrahim Sharaf, private secretary of the general guide of the Muslim Brotherhood. They were accused of belonging to an "illegal group." In another unattributed 500-word report on page 3, the paper writes about the arrest of Labor Party youths in various governorates for distributing leaflets on the occasion of 'Id al-Adha. GOVERNMENT CAMPAIGN AGAINST MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD CRITICIZED A 400-word article by Ahmad al-Suyufi on page 4 explains the role of the security forces vis-a-vis the people. The writer begins by explaining the difficult task of the security forces. He says: "The security men in Egypt should be pitied. Our impotent government has entrusted them with solving all the problems of Egypt. The policemen are asked to resolve political, economic, and social problems." They decide who is an extremist, moderate, terrorist, or a good citizen. They also decide which political parties cooperate with the government and which oppose it, which is publications are enlightened and which reckless, and which professional unions are good and which bad. Problems are tackled by the security forces, not by the politicians. The writer then refers to the government campaign against the Muslim Brotherhood "just because they dare to voice their views on our national issues." He asks: "What is their crime? Frankly speaking, the issue is not detached from what is happening everywhere in the world. What is happening to the Brothers is not detached from what is happening in Bosnia, Somalia, Iraq, Yemen, Libya, Kashmir, Algeria, Tunisia, and Burma. It is the same method and the hidden hands are the same. No one will believe the nonsense that the Brothers stand behind and encourage terrorism." MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD DEPUTY GUIDE DEFENDS GROUP AL-SHA'B publishes on page 5 a 2,300-word article by Mustafa Mashhur, deputy guide of the Muslim Brotherhood, in which he defends the group against accusations of involvement in terrorism. He begins by stressing that "not a single member of the Muslim Brotherhood" has participated in any disturbances or terrorist incidents during the past quarter century. Nevertheless, he continues, "some tendentious writers have continued to accuse the Brothers of involvement in terrorism and violence, and to describe the groups that are known to embrace violence as offspring of the Muslim Brotherhood." He says that the Brothers at times have tried to respond to these writers and refute their false accusations. The Muslim Brotherhood has always emphasized its religious orientation and exercised its legal activity through the official institutions, such as the People's Assembly, the professional associations, faculty clubs at educational institutions, and the local councils. "The public," he says "became confident of our moderate methods, which are far removed from violence and terrorism." But as soon as the president said in an interview with the German publication DER SPIEGEL that the Muslim Brotherhood encourages extremists, the national press and their chief editors and writers began attacking it and instigating the regime against it. Sensational headlines began appearing in the press, linking the Muslim Brotherhood with what happened at the Lawyers Association. Mashhur then gives a brief history of the Muslim Brotherhood since 1948, when Hasan al-Banna was murdered for sending fedayeen to confront the Zionist gangs in Palestine, and notes that various state leaders have come and gone, but the Muslim Brotherhood remains. He says that the Muslim Brotherhood resumed their moderate, legitimate activity under President Mubarak. The regime and some tendentious quarters were displeased when the Islamists won in the Lawyers Association elections. Referring to the recent incidents at the Lawyers Association, Mashhur says: "I would like to emphasize that the Muslim Brotherhood does not interfere in the internal affairs of the associations." But, he continues, they are reassured that the members abide by the correct Islamic behavior code. He also denies accusations that the Muslim Brotherhood have exploited the incident and turned public opinion against the regime. Continuing his defense of the Muslim Brotherhood, Mashhur says that al-Sadat once said that there is no politics in religion and no religion in politics; we objected to this saying. Al-Sadat later amended it and said that Islam is a religion and a state. Mashhur expounds on this idea by saying that Islam has from the beginning been a complete and comprehensive religion, regulating the lives of people in the political, economic, social, military, and other fields. Islam is not just a religion. People must abide by its teachings in all aspects of life. There is need for a state and government to implement God's shari'ah. Mashhur goes on to say that "it is unconstitutional to prevent the Islamists from establishing a political party." He says there is no proof that the establishment of an Islamic political party in Egypt will be followed by the establishment of a Christian party. The Muslim Brotherhood's relations with the brother Copts has always been good. He stresses that "Islam is the religion of justice, peace, freedom, and equality. It is against dictatorship and oppression." What happened in Algeria is that a regime, supported by the army, has destroyed the democratic system and canceled the free elections which brought the Islamists to power. It was not the Islamists who destroyed democracy, he says. Mashhur denies that the Muslim Brotherhood has a secret apparatus or a military wing. He admits that they did have such bodies in the 1940's when the Zionist gangs were fighting the Palestinians and when the British colonialists occupied Egypt. He says now conditions have changed, and "there is no more need for a secret apparatus or a military wing. We support God and His religion, which is the official religion of the state. Regrettably, we find that the ruling regime is trying to curb the activity of those who support God and His religion." He continues: Some say that the Muslim Brotherhood's aim is to seize power, after which it supposedly will prevent a multiparty system. "We have denied this claim over and over. We demand that government rule be according to the shari'ah, but we do not demand to rule ourselves." We said if others ruled according to the shari'ah, we would support them. Would anyone seeking power for temporal gains and facing the tribulations we have faced for half a century have persevered? We demand rule according to the shari'ah; this is a religious duty of every Muslim man and woman, rulers and subjects. "We are fully convinced that Islam is the solution to all our problems, because it comes from God, who created us and who knows what is good and what is bad for us." Mashhur concludes: "There is an international campaign by the enemies of Islam led by the Zionists, the Western crusaders, the Hindus, and others headed by the Zionist enemy and America. They are fighting Islam and the Muslims, as we see everywhere." These enemies think that with their material power they can destroy Islam, but they delude themselves. God will safeguard his religion, he says.
