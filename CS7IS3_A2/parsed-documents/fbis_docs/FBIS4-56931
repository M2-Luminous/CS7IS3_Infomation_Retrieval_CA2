(Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 4 May 94) The price of domestic raw materials rose 3.1 percent in the first quarter of 1994, according to an EL FINANCIERO study based on figures from the Bank of Mexico. The newspaper's analysts point out that this rate of inflation was below the inflation rate recorded by raw materials on the international market, which rose 8.6 percent in the same period. Nevertheless, the study points out that in 1990-93, Mexican consumer prices rose annually at 26.7, 22.7, 15.5, and 9.8 percent, while domestic raw materials rose only 23.6, 8.3, 5.7, and 1.7 percent, respectively. The difference lies in the price of imported materials, which are usually higher. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 5 May 94 p 3A) Higher inflation and less economic growth are now the government's projections for 1994. Following the murder of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio and the events surrounding the investigation and the election process, the government has adjusted the targets in its economic plan. Now, inflation is expected to reach 7-8 percent, and GNP growth has been revised downward and is expected to range between 1.5 and 2 percent. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 5 May 94 p 24) Unemployment in the 37 largest metropolitan areas rose to 3.8 percent in January, the highest January figure since 1992 and the third highest within the past 24 months. The National Institute of Statistics, Geography, and Information (INEGI) reported that 1.286 million people are out of work. Some 180,000 of these people are teens and young adults with no previous job experience, who were forced into the labor market and have not yet found work. INEGI monitors this figure on a weekly basis. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 5 May 94 pp 60, 48) An EL FINANCIERO study based on INEGI statistics indicates that the number of new jobs offered during the first quarter of 1994 showed a negligible increase of 0.1 percent. Only 11,000 new jobs were made available, which means that the government will reach its goal of 500,000 new jobs a year over a four-year period. The report concludes by saying the private sector has reported layoffs and closures in most major areas of production, which in turn makes it poor source of new jobs. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 6 May 94 p 3A) The Confederation of National Chambers of Commerce (Concanaco) has reported that the private sector's contribution to the nation's GNP dropped 1.2 percent in 1993. This is the largest fall since 1986. According to a Concanaco study, this had a negative effect on jobs and sales. The report projects, however, that there will be some recovery during the first quarter of 1994, although this recovery will be modest. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 6 May 94 p 28) The Mexican Secretariat of Agriculture and Hydraulic Resources (SARH) has reported that the agricultural trade deficit declined 84 percent in 1993 from the previous year. SARH noted that the 1992 trade deficit topped $761.47 million, while in 1993 the deficit reached $121.45 million. The report added that Mexico basically continues to sell raw coffee, fresh vegetables, and fruit, except for cantaloupe and watermelon, and is still purchasing soybeans, sorghum, and wheat. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 6 May 94 p 57) It has been reported that 68 of the 213 nonfinancial business enterprises on the Mexican Stock Exchange (BMV) registered net losses during the first three months of 1994. On the other hand, 79 consortiums reported their profits dropped by 23.2 percent, while 66 enterprises registered increases. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 6 May 94 pp 72, 58) The depreciation of the peso and the increase in interest rates, particularly 28-day Treasury Notes, have prompted financial middlemen to record losses in their net earnings in the first three months of the year. At least eight trading companies reported losses, 10 percent of the customers from 154 investment societies withdrew, and more than eight banks reported heavy losses. In addition, 60 companies in the BMV registered exchange losses worth more than 4.352 billion new pesos. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 9 May 94 p 6) In view of the increasing debts of corporations and individuals, less financing from national banks, and the uncertainty prevailing in the economy with regard to the lack of growth, consumer prices continued to drop in the first three months of the year. According to reports from 17 businesses working with the BMV, their net sales amounted to 12.343 billion new pesos from January to March 1994. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 9 May 94 p 3A) The federal and state governments have invested approximately 179 million new pesos in Chiapas State to be used in emergency programs in the areas of electrification, potable water works, and productive programs. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 9 May 94 p 3) Juan Ramon Jimenez, an economist from the Technological Institute of Monterrey who is conducting a study on the concentration of wealth, has concluded that 60 percent of the revenue generated in the country is being earned by 10 percent of the population, while 10 percent of the overall annual income is being distributed among 60 percent of the population. Jimenez says this "gap between the rich and poor" is the result of the fact the Mexican economy is highly monopolized. For example, the value of the shares owned by eight companies in the BMV is equivalent to one-fourth of the GDP. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 9 May 94 p 48) On 9 May, the Bank of Mexico reported that Mexico registered an inflation rate of 0.5 percent during April, and that the annual inflation rate so far this year amounts to 2.31 percent, which is lower than the inflation rate for the same period in 1993, which amounted to 3.27 percent. (Paris AFP in Spanish 0045 GMT 10 May 94) Given the weakness in the world fuel market, which has been generated by an excessive supply of petroleum products and the fall in international prices, Mexican petroleum exports declined at an annual rate of 16.6 percent in the first two months of 1994. Overseas sales of crude, its by-products, and petrochemical products totaled $986.6 million in the first two months of the year. This represents 19.5 percent of the nation's total exports, without taking into account assembly plant exports in this same period. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 2 May 94 p 3A) During the first two months of the year, Mexican public sector exports, without taking into account assembly plants, only grew 11.9 percent over the same period last year when they registered a growth rate of 21.5 percent. Nevertheless, the exports by the Mexican private sector in this same period grew 21.5 percent. Sales to various international markets totaled $5.58 billion, of which $3.70 billion was for semi-finished goods, $1.502 billion for consumer goods, and $484.8 million for capital goods. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 3 May 94 p 21) A Bank of Mexico report indicates that the nation's current accounts deficit has grown more than 700 percent during this administration. According to the report, the trade exchange of merchandise was one of the factors that influenced the increase the most, with imports outpacing exports. The current accounts balance in tourism registered a $605.2 million surplus, while revenues from travelers totalled $6.167 billion. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 3 May 94 p 16) Factors affecting administration, customs, handling, and dredging work, as well as the increase in maritime traffic in local waters and a lack of infrastructure for port facilities, have resulted in a decrease in services to foreign trade since the implementation of NAFTA. Moreover, extended delays for ships in Mexican ports have created huge increases in operating costs, which are estimated to run as much as $5,000 a day for a ship in port. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 3 May 94 p 24) A Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial Development study indicates that Mexican sales to the United States increased 22.6 percent over the first two months of the year "as a result of the implementation of NAFTA." The study also notes that the Mexican farming sector has a dynamic role in exports to the United States in terms of peeled citrus, dried melons, prepared potatoes, prepared tomatoes, dehydrated onions, nuts, canned vegetables and fruits, melons, watermelons, papayas, and sunflower seeds.
