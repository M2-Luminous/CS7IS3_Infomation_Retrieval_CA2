FR940426-1-00084 FR940426-1-00008 Regarding the scientific basis, the OTC also contends that emissions inventories, photochemical modeling and ambient monitoring data constitute the best tools available to evaluate the need for emissions reductions, despite continuing refinement of this scientific information. The OTC recognized that most air quality analysis in the past has focused on domains within a particular State rather than on a broader region. It asserts that it assessed the need for and effectiveness of reductions in the OTR using photochemical models, monitoring data, trajectory analyses, and mobile emission models. a. Focus on Contribution. At the outset, EPA believes the concern in section 184 with ozone transport affects its analysis of where emissions reductions are necessary for areas in the OTR to achieve attainment. That is, EPA currently believes that the ``need'' for additional measures in the OTR under section 184 should not focus on a State's need to adopt the LEV program in its own jurisdiction for the benefit of in-State nonattainment areas. States, of course, retain full authority to adopt this program under section 177 without EPA approval. Rather, EPA believes that the focus should be on the need for upwind States that contribute to nonattainment downwind to adopt the LEV program not for their own benefit but for the benefit of the downwind areas that could not otherwise attain on time. The statutory structure, including the reliance in section 184(c)(5) on section 110(a)(2)(D), as well as the legislative history, support this conclusion. Of course, EPA recognizes that upwind States also have an independent obligation to adopt measures for purposes of their own timely attainment. The measures upwind areas adopt for their own benefit may well be sufficient to prevent contribution to nonattainment downwind. While upwind areas may still contribute pollutants downwind after they have reached attainment, their independent obligation to attain should go a long way to reducing emissions that contribute to downwind nonattainment. 12 It nevertheless seems that reductions in upwind areas may be necessary to prevent significant contribution to nonattainment downwind, even if the upwind areas would have to achieve those reductions for their own benefit, anyway. In other words, it does not seem that upwind areas' own need to reduce emissions for their own attainment should render those reductions unnecessary. To be sure, upwind areas' independent implementation of the LEV program in their SIPs may make it unnecessary for administrative purposes to mandate those controls. But EPA's obligation to mandate the recommended LEV measure does not appear to turn on whether the States already have or would have to implement that program for their own benefit. Rather, EPA's obligation seems to turn on whether the program is necessary for purposes of downwind attainment, regardless of whether it is necessary or has been adopted for upwind attainment purposes. EPA requests comment on this view. 12 One complication, discussed further below, is the timing of reductions upwind, where the upwind areas may have a later attainment deadline. Finally, EPA notes that it may be possible for downwind areas that are the recipients of transported pollution to counteract some portion of the incoming pollutants by adopting more controls downwind than would otherwise be necessary. Such areas might diminish the reductions necessary upwind by adopting such more stringent controls downwind. For downwind areas that are less polluted and have less stringent controls in place, the downwind areas might even be able to ``over-control'' at less cost than it would take for upwind areas to prevent some increment of contribution. On the other hand, it may not be fair to insist that downwind areas bear the cost of counteracting pollution that is generated upwind. In any case, however, no area receives air at its boundaries that is free of ozone or precursors. Thus, in evaluating what upwind contribution ``needs'' to be reduced for attainment downwind, it may be important to determine what ``boundary conditions'' downwind areas should be entitled to receive. EPA requests comment on these issues, and particularly on the extent to which it should view upwind reductions as necessary for attainment downwind, if the downwind area could, through extra controls, make those upwind reductions unnecessary.
