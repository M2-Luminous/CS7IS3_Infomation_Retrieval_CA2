Progress, however, has hardly been made in the ongoing U.S.-Japan negotiations on reduction of the Japanese current account surplus and on market opening in individual fields such as automobiles. The U.S. side is pursuing an excessively utilitarian goal and the Japanese side lacks a responsible world view. Distrust of the Bureaucratic Structure For the United States, the U.S.-Japan economic framework talks constitute a framework through which the United States manages its confrontational economic relationship with Japan. The United States proposes the Japanese current account balance surplus be reduced by half in proportion to the gross domestic product. It also proposes introduction of a "market entry index" for individual markets, which include the market share for foreign enterprises in such areas as automobiles, auto parts, insurance, government procurement, and so forth. The purpose of such a target and of the introduction of indexes is to clearly elucidate "results." The United States believes that to bring about results, an automatic mechanism must be created and the United States must keep continuous surveillance over it. To maintain this surveillance, the United States believes that the indexes are necessary. The U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement is a precedent for the framework talks. Because the goal of a 20-percent market share for foreign-manufactured [semiconductors] was achieved through the administrative guidance of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), the United States, both government and private sectors, praised it, saying: "It is the first case in which the Japanese side honored a U.S.-Japan agreement." But Japan today refuses the U.S. demand entirely. MITI puts forth its position that "the semiconductor agreement was a very great mistake." One Japanese official spurned a high-ranking U.S. Government official who proposed establishment of market shares at the beginning of the framework talks, saying: "As for myself, your proposal is improper." This attitude has not changed since then. U.S. Government high-ranking officials, in turn, have been irritated ever since, saying: "Japanese officials can not be trusted." There is also thinking on the U.S. side that the bureaucrats are interfering, even though Prime Minister Hosokawa advocates "change" for the Japanese economy. Go Over the Heads of the Bureaucrats, Use Politicians An impatient U.S. negotiation team in December met with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Representative Secretary Ichiro Ozawa, skipping over the heads of the bureaucrats. They are leaning toward the use of the directive power of "politics" over the bureaucrats. This reminds us of a revival of the method used by former Ambassador Armacost. He was called "Mr. Gaiatsu" by Kasumigaseki [government office district] because he went over to Nagata-cho [Tokyo political district] any time an issue arose and negotiated with influential Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] members. But a solution is not necessarily found by going over the "wall" of the Japanese bureaucrats. As for quantitative indicators, should Japan create bilateral rules at a time when, as the new round is concluded, the rules are to be strengthened for multilateral free trade through GATT? As for imports, should Japan adopt methods of managed trade or conclude an agreement with the United States on voluntary import expansion, even as a temporary measure?... Such decisions concern fundamental issues of international trade policy and are outside the competence of individual politicians. Bureaucratic organizations themselves are losing the basis of their power for domestic regulation. Just at that time [when the U.S. representatives were approaching the politicians], at MITI, [Masahisa] Naito, Industrial Policy Bureau director general, was driven to resignation. Naito had inherited the line of former Vice Minister Tanahashi. Tanahashi had expanded his authority through dealing with LDP legislators who represented trade and industry interests. The U.S. negotiation team had scheduled its meeting on that very day with Mr. Naito, hoping to find a break through for the issue. But the commotion over his resignation had already started, and the meeting was canceled. Ambiguous Agreement Possible The management of trade which has depended on cooperation with powerful politicians, and leading industry with a heavy hand when dealing with U.S.-Japan friction has failed. The method of guidance such as calling the presidents of the automobile industry and making them buy U.S. products can not be carried out without the political back-up which can determine an industry's gain or loss. The U.S. side is at a loss because of the politicians' and bureaucrats' confusion. Still, the framework talks will not break down. This is because, for high-ranking officials of both the United States and Japan, "non-agreement" will become proof of a "lack of ability" and a "lack of power." As for macroeconomic policy, the U.S. side formerly wanted a "10 trillion yen tax cut," but now is indicating a compromise of a "total of 10 trillion yen for a tax cut and public investment." But there is a great possibility that the vague agreement on quantitative indicators will accelerate differences of interpretation and intensify mutual distrust and confrontation. Japan's continued accumulation of a surplus and refusal to accept foreign products and capital will disturb the world economy and accelerate the argument in the United States for retaliation against Japan. The basic thinking of the United States, which proposed the framework talks, is that, under such circumstances, the post-cold war U.S.-Japan relationship in which concern will be focused on economic interests cannot be maintained. They one-sidedly seek a change in Japanese policy. The current confusion stems from the fact that Japanese side could not indicate a clear counter plan to deal with such thinking and has merely continued to respond to the other side's language. What is sought from the Hosokawa government is finding a stable axis for the U.S.-Japan relationship.
