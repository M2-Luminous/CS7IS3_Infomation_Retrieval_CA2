Khergamvala] [Text] Manama (Bahrain), May 4. Iran's Ambassador in India has issued a statement which is an indictment of New Delhi for its conduct of the mission of diplomats in New Delhi to Jammu and Kashmir [J & K]. It accuses India of "misleading the diplomatic group" and not "fulfilling the terms under which these envoys were taken to J & K." Radio Teheran broadcast the text of a statement issued by the Iranian News Agency on Monday, May 2. The Ambassador, Mr. Raza Sheikhattar seems to have given his statement immediately after the return to New Delhi of the 11 diplomats who had visited J & K. After initial reluctance he had joined this mission. As would be seen from the text, it is extremely unusual for a diplomat stationed in another country to use such strong words publicly against the Government to which he is accredited. In India, at the very least the move should come as a considerable embarrassment to policy planners and other observers who have maintained the pretence, since the Human Rights meeting in Geneva, that Teheran's neutrality tilts towards India and that bilateral ties are all hunky-dory. "The itinerary of the eight Muslim and three Latin American countries diplomats never materialised," said the envoy. "Since I was promised that I could meet anyone I asked and go anywhere I desired and even hire taxis if I wanted to and in consideration of the Indian Government's policies of clarifying the situation in J & K, I accepted the offer to go there. The Government of India had also promised to arrange the meeting between the delegation (of envoys) and leaders of the Hurriyat Conference. This was written in our itinerary, unfortunately it did not happen. The Government of India under the pretext of security problems and despite the fact that the Hurriyat Conference had guaranteed our security, refused to agree with the meeting place proposed by the Hurriyat Conference," the statement added. No Official Reaction In India, actions of powers above the Ministry of External Affairs [MEA] and some in the MEA have led Iran to believe that Teheran being India's only rescue act in the Islamic world, New Delhi must do its bidding. It is perhaps not too well known that the Indian Ambassador in Teheran is being prematurely transferred, at the behest of Teheran, for allegedly ruffling some feathers. However, nothing that he is known to have said or done that compares with the public censure issued by the Iranian Ambassador in New Delhi. In terms of content, it is not known if others in the diplomatic group share his views but it is most unlikely they would issue public reports. Extraordinarily, in contrast to what may have transpired if the Pakistani Ambassador had said this, the Indian spokesman has not reacted at all to the Iranian envoy's statement. Objectively, it seems difficult to believe that the envoy would continue to enjoy confidence in the MEA, especially when one reads what he said further. His statement added: "The diplomats wanted to meet with ordinary people but the Government officials decided that this was not possible in circumstances of a strike called by the Hurriyat Conference. The envoys' request to travel to Sopore and Bijbehara (the scene of last October's massacre) was rejected on security grounds. Although the provincial authorities had earlier agreed to the delegation meeting with representatives of the Srinagar people who had sustained damages, this was later cancelled and the reason given for it was that the Srinagar representatives were not too keen on holding the scheduled meeting. We could not pay a visit to the Hazratbal shrine either. When complaints were made to provincial authorities about the fact that facilities similar to the ones provided to the visiting delegations in the past were not being offered at this time, the envoys were told that people had protested after such visits and the Government was trying to avoid further unrest. Visiting diplomats were instead taken to the Dal Lake area and were provided binoculars to be able to see the shrine from a distance." Visit Incomplete In conclusion, the statement attributed to Mr. Sheikhattar says "the Srinagar visit has been incomplete and the aim of clarifying the situation in Kashmir is yet to be achieved. In Delhi we were told that the situation in Kashmir had improved and we had hoped to visit large areas of the State. The situation is totally upside down. We hope the Government would in future provide suitable facilities for diplomats and fulfil its promises about clarification of the situation in the region." Some may now question the whole idea of arranging diplomatic transparency in J & K, but Indian diplomats, reacting to the Iranian view say it has been a good move and there is no need to throw out the baby with the bathwater. As for the envoy's intentions, one purpose would be to enhance its standing in Islamabad and with the Hurriyat Conference, the ascendant group in J & K or with one of its factions. No doubt, such remarks would never have been possible had it not been for India itself making Iran feel it can play the key umpire's role. In any event the statement issued -- and neither reported in India nor responded to officially -- is inconsistent with the official level pretence about the state of relations.
