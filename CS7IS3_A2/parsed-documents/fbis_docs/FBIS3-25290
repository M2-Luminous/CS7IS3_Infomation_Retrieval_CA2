Max-Anicet Koumba, who returned to Gabon in January after 13 years living in exile in France, said he chose the party's name based on the fact that "our history does not begin here in Gabon but dates back to our Gallic origin." He said the Gabonese should "return to their pre- independence origins," and said the new party attested to Gabon's strong ties with France. "We are going on the basis that the name Gabon does not reflect the reality in our country since it derives from a wine of Portuguese origin, which as proud people we cannot accept," Koumba said, adding that he wants to hold a referendum to adopt a "more serious name" for Gabon. Koumba, while in exile, became one of the leaders of the first opposition party MORENA [National Recovery Movement], along with Paul Mba Abessole, a priest. Abessole was the opposition's presidential candidate during elections last December that were carried by Gabon's long-serving President Omar Bongo.
