ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) proposes to revise part 40 of Chapter I, title 25 of the Code of Federal Regulations, to ensure consistency with U.S. Department of Education student financial assistance program regulations, to implement requirements of a court decision regarding eligibility, and to change the title of part 40 to ``Higher Education Grant Program''. Loans to individual Indians are provided for in 25 CFR part 101 and are, therefore, removed from this part. DATES: Public comments must be received on or before July 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments are to be mailed to the Director, Office of Indian Education Programs, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Department of the Interior, 1849 C Street NW., Mail Stop 3530&hyph;MIB, Washington, DC 20240. Alternately, comments may be hand delivered to room 3510 at the above address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Garry R. Martin, at telephone (202) 208&hyph;4871. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The United States Department of Education published regulations in March 1975 setting forth the manner in which student financial assistance programs are administered. In the absence of regulations specific to the Bureau's Higher Education Program and eligible Indian students, recipient institutions of higher education often do not understand the purpose of the Bureau's program. These regulations are proposed to clarify the program and remedy inconsistent practices. The Bureau previously defined applicants for assistance under the Higher Education Grant Program to mean a person who is recognized as a member of an Indian tribe by the Secretary of the Interior and who has at least one-fourth degree Indian blood, Alaska Native, Eskimo or Aleut blood. However, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has ruled that such 1/4 blood requirement was not in accordance with the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA), the authorizing statute that was cited as authority for the regulation. Zarr v. Barlow, 800 F.2d 1484 (9th Cir. 1986). The authority used for the Higher Education Grant Program is the Snyder Act, which places no limitation on the definition of Indian. The definition in BIA elementary and secondary education programs, ``an eligible Indian student is a student who is a member of or is at least a one-fourth degree Indian blood descendant of a member of an Indian tribe which is eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States through the Bureau of Indian Affairs to Indians because of their status as Indians'', (Section 2008(f) of 25 U.S.C.), is used. For purposes of this part, the definition is, therefore, revised. Comments are especially desired on this section of eligibility. On March 3, 1987, the Bureau published proposed Higher Education Grant Program rules in the Federal Register . In January 1991, the Bureau conducted consultation meetings with Indian tribes, parents, school boards, and other interested parties concerning the Higher Education Grant Program regulations. Oral testimony and written statements were received in the Office of Indian Education Programs until February 26, 1991. The Bureau considered the comments, objections, and suggested changes received in response to the 1987 Federal Register publication and the 1991 consultation meetings in re-proposing these regulations. The information and record-keeping requirements contained in this part have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for approval as required by 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. The collection of this information will not be required until approved by the Office of Management and Budget.
