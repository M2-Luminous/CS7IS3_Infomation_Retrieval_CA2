Following its two-day meeting, the committee adopted a number of decisions on facing up to some negative phenomena which have caused an increase in the prices of a number of commodities and services, and to the causes of the pressures on the Libyan dinar -- pressures brought about by certain unlawful practices -- which have led to a drop in the real value of the income of part of the population. The committee's Secretariat has asked the Central Bank of Libya to study the matter and come up with a date to start paying sums of money in hard currency to citizens to enable them to face up to their difficulties, as well as to define what sums of money should be paid in every deserving case. The Secretariat has reiterated the need to the brother secretary of the General People's Committee for economy and trade and to the governor of the Central Bank of Libya to open the credits necessary for the provision of the local market with the required commodities, through the legally recognized channels.
