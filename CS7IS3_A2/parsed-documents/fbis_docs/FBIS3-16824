Today you and I have a dialogue with Leonid Makarovich Kravchuk, president of the Republic of Ukraine. He is in the television studio in Kiev. Good afternoon Mr. President! [Kravchuk] Hello! [Skryabin] We are happy to have you on our program. [passage omitted] I think that the Institute of Sociological Research, headed by Professor Sokolov, is also taking part in our program today. The fact of the matter is that today we are using sociological research carried out here in Moscow in March and I think it will serve our program well. I would like to say that the sociological research which was carried out was devoted to the theme "Russia and Ukraine -- their joint situation -- public assessment of information and expectations." Before putting a question to you, Mr. President, I would like to draw attention to two problems worrying the public in connection with the poll carried out by the Institute of Sociological Research. The first is the lack of information on the situation in Ukraine. In particular, according to the data, more than one-third of all those polled said they lacked information and the majority of those polled -- 55 percent -- think that the Russian mass media are not very objective about life in Ukraine, or simply carries distorted reports about it. I think that our meeting today will allow that problem to be resolved. And the second problem is the public's great concern about relations between Russia and Ukraine. If you don't mind, Mr. President, I think that we will devote our conversation today to this problem. Allow me to begin by trying to find out how you regard the stereotypes that exist today in Ukraine and Russia; stereotypes that on the whole are held to be true by people. We would like to know your point of view. Well, the first and main one is connected with the economy. The fact of the matter is that sociological research showed that the state of Ukraine's economy, especially as far as Muscovites -- 65 percent -- are concerned, is seen as catastrophic, or very serious, while only eight percent think that there is a tendency for it to improve. [passage omitted] [Kravchuk] There is no doubt that Ukraine's economic situation is serious. There are no doubts about that. We realize that ourselves, as do the government, the Supreme Council, and the authorities in the localities. But the main question probably is: Is the Ukraine's economy really as bad as its made out to be, and is Ukraine the only state of the former USSR where things are worse than everywhere else? And that lack of information has a good deal to do with that view. I will not give any figures but any unbiased visitor to Ukraine if he visits our shops today, not just in Kiev but in the oblasts, will see that there is a choice of sausage, meat, dairy products, groats, and pasta. Well, prices are another matter. But there is a choice, in the first place. In the second place, these are Ukrainian-produced goods. But if you live nearer Moscow you can visit the squares in front of the city's stations and its markets -- which I happen to know very well -- you will see an awful lot of Ukrainian products, of foodstuffs there. And I naturally ask the question: Is a poor people, or a people which are hungry, as it is sometimes made out to be, able to fill not just its own shops, but also Russia's markets and the squares in front of its stations. Therefore, I think this stereotype appeared about a year ago. Yes, indeed, it is true, a year ago, the shelves of the shops in many regions of Ukraine were practically empty because a pricing and subsidy system was not developed. But that question has been taken off the agenda for now. There are two questions now: Prices and wages, but not food products. There are food products. That is why this stereotype is still around and they are still hanging on to it. Therefore, I would say: If there are any doubts here, take the television cameras into our shops and then you can see what things are like, if Ukraine is hungry today or not. That is a short reply. But there are more profound questions -- questions of economic reform, questions of the transition to new economic relations, market reform, financial and credit reform, banking reform. But these questions are all so complex and difficult that they will take time, and these questions of reform are just as complex and difficult for all states of the former Soviet Union, including for Russia, too. Therefore, unless there are some other aims, I think it is simply unjustified to single out Ukraine today. [Skryabin] Leonid Makarovych, you will, I hope, agree that perhaps the sorest problem both for Ukraine and for Russia is the disruption of economic ties. [passage omitted] What do you think about this situation? [Kravchuk] One should first answer the question of what ties we are talking about here. If people say that all the ties that formerly existed should be reestablished, this cannot be done, because many enterprises in both Russia and Ukraine that were previously linked with such ties either no longer exist, or have switched to new output, so it is impossible. I advocate strengthening ties, but on a new basis, on new principles. Let us just take a look at these principles. Who is it who should establish ties -- President Yeltsin and President Kravchuk -- or the enterprises and collectives themselves? Collectives that have an interest in establishing ties have already got them going -- and long since, at that. Secondly, what should the state do to develop, expand, and strengthen ties? It must create the conditions for that to happen. In Ukraine, for example, we have abolished all customs duties on goods being exported from Ukraine. We have suggested to Russia setting up a free trade zone. Russia has not as yet accepted this. It has opted for most favorable status, but with certain goods exempted, namely gas, oil, nonferrous metals, timber, and some others. So we get a sort of cut-off zone. For our part, we did not initiate setting up a customs barrier, nor creating any sort of obstacles. Let us be quite frank about this, it is the sorest point at the moment. If we, today, are advocating a single market or a common market within the context of the CIS, then we certainly support that. But for this to come about, conditions have to be equal. If today, for example, the Russian consumer buys oil at 30 percent less than oil costs the Ukrainian consumer, and the same thing applies to gas -- how can Ukrainian manufacturers withstand the competition in this common market that it is proposed we should set up? In order to strengthen ties and develop good relations, identical common conditions must be created. Customs policy, taxation policy, pricing policy, and other forms must all be coordinated, just as is done in all civilized countries. But when this is not done because each state pursues its own interests -- I am not singling out Ukraine as being the most reticent here, so to speak -- if each state pursues its own goals and at the same time chants the slogan, let us join together, then no one has ever managed this before, nor will anyone do so now. That is why I advocate that it should be the collectives who strengthen ties, on the basis of the new situation in their work and life; and that states should create the conditions for it, including by accords between states -- Ukraine, incidentally, has signed almost all the documents that have been put forward within the context of the CIS and also in relations between Russia. This removes all the problems and questions. It will neither concern the government nor the president, it will be the concern of the collective that has an interest in the market, the ties, and in ensuring normal payments. [Semenov] Then why do you occupy such a restrained and cautious position regarding economic union? [Kravchuk] I will tell you. Economic union should openly specify to the whole people the principles of its development. To demonstrate this, I will touch upon the following issue: a single ruble zone. Russia, as a center of gravity -- which is natural -- and also as the initiator of setting up a single ruble zone, should say openly what the principles of joining the single ruble zone are. What will the states which will join the single ruble zone lose or win economically, politically, etc.? Moreover, this should be said openly. And then each person would decide whether it will develop as an independent state on the basis on its own currency and relations between states develop in the framework of equality and partnership, or whether there will be a single ruble zone, single currency, single financial and banking system, and then one should forget about independence. The people should not be deceived. Look at the practice. Why did Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan refuse the single ruble zone? Because a general phrase was written: A single ruble zone. It should be clearly stated: What are the motives of the national bank, or the Russian bank? What are the motives of the Finance Ministry? What has to be given up, what should be gained? Then I will say to my people: Esteemed ladies and gentlemen, this is the option you are being offered -- openly and honestly. If you are in favor, then go ahead -- with or without me, enter the zone. But when this is done with eyes closed, when they say first you sign and then we specify, the result is that some people enter and then leave. Surely, it is this that has led to such complexities with Belarus -- because there is not absolute clarity. Therefore, I have said before and I am say now: We should define our position, whether we will build an independent state based on the principles of good-neighborliness, friendship and partnership, helping each other, or whether we will unite in a single state with a single ruble, a single bank, single taxation, and single customs. We should ask the people. At present, I base my opinions on the fact that 92 percent of Ukraine's people voted for independence. One should ask the people: What do you want? We cannot rely on the people and, on the other hand, decide these issues without the people at somebody else's will. There should be clarity and openness, inter alia regarding Belovezhskaya Pushcha. This is also one of the stereotypes. The Soviet Union did not disintegrate in Belovezhskaya Pushcha. This happened before Belovezhskaya Pushcha. The final decision was not taken in Belovezhskaya Pushcha but in Almaty, in the Almaty Declaration, but nobody admits this. By the way, as for Belovezhskaya Pushcha, not only the presidents, but also the prime ministers signed the documents there. One prefers to forget this because one wants to find who is to blame, but those who are to blame were before the event. Believe me, they were not in Ukraine. [Skryabin] Thank you very much. Leonid Makarovych, speaking about Belovezhskaya Pushcha, if our Ostankino Television prepares a program connected with Belovezhskaya Pushcha within the framework of Live Dialogue, are you prepared to take part in it? [Kravchuk] Yes, absolutely! Quite a bit of time has passed since the Soviet Union collapsed and since the time of perestroyka and it is time to tell the people how that process developed, who stood on the path of that process, as one of our leaders used to say, and who enabled all that happened to happen. And most importantly, did we have another way out? Was it people's will or was it an objective and natural process? I think that it was an objective and natural process of disintegration. But were we able to go through that natural process as subjects, in accordance with will and reason, or were mistakes made and who made the mistakes and why? People must be told because myths and illusions around that and the search for guilty parties in the form of several people have gone too far already, and some zealous participants in that process are now making themselves out to be super-internationalists and they pass over in smiling silence their participation in that. I am not accusing anyone. I repeat, that was a natural process and by that disintegration we stopped the whole thing collapsing -- that is objectively -- but nevertheless, since things have gone so far, people must be told the truth. [passage omitted] [Telen] Mr. President, I regret having to interrupt that interesting conversation about Belovezhskaya Pushcha, but since we have agreed to make a separate program on it, I will return to the economy, to economics, and politics. You were quite right when you said that the economy is closely linked to politics today and often is based on politics, but as long as the economic situation, in particular, in Ukraine is so serious, there is always the chance that another state, not necessarily Russia, will use economic pressure for political aims. There has been much talk of that in various situations, both with regard to Russia and to Ukraine, in particular, the recent gas situation, with Ukraine's debt to the Russian Gazprom. [passage omitted] What do you think? Can Russia use economic sanctions for political ends? Is that a reality? And do you see such a danger for Ukraine? [Kravchuk] There are a number of complex aspects for me. The first is that gas and oil must be paid for. And in Ukraine today, the following situation has taken shape: Since we have no real possibilities of accumulating hard currency because Russia does not buy in great quantities the goods that are being sold to it. I am speaking about Russian enterprises. For instance, a Russian enterprise can wait to buy a KRAZ [truck made at the Kremenchug automobile works] for a six months or a year, whereas gas is an everyday necessity. In other words, we cannot accumulate hard currency in selling our goods to Russia today. There are no quotas on the European market. So we have a product, but we cannot sell it and accumulate hard currency. Therefore, it is not possible to pay for gas and oil in a timely manner. What can I say if there are not any payments? The tap can always be turned off. That can always be dished up as pressure, anything you like, and the following explanation can be given: You are not paying, we are not supplying you. Therefore, there is a problem here, and we are now making every effort to mobilize forces, reserves, resources, or by other means, to accumulate hard currency and to settle with Gazprom. But I have a question, too. The gas could have been turned off on 26 February. There were no payments there either, but for some reason it was turned off on 3 March while I was in the United States. I cannot explain why it happened like that -- for it is probably no coincidence, people say. That is the question! Some are always exploiting the time, political, or economic factors to create problems around it. I think we will find a solution -- there is no doubt -- and relations will be normal, payments will be normal. Ukraine is not a poor state. It will settle up. Incidentally, we owe everyone today -- we owe the West -- and the West deferred loan and interest payments. When normal interests and the prospect for relations are taking into account, all factors are taken into account and the main factor is our future, our good relations with our neighbor, with people with whom we lived for 340 years together with one territorial integrity, lived in the Soviet Union, shared sorrows and difficulties and good times. Therefore, I would refrain from having only mercantile relations now or taking advantages of difficulties with Ukraine. Ukraine will not be a debtor. It will settle up -- if not today, then tomorrow. [Semenov] Leonid Makarovych, there is another moral and political aspect. Is Ukraine in a position to guarantee fully that Russian gas and oil reach Europe? You know there have been some unpleasant situations. [Kravchuk] The position is this. We have now set up a working group, headed by Deputy Prime Minister Valentyn Landyk, which together with local administrations has placed the passage of gas and oil under the strictest supervision. We believe that this is absolutely unacceptable, and believe me, I am convinced of that. If anyone is doing this, or does it in the future, he will be called to account. [Semenov] [Passage omitted] Recently a sort of diplomatic, perhaps friendly or unfriendly triangle has become established, namely Russia, Ukraine, and the United States. What is the role of the United States here, in your view? Is it serving to reconcile us, to remind us of our old friendship, or will we perhaps feel ashamed in front of the United States and come to agreement without its help? [Skryabin] Well, if I can approach this from another angle, it has been said that America is our new friend. Is this not in some way the loss of our old friend Russia? [Kravchuk, laughing] Well, I reckon it is like this: The fact is that we have all been brought up on a specific sort of ideology, an ideology that declared all bourgeois, capitalist countries to be our enemies. Now, of course, even some friends are difficult to interpret, But I think the more friends the better. In any case, I am convinced that America will lay no claims to Ukraine, whether territorial or any other. The fact that we are establishing ties with the United States, France, or Great Britain does not mean this is detrimental to Russia. I have said before and I am saying now: our relations with Russia have a special status. These are relations of partnership, friendship, and good-neighborliness. There is no other way for Ukraine or Russia. Historically and objectively and, if you prefer it, subjectively, this friendship is at the level of everyday life. If, for example, we are talking of friendship with the United States at the level of government structures, at state level, here it is at the level of people, border areas and families who have friends and relatives or children. It became integrated at the level of everyday life. I can see that Russia seems to be jealous, as if the fact that Ukraine is making friends and establishing good relations with others will be at Russia's expense. I even like this. It looks as if Russians love Ukrainians very much and they do not want to let them go because of their friendly feelings. But I would like to see one thing: so that this love should be expressed in some concrete steps with regard to Ukraine -- in providing aid in the economic reform and in the reform of the political system. In mitigating those harsh processes that are under way in our country, inevitable as they are. In solving calmly and equitably the problems of nuclear weapons, of the Black Sea fleet, and everything connected with these. If this love, these good relations, are expressed in such concrete steps, then this love can only be to the benefit of us alive today, and of those who will be living tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, for we have to live on the same planet, live and be friends, as the saying goes, and we cannot avoid that. There is no other option, no alternative. Only hotheads can think otherwise. Those Russian Federation citizens who often brand the official authority, including the president, as virtually nationalist, because he pursues this policy, should reflect. This, too, is a stereotype of the same ideology. If somebody speaks in favor of an independent state, nothing more is required. If he is in favor of independent Ukraine he is a nationalist but if he is against independent Ukraine he is an internationalist and is most welcome, that is the point. But then the following question could be asked: If a Russian speaks in favor of independent Russia who is he? This question is somehow avoided. We should not, therefore, be guided by stereotypes in our life. We have risen to a new plane, new philosophy, new ideology, and we should rid ourselves gradually, step by step, of nationalism, chauvinism, or national-patriotism which, I am convinced, can only lead to confrontation, not to good relations. [Semenov] But for love to blossom it should be reciprocal, Leonid Makarovych, do you agree? [Kravchuk] Certainly. I cannot, therefore, give you any example saying that there is no reciprocal love on the Ukrainian part. When the Russian Supreme Soviet, contrary to common sense, adopts a decision on the status of Sevastopol and sends its people to the Crimea to stir up separatist moods, believe me, Ukraine is not sending anyone to Rostov or Tatarstan or other republics to create difficulties there. And now tell me who loves whom reciprocally: the one who wants to interfere in the other's territorial affairs -- and I find this very difficult to explain -- or the one who bends. Or do you want us to bend over backward? One should understand that a person has a limit, he has honor which is above all, beyond which economic and other problems become of secondary importance. It is how people are. [Skryabin] Thank you very much. Leonid Makarovych, I would like to refer to the findings of the Institute of Sociological Research of Professor Sokolov again. It also is about stereotypes. The majority of Muscovites who were polled in the survey are very negative about your political course. Fifty-six percent think that you follow a policy of isolation and separatism and are a Ukrainian nationalist. [Kravchuk, laughing] Well, what did I say! [Skryabin] But I think that Yevgeniy Andreyvich (Ushakov) from Moscow is right when he says that he hopes there are people in the leadership of Ukraine today who are as wise as Bogdan Khmelnitskiy [17th century Ukrainian leader], who understand that only a close union between the people of Russia and Ukraine, a union without ambition, will bring calm and prosperity to these peoples. [Kravchuk] I completely agree. But there is just one thing. The nature of that union must be determined. You know there are calls at the moment in our country -- the pre-election campaign is underway -- some say we are for union with Russia, for the creation of a single credit and banking system, for the creation of a single monetary system. Down with the frontiers! Down with the customs! Down with everything! But we say: For an independent and self- sufficient Ukraine. I want to ask: Is this logical and do these actions and ideas go together? Therefore, there is no need to deceive the people! I said that right at the outset. Let us determine what the economic union will be like, what the ruble zone, the nonruble zone will be like, let us tell the people and then let the people decide what it should give back and what it should take. But to simply make declarations will bring only confrontation. I was and will be a supporter of friendship, neighborliness, and partnership with Russia not because it is my particular opinion but because this is what history dictates. That is the crux of the matter. But let us channel everything else not dictated by history into a civilized framework, along the lines of good relations, mutual understanding, partnership, equality, and then all the problems will disappear. Believe me, if somebody wants to dictate and somebody else is to be subordinate, the problems will not go away. [Telen] Mr. President, then let us go on to the problem of elections. We know that Ukraine has embarked upon the final part of the pre-election campaign -- I mean parliamentary elections. The presidential elections are ahead and... [Skryabin, interrupting] And the local soviet elections... [Telen, continues] And the local soviet elections, too. Relations between Ukraine and Russia are one of the central questions of the pre-election campaign. But I would like to ask you about something else. It is known that around 70 percent of the electorate intend to take part in the first round of the parliamentary elections -- that is quite a big figure -- but according to forecasts by many Ukrainian specialists, the matter will not be decided at the first round of voting, since there are too many candidates for every deputy's seat and it is quite likely that parliament will not be elected at these elections. Tell us please, how do you forecast the situation if parliament is not elected as a result of the first and second round of voting? What will the situation in Ukraine be like? [Kravchuk] I would like parliament to be elected, that is the first thing, and that wise, calm and professionally trained politicians, people capable of resolving domestic and external problems in line with international principles and the interests of their people enter parliament. This is my profound wish and conviction. There are really around over 5,000 candidates for 450 seats. That works out about 12 people per constituency. It is unlikely that this problem will be resolved in the first round. The second round is more difficult from the legal point of view: 50 percent turnout is required and over 25 percent are required to vote. There will be difficulties. But if parliament is not elected, a parliamentary crisis could arise because some deputies will be elected and it cannot be ruled out that one deputy could hold a seat in an old constituency, another in a new constituency and it will be difficult to manage that situation. But elections to local bodies of power and presidential elections in June still lie ahead. Unless all of that is decided in March or April, I fear that a power vacuum could be formed and then we will have to take some kind of extraordinary decisions. I think we will be able to decide that problem within the framework of democracy, within the framework of the interests of the state so as not to bury the state, not to allow executive structures of power to disintegrate. We have bodies of power in the localities, there are presidential structures, there are local soviets. I think that we can and will be able to run the state with the help of these structures, having decided the question here in the center in accordance in the interests of both the people and the state. [Telen] Mr. President, can presidential elections be postponed given the complicated situation? [Kravchuk] Well, you see, I would not like to initiate this because some people could view this as my desire to put off elections. It was me who proposed early elections of both parliament and president. But today, according to my information from localities and leaders of different ranks and the letters and telegrams that keep arriving, first, time limits are very compressed, second, it will be summer, harvesting will be underway. And then, people say that if the parliament issue is not settled, if the parliament fails to adopt two important laws, on local power structures and their functions, plenary powers and interaction with the central authorities, and if a new law on presidency is not adopted -- because the current law defines the president as head of state and executive authority and also defines relevant functions and plenary powers -- then the elections can be not simply inexpedient but even dangerous to a degree because a power vacuum will set in. The central bodies of authorities will have no influence over local bodies of authority, because there will be no law to regulate these relations. So people notice this, they are worried and are asking to postpone these elections until these two laws are adopted and to hold the elections at a more convenient time. Well, I cannot solve this problem on my own. [Skryabin] Incidentally, Leonid Makarovych, your view fits in with those of our viewers. [passage omitted] [Kravchuk] Yes, there is concern, I feel it, too, in telegrams, letters, or telephone calls that are received not only by my office but by other structures, too, including the Cabinet of Ministers and the Supreme Council. In other words, the people are alarmed. But since there is alarm and uncertainty, which is undeniable, all this should be solved in such a way that the management of the state, the state itself, and its independence do not suffer in the process. [passage omitted] [Semenov] I know that preventing any form of bloodshed in Ukraine is your political priority. At the same time, you have declared the holding of referendum in Crimea illegal. It will, however, be held, most probably. What actions can you take? I can hardly imagine. [Kravchuk] You see, here we have the following problem. I agree with Andrey Georgiyevich [Skryabin] that if we start arguing today about who owns Crimea this argument will be very difficult to bring to a logical conclusion. It depends on what period, time span, or historical period you examine. I would not raise this issue at all. The way I formulate the question is the following: Do we need today, considering the difficulties that have arisen within the CIS framework and the difficulties related to the former Soviet Union -- do we need to raise the issue of solving the Crimean problem? My answer is an unequivocal no, if we are to be guided by common sense and political expediency and consider the dangers that lie in wait for us along this road. This is my profound conviction. Second, after the president of Crimea was elected, our first meeting in Ukraine was interesting. The president did not ask a single political question. He [Meshkov] said: The main issue for me is the economic program. After this, I gave instructions to the government, and we created for Crimea, together with Crimea, a budget balancing expenditure if the Crimean authorities ensure the revenue. In addition, we added a specific sum for the Crimean Tatar people as was done in all our budgets. So, the main issue of the budget was removed from the agenda. Now we need to work. And here I ask myself the question: Should one tackle the economic issue or kindle the political problems again? Such as: Are you in favor of dual citizenship? Is it not understood that the majority of the population is in favor of dual citizenship in Crimea? Are not the other questions asked in the poll understood? But the main issue is the competence of the all-Ukraine referendum and not the Crimean referendum: This is, in accordance with Ukraine's Constitution and with the law on the all-Ukraine local referendum, the competence of Ukraine. That is, no part can resolve this problem unless it expresses the will of the entire people. That is the first thing. The second thing is that there is a ratified international principle, the Helsinki Process, which takes very seriously all problems related to territorial borders and others, because they understand that confrontation is in store here, there may be blood in store here. Therefore, I could not but annul these two points in the Crimean president's decree, because they contradict the Constitution and our laws. The point that relates to the competence of Crimea remains. So, conditions have been created today for Crimea to work economically and resolve its problems. What conditions are these? Inadequate in respect of the opportunities, indeed, difficult and hard ones, yes indeed, but we have to work. I can imagine what will happen after this referendum. It has absolutely no juridical force whatsoever, but I can well imagine how many of your Ostankino broadcasts there will be, not to say from your editorial office: The Crimeans have expressed their will, and so on and so forth. This is all politicizing, whipping up passions, the newspapers will go on about it, there will all sorts of rallies, everything to show what the Crimeans want. But can what the Crimeans want today be settled without the involvement of Ukraine and Russia? In keeping with the Helsinki and UN norms and other principles, two conditions are essential: First, the agreement of Ukraine and of Russia. Third, the expression of the people's will. Or rather second, the expression of the people's will. But those conditions are not present, all these expressions of the will of part of the people will constantly come up against the barriers of international principles, territorial borders etc., and so on and so forth. Can we really set out on this path today? This is why I have been appealing and continue to appeal: There should be an end to politicizing, exploitation, and playing the Crimean card. It will not lead to anything good. We have the experience of the Dniester Region and Karabakh. Surely we do not need a few more trouble spots for the hotheads to finally understand that they must stop. Because we are already tired of receiving death notifications. How many of these must there be? [Skryabin] Leonid Makarovych, thank you, I am sorry but we have already run over our airtime, I cannot even offer you time to bid farewell. [passage omitted]
