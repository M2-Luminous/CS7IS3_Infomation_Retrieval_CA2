FR941230-0-00062 FR941230-0-00012 LIBRARY OF CONGRESS Copyright Office 37 CFR Part 201 [Docket No. RM 86&hyph;7B] Cable Compulsory License; Definition of Cable System AGENCY: Copyright Office, Library of Congress. ACTION: Amendment of cable license regulation. SUMMARY: The Copyright Office is repealing the provision of its regulations regarding the eligibility of multipoint distribution service and multichannel multipoint distribution service operators for compulsory licensing under section 111 of the Copyright Act, and is amending other regulatory provisions necessitated by the Satellite Home Viewer Act of 1994. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 1, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Marilyn J. Kretsinger, Acting General Counsel, Copyright GC/I&R, P.O. Box 70400, Southwest Station, Washington, D.C. 20024. Telephone: (202) 707&hyph;8380. Telefax: (202) 707&hyph;8366. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On October 18, 1994, the President signed into law the Satellite Home Viewer Act of 1994 (1994 Home Viewer Act). Public Law 103&hyph;369, 108 Stat. 3477. The 1994 Home Viewer Act extends the Copyright Act's section 119 compulsory license for satellite carriers another five years, until December 31, 1999, and amends the section 111 cable compulsory license definitions of a ``cable system'' and the ``local service area of a primary transmitter.'' These legislative amendments to the Copyright Act require certain changes in Subchapter A, Part 201 of the Copyright Office's regulations, 37 C.F.R. Definition of a Cable System_Wireless Cable Systems The 1994 Home Viewer Act amends the definition of a ``cable system'' in the section 111 cable compulsory license to include what are known as ``wireless'' cable systems. ``Wireless'' cable operators, which provide video retransmission in the Multipoint Distribution Service (MDS) and the Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service (MMDS), are eligible for section 111 compulsory licensing for the broadcast signals that they retransmit to their subscribers. By clarifying the section 111(f) definition of a ``cable system'' to include ``wireless'' cable operators, the 1994 Home Viewer Act expressly overruled a prior decision of the Copyright Office that ``wireless'' cable operators did not come within the section 111(f) definition. On January 29, 1992, the Office concluded its inquiry into the definition of a ``cable system'' in Docket No. 86&hyph;7B and issued a regulation denying both ``wireless'' cable operators and satellite carriers eligibility for the cable compulsory license. 57 FR 3284 (1992). This regulation added a new subsection (k) to section 201.17 of the Office's rules, the pertinent part of which provided: Satellite Carriers and MMDS Not Eligible Satellite carriers, satellite resale carriers, multipoint distribution services, and multichannel multipoint distribution services are not eligible for the cable compulsory license based upon an interpretation of the whole of section 111 of title 17 of the United States Code. Subsequent to the issuance of this regulation, the Copyright Office delayed its effective date until January 1, 1995. 58 FR 40363 (July 28, 1993). In light of the 1994 Home Viewer Act change to the ``cable system'' definition, the Office is amending ยง201.17(k) to conform to the law and will treat ``wireless'' cable operators as being eligible for the cable compulsory license since January 1, 1978, the effective date of the Copyright Act and section 111. Satellite carriers, however, continue to remain ineligible for the section 111 license and the regulation is revised to notify satellite carriers when they may request a refund of royalties submitted to the Copyright Office under section 111. Local Service Area of a Primary Transmitter The other change to the cable compulsory license made by the 1994 Home Viewer Act is the broadening of the section 111(f) definition of the ``local service area of a primary transmitter.'' The definition is used to determine when a broadcast station is local or distant to a cable operator, which in turn determines whether the operator must pay a royalty fee for that station. Effective July 1, 1994, the local service area of a broadcast station for copyright purposes also includes the area in which the station is entitled to insist upon carriage of its signal by a cable system (i.e. its must-carry zone), in accordance with the rules of the Federal Communications Commission in effect on September 18, 1993, and any subsequent modification of those rules. Satellite Carriers Section 201.11(a) and (b) are amended to reflect passage of the 1994 Home Viewer Act, including the royalty rate and the definitional changes to section 119 of the Copyright Act.
