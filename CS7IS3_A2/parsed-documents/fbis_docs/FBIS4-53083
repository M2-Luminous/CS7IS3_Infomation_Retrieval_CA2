The talks will cover Japan's response to North Korea's suspected nuclear arms program, tax system reform and rice prices, the officials said. SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama and Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura reached the agreement in a meeting Monday, they said. The SDP, the country's no. 2 opposition party, left the coalition late last month in protest over the establishment of a large parliamentary group that excluded it. Sakigake earlier declared that it would not take cabinet posts but will cooperate with the cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata for some time, keeping its distance from the coalition.
