Rybkin said that they discussed measures to be taken by the State Duma to give a legislative support to the Treaty of Civic Accord. Much attention was given to the budget-94 draft law which will be discussed by the State Duma in the second reading and in particular, to articles of the draft law concerning needs of the Army, education, culture and science. Rybkin said that he had informed the Russian president that a presidential decree and a resolution of the Russian Government, under which a block of buildings in the Okhotny Ryad Street were transferred to the State Duma, were not fulfilled by some organisations which had not moved out from the building given to the State Duma as its new residence. Rybkin voiced satisfaction that after his conversation with the Russian president all organisations ignoring the resolution were given a strict warning to move out until May 26.
