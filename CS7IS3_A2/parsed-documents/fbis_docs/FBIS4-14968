ZVYAZDA correspondents have asked Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb to comment on the parliament's discussion of this issue. [ZVYAZDA] How do you estimate the fact that the parliament has not adopted any resolution on proposals put forward by the commission headed by Alyaksandr Lukashenka? [Hryb] I think that the reason for this was the lack of any documents which could substantiate charges against each of the individuals. In my opinion, it was necessary for people's deputies to have at their disposal both documented evidence and explanatory statements by the ministers. As became clear today, the commission has not spoken with any of them. It is impossible to adopt a resolution on the basis of such one-sided material. [ZVYAZDA] Thus, you believe that the commission simply failed to convince people's deputies of the guilt of government members? [Hryb] Absolutely. Even the opposition's representative, People's Deputy Malashka, said that he would like to see the government dismissed, but would not vote in favor of anyone's dismissal without having documented proof of their guilt. [ZVYAZDA] Do you think Alyaksandr Lukashenka used this opportunity to begin his election campaign? [Hryb] It is hard to say. He may be the best person to answer this question. However, judging by all appearances -- yes, he has.
