This news proved that He Daoquan has been appointed Deputy Commander of the Beijing MR and concurrently Commander of the Beijing Garrison Command. He predecessor Lt.Gen. Zhang Zhijian was transferred to take the post of Political Commissar of the Chengdu MR. Joined Army in Hubei in 1951 Lt.Gen. He Daoquan was born in Huangpi County, Hubei Province. He was born in the same county as Xu Haidong who was granted the military rank of a full general when the Chinese Communists first started the military rank system in 1955. However, they were military officers of two different generations. When Xu Haidong led the 25th Army of the Red Army to march from Hubei, Henan and Anhui to northern Shaanxi, He Daoquan was born in that year. He had never participated in any of the campaigns in that year. In July 1951, two years after the founding of the PRC, He Daoquan, who was a 17-year old middle school student, joined the PLA in Hubei. He, together with Lt.Gen. Liu Jingsong who later became his superior, were sent to study at the PLA 27th Infantry School in Qiqihar, Heilongjiang. The 27th Infantry School grew out of the Military and Political Academy of the Northeastern Military District. It trained infantry company and platoon-level commanders. The 27th Infantry School was renamed the 7th Infantry School. In the school, the students received strict training from Soviet instructors and were prepared to fight in Korea at any time. Graduated From Infantry School in 1954 He Daoquan graduated from the infantry school in 1954. One of his veteran instructors was an officer who used to work for Gen. Feng Yuxiang. He hoped that all the graduates of this class would become generals. Soon after that He Daoquan was assigned to the 23rd Army Corps of the Chinese People's Volunteers Army as a platoon leader. The Korea War stopped on 27 July 1953. In order to prevent the war from breaking out once again, the Chinese Communists left some troops in North Korea. The 23rd Army Corps was one of the PLA units left in Korea. This army corps entered the Korea War on 5 September 1952. Originally it was the 4th Column of the East China Field Army officially formed in January 1947. It grew out of the guerilla units left in Fujian, Zhejiang and Jiangxi when the Red Army started the Long March in 1934. In the early stage of the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression, it was reorganized to become the 2d Detachment of the New 4th Army. Later, it became the 1st Division of the New 4th Army and the 1st Division of the Central China Field Army. It fought many battles under the direct command of Su Yu. When the civil war between the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communists broke out in an overall manner, it took part in the Suzhong, Laiwu, Menglianggu, Eastern Honan, Huaihai and Yangtze River Crossing campaigns. It remained one of the main forces of the 3d Field Army. Prior to the Korean Armistice, the 23d Army Corps took part in the third offensive campaign in the summer of 1953. At that time, Zhong Guochu was Corps Commander and Lu Sheng the Corps' political commissar. When he stationed in Korea with the 23d Army Corps, He Daoquan took the post of a staff training officer and department head in an infantry battalion. Withdraw From Korea With 23d Army Corps in 1958 He Daoquan withdrew from Korea with the 23d Army Corps and returned to China in March 1958. After returning to China, the 23d Army Corps stationed in Heilongjiang for a long time. It was placed under the command of the Shenyang MR. He Daoquan was the corps' deputy director and then director of its training department and Deputy Divisional Chief of Staff. During the Sino-Soviet border clash, he went to the frontier command post to direct the PLA units under his command. Outstanding Contributions to Automating Army Command System In 1975, He Daoquan held the post of divisional chief of staff. Later he was promoted to Deputy Division Commander and then Division Commander. During that period, he strived to achieve automation for the command system. After 1977, China's first automated military command vehicle appeared in his military compound. The automation engineering project for the command system was further developed after 1980. He Daoquan was promoted to Chief of Staff of the 23d Army Corps in 1983. Not long after that, he personally led the staff members in his office to visit the Academy of Military Sciences in Beijing, the National Defense University, the Air Force Academy, the Armored Force Engineering Institute and other military academies. Later he went to Xian and Changsha to learn from the experience of the University of Science and Technology for National Defense, and worked hard for command system automation. Build a Quick Response Regiment in the Army He Daoquan was promoted to Commander of the 23d Army Corps in 1985. On 8 February 1985, the JIEFANGJUNBAO carried a report on its frontpage, entitled: "A Battlefield without Smoke of Gunpowder." It reported on the automated command system network which included one army, three divisions and one regiment. The network was developed by the group army led by He Daoquan. Their "Battlefield No. 1" model was sent to Beijing for exhibition, attracting the attention of many foreign military attaches. Later, He Daoquan decided to establish a quick response regiment in the army, adding a pair of skis to the standard equipment for each soldier. His immediate target was to train this regiment to enhance its mobility on snow-covered land. His long-term target was to use motorized sledges with which all military equipment and personnel could move quickly from one place to another. The establishment of the quick response regiment and He Daoquan's concept on quick response won approval from Commander Liu Jingsong and Chief of Staff Li Haibo of the Shenyang MR. In the next winter, the division to which the quick response regiment belonged was supplied with skiing equipment. Each soldier got a pair of skis as a part of the standard equipment. At the 13th National CPC Congress held in November 1987, He Daoquan was elected an alternate member of the CPC Central Committee. After the PLA resumed the rank system in October 1988, he was awarded the rank of an army major general. At the 14th National CPC Congress held in October 1992, He Daoquan did not get elected as an alternate member, because he had left the 23d Army Corps and worked for the PLA General Staff Headquarters. Wu Yuqian, who replaced He Daoquan as the commander of the 23d Army Corps, was elected alternate member of the CPC Central Committee. Promoted to Army Lieutenant General in 1993 He Daoquan became Deputy Commander of the Beijing MR and concurrently Commander of the Beijing Garrison Command in January 1994. Prior to this, he was promoted to army Lieutenant General. This shows that his position in the army is rising. The Beijing Garrison Command which was established in January 1951 mainly shoulders the heavy responsibility of performing garrison duties and guarding the capital. Right now, it is placed under the command of the Beijing MR. At the same time, it is a department of the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee in handling military affairs. It is placed under the dual leadership of the Beijing MR and the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee. Chen Xitong, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee and member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, is concurrently the First Secretary of the Beijing Garrison Command's CPC committee. After the "Cultural Revolution," Fu Chongbi, Yan Tongmao, Dong Xuelin and others held this post before. In view of the importance of this position, there are good chances for the 59-year old He Daoquan to move upwards in the next few years. He Daoquan believes that we never complain about having too many friends, but we are not sure that one will never become our enemy. As long as border lines are not eliminated on earth, it will be impossible to eliminate frictions and conflicts for survival among the various nationalities. The armed forces must be ready to launch attacks at all times. Armed Forces Must Be Ready to Launch Attacks At All Times He Daoquan often sigh with a soldier's feelings about the perverse and changeable, but sometimes soft and tender history. He is not sure that he has reached the peak of his life, but he accepts the historic facts imposed on an individual. Because he believes that one must commit oneself for being a high-ranking general and that one's obligation is always commensurate with his power. One who wishes to become a general thinks more about honor, and one who is a general thinks more about one's responsibilities. He Daoquan is one who thinks more about his responsibilities. At a time when cries for peace are causing a temporary clamor, this general, laden with anxiety, is improving his military machinery all by himself night and day. He believes that his efforts and those of his colleagues will not be wasted. Once the page of "complex and changeable" history is turned over, our descendants will joyfully find that their world will be more secured than ever before.
