Interviewed by IRNA, Shirzadian stressed that Iran's nuclear program aims at peaceful utilization of nuclear energy and its activities are within the framework of the rules and regulations of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The daily which is simultaneously published in London and Beirut, in its Monday edition alleged that a Spanish nuclear firm is to provide Iran with necessary technology to transform its two nuclear installations for peaceful utilization of that energy into plants with military purposes. The daily claimed that the Spanish company is to sell diversion technology to IRAN under a 80 million dlrs [dollars] contract signed by an Iranian nuclear delegation in Madrid last month. The Islamic Republic of Iran is a signatory to the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and has repeatedly announced its firm adherence to it. The official noted that Iran has always proclaimed that its nuclear facilites are open to the IAEA and the agency's inspection teams have repeatedly confirmed that Iran's nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. Despite the fact that the Islamic Republic of Iran has repeatedly rejected such wild reports, some segments of the western media are trying to portray Iran as a country which is in quest for nuclear arms, regretted Shirzadian. In a separate statement today, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also rejected rumours circulated by 'AL-SHRAQ-UL-OWSAT' daily accusing Iran of seeking nuclear weapons. The statment dismissed as "baseless" the daily's allegations and called it part of the psychological war against Iran by the arrogant countries and the zionist regime. Certain media often lauch such fabrications of Iran's cooperation with a third party, in a bid to poison world public opinion against Iran's peaceful nuclear program and the peaceful ends of its foreign policy and they want to undermine its friendly relations with Spain, the Foreign Ministry said. On December 2, Iran's permanent representative at the United Nations, Kamal Kharrazi, announced at the general assembly meeting that Iran is firmly committed to the establishment of the Middle East as a nuclear free zone (NFZ).
