Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said the Arab League is very gravely concerned about this sorrowful incident. In a statement to MENA, 'Abd-al-Majid said he issued instructions to Ambassador Mahmud Abu-al-Nasr, head of the Arab League Bureau in New York, to coordinate with representatives of the Islamic Conference Organization, the OAU, and the Arab countries at the United Nations to submit the issue to the Security Council to decide what to do about this assault and to draw the world's attention to it via the Security Council, the highest international body. The Arab League secretary general added that this act proves again that the settlers flout security and public order in the occupied territories while the Israeli authorities overlook their crimes. He pointed out that this situation causes things to escalate dangerously and threatens the peace process. Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said the Israeli Government must immediately adopt measures to protect the Palestinians from such hostile acts and that the world community must bear its responsibility and provide international protection for the Palestinians living under occupation. He remarked that this is necessary because Israel is unable to maintain order in those areas in line with international agreements and the Human Rights Charter. 'Abd-al-Majid stressed the importance of adopting measures to prevent a recurrence of these hostile actions.
