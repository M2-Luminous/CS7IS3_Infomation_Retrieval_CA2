[Text] The most discussed subject in political circles these days is: What does Kanshi Ram really want? Does he want the SP-BSP coalition government to serve its five years in the state or does he want to topple Mulayam Singh's government when he gets the opportunity and then hold mid-term elections? If we pay close attention to Kanshi Ram's speeches, we get the impression that he is committed to the government and, at the same time, is working against it. The politics of this state seems to be trapped in this web. The BSP leaders seem to believe that it was their cooperation and support that helped make Mulayam Singh the chief minister of the state. No one can have any objection to their desire to live in this delusion. There are 67 BSP legislators now and [the party] is in the third position in the state. If we look at the pre-election climate and analyze it , it would not be inappropriate to say that while the BJP was trying to get back its old seats, the strong support was for Mulayam Singh. He had the support of farmers, students, the youth, minorities, and even traders. There were two reasons for this. First was Mulayam's clear plan. People general believed that there was no difference between what he said and what he did. The second was that the voters who were disappointed with the BJP saw Mulayam Singh as the only alternative. The Congress and Janata Dal leaders failed to win people's trust. The BSP already was working with the SP. One quality of Mulayam Singh is that when he trusts someone, he trust that person fully. He excuses all his crimes. Mulayam Singh also recognizes favors done for him. Whatever goals the BSP had in mind when it cooperated with Mulayam Singh, the important thing for Mulayam Singh is that this party helped him when he needed strong support. The cooperation between the two parties actually started during BJP rule when Kanshi Ram had ran for Lok Sabha election from Itarsi, Mulayam Singh's home constituency. At that time, observers had said that Mulayam Singh had secretly endorsed Kanshi Ram instead of his own party's candidate for future political reasons. Kanshi Ram's efforts to become a lawmaker finally were successful and he began to shine like an important star in the political horizon. The SP-BSP coalition was formed later during the governor's rule in the state, and Mulayam Singh and Kanshi Ram addressed their joint rallies. As said earlier, this time around, Mulayam Singh let BSP candidates run from their desired election districts that included many areas of northeastern Uttar Pradesh. The SP workers and an influential group of backwards worked as hard to help BSP candidates win as they did for their own candidates in order to get their leader appointed to the highest position in the state. Mulayam Singh himself toured the whole state several times to glean support. In the end, the SP-BSP coalition won 175 seas and the BJP won 176 seats in the vidhan sabha. The Janata Dal, the Congress Party, and the communists faired very badly. The comments that the BSP leaders and legislators made in public soon after the coalition government was formed, suddenly heated the political atmosphere in the state. This became a cause of concern for Mulayam Singh who favored socialism. Finally, Mulayam Singh had to announce in dozens of meetings and in the vidhan sabha that he is a socialist and did not support caste politics. He said that his goal was always to build the society and not break it. He believed in breaking up the caste system and building the social structure. He also had to repeat again and again that he was not the chief minister of SP-BSP coalition but of the 140 million people in the state. He believed that his first duty was to get justice for every group and would not let unfair treatment to anyone because of his or her caste. Mulayam Singh also tried to put salve on the wounds of the state's bureaucracy which was disgusted by the statements issued by BSP leaders. The political dilemma for Mulayam Singh is that he is not in a position to say anything openly. He also tries to admonish BSP legislators and cabinet members as a good friend. At times, he becomes a prey of these legislators' mistakes. One such mistake was made by V.R. Verma when he presented the thank-you resolution at the end of the governor's speech. He made a comment on Govind Ballabh Pant, the first chief minister of the state and great freedom fighter. Actually this comment was not his own; it was a statement made by Dr. Ambedekar. This was what happened in the House. Outside the House, Ms. Mayavati, the national general secretary of the BSP, used the kind of language while talking to newsmen in Lucknow that not only hurt the feelings of the Congress Party but of the whole nation. She called Mahatma Gandhi, whom the people call Bapu [father] with love and devotion and whose love for scheduled castes and tribes is known to all, the greatest enemy of this group. Mayavati said that Mahatma Gandhi had insulted this group by giving them the name of Harijan and tried to undermine this group. She gave a strange reasoning in this context and asked if Gandhi liked the word Harijan so much then why did not he add the word Harijan to his name. She said that time was not far when Gandhism in this country will be replaced with "Ambedakarism." Mayavati, just like her leader Kanshi Ram, attacked the state government in which her own party is also involved. She alleged that the BSP cabinet members were not allowed to function independently. What is more, she said, the minister did not have the authority to replace the officials in their departments. She also said that the chief minister must change his habit of forcing SP ministers on the BSP ministers. Mayavati said that most of her and Kanshi Ram's time is wasted listening to complaints made by the BSP legislators, ministers, and workers while the goal for the BSP is not just to have a government in this state but take control of the whole nation. At the same time, Mayavati also says that she is satisfied with the chief minister's work! Mayavati's above statement perhaps is influenced by her leader Kanshi Ram's speech given in Allahabad. Kanshi Ram had openly expressed his anger at Mulayam Singh in his speech in Allahabad on 5 March. He said that the chief minister did not pay any head to the BSP ministers and legislators. This had made the position of BSP ministers lower than the office peons (the BSP has no responsibility). Kanshi Ram openly said that if the promises that were made at the time of SP-BSP coalition were not followed up then this government will be uprooted. He said that he was not a follower of such a government. Perhaps, Mayavati had kept this in mind and told the newsmen that if Mulayam Singh did not change his attitude, it will not take much time to implement what Kanshi Ram had said in Allahabad. The BSP leaders say two different things in the same breath. They criticize Mulayam Singh's style of administration and also express satisfaction at his achievements. Kanshi Ram also says that he will not let the Mulayam Singh government fall and that the coalition government will rule for full five years of its term. The most interesting aspect of this is that Mulayam Singh was present on the stage when Kanshi Ram had made that announcement in Allahabad. The BSP people have a thick bundle of complaints against Mulayam Singh. They say that the BSP minister given district responsibilities have only one or two districts under them compared to five or six districts given to the SP ministers. The officials do not give as much serious attention to the BSP ministers as do they to the SP minister. They also say that the BSP ministers of state that are working with the SP cabinet level ministers have been given tasks that are done by deputy ministers. The BSP believes that the Yadav caste has control over the backward votes, and the number of Kurmi voters is only slightly less then the Yadavs. Therefore, the BSP is looking at the voters in this group. Perhaps, that is why the BSP has appointed Kurmi caste persons to the positions of state general secretary and the legislative group leadership. The president of the BSP is Jang Bahadur Patel, its general secretary is Sonelal Patel, and the leader of the legislative group os Ramlakhan Verma. The Kurmi conferences have been held in Bareilly, Benares, and Sonbhadar districts. The BSP is planning similar conferences in other districts also. It is not that Chief Minister Mulayam Singh is unaware of all these developments. He has given the responsibility to lure the Kurmi voters and officials to Beni Prasad Verma, the legislative program minister. Another BSP action has become a subject of discussions in political circles. This action is related to criticism of top Congress Party leadership. This is not limited to former leaders; present leaders are also included in it. They have been attacking Prime Minister Narasimha Rao from the very beginning. It is a known fact that Congress legislators support the government and defend it from the sharp attacks by the BJP. Mayavati attacked Pramod Tiwari, the leader of this group, very strongly. This is neither timely nor an appropriate strategy for the coalition government that has the majority in the House because of the support from the Congress Party and the Janata Dal. It is especially wrong at a time when the budget session is in progress and the government had to struggle during each budget hearing. We will see now what kind of shrewdness Mulayam Singh demonstrates in keeping the Congress Party with him. At the same time, the chief minister has to satisfy the BSP leaders, ministers, and legislators.
