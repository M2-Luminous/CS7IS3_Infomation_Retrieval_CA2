One of the wonders of arrogant powers in justifying their worldwide plundering interests is the use of political concepts with various, and occasionally contradictory, meanings which create a convoluted and complex situation and paves the way for them to capitalize and misuse. For example, when the expression war and peace loses its meaning in Somalia and western forces' invasion of Somalia is said to be to restore peace, within that context, war and peace would be difficult to appraise in any part of the world. An expression which, more than war and peace, has lost its true meaning and is used in various, and sometimes contradictory, forms is the concept of human rights. The best evidence of that fact is the present situation in occupied Palestine. Murder, assassination, breaking of limbs, arrest and torture of Palestinian combatants, and dozens of other inhuman acts are the daily achievements of Zionism, of which few are unaware. But, despite those terroristic activities, which take place officially and semi-officially, the violation of human rights in the region is not on the agenda of any organization defending human rights. The deadly silence of international forums proclaiming to be defenders of human rights places a heavy onus on freedom-seeking people of the world, to perform their humanitarian duty and bring the oppressed cries of the Muslim people of Palestine to the world's ears. Ruyvaran, Middle East analyst of the New Research Group, describes the situation in occupied Palestine and the international forums overlooking Zionist crimes. He says: Perhaps one could sum up that the Muslim people of Palestine are deprived of their right to live, let alone their other rights. Basically, the policies of the Zionist regime in the occupied territories are not even comparable to the racist policies of the apartheid system in South Africa. In the occupied territories, in accordance with the planned policies of the Zionist regime, the people of Palestine are deprived of a large portion of their political, economic and social rights, and basically face unequal conditions in matters of education, hygiene and employment. Not even once have the international organizations and forums objected to the policy of rendering the Muslim people of Palestine homeless and settling migrant Zionists in homes which used to belong to Palestinians. This is despite the fact that such a policy contravenes the fourth article of the Geneva Convention. Generally speaking, this policy entails the disruption of the demographic composition of Palestine, and this is an objective which as a whole constitutes one of the indisputable foundations of the Zionist process of thought. Placing Palestinians in protected zones and preventing their movement in the occupied Palestine unless with the permission of the military governors, has in practice deprived the people of Palestine from enjoying equal opportunities in jobs, education, and health. This behavior can only be analyzed within the framework of the systematic and wholistic policies of the Zionists, the main objective of which is the political, economic, and scientific impoverishment of Palestinians. Equally important, by training and arming the Zionist settlers on the one hand, and then on the other hand depriving the Palestinians from the right to defend themselves in that any of them who dares carry even knives and other non-firearms is punished, the Zionist regime has formed a kind of relationship between the Palestinians and the Zionist settlers which basically entails that any dispute is invariable resolved by coercion and the law of the jungle. The tragedy of the massacre of fasting worshippers in the tomb of Abraham, even if one accepts the Zionist regime's claim that the crime was committed by an individual, was a natural outcome of the aforementioned official policies. So long as these policies remain in force, similar tragedies will unfortunately happen again. Of course one must not overlook America's role amid all this. Although Washington was probably more informed than any other party about current developments in the occupied territories, but it made certain arrangements two years ago to put pressure on the UN General Assembly to rescind its resolution which equated Zionism with racism. The International Human Rights Committee's turning a blind eye to that reality has thus far been an encouragement to the Zionist regime to pursue its policies through further violation of the rights of the Muslim Palestinian people. Maybe that is just the the reason why those international forums cannot be considered blameless in the atrocities that are daily happening in occupied Palestine. Mr. Mohammadi, from our country's foreign ministry, has this to say about the issue: [Begin Mohammadi recording] Human rights and the Palestine issue is one of the United Nation's complicated issues. That is, on the one hand the Special Committee of 24 for Decolonization -- which is one of the main UN General Assembly' committees -- condemns Israel every year as a violator of human rights and on the other hand the UN Human Rights Commission fails to take any measures to prevent human right violations in the occupied territories. That can be interpreted in this way that the legal aspect of human rights differs from its political aspect when applied to various states. That is, wherever the political will of those powers which are at the top of the United Nations and international organizations is in line with a state and those powers are in agreement with such a state then the powers take no decisive and urgent action to prevent human right violation and are not even willing to issue any binding resolution. There human rights is merely confined to its legal aspect and is never used as a political weapon to discredit and isolate such states. In the last half century the world public opinion has witnessed the violation of human rights -- in its worst possible form -- in the occupied territories. On the other hand it does not seem that anyone can remember that up till now any special envoy to have taken any action on human right violations in the occupied territories on behalf of the United Nations or the Human Rights Commission. Only on one occasion, when 400 Palestinians were expelled from their homeland, the UN Security Council adopted an advisory resolution saying the Palestinian should be returned to their homeland. And even that was implemented conditionally -- given the occupiers method of approach to the resolution. That is, the occupiers decided how they were to return to their homeland. Therefore we can draw this conclusion that those states which are supporters of the Qods occupying regime and are at the top of international organizations do not in anyway make use of the political aspect of human rights against the image and credibility of the Qods occupier regime and fail to adopt serious decisions and measures for human rights to be observed in the occupied territories. [end recording] The political and discriminatory approach by world powers towards human rights issue and their use of it as a pressure lever to secure their own plundering interests distances the Human Rights Committee and Amnesty International Organization from their titles every day and renders them devoid of humanitarian objectives.
