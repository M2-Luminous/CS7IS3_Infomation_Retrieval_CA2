[passage omitted] The faith campaign [al-hamlah al-imaniyah], whose positive results have been felt by our upright leader President Saddam Husayn, shows the leader president thinks highly of the faith issue, which is represented by the call to follow the teachings of the Holy Koran, not just repeat them. The Koranic courses, which will be held for children in mosques during the Summer holidays, will consist of the true thought which came in the revelation to Prophet Muhammad, may the peace and blessings of God be upon him. The call of faith has come in response to the revelation's aims of bringing up children according to the teachings of the Koran. This call has come at the right time, when the nation is facing the revelation's enemies, the enemies of justice and the people. The leader's ambitions will be achieved by the preachers in the field. The Koranic sessions are only one aspect of bringing up children according to the teachings of the Koran. Therefore, we appeal to guardians to urge their children to respond to this luminous call, which the leader and God's faithful servant Saddam Husayn has adopted and advocated in order to bring up a faithful generation that will love God, the homeland, and the leader through the sublime principles they will learn from the Holy Book they will read. This will prepare them to resist the evils of the enemies. When the young generation is strong by its faith and its struggle for the sake of principles, the enemies will retreat. This is the state we are all struggling for so the plots will backfire on the enemies. As the leader president said: We are gaining the youths in order to guarantee the future. [passage omitted]
