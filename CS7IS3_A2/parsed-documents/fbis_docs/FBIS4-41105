In the last three months the total volume of currency retained by exporting organizations rather than handed over is $70 million. A total of 40 organizations are among the guilty ones. But according to observers, the volume of currency which has not been handed over in detected cases may seem paltry compared with the amounts of currency which simply disappear. One wonders whether the control mechanisms introduced are effective.
