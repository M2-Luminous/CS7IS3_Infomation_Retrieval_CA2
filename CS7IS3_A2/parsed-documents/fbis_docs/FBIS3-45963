The instructions require all PLA units to guide themselves with Mao Zedong's military thinking and Deng Xiaoping's concept of army building in the new period, to keep to the correct orientation of military training, and to further increase the intensity and depth of training reform so as to improve the fighting capabilities of the armed forces as a whole. The General Staff Department calls on leaders at all levels in the armed forces to focus their attention on changes in the objective situation, the characteristics of modern warfare, the actual conditions of our army building, and the new situations and characteristics of army building and combat in the new period; to conscientiously implement the series instructions issued by Jiang Zemin and other leaders of the Central Military Commission; and to give more macro-guidance for training. Keeping reality and development in mind, all PLA units, academies, and schools should quicken their pace of progress, deepen their reforms, and strive to explore new ways of training. In connection with cadres' in-service training, they should conduct training in high technology, suiting such training to different trainees at various levels. All military academies and schools should focus their attention on the developing students' intelligence and improving their abilities. They should do a good job of overall planning for optimizing the knowledge and ability of cadres at various levels. The General Staff Department stresses: In training management, it is necessary to improve training mechanisms, rules, and regulations; to formulate policies and measures to link actual training achievements with the immediate interests of officers and men; to increase the degree of difficulty and intensity in training; to improve the basic quality of all PLA units and their fighting capabilities; and to explore ways to vanquish the enemy with existing weapons and equipment. Efforts should be made to step up the coordinated training of the Army, Navy, and Air Force and to keep improving their fighting capabilities. It is essential to pay attention to both army building and management, to raise the efficiency of training, and to strengthen and improve ideological and political work in this regard to arouse the enthusiasm of officers and men for military training.
