FR940405-1-00018 FR940405-1-00005 SBA certifies that this proposed rule, if promulgated in final form, will not constitute a significant regulatory action for the purposes of Executive Order 12866, since the proposed change is not likely to result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more. While the proposed rule is intended to make eligible more media small business concerns, it is reasonable to assume that SBA will not be requested to process a disproportionate number of additional media loan applications. For example, in fiscal 1991, 1992 and 1993, respectively, SBA guaranteed 202, 199 and 241 section 7(a) loans to eligible bookstores, advertising agencies, video stores and vocational schools. The aggregate amounts of the SBA guaranteed portions for those three years for such businesses were, respectively, $27.7, $28.7 and $35.2 million. SBA certifies that the proposed rule, if promulgated in final form, would not impose additional reporting or recordkeeping requirements which would be subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. chapter 35. SBA certifies that this proposed rule would not have federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with Executive Order 12612. Further, for purposes of Executive Order 12778, SBA certifies that this proposed rule, if promulgated in final form, is drafted, to the extent practicable, in accordance with the standards set forth in section 2 of that Order. (Catalogue of Federal Domestic Assistance Programs, No. 59.012, Small Business Loans) List of Subjects in 13 CFR Part 120 Loan programs/businesses; Small businesses.

Section 120.101&hyph;2 would be amended by removing paragraph (b) in its entirety, and redesignating paragraphs (c) through (h) as paragraphs (b) through (g). Dated: March 17, 1994. Erskine B.
