[Begin Liu recording] Today, at a time when people of various nationalities throughout the province are comprehensively implementing the instructions of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and are emancipating their minds, seeking truth from facts, widening the opening up scope, and seizing the opportunity to expedite their development, the Second Session of the Seventh Provincial CPPCC Committee has opened in Guizhou. On behalf of the Guizhou Provincial CPC Committee, I extend my warm congratulations to this session and my kind regards to all CPPCC members and comrades present here. The year of 1994 will be the first year to comprehensively implement the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee as well as the first year to comprehensively implement all the tasks set by the Seventh Provincial CPC Congress. To fulfill this year's tasks, the provincial party committee has explicitly proposed that, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, we should implement the instructions of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, focus on economic construction, further emancipate our minds, seek truth from facts, expedite reform, widen opening up, boost our morale, work in a down-to-earth manner, and promote the province's socialist market economy, party building, spiritual civilization, and the formation of the democratic and legal system. [passage omitted] We should correctly handle the relations between reform, development, and stability and unite people of all nationalities throughout the province in preserving and developing the political situation characterized by stability and unity. To provide a good social and political environment, we should do two types of work simultaneously, lay equal stress on both, and carry forward socialist spiritual civilization. All this has set higher demands on the provincial CPPCC this year. In this year, CPPCC organizations at all levels throughout the province should conscientiously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, profoundly implement the instructions of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, conscientiously carry out all the tasks set by the Seventh Provincial CPC Congress, uphold the party's basic line, further abide by and improve the CPC-led multiparty cooperative and political consultative system, and raise the province's patriotic united front work to a new level. [passage omitted] In cooperation with the relevant departments, the CPPCC organizations at all levels throughout the province should do a good job in accommodating overseas friends who come to Guizhou for family visits, sight-seeing, and trade discussions; should promote scientific, technological, and cultural exchanges with foreign countries; and should encourage more friends to invest in Guizhou. They should tell potential investors about the party's policy of peaceful reunification and one country, two systems and should describe for them the province's scenic spots and the people's habits and customs to expand our influence. [passage omitted] CPPCC organizations at all levels should conscientiously study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, should study and implement the party's line, policies, and principles, should further improve their ideological and theoretical level, should improve their ability to participate in the deliberation of state affairs, and should make greater contributions to the province's two civilizations. All levels of party committees and governments should further improve their understanding of the CPPCC's nature, position, and mission, should seriously implement the CPC-led multiparty cooperative and political consultative system, and should vigorously support and propagate the CPPCC, political consultative, and democratic supervisory systems. [passage omitted] Party committees at all levels should strengthen their leadership over CPPCC organizations -- first and foremost their political leadership over CPPCC organizations. CPPCC organizations at all levels should carry out their work according to the party's line, principles, and policies by focusing on economic construction and the work of party's committees and governments. All levels of party committees and governments should solicit the opinions of CPPCC organizations, democratic parties, mass organizations, and nonparty patriotic individuals. The relevant departments should seriously handle important suggestions and criticism raised by CPPCC organizations and nonparty individuals. Difficulties that CPPCC members encounter in work and life should be resolved with every possible effort. [end recording]
