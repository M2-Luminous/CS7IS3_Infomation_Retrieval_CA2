When I read excerpts from some of the speeches and presentations there were of course some interesting moments and even some idealistic notions, but in addition to that a degree of uncertainty and apprehension about the question of the future of a new, modern Europe and our role within it. [Havel] I did not attend the entire conference, but from what I heard I get the impression that it was a very interesting and important conference. There were some interesting personalities here from all over Europe, some of whom I met and spoke to, and for me the staging of the conference was a kind of signal to consider certain things. For example, I realized, and also said so when I was there briefly at the conference, I realized that a temporary, transitional phase had ended, not just in our country, but also in others that have shaken off communism. We must bear in mind the monolithic power that existed here and had at its disposal all the instruments of power -- there was no system of political plurality. When that power collapsed organizations grew up to oppose it and sought a means of organized expression of their will. That was the period of the big mass movements, such as Solidarity in Poland or Civic Forum in our country, which constituted a kind of improvised revolutionary counterbalance to the ruling power. It was clear that that was merely a bridging period leading to more normal political circumstances in which the spectrum of political parties would become defined and in which political parties would grow up around various programs. For the first two years we lived through this truly transitional phase, full of various anomalies that do not belong to normal, stable democratic life, and it was a very important period. Nowadays we sometimes have a tendency to make fun of it, to turn our noses up at the whole period of revolutionary euphoria and the idea of that kind of general understanding, but I do not think that that is entirely fair. Let us remember that that was the time when all the fundamental changes to the system were made. That was the time when the character of our economic reforms was agreed upon, when fundamental legislation was passed, when the transformation of the entire legal system began, and when we established ourselves on the international scene as an independent country. But it was a period of transition, to which I gave the working label of "post communist," by which I wished to express its unusual character. We have had two sets of free elections, we have normal, structured political parties which compete for power in those elections, and we are genuinely becoming, as far as all the external signs of political life are concerned, a normal democratic country. I think it is important to realize this, and when our politicians are sometimes accused of being arrogant and people say that we are always praising ourselves and that we are somehow conceited, I think it is possibly a little unjust. We are trying to truthfully reflect the situation and to persuade others to keep up with the times, so to speak, and to realize that we are genuinely further than we were at the beginning of 1990. The above is not true just of the Czech Republic, which in the table of indicators is doing relatively well, but also of those neighboring countries where the fact that so-called post-communist parties are winning elections is causing a certain nervousness. I admit that that does not make me all that nervous. I do not see in it any sign of a return to the past or anything like that. I would prefer to see it as precisely an expression of normality. That is how democracies work, sometimes the left wins and sometimes the right, and we have to become accustomed to that. [passage omitted]
