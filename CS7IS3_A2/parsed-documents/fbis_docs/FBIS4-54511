According to current estimates, areas sown to grain crops have increased by 70,000 hectares, with the greatest expansion occurring in rye crops (increased by more than 20 percent). Winter wheat areas (also used for food purposes) have increased by approximately 2.6 percent over last year. The average yield of grain crops is being estimated at a level of 4.12 tons per hectare (as opposed to last year's 4.05 tons per hectare), in view of the improved status of winter crops, compared with the comparable period of last year. The attainment of the anticipated volume of the harvest is also based on this year's better development of precipitation in the winter months. Imports of grain crops last year amounted to a total of 490,000 tons, which is approximately 350,000 tons more than was the case in the previous period, noted Stehlik. Exports (including transfers), on the other hand, declined from 493,000 tons in 1992 to last year's figure of 45,800 tons. "The consequence of such low imports resulted in the overall decline in the use of grain crops in this country by almost 10 percent," the deputy minister stressed. Last year, in terms of overall consumption, reserves rose by approximately 288,000 tons--that is, approximately to a level of 20 percent. "We are thus reaching the optimum level--the low amount of reserves last year was virtually critical," added Stehlik.
