Vyacheslav Chornovil, leader of the opposition movement "Rukh", agreed with him saying "the presidential elections in the Crimea should have been cancelled before they started". Yuri Shukhevich, head of the ultra-right paramilitary UNA-UNSO organization, went further saying the Crimean developments were "Israeli intrigues". Several west-Ukrainian politicians questioned by ITAR-TASS on the matter, joined in opinion that the results of the Crimean elections are only the beginning of the federalization of Ukraine. Moreover, they predicted that following the Crimean example, the next province to claim the sovereignity will be Galicia or the Transcarpathian part of the Ukraine. Last year the attempts to proclaim there an independent state were strangled by the parliament.
