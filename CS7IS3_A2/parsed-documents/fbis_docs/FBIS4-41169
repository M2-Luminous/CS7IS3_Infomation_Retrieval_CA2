Kolosova, and others] [Text] Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Krylov described the citizenship act passed in Latvia as inhuman. He told Interfax that the act turned numerous residents of Latvia into stateless persons, made it impossible for them to become citizens and imposed naturalization quotas. He said the law did nothing for the image Latvia was striving for itself as a stronghold of democracy. Krylov said that the act was aimed against the Russian-speaking residents of Latvia. He explained that if it became law, Russian- Latvian relations would deteriorate, the visit of Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to Latvia would most likely not take place and numerous agreements made during the recent visit of Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis to Moscow would be in doubt. He did not rule out the possibility that Russia would lift Latvia's most favored nation status. Krylov said he did not believe, however, that the citizenship act would influence the deadline for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia. He said that Russia intended to raise the question of human rights violations in Latvia in the CSCE and other international organizations.
