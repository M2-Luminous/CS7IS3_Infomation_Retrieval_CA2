According to data provided by the SHCP [Finance and Public Credit Secretariat], the INEGI [National Institute of Statistics, Geography, and Information Science], the Bank of Mexico, and private consulting companies, the federal government will support the awaited economic takeoff by reprogramming public expenditures for the rest of 1994. Reaching satisfactory statistical levels with export revenues has also being taken into account, although this mechanism has created something of a paradox, because the economic opening, by replacing consumer expenditures, has failed to remove the obstacles that impede domestic production and job creation. Authorities believe that domestic supply and demand will improve by year end thanks to a combination of these two factors; namely, current public expenditures, estimated at "to what prudence dictates," and revenues from exports. To that effect, the GDP is expected, statistically speaking, to reach an annual growth rate of 1.0 to 1.9 percent. That is the best case scenario. But even if the economic recovery were to reach the best estimates for the whole year, the population's demand for jobs would still not be met and would increase the government's social debt that has accrued throughout the current presidential term. According to these sources, the reorganization of expenditures and export revenues, in theory, would achieve the ultimate goal of formally reviving the basic indicators: supply and demand. Abel Hibert, an analyst for Vector Brokerage House, says that statistically speaking, this recovery is important because the two indicators represent 80 percent of GDP. The analyst added that based on the gap in which public spending growth multipliers operate, it is conceivable that "the national economy will grow at reasonable rates" beginning in the fourth quarter of the year. This will be possible insofar as the best possible scenario includes complete political stability. Despite the sectorial heterogeneity, official reports on the first semester of 1994 indicate that the economic deceleration has already reached its lowest point. Nevertheless, the reactivation strategy adopted at the beginning of the year has yielded none of the expected results. Domestic consumption has stagnated, the strongest evidence of which is the commercialization of durable goods. Domestic sales in the automotive industry dropped 11.1 percent from January to April, a situation that has continued since the third quarter of 1993. The outlook is no better for nondurable goods. Perhaps the situation has been aggravated by imported goods, which divert consumer preferences and lead to serious contradictions in local production by swelling inventories and deterring productive investment. Speaking of investment, preliminary SHCP and INEGI reports show that a considerable number of the projects announced late in 1993 -- all except those of the country's biggest and most profitable enterprises -- were postponed indefinitely. The construction industry, a sector that more accurately represents investment, achieved 4.5 percent growth at the close of the first quarter, mainly as the result of the construction of petrochemical plants, highways, and public projects, but clearly not because of the construction of public sector projects. The Construction Industry Chamber said the sector experienced a significant drop in the four-month period, resulting in the unemployment of 58 percent of its members. The investment sector was further weakened by the fact that although steel production increased 11.3 percent until April, cement production barely increased to 4.5 percent, a figure lower than the 6.5 percent registered during the last quarter of 1993 and the first quarter of 1994. "A high degree of consumer debt, increased unemployment, a lack of job security, macroeconomic uncertainties, and higher interest rates have combined forces to postpone purchases of durable goods," Hibert pointed out. A similar situation is unfolding in the field of investment. SCHP sources have admitted that the vicious circle of scant demand and reduced investment leads to lower supply and, consequently, stagnation. The public expenditure reorganization, which, particularly in view of the Chiapas crisis, had been regarded along with the external sector as a catalyst for immediate growth, has not yielded the desired results even though the deterioration of the main economic indicators has stopped. The conditions do not currently exist to attain the growth, consumption, and investment objectives presented to Congress in the economic program. What is worse, we must now add to this situation the authorities' decision to tighten restrictions on the handling of money with the purpose of checking exchange and financial pressures. The method used during the first half of the year will continue until late into the six-year term as the result of both poor domestic demand and the prevailing instability. This will make it possible for the new government to begin its administration with rising rates, as has happened in the previous three administrations.
