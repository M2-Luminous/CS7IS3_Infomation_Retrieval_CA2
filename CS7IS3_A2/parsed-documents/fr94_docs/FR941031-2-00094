WCL has certified that: (1) No local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) any overhead traffic on the line can be rerouted; (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or a State or local government entity acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period; and (4) the requirements at 49 CFR 1105.7 (service of environmental report on agencies), 49 CFR 1105.8 (service of historic report on State Historic Preservation Officer), 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication), and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (service of verified notice on governmental agencies) have been met. As a condition to use of this exemption, any employee affected by the abandonment shall be protected under Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen, 360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately protects affected employees, a petition for partial revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. Provided no formal expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistance has been received, this exemption will be effective on November 30, 1994 (unless stayed pending reconsideration). Petitions to stay that do not involve environmental issues, 1 formal expressions of intent to file offers of financial assistance under 49 CFR 1152.27(c)(2), 2 and trail use/rail banking statements under 49 CFR 1152.29 must be filed by November 10, 1994. 3 Petitions to reopen or requests for public use conditions under 49 CFR 1152.28 must be filed by November 21, 1994, with: Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. 1 A stay will be issued routinely where an informed decision on environmental issues (whether raised by a party or by the Commission's Section of Environmental Analysis in its independent investigation) cannot be made prior to the effective date of the notice of exemption. See Exemption of Out-of-Service Rail Lines, 5 I.C.C.2d 377 (1989). Any entity seeking a stay on environmental grounds is encouraged to file promptly so that the Commission may act on the request before the effective date. 2 See Exempt. of Rail Abandonment_Offers of Finan. Assist., 4 I.C.C.2d 164 (1987). 3 The Commission will accept late-filed trail use statements so long as it retains jurisdiction. A copy of any petition filed with the Commission should be sent to applicant's representative: Janet H. Gilbert, Wisconsin Central Ltd., P. O. Box 5062, Rosemont, IL 60017&hyph;5062. If the notice of exemption contains false or misleading information, use of the exemption is void ab initio . WCL has filed an environmental report which addresses the abandonment's effects, if any, on the environment or historic resources. The Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) will issue an environmental assessment (EA) by November 4, 1994. Interested persons may obtain a copy of the EA from SEA by writing to it at (Room 3219, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423) or by calling Elaine Kaiser, Chief, SEA at (202) 927&hyph;6248.
