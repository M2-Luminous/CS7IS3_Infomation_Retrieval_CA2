FR940124-0-00026 FR940124-0-00003 Justification for Interim Rule In general, the Department publishes a rule for public comment before issuing a rule for effect, in accordance with its own regulations on rulemaking at 24 CFR part 10. However, section 132(g) requires that the Secretary implement this demonstration by issuing interim regulations, allowing for a 60-day public comment period. The Department has adopted a policy of setting an expiration date for an interim rule unless a final rule is published before that date. This ``sunset'' provision appears in §907.1(b) of the interim rule, and provides that the interim rule will expire on a date 12 months from publication. Section 132(g) also requires that the interim regulation be effective upon issuance. The Department interprets this provision as superseding the requirement for a 30-day delay between publication and effective date of a rule required by section 7(o) of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act. Other Matters National Environmental Policy Act A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR part 50 implementing section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4332. The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection and copying between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays at the Office of Rules Docket Clerk, 451 Seventh Street SW., room 10276, Washington, DC 20410&hyph;0500. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this interim rule before publication and by approving it certifies that the interim rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The interim rule is limited in scope to Omaha, Nebraska. Executive Order 12606, The Family The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that the provisions of this interim rule will not have a significant impact on family formation, maintenance or well being, except to the extent that the program authorized by the interim rule will increase homeownership opportunities for low-income families in Omaha, Nebraska. Any such impact is beneficial and merits no further review under the Order. Executive Order 12611, Federalism The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12611, Federalism, has determined that the policies contained in this interim rule will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions, or the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.
