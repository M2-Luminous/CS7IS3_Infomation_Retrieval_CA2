FR940725-2-00114 FR940725-2-00068 The risks posed by uncompared trades and by the long span of time between trade execution and trade comparison ( i.e., as long as five business days for equity trades) came under intense scrutiny after the Market Break of October 1987. The leading studies of the Market Break of 1987 identified uncompared trades as a major stress point in post-trade processing which, together with the unprecedented trading volume and the unprecedented price volatility during the Market Break, posed an unacceptable threat to the marketplace. 5 The Commission, in its recommendations to Congress in February of 1988, proposed that markets accelerate their efforts to compare all trades on trade date. 6 5 E.g., Division of Market Regulation, The October 1987 Market Break, at 10&hyph;2 to 10&hyph;12 (February 1989); see also Division of Market Regulation, Market Analysis of October 13 and 16, 1989, 117&hyph;129 (December 1990). 6 Testimony on the Securities and Exchange Commission's Recommendations Regarding the October 1987 Market Break delivered by David S. Ruder, Chairman, Commission, before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs at 23&hyph;24 (February 3, 1988). Since 1988, NSCC, among others, has sought to improve clearing operations and to reduce exposure to losses associated with market volatility occurring during the period between execution and settlement. The NSCC, together with the NYSE and Amex, reduced the comparison cycle in stocks first from T+5 to T+3 in 1989 and then to T+1 in 1990. 7 7 Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 26785 (May 4, 1989), 54 FR 20221 [File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;89&hyph;02] (order approving proposed rule change) and 27074 (July 28, 1989), 54 FR 32405 [File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;89&hyph;04] (order approving proposed rule change). As stated above, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change, by shortening the NYSE and Amex comparison cycles for equity trades from T+1 to trade date, will make the comparison process safer in terms of the risks resulting from market price volatility. The Commission believes that the proposal will offer additional protection to NSCC and investors, brokers, and other persons that safeguard investors' funds and facilitate investors' transactions. The proposal also should help in the implementation under the Act of Rule 15c&hyph;6 which requires settlement of securities transactions on T+3 effective on June 1, 1995. 8 In the Commission's view, this proposal should help provide fundamental and important improvements to the marketplace. 8 17 CFR 240.15c&hyph;6. Fed. Sec. L. Rep. ¶23,351 at 20,582 (Oct. 1993); Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33023 (October 6, 1993), 58 FR 52891. NSCC has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of the filing in the Federal Register. Accelerated approval will permit NSCC to coordinate with the NYSE and Amex in the early phases of those exchanges' efforts to move toward trade-date comparison. Therefore, the Commission believes there is good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of the filing. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act 9 that the above-mentioned proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;94&hyph;07) be, and hereby is, approved. 9 15 U.S.C. §78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 10 10 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
