This is in response to the situation in which trade in services, such as finance, communications, and transport, has become active with the advance of internationalization, and the pace of trade expansion in this area is expected to exceed that in merchandise trade. With the aim of increasing transparency of services trade, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) formulated new standards last autumn and asked member nations to revise the method of computing their statistics on international balance of payments in accord with the standards. Taking the same steps as the United States and Europe, Japan also plans to revise its statistics. The government will begin the revision based on a report to be compiled in June by the Council on Foreign Exchange and Other Transactions (an advisory panel to the finance minister and the international trade and industry minister). New statistics are expected to be adopted in two or three years. International balance of payments includes current balance, which shows data on trade in goods, such as automobiles and home electric appliances, and on trade in services. Presently, current balance consists of balance of trade, balance of invisible trade, and balance of transfer. The planned revision will center on improving data on services trade, which is a category in invisible trade balance. The government is to classify data on services trade into about 10 groups by adding communications, construction, information, and other items to the present transport and travel. This broad classification will enable one to know the actual state of services trade at a glance. Japan is a nation with a huge trade surplus. It registered a surplus of $141.4 billion in its balance of trade in 1993. On the other hand, the nation's balance of invisible trade in the same year was a deficit of $3.8 billion, reflecting the increasing number of Japanese who make trips abroad. A government source said by disclosing detailed data on services trade, "Japan can demonstrate that its markets are open." However, if Japan discloses data on balance of payments in the construction market, which is not fully open to foreign competition, the United States and Europe might increase their pressure on Japan to open it wider. Currently, "capital account balance" is divided into long-term capital balance (which shows data on increase and decrease of external assets and debts during a period of over one year) and short-term capital balance (which shows data during a period of less than one year). The government plans to abolish this classification because it is difficult to know from the data what private companies are aiming at. Instead, it will reclassify the capital account balance into "direct foreign investment," "portfolio investment," and "other investments." Direct foreign investment is an act to acquire shares in foreign companies to participate in management, while portfolio investment is an act to purchase foreign government bonds. Free trade in services was seriously discussed in the Uruguay Round of GATT multilateral trade negotiations. The final act of the round signed in Marrakech, Morocco, in April notes that trade barriers should be lowered by extending the scope of liberalization from merchandise trade to services trade.
