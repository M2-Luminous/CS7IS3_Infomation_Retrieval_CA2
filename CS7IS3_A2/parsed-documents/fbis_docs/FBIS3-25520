FBIS3-25520 "drafr035_e_94007" FBIS-AFR-94-035 Document Type:Daily Report 22 Feb 1994 WEST AFRICA Togo Second Round of Voting Held; Violence Reported AB2002170294 Lome Radio Lome in French 1230 GMT 20 Feb 94 AB2002170294 Lome Radio Lome Language: French Article Type:BFN [Excerpts] Togolese have been voting since this morning in 24 constituencies, where second-round elections have been set up to elect parliamentary candidates to fill the remaining seats at the National Assembly after the 6 February first round of legislative elections. [passage omitted] Voting started a bit late following anti-fraud measures taken yesterday by the National Electoral Commission. Calm currently reigns at the capital's polling centers. Meanwhile, in the interior of the country some incidents have been recorded. In Haho Prefecture, youths wearing T-shirts that displayed Union of Forces for Change logos tried to disperse voters and tear up ballot papers. Six polling stations were ransacked. During the night of 19 February three [as heard] explosions were reported in Kloto Prefecture. There was one explosion in the district center of Agou-Gadzepe, where the prefect's office was destroyed by a bomb. A second bomb which was discovered was defused. In Koumawou, a house next to the Gendarmerie building was targeted. There was another explosion in Afegame, where a shop was destroyed. In all the above cases, only material damage was reported. A fourth explosion was reported in Akatse, also in Kloto Prefecture [as heard]. We have also been informed that there was an explosion last night in Lome, in Totigan. The explosive was planted under a felled baobab trunk tree which had been felled across a street. There was no loss of life or material damage. Although there were explosions in one district of the capital, as well as others in Agou, and incidents were reported in Notse where ballot boxes were broken, the climate is fine in Assoli, where Kossi Malambani interviewed the area prefect this morning: [Begin recording] [Unidentified prefect] You must have noticed, if you did walk around, that people are lining up at the polling stations. There are very long queues. Since we are fasting during Ramadan, people got up early and were already at the polling stations by 0600. What is holding up voting a little is that political party delegates should have signed the ballot papers first, and this is has somewhat slowed down the voting. [Malambani] To ensure the smooth running of the second-round elections, of what measures have been taken this time around, as compared with the first round? [Prefect] This time, the people have been well informed, especially those who work in the polling stations. Polling officers, local electoral commission members, and party representatives have all been well briefed on how to receive voters and collaborate with their other colleagues. [Malambani] What would you like to say to your people? [Prefect] What I would like to tell the people is that voting went on smoothly during the first round. And I would like the second-round elections to turn out the same way. I would like the people to turn up in massive numbers on election day and vote calmly and without any incidents. I would also like polling officers to implement our recommendations, they should not press voters, voters must be allowed to enter polling stations calmly to vote and they must be happy to have performed their civic duty when they leave the polling booths. [end recording] Also in Lome, Guegue Adjavon managed to interview voters and polling officers: [Unidentified polling officer] I have noticed that voters are not coming out in sufficient numbers to vote, as was the case during the first round of elections. They have certainly not been informed. Others have no idea where to go to vote, because the second-round elections are not taking place in all the constituencies. The people do not know exactly what to do. We are waiting for them. [passage omitted] [Second unidentified polling officer] Here the participation rate has been a little higher. But I hope that in other polling stations where there are second-round elections that the participation rate will be the same, that is, as many people as possible will participate. What I deplore at this polling station -- Massesse I School -- is that His Excellency Herman Yameogo, the chairman of the International Followup Committee, did not visit this station. I wish he would tour other centers to see what is happening there. For the moment, there is no intimidation here at this polling station. Everything is going on very well, very well indeed, and we are operating under very excellent conditions. [end recording]
