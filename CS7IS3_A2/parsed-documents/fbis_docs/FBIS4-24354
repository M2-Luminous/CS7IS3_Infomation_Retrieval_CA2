FBIS4-24354 "drafr126_a_94006" FBIS-AFR-94-126 Daily Report 29 Jun 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Rwanda RPF Claims French Troops Ignoring Stated Mission RPF Claims French Troops Ignoring Stated Mission EA2906203094 (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura in French to Rwanda 1815 GMT 29 Jun 94 EA2906203094 (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura French BFN [Excerpts] French troops have been in our country for the last [word indistinct] days. The French defense minister reportedly has arrived in Cyangugu, southwestern Rwanda, to inspect his troops, and is accompanied by the French official in charge of humanitarian affairs. [passage omitted] On 27 June the French carried out so-called patrols, up to 20 km from the battlefront, in Gikongoro [words indistinct]. It is worth recalling the RPF's conditions for avoiding fighting between the Rwandan Patriotic Army [RPA] and the French Army [words indistinct]. First, the French Forces must not overstep their humanitarian mission. Second, French troops should not cross the borderline of the western region. Third, the French presence in Rwanda must end in July, as announced by the French Government itself. Some of these three points, which should govern Operation Turquoise, have already been overstepped. As we have just told you, French (?troops) have started to approach the combat zone. Their mission has also started to show its nonhumanitarian character. How can one assess the fact that French soldiers abandoned 100 Tutsis they found being pursued in Kibuye Forest by the Interahamwe [Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development militia], who had just killed one of the Tutsis? Is that not a reconnaissance mission being carried out by the French soldiers on behalf of the militias responsible for the genocide of the Kibuye region? [passage omitted] Briefly, the French military operation in Rwanda is just meant to explore mass graves [words indistinct]. If the French mission is really humanitarian, why can't they disarm the killers found at crime spots. [passage indistinct] A wise man said you can fool some people some of the time, but not all the people all of the time.
