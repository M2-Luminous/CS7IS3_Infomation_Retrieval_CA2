FR940916-0-00022 FR940916-0-00007 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Departmental Offices 31 CFR Part 1 Privacy Act of 1974; Implementation AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service, Treasury. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: In accordance with the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a, the Department of the Treasury gives notice of an amendment to exempt the new system of records entitled Internal Security Management Information System (ISMIS)_Treasury/IRS 60.011 from certain provisions of the Privacy Act. The exemption is to comply with legal prohibitions against the disclosure of certain kinds of information and to protect certain information on individuals maintained in this system of records. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 16, 1994. ADDRESSES: Please submit inquiries to the Director, Office of Disclosure, Internal Revenue Service, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20224. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Vince Curtin, Tax Law Specialist, FOI/Privacy Branch, Office of Disclosure, Internal Revenue Service at (202) 622&hyph;6240. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Department of the Treasury published a notice of proposed rule exempting a system of records in the Federal Register at 58 FR 44481, dated August 23, 1993. The Internal Revenue Service published a notice of proposed new system of records in the Federal Register at 58 FR 40644, dated July 28, 1993. Under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), the head of an agency may promulgate rules to exempt any system of records within the agency from certain provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 if the agency or component thereof that maintains the system performs as its principal function any activities pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws. The Office of the Chief Inspector has as its principal function activities pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws. To the extent the exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) does not apply to the above-named system, then exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), relating to investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes, is hereby claimed for this system. The proposed rule requested that public comments be sent to the Director, Office of Disclosure, Internal Revenue Service no later than September 22, 1993. No comments pertaining to the proposed rule were received by the Office of Disclosure. Accordingly, the Department of Treasury is hereby giving notice that the new system of records entitled Internal Security Management Information System (ISMIS)_Treasury/IRS 60.011 is exempt from provisions of the Privacy Act pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) and the authority of 31 CFR 1.23(c). The reason for exempting this system of records from this provision of 5 U.S.C. 552a is set forth in the rule itself. It has been determined that this rule does not constitute a ``significant regulatory action.'' Departmental experience indicates that the rule does not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; does not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; does not materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or rights and obligations of recipients thereof; and does not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the regulatory principles set forth in Executive Order 12866. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, it is hereby certified that this rule will not have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. In accordance with the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the Department of the Treasury has determined that this final rule would not impose new recordkeeping, application, reporting, or other types of information collection requirements. The following correction is made to the rule as published on August 23, 1993 at 58 FR 44482, column 2, line 21, by changing paragraph designation ``(b)'' to ``(a)''.
