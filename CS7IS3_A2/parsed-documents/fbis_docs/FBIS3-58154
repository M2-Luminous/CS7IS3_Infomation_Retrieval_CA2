Speaking after talks of more than an hour with French President Francois Mitterrand, Chretien said that Canadian and French troops were playing "a very useful role in extremely difficult circumstances," and that the question of their mandate would be discussed at next week's NATO summit in Brussels. Earlier this week, the prime minister said Ottawa was considering withdrawal of its troops, who are blocked in the Moslem enclave of Srebrenica. On Friday, he said there would be a debate in parliament before a decision was taken. "Canada has always been there for peacekeeping but it is not peacemaking because we do not have the means to do that and it is a kind of in-between, not much military in many ways, it is more Red Cross type of work," Chretien said Friday. He added: "It seems to be a conflict that has no solution at this moment. The United Nations have passed resolutions but we do not have the means to enforce their decisions so peacemaking does not exist. In Bosnia it is not a question of peacekeeping because there is no peace." Chretien was due to lunch with Premier Edouard Balladur later Friday. He arrived in Paris late Thursday at the start of his first official visit to France, after a short stay in London. Canada is in dispute with France over fishing quotas allowed to the French archipelago of Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon, in Canadian territorial waters off Newfoundland. The French consider the quotas insufficient and after negotiations broke down, Canada imposed a moratorium on cod fishing for both its own and French fishermen to allow reconstitution of stocks. After a private stay in Paris, Chretien was to travel to Brussels on Sunday to attend the NATO summit.
