FR940118-1-00045 FR940118-1-00008 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Coast Guard 46 CFR Parts 25 and 160 [CGD 78&hyph;174] RIN 2115&hyph;AA29 Hybrid PFD's; Establishment of Approval Requirements AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: On August 22, 1985 the Coast Guard published an interim final rule (IFR) in the Federal Register (50 FR 33923) which established structural and performance standards and procedures for approval of hybrid inflatable personal flotation devices (PFD). This IFR allowed the approval of several hybrid PFD's but not enough devices were made and sold to make a significant difference in the number of lives saved by this superior performing and more comfortable PFD. The changes proposed are designed to make hybrid PFD's more affordable and attractive to recreational boaters. The changes include lowering manufacturing costs by reducing the amount of repetitive testing required. Increases in buoyancy are proposed to compensate for removing of the Type V criteria of being ``REQUIRED TO BE WORN'' to allow approval of hybrids a Type I, II, and III. Types I, II, and III are proposed in addition to the existing Type V category. This SNPRM also proposes approval of hybrids for youths and small children. These proposals are in hopes that hybrid PFD's will be more widely used and potentially save more lives. DATES: Comments must be received on or before April 18, 1994.
