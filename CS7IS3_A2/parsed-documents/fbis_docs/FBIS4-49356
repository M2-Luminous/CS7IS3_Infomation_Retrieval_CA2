Tian said that on April 28, the United States Congress passed the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, fiscal years 1994 and 1995, which was signed by the U.S. President on April 30. When this bill was being discussed, the Chinese side expressed serious concern over the anti-China provisions and made several solemn representations with the U.S. side, Tian said, adding that "We pointed out to the U.S side that these provisions, which had severely infringed on China's sovereignty and constituted a gross interference in China's internal affairs, would cause serious damage to Sino-U.S. relations." The U.S. side, however, in disregard of the Chinese side's strong opposition and representations, went ahead with the passage and signature of this bill that contains many provisions detrimental to China's fundamental interests. This can not but arouse great indignation of the Chinese people, the vice-minister said. "I am hereby instructed to lodge a strong protest with the United States Government on this issue", Tian said. It is known to all that there is only one China and that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, he said, and the government of the People's Republic of China, as the sole legal government representing the whole of China, is recognized by the United Nations and the international community. With regard to the Taiwan question, Tian said, the U.S. Government has made unambiguous commitment in the three Sino-U.S. Joint communiques, and is therefore bound by its international obligations. But the authorization act states that "Section 3 of Taiwan Relations Act takes primacy over statements of government policies, including communiques, regulations, directives and policies based thereon", thus openly trampling on the communique of August 17, 1982 between the Chinese and American Governments and seriously undermining the basis of Sino-U.S. relations. The vice-minister said that the act also advocates visits by American cabinet-level officials to Taiwan and calls on the American President to take steps to express clearly U.S. support to Taiwan in bilateral relations and multilateral organizations of which the United States is a member. "This is a deliberate attempt to create `two Chinas', `one China and one Taiwan' in the international arena that completely contravenes the U.S. Government's commitment to pursue a `one China' policy," Tian said, and this attempt by the U.S. side to sabotage China's peaceful reunification and create tension in the Taiwan Straits will certainly meet with the resolute position of the Chinese people including our Taiwan compatriots, and is doomed to failure. The vice foreign minister also said that Tibet has always been an inseparable part of China ever since the 13th century, and no country in the world, including the United States, recognizes Tibet as an independent country. But the act openly refers to Tibet as a "country", alleging that Tibet is an "occupied sovereign country" and "its true representatives are the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Government in exile", and even asks the United States Information Agency to establish an "office" in Lhasa for the development of educational and cultural exchanges with the "people of Tibet". He said that it is indeed shocking to see such a contempt for the basic norms governing the international relations, such open infringement of China's sovereignty and attempt to split China. The Chinese people waged protracted and arduous struggles to safeguard their state sovereignty and territorial integrity, Tian said, and all attempts to split Tibet from the Chinese territory have ended in total failure with no exception. "Anyone who still wants to follow this beaten track today will certainly come to grief", Tian said, and "We appeal to the U.S. Government to strictly adhere to its openly-stated position that Tibet is part of China and undertake not to get involved in any activities aimed at splitting China. On the "Radio Free Asia", Tian said, China and many other Asian countries have pointed out clearly on a number of occasions that the true intention of the United States in setting up this radio is to use mass media to interfere in the internal affairs of China and other Asian countries. This act, however, approves the setting up of such a radio. Tian said that this action once again shows no regard for the universally acknowledged norms governing international relations and violates the principles enshrined in the three-joint communiques between China and the United States. It is bound to meet the resolute opposition from the Chinese people and the peoples of other Asian countries. Tian pointed out that Sino-U.S. relations are at a crucial moment right now, and "We hope that they will move in a positive direction." However, he said, it depends on the joint efforts of both sides to improve and develop the bilateral relations. The above-mentioned contents of the foreign relations authorization act seriously undermines the basis of Sino-U.S. relations, runs counter to the fundamental interests of both countries and peoples, and are inconsistent with the statement by the U.S. Government that it wants to develop a positive and constructive relationship with China. The vice-minister said that China hereby states in all seriousness that all the anti-China sections in this act are absolutely objectionable and unacceptable to the Chinese Government and people. And "We demand that the U.S. Government honor its words and adopt effective measures to reverse its wrong position and erroneous decision so as to strictly adhere to the principles enshrined in the three joint communiques between the two countries and the basic norms governing international relations." Otherwise, he warned, the U.S. side shall be held responsible for all the consequences arising therefrom.
