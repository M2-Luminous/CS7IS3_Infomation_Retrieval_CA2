The decline in January-February in comparison with the same period last year was 8.8 percent. The improvement of the quarterly indicator, according to Deputy Chief Vladimir Kiselev of the Main Economic Administration of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, was due to the continued growth of exports and the slight deceleration of the decline of imports. The positive balance for the quarter was 5.2 billion dollars (2.2 billion in January-February).

Exports in March increased to 3.5 billion dollars, as compared to 3 billion in February and 2.5 billion in January. Shipments to industrially developed countries in comparison with the first quarter of 1993 displayed an increase of 8.4 percent and reached 5.5 billion dollars (2.2 billion in March), and exports to developing countries increased by 5.6 percent to 1.2 billion dollars. Exports to all other countries decreased by 2.3 percent, declining to 2.4 billion dollars.

In terms of cost, however, exports of crude oil and petroleum products decreased by 17 percent and 20 percent respectively--because of the drop in world prices in 1993. Exports of nickel and aluminum more than doubled. As Mr. Kiselev pointed out, the increase in exports of primary aluminum was accompanied by an even larger increase (2.7-fold) in imports of aluminum ores and concentrates, much of which come here as part of "tolling" operations (ore imports paid for with finished metal products).

Imports of machines, equipment, and vehicles decreased by 10 percent to 1.31 billion dollars (33 percent of all Russian imports from distant foreign countries). Imports of the main foodstuffs continued to decrease. Imports of grain were 87.6 percent below the figure for January-March 1993, declining to 372,000 tonnes. Furthermore, as Mr. Kiselev reported, there were virtually no shipments of grain in March, and all incoming shipments in January-February were made in line with 1993 contracts. No contracts with the main foreign suppliers of grain were signed in the first quarter. There were decreases of 54 percent in imports of meat, 83 percent in sugar imports (including 95 percent for raw sugar), 30 percent in imports of vegetable oil, and 91 percent in imports of noodles in comparison with January-March 1993.
