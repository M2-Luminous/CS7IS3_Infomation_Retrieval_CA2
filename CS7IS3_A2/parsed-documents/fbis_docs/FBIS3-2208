Shi Guangsheng said: The Chinese Government has consistently been abiding by the accords that it has signed with some countries on textile exports. In recent years, however, we found that a small number of enterprises have been violating the relevant regulations in an attempt to disrupt market order through cheating, illegal transshipment, and other means, thus affecting the normal export of Chinese textiles. In this connection, the Chinese Government is conducting conscientious investigations and will take strong measures against such activities. Shi Guangsheng said: There are three possibilities regarding illegal textile exports. First, some enterprises intentionally violate the law; second, Chinese exporters collaborate with foreign importers and intermediary agents; and third, some enterprises simply know very little about the relevant policies, laws, and ordinances. Shi stressed that comprehensive and coordinated efforts should be organized to curb offenses in the first two cases. Shi Guangsheng revealed that the departments concerned had called a meeting before the Spring Guangzhou Export Commodities Fair this year to formulate measures in a campaign against illegal activities related to the textile trade.
