Full withdrawal is the linchpin of peace. Whoever cares for a just and inclusive peace settlement in the Middle East must satisfy the conditions on which the peace initiative was launched -- the point of reference laid out by the Madrid conference. Since the Madrid conference, Israel been shown to be evasive as far as meeting the conditions required to establish peace. There is no shortage of Israel's evasive tactics: Unabated settlement building activity, stepped up repression of Palestinians under occupation, population displacements, killings, detentions, falsification of facts, and a defamation effort against Syria and Lebanon under pretexts that the U.S. Administration and the world community know are flimsy. The United States and the world community recognize that it is Israel that must take the blame for the logjam in the peace process. No fair-minded person anywhere in the world will concur with Israel's definition of resistance inside Palestinian land or in the Golan Heights and south Lebanon as terrorism. The Israeli Government has never passed up an opportunity to dilute the Madrid conference formula and the requirements of a just and comprehensive peace. To advance that goal, Israel has pursued separate deals and abridged solutions, like the Oslo agreement and the subsequent Cairo accord, which, in effect, imposed Israel's tutelage over the Palestinian Arab people. The Gaza-Jericho agreement, hobbled by demeaning constraints and deviating from UN Security Council resolutions and the Madrid conference that envisaged the removal of occupation and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state on Palestinian soil, undervalues the rights and dignity and future prospects for the Palestinian people. It is therefore, not surprising to see growing opposition to the agreement in the Palestinian body politic. This in itself is a virtual plebiscite on the option of separate deals and a reconfirmation of the notion that a combination of the Madrid formula and the Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425 is the only game in town for the eliminatiion of tension and instability from the region. That notion was best summed up by the paper submitted by Syria at the sixth round of the Washington peace talks. Things became even clearer at the Geneva summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton. It emerged then that for a just and inclusive peace to come to the region, Israel must pull out from all the occupied territories. That much was resiterated by His Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher earlier this month. The president impressed on the U.S. secretary the urgency of addressing the core issues if the stalled peace process is to move forward. The question arises as to whether Christopher's next Middle East tour will break new ground. Will he bring Israel around to addressing core issues and observing UN resolutions and obliging the the international community's will for a just peace in which all the interested parties are involved?
