FR941020-0-00016 FR941020-0-00005 V. Standard H The predecessor to Standard H required pipelines offering a transportation discount to an affiliate to make a comparable discount contemporaneously available to all similarly situated non-affiliates. In Order No. 566, the Commission retained this requirement. It modified the Standard, however, to codify the interpretation developed through case-by-case decision-making that pipelines were required to post certain information about affiliate discounts on the pipelines' EBBs. 15 Under Standard H, pipelines are required to post, for a 90 day period, notice of each offer to an affiliate, providing the date of the offer, the discount rate, the quantity of gas scheduled to be moved at the discount rate, the delivery points in the offer, any conditions applicable to the offer, and the procedures by which a non-affiliated shipper can request a comparable offer. The Commission found that this modification of the Standard did not add a new posting requirement, because the Commission eliminated the comparable requirement under §250.16 that pipelines post affiliate discount information on their EBBs. 15 See Colorado Interstate Gas Company, 64 FERC ¶ 61,277 at 62,960 (1993) (citing Sunrise Energy v. FERC, 62 FERC ¶ 61,087 at 61,622&hyph;23 (1993)), reh'g denied, 65 FERC ¶ 61,264 at 62,224&hyph;25 (1993). A. Revisions to the Standard Pipelines 16 challenge the Commission's modification of the Standard first by contending that the Commission failed to abide by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), because the proposal to require posting of affiliate offers on EBBs was not included in the NOPR in this proceeding. 17 They assert that the addition of the posting requirement to Standard H, without proper notice, violated the APA, because it was not in character with the prior regulations or the original scheme proposed in the NOPR and was not a logical outgrowth of the NOPR. In particular, they assert that the modification to Standard H was not in character with the previous regulations, because, under prior §250.16, pipelines were required to post affiliate discount information after the discount was provided, while the revision to Standard H requires such posting when the discount offer is made. 16 ANR/CIG, Enron, INGAA, MGS/Natural, Panhandle Pipelines. 17 5 U.S.C. 553(a). The pipelines also make a number of substantive challenges to the Standard. They contend Standard H in its entirety is unnecessary because no evidence demonstrates that pipelines engage in abusive discounting practices. 18 They further maintain that any potential problems are adequately covered by Commission regulations under Part 284 which prevent undue discrimination and require, under §284.7(d)(5)(iv), that the pipelines provide notice of discounts. 19 18 Enron, MGS/Natural. 19 Enron, INGAA. The pipelines further contend that the required posting of discount information when offers are made will disclose confidential competitive information and will permit non-affiliates to steal deals being negotiated by affiliates. 20 Enron argues that contemporaneous posting of the discounted rate, volume, and delivery points will enable competitors to discern the identity of the affiliate's customer and determine the type of offer that will enable the non-affiliate to undercut the affiliate's deal. 21 Enron requests that if the Commission retains the posting requirement, it eliminate the disclosure of competitively sensitive information, requiring only the posting of a notice of a discount. MGS/Natural contend that the revision to the regulation is based on the incorrect premise that non-affiliated shippers will request discounts only if they are made aware of the discount offered to the affiliate. They maintain that all shippers know how to request and bargain for discounts so that after-the-fact posting of discounts is all that is necessary to ensure that discrimination has not occurred. 20 ANR/CIG, Enron, MGS/Natural, Panhandle Pipelines. 21 TGPL requests deletion of the requirement to post the volume of gas scheduled since the pipeline will not know this information when offering the discount. Along the same lines, K N Energy and Panhandle Pipelines request clarification of when pipelines are obligated to post offers under the regulation. They argue that pipelines should not be required to post affiliate discount information during negotiations, but should post only the final offer on the day it is offered to the affiliate. K N Energy states that affiliates will be unduly disadvantaged by posting of offers during the negotiation process and cites to the Commission's decision in Sunrise Energy Company v. Transwestern Pipeline Company, 22 in support of this interpretation. In contrast, Indicated Companies contend that the Commission should require the posting of all offers made during negotiations in addition to posting the final offer, citing to the Commission's decision in Colorado Interstate Gas Company. 23 22 62 FERC ¶ 61,087 at 61,623 (1993), aff'd, 66 FERC ¶ 61,170 (1994). 23 65 FERC ¶ 61,264 at 62,224&hyph;25 (1993).
