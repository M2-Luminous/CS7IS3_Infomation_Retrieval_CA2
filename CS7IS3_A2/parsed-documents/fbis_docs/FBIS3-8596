It marks a further escalation of the strategy of violence against the Democratic Alliance [AD] and free speech that began in Shkoder with the murder of Gjovalin Cekini and the assault on Gjergj Zefi, and continued in Tirana with the arrest and persecution of journalists. There is no doubt that the hand that struck Teodor Keko was one of those criminal hands that raised a toast in the tourist hotel in Shkoder with the odd Democratic Party leader. For us, this represents a caveman's reaction to the letter from the Cekini family published in ALEANCA two days ago. An assault on a deputy in the middle of the street, in the presence of his own wife, shows that criminals hold the real power in this country. As chairman of the second-largest opposition party, an intellectual, and a citizen, I demand a public statement by the president, the prime minister, and the Public Order Ministry concerning guarantees that they give for the normal conduct of political life in Albania. The opposition is here to ensure a democratic order, not to create a pretty facade for foreign delegations, behind which a corrupt and criminal state can operate. Silence would be a disgrace, if not an incrimination, for any civilized politican.
