FR940617-2-00214 FR940617-2-00117 P. Are matching funds required? Yes, non-federal matching funds of at least 25% of the total cost of the project are required, although EPA encourages matching funds of greater than 25%. Federal funds to support the project must not exceed 75% of the total cost of the project. The 25% match may be provided by the applicant or any other organization or institution, except that no portion of the 25% match can include federal funds (unless specifically authorized by statute). The 25% match may be provided in cash or by in-kind contributions and other non-cash support. In-kind contributions often include salaries or other verifiable costs. In the case of salaries, applicants may use either minimum wage or fair market value. The proposed match, including the value of in-kind contributions, is subject to negotiation with EPA. All grants are subject to audit, so the value of in-kind contributions must be carefully documented. The matching non-federal share is a percentage of the entire cost of the project. For example, if the 75% federal portion is $5,000, then the entire project should, at a minimum, have a budget of $6,667, with the recipient providing a contribution of $1,667. The amount of non-federal funds, including in-kind contributions, must be briefly itemized in Block 15 of the SF 424 included at the end of this notice. Q. Can I use federal funds other than those provided by this program to support the same project? Yes, you may use federal funds other than those provided by the Environmental Educational Grants Program to support the same project, but only for different activities. Furthermore, you may not use any federal funds to meet all or any part of the required 25% match as stated in Section V.P. above. If you have already been awarded federal funds for a project in which you are seeking additional support from this program, you must indicate in the budget section of the work plan that you have been awarded other federal support for this project. You must also identify the project officer, agency, office, address, phone number, and the amount of the award. R. Can I request funding for any budget category on the SF 424A (i.e., personnel/salaries, fringe benefits, travel, equipment, supplies, contractual, construction, and indirect charges)? Yes, you may request funding for any of the budget categories identified above with the following exceptions. First, as indicated under Section VI.M.1. above, EPA will not fund the acquisition of real property (including buildings) or the construction or modification of any building under this program. Second, you may request funds to pay for salaries, but only for those personnel who are directly involved in implementing the proposed project and whose salaries are directly related to specific products or outcomes of the proposed project. EPA also strongly encourages applicants to request reasonable amounts of funding for salaries. Third, you may include a request for indirect costs if your organization has already negotiated and received an indirect cost rate from the federal government. S. What must the pre-application contain and how must the information be presented in the pre-application? The pre-application must contain an SF 424, and SF 424A, and a work plan as described below: 1. Application for Federal Assistance (SF 424 ). The SF 424 is an official form required for all federal grants. A completed SF 424 must be submitted as part of your pre-application. This form, along with instructions and a sample, are included at the end of this notice. Please carefully review the instructions and the sample. 2. Budget Information: Non-Construction Programs (SF 424A). The SF 424A is an official form required for all federal grants. A completed SF 424A must be submitted as part of your pre-application. This form, along with instructions and a sample, are included at the end of this notice. Please carefully review the instructions and the sample. Refer to Section V.R. above for information on what types of activities can and cannot be funded. 3. Work Plan . A work plan describes the applicant's proposed project. Work plans must contain all four sections (a&hyph;d) submitted in the format described below. Each section of the work plan is assigned points which indicate how your proposal will be scored. Note that certain sections and subsections are given more points than others. Work plans must contain the following four sections: a. Project Summary: A synopsis of no more than one page stating: (1) The nature of the organization requesting funds; (2) The type of project proposed as described under Section IV.N.2; (3) The overall purpose and specific objective of the project; (4) The target audience as well as the total number of individuals to be reached and their demographics; (5) The expected results of the project; and (6) How the funds will be used. (Do not include a detailed budget in the summary section).
