The United States issued the proposal during a meeting with representatives of the Andean Pact countries (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela), held on Tuesday and Wednesday in Bolivia to analyze the struggle against drug trafficking. The U.S. Department of State representative, Paul Valky, said in Bolivia his country considers it essential to eliminate banking secrecy to fight against drug trafficking. According to Mulino, "Panama is a sovereign country which can decide whether it accepts making its legislation uniform with that of the United States and other countries, but we have more than enough laws to fight drug trafficking activities without endangering banking confidentiality." The powerful international banking center in Panama is considered by the U.S. authorities to be an important center for laundering money resulting from drug trafficking activities. Mulino asserted: "It is not true that banks in Panama are impenetrable concerning legal issues or that banking confidentiality is an absolute regime." Banking confidentiality "is penetrable" upon request from the legal authorities, when legal processes are properly carried out, he added. Mulino said Panama has signed the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) to fight drug trafficking with the United States, Colombia, England, and the Central American countries. Nevertheless, the U.S. Congress has yet to ratify the MLAT signed in 1992 with Panama, even though the Panamanian Legislative Assembly ratified the agreement, which allows authorities in different countries to exchange information about money laundering activities.
