FR940721-0-00029 FR940721-0-00010 d. Labeling and Printed Instructions This rule adopts requirements for labeling and printed consumer instructions to decrease the likelihood that belt-positioning seats will be misused. The information that needs to be conveyed to the consumer is: (a) That a belt-positioning seat must be used with a vehicle lap/shoulder belt system to perform effectively and must not be used with just a vehicle lap belt; (b) when using a shield booster with a vehicle's lap/shoulder belt system, the consumer must place the shoulder belt portion of the system behind the child's head; and (c) the belt-positioning seat is not certified for aircraft use. Each of these items of information is discussed below. This rule does not adopt the proposal that the manufacturer's height and weight recommendations on the label include the information in metric units. In commenting on the NPRM, Tarrant County Child Car Safety Coalition said that the metric units would be extremely confusing to many parents. Similarly, Ford and Cosco commented that the proposed use of the word ``mass'' in the label would be confusing. NHTSA concurs that the metric information on the label is unnecessary at this time. (Pursuant to the agency's plan to convert to the metric system pursuant to the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act and E.O. 12770, this rule specifies metric units in the specifications for Standard 213's compliance test procedures, see e.g. , figures 1A and 1B. Since these values will not be any part of a labeled child seat, the metric values will not engender confusion on the part of ordinary consumers.) 1. Appropriate Vehicle Belt System NHTSA adopts a requirement that each add-on and built-in belt-positioning seat be labeled with a warning about using the seat with Type 1 or the lap portion of Type 2 belt systems in a vehicle. No commenter other than Chrysler disputed the need for the labeled warning. (Chrysler's comment is discussed below with respect to ``dual purpose'' boosters.) In response to Cosco's belief that the warning was proposed to be on a separate label, no such requirement was proposed. The warning can be on the existing installation label. Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety believed that there is need for an installation diagram showing the proper installation of the belt-positioning seat in a vehicle. The American Academy of Pediatrics believed the installation diagram should be placed directly on the child seat, and not on accompanying printed material. Child restraints are already required to be labeled with an installation diagram showing the restraint in the right front seating position in a vehicle, with a lap/shoulder belt (S5.5.2(l)). NHTSA proposed a labeling requirement for ``dual purpose'' boosters. These boosters can be used with either a lap or a lap/shoulder belt in the shield mode, but only with a lap/shoulder belt in the belt-positioning mode. These seats also typically require different belt routing for the two modes. To better ensure the boosters are properly used, the agency proposed requiring dual purpose boosters to be labeled with information about the appropriate vehicle belt system (lap-only or lap/shoulder belt system, depending on the design of the booster) to use with the booster, and about how the booster must be used with the particular belt system (e.g., with or without the booster's shield). Chrysler believed there is no need to label built-in dual purpose boosters that are factory-installed. Chrysler believed these seats are already labeled with too much information, and that the information on the proposed label ``will mostly duplicate the information that is already provided in the [vehicle] owner's manual.'' Conversely, Volvo commented that built-in belt-positioning seats ought to be labeled with information on correct belt usage. NHTSA disagrees with Chrysler. There is a substantial amount of information that must be labeled on built-in seats. However, it is vitally important that built-in seats be used with the appropriate vehicle belt system. Instructing consumers how to use the belt-positioning booster increases the likelihood of correct usage. Further, the agency believes that consumers are more likely to refer to the information if it is ``handy'' on the seat rather than in the vehicle owner's manual. However, NHTSA is aware of concerns that there is too much information placed on child seat labels. The agency will evaluate the labeling mandated by Standard 213 in the near future to determine if changes are warranted. 2. Placement of Shoulder Belt This rule requires manufacturers to label shield boosters with a warning to consumers that if the booster is used with a Type II belt system, the shoulder belt portion of the belt system should be placed behind the child. Comments on the proposed requirement were divided. UM&hyph;CPP ``strongly support[ed]'' the proposal because it found high head accelerations resulting from impact of the dummy's head with the dummy's arm. Cosco disagreed with the proposal, stating that the proposal ``ignores the excellent performance of shield booster seats used with the shoulder belt in front of the child.'' (Emphasis in text.) NHTSA disagrees with Cosco about the effectiveness of shield-type booster seats used with the shoulder belt routed in front of the child. The agency's VRTC Report No. DOT&hyph;HS&hyph;808&hyph;005 titled, ``Evaluation of Belt Positioning Booster Seats and Lap/Shoulder Belt Test Procedures,'' summarized the findings of the agency's test program on different booster seats. The report stated that, for small shield booster seats, ``the routing of the shoulder belt (three point belt) in front of the dummy did significantly effect the HIC, 3 msec chest clip [acceleration], and head excursion values, regardless of dummy size.'' Specifically, the study stated that: The 3 year old dummy/three point belt tests had 80% to 90% higher HIC values than the corresponding lap only belt tests, while for the 6 year old dummy, the three point belt tests were 18% to 59% higher. The 3 year old/three point belt tests were the only test conditions that produced HIC values above 1000.
