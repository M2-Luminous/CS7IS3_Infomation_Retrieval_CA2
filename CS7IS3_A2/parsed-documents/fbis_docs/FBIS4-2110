On behalf of the regional party committee and government, I extend a Happy New Year to all comrades and friends present; as well as cordial greetings to all workers, peasants, intellectuals, office cadres, retired comrades, army commanders and fighters, armed police officers and men, and workers and staff of the Production and Construction Corps of all nationalities throughout Xinjiang; to all democratic parties, mass organizations, and patriotic people in all walks of life and of all nationalities; to comrades from the central departments and various fraternal provinces and regions working on various fronts in Xinjiang to help our economic construction; and to friends in Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and foreign countries who have cared for and helped the region's economic development! I also extend heartfelt gratitude to comrades who stay fast at their jobs during the festival. In the past year, we implemented in depth Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speeches made during his southern tour and the 14th CPC National Congress guidelines, actively carried out the tasks laid by the fifth plenary (enlarged) session of the fourth regional party committee and the first session of the eighth regional people's congress, and relied on and united cadres and people of all nationalities in Xinjiang to work hard and concertedly to score gratifying achievements. In 1993, the regional economy retained its growth momentum: In agriculture, we overcame natural disasters and reaped a bumper harvest for the 16th year in a row, industrial production recovered from the stagnation at the beginning of the year and gradually picked up monthly, basic industries and key construction projects proceeded smoothly, and financial revenues increased by a big margin. We strengthened macroeconomic regulation and control, stabilized financial order, deepened enterprise reform, further developed diversified economic sectors with public ownership as the mainstay, and made significant progress in opening up Xinjiang to the outside world. We earnestly safeguarded social and political stability and brought about a noticeable improvement in economic and social order. We scored interim achievements in promoting clean government and fighting corruption; further strengthened the comprehensive management of public security; steadily promoted reform in education, science and technology, culture, health, family planning, environmental protection, and sports; and continued to make headway in building socialist spiritual civilization, democracy, and the legal system. An excellent situation characterized by economic growth, political stability, national unity, and social progress prevailed throughout the region. This year, we will carry forward our cause and continue to work together for still greater victories in Xinjiang's economic construction and all fields of endeavor. It will also be a crucial year for the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang to realize the second-step strategic goal and comparatively well-off living standards. The recent sixth plenary (enlarged) session of the fourth regional party committee adopted a "decision on conscientiously implementing the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee guidelines to accelerate reform and opening up to promote rapid and highly efficient development of Xinjiang's economy." The principles, policies, and focuses put forth by the session for deepening reform, opening up wider, and promoting economic development in the region are in line with the requirement for integrating the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee guidelines with Xinjiang's realities. Meanwhile, the session mapped out arrangements for the work in various fields in 1994. We should unswervingly adhere to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, and work in a down-to-earth manner according to the tasks laid down by the sixth plenary (enlarged) session of the fourth regional party committee, so as to continuously promote a socialist market economy, socialist democracy, and socialist spiritual civilization. We should continue to steadfastly make economic construction the central task. We should strengthen the fundamental position of agriculture and ensure its steady development. We should invigorate the county economy by energetically developing second and tertiary industries in rural areas with village and town enterprises as the mainstay. We should improve the hard environment for large-scale socialized production by accelerating the construction of basic industries and infrastructure, such as transportation, energy, telecommunications, power supply, and water conservancy. We should upgrade the technology of existing enterprises and expedite the exploitation and transformation of resources. We should practice multidirectional opening up and market diversification and step up trade, economic, and technological cooperation with foreign countries. We should promote local economic development and all-round revitalization of the regional economy, concentrating on prospecting and developing petroleum and nonferrous metals. We should accelerate the pace of establishing a socialist market economic structure. We should change the operating mechanisms of enterprises and quicken the restructuring of existing enterprises in accordance with the basic requirements for establishing a modern enterprise system. We should energetically promote the reform of the macroeconomic regulation and control system, readjust the economic structure, and strive to nurture new points of economic growth. We should gradually establish a unified, open, fair, and orderly market system to converge the regional economy with major international and domestic markets. We should readjust ownership structure and go all out to develop nonstate sectors of economy. We should implement the principle of "giving priority to efficiency while taking fairness into account" in initiating a sound social security system. We must always uphold the principle of "grasping two links at the same time" in effectively maintaining social and political stability and create sound social milieus for Xinjiang's reform and development. We should go all out to improve party workstyle, promote clean government, and fight corruption unremittingly. We should further encourage advances in ideological, cultural, and educational undertakings. We should strengthen national unity and unity between soldiers and civilians and between the army and the government. We should correctly handle the relationship between reform, development, and stability; and continuously consolidate and develop the political situation characterized by stability and unity. Comrades, friends: The coming year has entrusted upon us a new mission. Time is running out; and we shoulder a heavy responsibility. Under the leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the nucleus and under the guidance of the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, let us further emancipate our minds, seek truth from facts, work hard, and forge ahead to contribute more to the realization of Xinjiang's goal of development, the establishment of a socialist market economic structure, and the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. May you all have a happy holiday, good health, smooth sailing at work, and happiness at home.
