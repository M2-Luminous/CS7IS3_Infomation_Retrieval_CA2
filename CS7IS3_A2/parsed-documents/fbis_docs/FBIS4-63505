These clauses in the Constitution were changed in September 1992 by the Republic of Crimea's Supreme Council itself in accordance with the law of Ukraine on the delimitation of powers between the state authority bodies of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea. Above all, it is about establishing relations between the Crimea and Ukraine on the basis of treaties and agreements and about introducing Crimean citizenship. This is a step toward Crimea leaving the composition of Ukraine, which violates the territorial integrity of Ukraine and its state sovereignty, and runs counter to the universally recognized principles of international law. In accordance with Article 75 of Ukraine's Constitution, the Crimean Autonomous Republic is a constituent part of Ukraine and can resolve independently only those issues attributed to its authority. The competence of state authority bodies of the Republic of Crimea is determined by the above-mentioned law of Ukraine on the delimitation of powers between the state bodies of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea. In accordance with Article 11 of this law, the higher bodies of state authority of the Republic of Crimea do not have the right to resolve issues belonging to the exclusive authority of the state bodies of Ukraine. The extent of the powers of the Republic of Crimea, in accordance with Ukraine's legislation, cannot be changed by the Republic of Crimea without the consent of Ukraine's Supreme Council. Taking account of the above, and with the aim of protecting state sovereignty and ensuring the supremacy of the laws of Ukraine on all of its territory, and in accordance with Point 31 of Article 97 of the Constitution of Ukraine, Ukraine's Supreme Council resolves: 1. To halt the operation of the law of the Republic of Crimea of 20 May 1994 on renewing the constitutional basis of the Republic of Crimea's statehood as such that runs counters to the Declaration on Ukraine's State Sovereignty, the demands of Articles 31, 70, 75, and 77 of the Constitution of Ukraine, and the laws of Ukraine on the delimitation of powers between the state authority bodies of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea and on citizenship of Ukraine; 2. To propose that the Republic of Crimea's Supreme Council brings the Republic of Crimea's Constitution into line with the Constitution of Ukraine and the laws of Ukraine on the delimitation of powers between the bodies of state authority of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea within 10 days. 3. That this resolution loses its validity from the moment when the Supreme Council of the Republic of Crimea revokes the law on renewing the constitutional basis of the Republic of Crimea's statehood. You have been listening to Ukraine's Supreme Council resolution on halting the operation of the law of the Republic of Crimea on renewing the constitutional basis of the Republic of Crimea's statehood.
