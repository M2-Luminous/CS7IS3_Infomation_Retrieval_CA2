It, however, is regrettable that India has rejected most of these proposals. India is the only country in the world where the pursuit of limitless power is increasingly seen as a religious obligation in the context of militant Hindu revivalism. Dr. Tanvir Ahmad Khan commented on a book called The Critical Mass, in which its two authors presented facts in a distorted manner, ignoring Pakistan's declaration that it wants to utilize nuclear power to meet the growing fuel and electricity demands in the country. Dr. Tanvir Ahmad Khan criticized the arguments of a specific circle, which is overlooking the peaceful nature of Pakistan's nuclear program with the intention of reinforcing its own viewpoint, to have strict restrictions imposed against Pakistan. He made it clear that Pakistan has no intention whatsoever of using its nuclear program for military purposes. On the other hand, he added, India has been adopting an intimidatory posture toward Pakistan. During the Cold War, which has now ended, India had acquired massive stocks of arms from the former Soviet Union and acquired arms and relevant technology from the Western countries. Under these circumstances, Pakistan's national security has assumed special importance and nuclear capability is the only effective means of safeguarding national security under the current scenario. Tanvir Ahmad Khan answered a question about rolling back the nuclear program and said no Pakistani Government will be able to sign an agreement on the nuclear issue until a regional agreement is signed. This agreement must bind all countries of the region. The information secretary said it is a matter of great strength for Pakistan that today it enjoys the leadership of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who possesses the full ability, determination, courage, and foresight to lead the nation at this time of difficulties. He said the opposition should cooperate with the government at this difficult time so a national outlook and strategy on the nuclear issue can be adopted.
