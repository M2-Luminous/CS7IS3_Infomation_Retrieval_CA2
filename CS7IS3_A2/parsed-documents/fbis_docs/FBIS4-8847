The Chetniks are also situated on the left side of Gorazde, at the gates to the town center, with a number of tanks and strong infantry forces. So the Chetnik occupation of Gorazde is coming to a very painful and tragic close for these people. An entire town and its people -- who were fed lies about living in a Security Council protected area -- is being wiped from the face of the earth, left to the mercy of Chetniks. This morning the Chetniks are targeting the hospital area with chemical agents. Yesterday, overnight, and this morning the mass slaughter of civilians on the left bank of the Drina River is continuing, not with knives but with shrapnel. Overnight alone thousands of shells were fired from Jabuka and [word indistinct] at the town center on both banks of the Drina River. Dozens of apartments were blown apart and there were many civilian casualties. The shells rained down only a few meters away from the headquarters of the UN monitors. This morning six tanks and hundreds of Chetniks are attacking Gorazde from the direction of (Osanica). The attacks have also started on Ilovaca, Zorovici, and Bare. People are fleeing from these villages toward the town. And while 60,000 people are crowding the town center on the left bank of the Drina River, the Chetniks are looting and burning all the villages that have been emptied. Yesterday dozens of trucks arrived in Kopaci, 5 km from Gorazde, from Priboj and other towns in Serbia and Montenegro, and looting is under way on a massive scale. This was supervised yesterday by the two brothers in crime, war criminals Radovan Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic. They also toured the premises of the wire factory and [word indistinct] in Kopaci, which they managed to capture with the full support of the UN, together with the residential area [words indistinct]. The mass slaughter of these people is to happen today as the Chetniks have already this morning activated their bloody artillery on the surrounding hills. The shells are again killing, and who knows for how long it will continue to claim victims among the women, children, old folk, and all those caught in this tiny crowded space. Finally it must be made clear to the world that these innocent victims and the full tragedy of the people of Gorazde are their shame.
