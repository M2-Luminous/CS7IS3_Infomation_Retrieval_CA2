He presented himself in a fighting mood, certain of his victory. For 12 minutes, applause roared in the Congress Center in Hamburg. However, only the Political Compass poll in March will show whether, with this brilliant speech, he managed to put an end to the opinion poll jeers in the country, which continued to swell in February. Even though the proportion of voters who would vote for the chancellor and the CDU remained unchanged at 34 percent compared with January, the results of the poll conducted by Basis Research for FOCUS show: The water that is streaming into the government ship through a hole will soon be up to the captain's neck. It is a phenomenon how Rudolf Scharping, to whom there is no alternative, manages to put the "chancellor of unification" into a corner like a useless umbrella, even though he himself still lacks profile and is skillfully hiding his lack of competence in material issues: Only 23.8 percent of the Germans (in January 29 percent) would vote for Helmut Kohl if they had the opportunity to elect the chancellor directly. Rudolf Scharping, who is obviously considered as some sort of radiant person and messiah, for the first time easily jumps over the 50-percent threshold in this comparison: 52.4 percent of the voters would like to see him as the future head of government. However, the most alarming result of this FOCUS poll for Kohl is proved by those who are still undecided as to whom they are going to vote for. In January, 22 percent of those polled answered the question "Who would master the most important political problems and tasks best?" with "I do not know." Four weeks later, this proportion has plummeted to 14.5 percent. At the same time, the number of those who considered a federal government headed by the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] most suitable to solve the problems rose from 39 to 46.3 percent. On the other hand, the proportion of voters who favored the CDU remained unchanged at 24 percent. Higher taxes, rising gasoline prices, an increasing number of unemployed, imminent zero wage rounds, and the disaster of the nursing-care insurance are probably items on the opinion bill. If the Germans did not have to elect the Bundestag, but could chose the composition of the federal government as they like, the next chancellor would certainly be Rudolf Scharping. A total of 34.2 percent of those polled by FOCUS want a coalition government headed by the SPD; only 15.7 percent want one headed by the CDU. A total of 25.7 percent would prefer a coalition of the CDU, the Christian Social Union [CSU], and the SPD. Helmut Kohl can turn the results around and whitewash as he likes: The Social Democrats are nowadays overtaking his party and his government in all fields regarding the acceptance of their competence -- apart from one exception. In economic policy there are still 36 percent of Germans who think that a CDU-headed government can do more than one headed by the SPD (33.8 percent). However, in this field, too, the SPD is in the process of replacing the CDU. In January the ratio was still 38:30. In the meantime, more Germans have come to the conclusion that internal security, too, is better dealt with by the SPD. While at the beginning of the year the CDU/CSU Federal Government was narrowly ahead in the competence competition by 29:28, in February it has fallen behind at 30:31. This change in the trend can be explained only by the rejection of tougher measures against crime by the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP]. In all other political questions the majority of those polled have expected Scharping and his party to give the better answers for many months and no longer Kohl's and Kinkel's CDU/CSU-FDP coalition. The FDP, the junior partner not only in terms of size, are shrinking in the voters' favor and come dangerously close to the 5-percent threshold. Polls still give it 8.5 percent of secondary votes at the next Bundestag elections. However, the doubts about its potency as a party that is capable of ruling are rising. FOCUS also asked about this capability. The result is somber for the coalition; however, it is not flattering for the opposition either (0 percent = completely incapable of ruling; 100 percent -- fully capable of ruling): SPD 62.4 percent, CDU 56.1 percent, CSU 48.4 percent, FDP 37.6 percent, and Greens 30 percent. The march of the coalition into ruin (even though still only in public opinion polls) cannot be stopped by the government team, at least not at the moment, because 40.7 percent of Germans believe that Scharping can send the better team into the race. Kohl's "lost bunch" only gets 25.7 percent in the favor of the soon "interactive" audience. Even more devastating, 42.4:17.8 percent is the ratio in Kohl's landscapes in the German east, which are flourishing a bit later. Despite the self-confident whistling in Hamburg, which is to hide one's fear of the darkness in the basement -- there is no ray of light in sight for the courageous, steadfast men around the black giant [Kohl]. However, the February poll of FOCUS still gives a little consolation: The common fear shown by the "established" parties of the numerous groups and small parties that want to run for the Bundestag elections is increasingly shown to be unjustified. Only 2 percent of those polled -- a figure that has remained almost stable for months -- would vote for the "others." Only the Republikaner (3.5 percent) and the Party of Democratic Socialism (4 percent) could get close to the 5-percent threshold. Even though the popularity values for the Instead Party and the Association of Free Citizens are surprisingly high, so far they do not have the slightest chance of entering the next Bundestag. Whether this will change will be decided by the CDU/CSU, the SPD, the FDP, and the Greens. If they manage to contribute their respective profiles to the election campaign, one need not fear a fragmentation in the next Bundestag. However, achieving one's own profile is obviously the problem. Asked how united or how disunited the individual parties are on the central political issues, the answers were the following (0 percent = completely disunited; 100 percent -- completely united): CDU 53.4 percent, CSU 53.7 percent, SPD 54.8 percent, FDP 44,8 percent, and Greens 41.2 percent. Long live the small difference.
