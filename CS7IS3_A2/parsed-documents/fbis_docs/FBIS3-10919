Fujimori, who attended the presidential inauguration in Chile, stressed that the Rio de Janeiro Protocol is an international treaty and therefore ironclad. The parliamentarians said Ecuador does have a border problem, therefore, it should insist on finding a sovereign and graceful outlet to the Amazon. The Rio de Janeiro Protocol which benefits Peru should be annulled. The statements by President Fujimori in Chile on the Rio de Janeiro Protocol have caused uneasiness in Ecuadoran political circles. Deputy Carlos Vallejo said it was advisable for the Executive Branch to continue handling the matter through the Foreign Ministry. [Begin Vallejo recording] As I have always said, this is an issue we must let the Executive Branch handle through the Foreign Ministry. This branch is the representative that must deal with international matters and our problem with Peru. [end recording] Nevertheless, for Independent Deputy [name indistinct] the problem of the Rio de Janeiro Protocol is a political problem used during election time. [Begin independent deputy recording] Of course, Peru will never accept the existence of a border problem. If we were in their shoes we would not accept the existence of a border problem either. When I was a young boy we absolutely thought that the only way for us to recover our territory was by force, that the Peruvian people were spineless, and that we had enough force, interest, and courage to occupy that territory. It has been handled politically for the past 50 plus that the Rio de Janeiro Protocol has existed. It is time to be honest. Let us stop handling this politically and much less during preelection time. We must put our hands on our hearts, think honestly and rationally and realize that the only way to have our outlet to the Amazon is by the diplomatic road. We must bring about that the Peruvian Foreign Ministry, the Peruvian Government, and the Peruvian people -- brothers as they now feel of the Ecuadorans -- grant us the renewal of that right we have; that is to navigate along the Amazon River. [end recording] Fujimori reiterated in Chile that the Rio de Janeiro Protocol is completely valid. These statements prompted several political sectors to say there is no reason for our President Sixto Duran-Ballen to travel to that nation. Other deputies also expressed their points of view on this issue. Democratic Left Deputy Antonio Rodriguez said that the Ecuadoran Government should ratify that the Rio de Janeiro Protocol signed in 1942 is null. Our position, he said, should be unyielding in upholding that the Rio de Janeiro Protocol is null and that there is a territorial conflict that in no way seeks an armed solution. Rather, it wants to draw attention to holding a permanent dialogue. Meanwhile Republican Deputy Abraham Romero indicated that Peru's position that no border problem exists, is not in keeping with reality. The thesis that there is a problem cannot be wiped out, he said. A solution must be found promoting dialogue, he noted. Former Congress President Carlos Vallejo also said it was unacceptable for the Peruvian president to ignore the fact that there is a border problem. They themselves have sought -- through the protocol's guarantors -- a solution to the crisis, he noted. Carlos Vallejo also said that the two communities should reach an honorable agreement that will allow the two nations to act with dignity without giving up the rights over the Amazon River.
