This view was expressed today by the Ukrainian Foreign Minister Konstantin Zlenko [name as heard], Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy, and Deputy Prime Minister Vasiliy Shmarov at a meeting with representatives of the diplomatic corps. At the same time Ukrainian centrist and radical right-wing political parties showed a total lack of understanding of the signing of the treaty. In particular, the very large Rukh organization and the Conservative Republican Party assessed the actions taken by President Kravchuk as treachery. According to them, the document signed in Moscow covers not only liquid fuelled rockets but also solid fuelled ones, which are not even mentioned in the START I Treaty. The pointer of the political barometer in Ukraine has moved toward tension. The sharp response has been softened to a certain extent by the Christmas holidays, which continue until 19 January.
