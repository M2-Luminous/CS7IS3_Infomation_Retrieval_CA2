Urging the United States to exercise control in invoking the Super 301 clause of its own volition [chauijogin supo 301 paltongul chaje], Han Yong-su, director of the ministry's Trade Cooperation Division, said: I do not think the U.S. action will immediately effect ROK-U.S. trade relations fundamentally [kunbonjogin] because ROK-U.S. trade is currently fairly [pigyojok] balanced and because the two countries are headed towards resolving matters of mutual interest through consultation channels. Director Han said: If the United States takes action regarding the ROK, we will solve problems that arise from U.S. actions according to dispute-settlement procedures of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the World Trade Organization. He also said: The government will utilize various channels to prevent incorrect or false information on the ROK from making its way into the annual U.S. report on each country's trade barriers. At the same time, it will support active dialogue between ROK and U.S. businessmen through ROK-U.S. industrial cooperation channels in nine areas which include the computer and semiconductor sectors.
