The investigation of criminal matters by the department's investigators last year resulted in the confiscation of R11,915,000, $900,000 in U.S. currency, items and valuables worth R3.2 billion, 338 grams of marijuana, more than 15 kg of mercury, and a large quantity of ammunition.

Federal Counterintelligence Service staffers estimate that as a result of their operations, they have prevented an economic loss to Russia totalling R5.8 billion. According to information from the service's staffers, they are currently tracking the development of contacts between Japanese yakuza [Japanese underworld] and Russian mafia structures aimed at smuggling fish and marine products and establishing channels for delivering firearms and drugs to Japan using fishing vessels and the merchant fleet.
