President Bill Clinton did so while self-appointed pro-American lobbyists in Bulgaria are sparing no efforts to convince the United States and the whole world that the country is being recommunized and its democratic development is lagging behind, after they lost power. It would have been even more gratifying, however, if President Clinton's appreciation of Bulgaria's policy in the sphere of human rights had not been tainted by the well known U.S. condescension, accompanied by encouragement for obedience (namely trade without prohibitive customs duties, for example). Regardless of Bulgaria's difficult economic situation, it still has its pride, and if someone is willing to exchange goods with our country, he had better accept us as partners rather than as subordinates. Even Russia, which is totally submerged by economic chaos, had the dignity to declare, through its ambassador in Washington last Tuesday [25 January], that it prefers real material assistance to advice on how to run its domestic affairs. Since the beginning of 1990 Bulgaria has received $150 million from the United States in the form of official financial assistance, which amounts to $40 million annually, the U.S. Embassy in Sofia has disclosed. This deserves our gratitude, but we should admit, in all frankness, that the amount is not only far from adequate compared with our country's needs, but also far from being overgenerous compared with the financial possibilities of the United States. The amount appears even more modest compared with Washington's ambition to dictate what should be done and how things should be run in Bulgarian politics. Once upon a time, the late USSR paid out much more for the same prerogative.
