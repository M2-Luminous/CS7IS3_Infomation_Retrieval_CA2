[passage omitted] He expressed his wish that Kuwait would channel its investments to German industry, in particular, and to the new regions in Germany after the unification of the east and the west, which would allow Kuwait to contribute to modern German technology and to benefit from it. The ambassador stressed that economic relations between Kuwait and Germany were developing steadily and are being strengthened in both directions, the proof being the various Kuwaiti investments in Germany. The ambassador has also denied that his country was arming fundamentalists or extremists and said that those allegations were groundless. He added that some extremists and fundamentalists are based in Germany as residents and used to be involved in some political activities, just like Kurds, Turks, and some Palestinians.
