FR940721-2-00146 FR940721-2-00085 For purposes of this demonstration, the Department will make up to $1 million available to the HABC for use in establishing a FIC in the Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood. The funding will be used in accordance with the statutory requirements of the FIC program to contribute to an integrated network of supportive services for public housing and other neighborhood residents. The system of services and outreach planned by the community, CBP, the City, and the HABC will not only increase the intensity and variety of educational and supportive services available to neighborhood residents, it will also establish a delivery system involving residents who will work with neighbors to ensure progression towards self-sufficiency. Residents involved as ``Family Advocates'' will work with trained social workers to manage the most complex cases. Together with service providers, the advocates and case workers will form ``Family Support Teams'' and will create a new system to integrate, at the community level, the multiple supportive service programs that affect most Sandtown-Winchester residents. The focal point of this service provision and outreach activity will be a Family Resource Center located in a City-owned facility on Mount Street in Sandtown-Winchester. Most of the funding provided under this demonstration will be used to renovate and expand the Mount Street facility. Remaining funds will be used for service coordination by the Family Support Teams and for core support services. Core support services will help families and individuals to overcome personal difficulties that inhibit their readiness to work, and will include such services as literacy and G.E.D. training and drop-in day care. In addition to the FIC funding proposed under this demonstration, public and private organizations will support the Family Resource Center, its core services, and the Family Support Teams. This network will deliver necessary services to public housing residents as part of the larger community, through the community-wide system developed by HABC, the City, and CBP. The Department believes that the institutional integration_of which this demonstration will be one part_will enhance the quality, continuity, and impact of support provided to public housing residents. HABC will be a particularly active partner in this endeavor, drawing upon its experience with the Family Development Center at Lafayette Courts, which provided one of the models for the national FIC program. Core support services and Family Support Team activities supported by FIC funding provided under this demonstration will be targeted to ensure that a proportionate number of public housing families are served. Funding from other sources will support the provision of services to other neighborhood residents. Private foundations and the City of Baltimore have both committed funding and in-kind donations to the project. The Department expects that this demonstration will leverage more public and private funding as the project progresses. The Department will allocate up to $1 million to HABC to carry out its part of the project, pending receipt and approval of an application that is consistent with program and submission requirements as established in this notice and any subsequent notice issued after the comment period has closed. Sandtown-Winchester Throughout the nation, collaborations between community-based organizations and private foundations are establishing partnerships to address the full range of human needs in disadvantaged communities_public safety, education, job training and placement, health and human services, housing and open space development, and others. These comprehensive community development and revitalization efforts seek not only to accomplish specific projects, but also to build community-based institutions that will continue to provide for residents' needs over the long term. Government at the local, State and Federal levels, as well as corporate partners and intermediary development organizations, have become involved in these projects to varying degrees.
