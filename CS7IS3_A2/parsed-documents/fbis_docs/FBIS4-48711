FBIS4-48711 "drafr101_c_94006" FBIS-AFR-94-101 Daily Report 22 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA KwaZulu Without Authority Due to ANC-IFP Dispute KwaZulu Without Authority Due to ANC-IFP Dispute MB2205112294 Johannesburg THE STAR in English 22 May 94 p 2 MB2205112294 Johannesburg THE STAR English BFN [Report by Carmel Rickard] [Text] Serious political wrangles between the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and the ANC over cabinet positions has left Kwazulu Natal, one of the country's poorest, most violent and least developed provinces, effectively ungoverned and unable to begin implementing much-needed reconstruction projects. Natal ANC officials put some blame on the hardline approach of IFP President and National Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who meets with President Nelson Mandela in Cape Town today in an effort to sort out the squabbles. ANC provincial leader Jacob Zuma will also be in Cape Town today, and it is understood he will meet with Mr Mandela on the same issue. Provincial premier Dr Frank Mdlalose of the IFP and Mr Zuma, with their respective advisers, will have talks on Tuesday about the problem. ANC sources say that until the stalemate is sorted out, the province will not be delegated its powers under the Constitution. Pretoria will continue to hold its powers in trust, and Kwazulu Natal will be effectively powerless. ANC sources said the force of Mr Buthelezi's presence at regional level could become so significant that the province would end up with "two premiers", Mr Buthelezi and Dr Mdlalose. Among grievances listed by Mr Zuma was Dr Mdlalose's handling of cabinet allocation. Initially he announced Mr Zuma would have the post of social welfare, but this was changed -- according to Mr Zuma, without warning or consultation -- to public works and auxiliary services. Mr Zuma also complained that the ANC was not given the deputy cabinet position on police, which it wanted. "Completely excluding the ANC from this portfolio will never work."
