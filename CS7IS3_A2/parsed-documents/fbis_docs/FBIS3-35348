The paper says in its editorial for 24 February: This, however, does not mean we are calling for stopping the activity of the Lebanese resistance, which is a legitimate act against any occupier. But resistance must stem from genuinely patriotic elements; it must not be left to groups with suspect objectives. The paper says Hizballah is working on behalf of Iran, implementing its policies and receiving financing and arms from it. The paper says Iran sponsors terrorist groups in a number of Arab and Islamic countries, and is trying to foil the peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, Syrians, and Lebanese. AL-AKHBAR concludes that imposing Lebanese Government control over Hizballah is an essential step that is in Lebanon's interest.
