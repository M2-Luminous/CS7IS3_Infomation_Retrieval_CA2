"Quite happy, but success is not essential" is the general feeling ... of Taiwanese about their lives. The survey results showed that among all interviewees, fewer than 5 percent of the people thought that they were "unhappy" with their current lives, while nearly 5 out of 10 people (49.9 percent) felt they were happy. Comparatively, to the question "Do you feel you are successful?", 22.7 percent of those interviewed responded "unsuccessful," while fewer than 2 in 10 (18.6 percent) said yes. After all, what is "success" in the minds of Taiwanese today? The survey result showed, that among the eight elements of "success," the importance of "happy and conjugal family life" was ranked number one (60.5 percent), far higher than other items, while physical and mental health (43.6 percent), the ability to do what one wants (36.5 percent) and smooth work/successful career (36.2 percent) were also among the most favored items. At least in the priority ranking reflected by the public, the "sense of utility" of Taiwan society seems to be not as serious many people had imagined. In addition, since Taiwan has gradually moved into a prosperous society, the importance of "personal financial prosperity" has dropped significantly (10.1 percent), and is no longer an important target by which most people judge "success." "Social status and fame" has become the least important factor in judging success (3.0 percent). One interviewee laughingly said, "I'm not campaigning for the legislature, why do I need fame and status?" What is a matter for rejoicing is that the key elements for success stressed by the respondents are just what people feel are the most satisfactory parts--nearly seven out of 10 people feel satisfied with their family life, while over half expressed satisfaction with their personal physical and mental health situation, and were happy with the things they want to do. Besides this, there were more than 4 out of 10 who believe they are making contributions to the society and are helpful to other people. By comparison, "social status and fame," "self development and making the most of one's ability," and "smooth work/a successful career" are items which respondents ranked as low in satisfaction. However, looking at the positive side, strong self-development and career ambition only reflect the fact that Taiwan is still a youthful, motivated society. TIENHSIA's survey results also showed that the higher the self-expectation, the greater the possibility of disappointment--among interviewees, there were fewer than four out 10 people who thought their current achievements matched their expectations. What deserves deeper thought is that, according to cross analysis based on formal schooling, people with higher education have a lower rate of attaining their self-expectations. The only exception is at the levels higher than the institute. As a person at the highest educational level self-mockingly put it, "The fact that one can receive an education in an institute is in itself a sort of achievement in China society, which strives for scholarship, industry, agriculture, and commerce." In Taiwan, where education is popularized and opportunities are quite equal, most people (35.6 percent) found fault in themselves, blaming themselves for not working hard enough, followed by the "working environment does not provide the opportunity for making the most of myself" (2.5 percent), and too rapid changes in the times and society (22.0 percent). One point of interest is that differences in age have the greatest effect on responses to this question. Younger people think it is due to themselves "not working hard enough," while their elders think it is due to "too rapid changes in the times and in society." The biggest yoke for the young and for people in the prime years of 31 to 40 is "family"; young people complain the most that the "working environment does not provide the opportunity for making the most of myself," while people in the 51 to 60 age group, facing the final sprint, complain about their own "lack of ability." Besides the obvious results showed by the entire survey, further study to analyze the connections among each item and the backgrounds of interviewees can uncover much of significance that is hidden. "Success" does not equate to "happiness"; this result is worthy of further study. The percentage of interviewees who thought of themselves as "happy" was much higher than the percentage of people who thought of themselves as "successful." This may conceal the traditional concept of Chinese as generous in expressing joy but reluctant to brag of success. "Success" does not necessarily bring "happiness," while "happy" people do not necessarily consider themselves "successful." The most obvious example is: Interviewees with super high income (annual income over two million) consider themselves successful at a higher rate than ordinary people do (28 percent); but the percentage who consider themselves "happy" is much lower than that for ordinary people (36 percent). Contrarily, although homemakers think of themselves as "happy" at a higher rate than others (56 percent), this comes with a lower rate of considering themselves "successful" than others do (16.9 percent). Although a "happy family," "physical and mental health" and "being able to do what one wants to do" are not only the most important goals for "success" in people's minds, they also are the things people consider most satisfying about their lives, and analytical results showed that these three items have a much greater effect on "happiness" than on "success." Relatively, "success" has the most obvious connection with "work/career," "making the most of one's abilities" and "personal financial prosperity," and traditional concepts of value. In other words, although a happy family, physical and mental health and being able to do what one wants can make people happy, these are often considered necessary conditions for "success," while smooth work experience, successful career, maximizing one's abilities and personal financial prosperity can make people feel genuine "success." But if we look at the interviewees' backgrounds, in a Taiwan which still holds to traditional concepts of value, it is not surprising that males over 50 years of age with high education records who are professors or chief managers and have high incomes (yearly income over one million) would have a higher rate of regarding themselves as "successful." Another interesting survey finding is that women put greater stress on "happiness," while men put more emphasis on "success." According to cross-analysis by gender, female interviewees (especially homemakers) think of themselves as "happy" at a higher rate than men do. While male interviewees have a more extreme response to success, their rates of thinking themselves successful or not are both higher than for women. This is another example of how "success" does not equate to "happiness." Generally speaking, what kind of people are happy? What kind of people are not happy? Cross-analysis showed that a sizable proportion of the people who consider themselves "happy" are women aged between 31 to 50, with a history of higher education (college graduate at minimum), professionals (doctors, lawyers...), homemakers, having high income but not "super high" (yearly income between one to two million). Among "unhappy" people, a high percentage of them were concentrated in the 51 to 64 age group, low educational level (elementary school and below), homemakers (also in the high happiness group, but also an extreme reaction), self-employed, low income (less than 200,000) or super high income (yearly income over two million). Another key to determining whether one is happy or unhappy are the differing "ideas of value." Happy people pay much greater attention to life objectives such as family, health, and "ability to do what you want," than do unhappy people. Unhappy people pay much greater attention to "personal financial prosperity" and "making a contribution to society" than happy people do. To analyze the difference further, the things pursued by a happy person are usually things one can obtain by self-adjustment, accomplished by an individual alone, usually not involving comparison or competition with others. But those things pursued by unhappy people, that is, financial prosperity and making contributions to society, are things very easily affected by the external environment, opportunities, and comparisons with other people. Since there are many factors which can be controlled by external conditions, it is more difficult to obtain happiness. As for age level, the most complicated group are those aged between 51 to 64. Although this group thought of themselves as "successful" at a high rate (21.5 percent), their rate of "happiness" was lowest (37.9 percent) of all age levels. Also, of all age levels, these are the people with the lowest rate of satisfaction concerning their current situation. This is true regardless of whether one is talking about a happy family, ability to do what one wants, making the most of one's abilities, health, or financial situation. They are the least satisfied in each. This is the group which believes they work the hardest, with a much higher rate (45.1 percent) believing they have reached their goals than do the younger people. However the percentage of them who think they are better off than they were five years ago (35.3 percent, with the average being 52 percent) and the percentage of them who felt they were happy (34 percent, with the average rate being 44.5 percent) are far lower than for other age levels. In addition to the emotional indication that "the setting sun is wonderful, but dusk is approaching," the abrupt changes in Taiwan's politics, economy and society and changing concepts of values may shock and pressure them. The group with the most extreme range of views concerning happiness or unhappiness, success or failure, are seniors over 65, differing more than any other age level. Among their views, the greatest differences lay in their children's attitudes and ways to support them. [passage omitted] How is "success" defined? There was no unanimous response. But each person's answer was enough to affect their own happiness. "In recent years, what things in your life have increased in importance?" The answers: a happy family, physical and mental healthy, being able to do what one wants to do. These were followed by work, career, contributions to society and financial prosperity. Having passed through an era of economic boom and experienced a complete reorganization of the political, economic, and social order, most Taiwanese no longer worry about "the problem of getting enough to eat and clothes to wear." Looking back at family and self, being average seems to have become the common expectation of most people. On the whole, pursuing "happiness" instead of "success" will be the "new life attitude" for Taiwanese in the future. This survey was conducted between 16 and 18 January by means of systematic sampling and telephone interviews throughout the whole of Taiwan. There was an effective sample of 1,282, with a confidence level of 9.5 out of 10, and an error rate of plus or minus 2.68 percent.
