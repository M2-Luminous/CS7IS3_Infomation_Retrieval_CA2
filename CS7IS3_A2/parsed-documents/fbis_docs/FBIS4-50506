However, all Chen's moves are carried out in the presence of public security personnel. "Escorted" by the relevant departments, a source here said, Chen Ziming and his wife arrived in Shijiazhuang last week for a "short recuperation." Chen Ziming and his wife have stayed in an ordinary guest house over the past few days. He was told that after a period of recuperation here, he can return to Beijing in early June. As everyone knows, the source said that Chen Ziming has been sent to another locality to recuperate because of the upcoming fifth anniversary of the "4 June incident." Many foreign reporters are now in Beijing awaiting an opportunity to interview the pro-democracy figures of 1989. The authorities do not want Chen Ziming to be interviewed by foreign reporters at this time. The departments concerned do not know what Chen would say and what viewpoints he would express in interviews and they are worried that the results would be disadvantageous to China's bid for the most favored nation trading status. Before his release, it is said that Chen promised the authorities that he would be away from Beijing for a period of time after he is granted "parole for medical treatment."
