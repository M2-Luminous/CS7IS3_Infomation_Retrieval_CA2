Viktor Isakov, head of the Russian delegation for talks with Lithuania, said the progress made in Vilnius is "modest, but nevertheless a contribution" to the development of bilateral relations. The Russian negotiator said the deadlock over Russian transit through Lithuanian territory remains the main problem, which also concerns Lithuania's most favored nation trade status. The Russian diplomat said the connection between transit and trade appeared last year when talks on Russian troop withdrawal from Lithuania were coming to an end, and was confirmed at all further meetings between negotiators, as well as by the agreements signed. Virgilijus Bulovas, head of the Lithuanian working group for talks with the CIS, said the talks were "constructive" and added that "more time and efforts are needed" to resolve the remaining problems. Bulovas said both sides agreed that Belarussian representatives should take part in talks on transit. Isakov implied that the status of the Kaliningrad region in Lithuanian-Russian talks does not differ from the status of any other Russian region. The Russian diplomat said Kaliningrad can be granted special status only if such a law is adopted in Russia. At a joint press conference Wednesday, both delegation leaders confirmed that Russian military transit through Lithuania was not discussed in Vilnius and that both sides only exchanged views on the issue. The only document signed during the Vilnius meeting was an agreement on the basic principles of settlements between Lithuania and Russia. The accord was signed by representatives of Lithuanian and Russian central banks. Negotiators initialled an agreement on cooperation between customs and virtually completed preparation of an agreement on contract employees. Isakov said the next round of talks is likely to be held before September. The exact date will depend on the work of experts, he said. Discussing issues that may be discussed at the next round of talks, Bulovas mentioned mutual travel, cultural values, nuclear energy, fishing and environment protection.
