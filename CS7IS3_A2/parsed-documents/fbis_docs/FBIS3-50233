Despite the fact that it was previously announced that the meeting would not be a news conference, the General Staff chief answered several questions regarding problems in the Bulgarian Army. General Petrov considers the new military budget extremely insufficient for the Army, especially since war is raging along our western border. However, the Army chief said that contrary to reports that appeared immediately after the draft military budget was published, even if the budget is adopted, he would not resign. "I will not desert the Army, but I also will not be held responsible for the Bulgarian Army's combat readiness, " General Petrov said. The General Staff chief admitted participating in working out the presidential decree on the functions and prerogatives of the president's Military Office but refused to comment on the issue until the National Security Commission takes a stand.
