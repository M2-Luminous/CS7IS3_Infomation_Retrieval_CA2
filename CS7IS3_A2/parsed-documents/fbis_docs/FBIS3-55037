The fraudster, convicted on 50 counts, faces a 400-year jail sentence. The Bricklayer Lawyer In our country the best of intentions usually end in major scandals, court cases, and monstrous losses. But the "Ugol Rossii" Corporation (successor to the "Rosugol" state company) could hardly have imagined in its worst nightmare that its quite innocent desire to have two brick plants in Moscow Oblast's Serebryanoprudskiy Rayon would suddenly be transformed into a court case in what was, for it, the hitherto unknown Oklahoma City and that it would have to appear as the injured party. The idea was indeed to build these ill-starred plants to help miners in the Arctic who had been pensioned off. Arriving in warm Serebryanyye Prudy from the cold north, they would get a job at these plants and then receive housing built from bricks made with their own hands. It was decided to buy all the necessary equipment abroad. The tenders from major European and American firms were rejected at the outset as too expensive. Then the Oklahoma lawyer David Branson popped up from out of the blue. It is still a mystery as to who put the fraudster lawyer in touch with the "Ugol Rossii" leadership and how he was able to captivate the management. After all, until that time Branson had, by all accounts, only a rather vague idea about the brick manufacturing process, and his firm -- Consolidated Service Corporation, which, according to him, had received the prestigious "E" award from the U.S. Department of Commerce -- was only registered after signing the contract with our Russian businessmen. On the other hand, the lawyer promised to build the two brick plants in Serebryanoprudskiy Rayon for just $4.395 billion [as published]. In order to appear more convincing, he organized several trips for "Rosugol" representatives to the United States and South Africa, where, in an atmosphere of easygoing service, he took the tourists to visit other firms' plants producing brickmaking equipment, and passed them off as his own. The Russian officials' hearts melted, the contract was signed, and Branson was paid $1.3 million as an advance against future deliveries. The owner of Consolidated Service Corporation did not need any particular creativity to spend of the money. He vacationed in Hawaii and bought a fully furnished house and nine collector's-item automobiles. Another $100,000 went on dispatching several tie rods to the Moscow region.... Admittedly, "Rosugol" suspected that something was amiss but, fearing a scandal, preferred to extend the dubious contract in the hope of at least getting something more out of America. Unfortunately, it hoped in vain. Who knows how long all this would have gone on had the scandal not broken in the United States. Overdoing Things By 400 Years Initially local businessmen asked questions. In fobbing off our naive compatriots, Branson had overdone things somewhat. He produced exclusively for the Russian market an advertising brochure on his firm with beautiful photographs of other plants, calling them the property of Consolidated Service Corporation. The amazement of the real owners, when they found out about this document, knew no bounds. And the U.S. Internal Revenue Service also took an interest in the lawyer's spending. As a result, David Branson was arrested, and the U.S. Justice Department appealed through the Russian General Prosecutor's Office to the Russian Federation MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] Investigations Committee for help in investigating the case, which in principle affected us more than the Americans. Nikolay Psyrkov, an investigator with the Administration for the Investigation of Particularly Important Cases, did all that his U.S. colleagues needed -- he questioned witnesses and participants in the events and visited the empty site in Serebryanoprudskiy Rayon which had been carefully prepared for the construction of the plants promised by the lawyer. Then, taking with him as the main victim Valeriy Zaydenvark, deputy general director of "Rosugol," traveled to Oklahoma to take part in the trial. The Russian investigator's professional job and the deputy general director's sorry story made an indelible impression on the Oklahoma jury. David Branson was found guilty on 50 counts. In January he faces a total of 400 years' imprisonment. Following the confiscation and sale of the brickmaker lawyer's property, Russia should get back around $400,000 of the $1.3 million it lost in advance payments. The Americans will be getting something too -- help from the Russian Federation MVD's Investigations Committee in investigating an affair that has cost the U.S. medical insurance system $1 billion.... Jacobo Martinez Greenberg, or a Personal Magnet It would be naive to imagine that our emergent homegrown version of capitalism would suffer from intrigues by foreign adventurists without retaliating. Former Soviet citizens who now have the world as their oyster have been making money in the most unexpected situations with an inventiveness hard for Westerners to grasp. One such situation perpetrated a cynical and outrageous crime against the much-vaunted U.S. medical insurance system. The leaders of the sinister operation were three natives of the former Soviet Union. The leader was Mikhail Smushkevichus -- aka Moss, aka Jacobo Martinez Greenberg, aka Ivan Pavlov Sanchez -- and his two henchmen Michael (Mikhail Grigoryevich) Fayman and Feliks Kolgovskiy. In their former homeland they were known as the organizers of a firm to provide Soviet citizens with jobs abroad. Attractive employers' "contracts" were sold all over at the time. As a result, none of the 500,000 people who took the tempting bait actually went abroad -- but Jacobo Martinez Greenberg did, along with his "comrades" and the startup capital for his next business. Basing themselves in Los Angeles, they set up a network of mobile diagnostic centers and around 300 bogus companies, and opened a huge number of accounts. This entire armada was targeted against the U.S. medical insurance system. The actual ins and outs of the affair are relatively complicated, and we will not go into them. But the results were stunning. The swindlers earned more than $50 million in pure profit, and the damage they have done is estimated at $1 billion. Today they are all under investigation, and each faces a total of up to 1,500 years in jail. Nobody knows where the stolen millions are, but the Americans believe them to be in Russia or Lithuania. No Money Without a Treaty Nikolay Psyrkov, the investigator with the Russian MVD Investigations Committee's Administration for the Investigation of Particularly Important Cases, to whom we spoke on his return from the United States, pointed to his office safe: "There are several files in there, files on the embezzlement of $33 million, $10 million, and one for $50 million. There is a pretty standard operating procedure. Someone does the job, the money is put in foreign banks, and they leave the country. And in each case it is virtually impossible to get the stolen money back to Russia or to bring the fraudster himself to trial...." Unfortunately, the success in investigating the Branson and Smushkevichus-Greenberg affairs was possible only thanks to the personal ties between Russian and American investigators and so-called cooperation by agreement -- under the "you scratch our back" principle. In a number of other cases this simply does not apply. Strangely enough, we have concluded treaties on legal help in investigating criminal cases with just 17 countries, mainly in the former socialist camp. No documents have yet been signed with the main countries where our economic refugees usually hide and where our criminal structures keep their capital -- the United States, Austria, and Britain. In this situation it is impossible to track movements of stolen money through bank accounts, spending, or the sources of criminal financial operations; consequently, it is also impossible to prove that crimes have been committed.... Today all requests for help on specific criminal cases in the United States, for instance, have a long, hard route to travel -- from the MVD Investigations Committee to the General Prosecutor's Office to the Foreign Ministry to the embassy to the U.S. Justice Department; three or four months are quite enough for criminals to hide money and go into hiding themselves. The same thing happens in reverse too. Suffice it to say that our investigators received the request for help on the Branson case directly. The official request only arrived through the usual channels when Nikolay Psyrkov, having done everything necessary, was setting off for the trial in Oklahoma. But even personal contacts will not save us. The gaps in criminal legislation are too big. How can we explain to Western colleagues that someone is under investigation for suspicion of what is still called "embezzlement of socialist property?" Or that he has been charged under Article 147 of the Russian Criminal Code with "fraud," which the Americans break down into 20 separate crimes? Nor are things clear regarding the return of stolen property from abroad. When it is simply a matter of money, everything is more or less understandable, but when that money has been invested in shares, land, or real estate the waters are much muddier. I was told at the Investigations Committee that they themselves had tried to clarify why treaties on legal assistance in criminal cases are taking so long to conclude. They had found themselves in a Bermuda Triangle among the Foreign Ministry, the General Prosecutor's Office, and the Justice Department. Nobody in these three departments was able to say anything convincing -- they just sent you on to the next one. And that was the end of the matter. Yet, while officials are thrashing things out, the land of democratic reforms is simply a paradise for both Russian and foreign fraudsters. The main thing is to get out of the country with your loot in time. Once out, you can take things easy.
