The independent-moderate Seoul MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN in Korean, which focuses on economic issues, publishes on page 2 a 1,000-word article by Yi Tong-chu reviewing the ROK-U.S. trade meeting. The article reports the United States had a much stronger tone than in previous meetings in its demands and that the meeting was held amid worry and concern over the effect of the Super 301 restoration on the ROK. The article says our government had been optimistic that the meeting would focus on "the development of general cooperation" but the U.S. side extinguished that optimism by "raising individual subjects, such as the protection of the intellectual property right, IPR, and further opening of the motor vehicle market." The article reports the United States demanded strengthened regulation on software reproduction and revision of our revised IPR regulations in the IPR sector; and lower tariffs, lower domestic tax, and amendment of automobile taxes in the motor vehicle sector. The article reports that in response to the U.S. demands, our side explained that we are strengthening investigation of copyright violations and asked the United States to drop the ROK from the priority surveillance list for the IPR and advocated our position that the ROK has already made substantial tariff cuts on motor vehicle imports. The article concludes that the meeting only reconfirmed the two sides' positions and predicted stronger trade pressure from the United States. The MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN publishes on page 4 a 300-word article by Washington correspondent Kim Kyong-su on the USTR's annual trade policy report. The article reports "the USTR positively appraised ROK's contribution to a successful Uruguay Round, but urged early implementation of laws to protect patents, trademarks, and copyrights." The moderate Seoul HANGUK ILBO in Korean publishes on page 5 a 1,000-word article by Washington correspondent Chong Chin-sok on USTR's annual trade policy report. The article reports that the USTR reported the ROK has taken positive action in lowering tariffs on agricultural and manufactured goods, but stressed continued pressure on the IPR and motor vehicle sectors. The pro-government Seoul SEOUL SINMUN in Korean publishes on page 8 a 500-word article on USTR's annual trade policy report. The article also reports that "the USTR positively appraised ROK's opening effort, but urged improvement in the IPR and motor vehicle sectors."
