The unexpected development has delayed until after Tuesday the inauguration of a new government. The intracoalition standoff delayed the process of forming a new cabinet and the subsequent imperial attestation ceremony at the Imperial Palace in the presence of Emperor Akihito, they said. Hata said in a telephone message Monday night to Eiichi Nakamura, representative of the Democratic Reform Party, a small political party in the House of Councillors affiliated with Japan's largest trade union organization, the Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo), that he will complete the formation of his new cabinet by the early hours of Tuesday. Hata also said he would have to make fairly major alterations in the personnel lineup of the cabinet of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, which resigned en masse Monday morning. The Social Democratic Party (SDP), with 74 members in the House of Representatives, reacted strongly to the sudden establishment of the new parliamentary group in the lower house, from which it is excluded. Coalition dissension intensified a few hours after the Diet voted Shinseito leader Hata, 58, as new prime minister in place of Hosokawa.
