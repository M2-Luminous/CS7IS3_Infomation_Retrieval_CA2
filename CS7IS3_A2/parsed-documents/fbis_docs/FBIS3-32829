The minister has said if Armed Forces members are indeed involved in this crime, their sentences will show there is no impunity in Peru. On another topic, Vega has also reported that 95 percent of terrorist leaders are now in jail and that hope has been restored in Peru. The shadow of Marxist-Leninist-Maoist Communism no longer hovers over the country's future, the justice minister has said. He added, however, the struggle against terrorism and the state of emergency continued, and he justified the validity of several measures geared toward punishing and eradicating subversion.
