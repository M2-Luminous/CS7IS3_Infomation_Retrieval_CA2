To the Mexican people, the peoples and governments of the world, the national and international press, and brothers: The Zapatist National Liberation Front's Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Committee-General Command respectfully addresses all of you to inform you of its evaluation and to reply to the peace agreements proposed by the supreme government at the negotiations table during the Meetings for Peace and Reconciliation in Chiapas. 1. The EZLN, a militant Mexican organization comprised primarily of Indians, rose up in arms against the supreme government on 1 January 1994. The EZLN demands are summarized in the 11 points outlined in the Lacandona Jungle Declaration: work, land, housing, food, health, education, independence, liberty, democracy, justice, and peace. Those demands are supported by the majority of the Mexican people, and the EZLN is struggling for those demands, for all Mexicans. 2. After bloody clashes between our troops and policemen and soldiers of the Federal Army, a national and civilian movement forced us to suspend the clashes and attempt to hold a dialogue with the supreme government. Those talks were held in the city of San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, in late February and early March 1994. 3. On the occasion of the dialogue in San Cristobal, the EZLN presented a list of demands containing 34 points that could lead to peace with justice and dignity. 4. The list of 34 demands from the EZLN contains national and state demands, some for the entire population and others for peasants and Indians. The supreme government tried in vain to minimize the importance of our just struggle by viewing it as a conflict involving local Indian groups and even limiting it to four municipalities in the southeastern Chiapas State. 5. Our national demands for all Mexicans include: a) Free and democratic elections with equal rights and obligations for all political forces. b) In order to guarantee liberty and democracy, we demand the resignation of the head of the Federal executive branch as well as the illegitimate heads of the state governments. Following the president of the Republic's resignation, a transition government should be created, which will organize free and democratic elections. We also demand laws to guarantee the right of citizens and groups of citizens without any political affiliation to participate in the electoral process as a real and supreme authority. c) We demand a new federal pact to put an end to centralism and permit the autonomy of Indian communities and municipalities. d) We demand the revision of the free trade agreement signed with Canada and the United States because it is not consonant with Mexico's reality. e) We demand dignified jobs and just salaries for all rural and city workers; we also demand the enforcement of and respect for the Federal Labor Law, for the benefit of all rural and city workers. f) We demand an end to the sacking of our national wealth. g) We demand the cancellation of all debts acquired through credits, loans, and taxes. h) We demand solutions for the national problem of hunger and malnutrition in the Mexican countryside and cities. i) We demand the immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners and poor prisoners who are unjustly in jail throughout the country. 6. The supreme government avoided giving a positive reply to the national demands presented by the EZLN, which are supported by wide sectors of the Mexican people. Developments that followed the dialogue in San Cristobal showed that the EZLN's demands for democracy were justified. The cowardly assassination of Colosio, the imposition of Zedillo as candidate of the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party], and the newly acquired strength of government hard-liners showed that the resignation of Mr. Salinas de Gortari as chief executive on 1 January would have been the best option for the country. His efforts to perpetuate his position of power have created a permanent climate of insecurity and his efforts to commit electoral fraud to continue usurping power, through Zedillo, has placed the nation on the brink of a civil war. The electoral reform was obviously incomplete. The presence of a flawed voters list leaves the door open to electoral fraud and confirms the violation of the people's will. The reinforcement of government apparatuses of repression and the attempt to force the Federal Army to carry out police duties shows us very clearly that the Salinist group is not seeking a democratic transition, rather fraud and imposition. The EZLN reaffirms what is reflected by reality: The supreme government has no democratic inclination. The state party system must be destroyed. The EZLN reaffirms the demands made in points 1 and 2 of a document presented in San Cristobal: 1. Free and democratic elections. 2. Toppling the usurpers in the branches of the union and in the states of the Federation. The EZLN broadens its demands: There is a need for a democratic transitional government and a new constituent assembly to ensure, with laws and in practice, compliance with the basic demands of the Mexican people: democracy, liberty, and justice. These demands found a voice among the voiceless, a face among the faceless, a future among the futureless, and a life among the dead. The bad government tried to limit the demand for autonomy to the Indian communities and to leave intact the centralized system of power, which gives the Federal executive branch a dictatorial dimension. The government ignored the demand for genuine autonomy for the municipalities. The law proposed by the government to recognize the political, economic, and cultural autonomy of Indian communities is being handled according to normal procedures: The bill does not present an in-depth solution and does not reflect a consensus among Indian sectors or experts, and attempts are being made to approve it in a hurry. Contravening its own offer that the so-called "General Law of Indian Community Rights" will be in response to "the demands, ideas, concerns, and political consensus of the Indian communities" and that it will be enriched by "a group of experts," the law simply complies with the procedure of fulfilling the requirement of regulating Article 4 of the Constitution, without consulting the interested sectors. To the demand of revising NAFTA, the government replied with its stubbornness regarding continuing with an economic plan that has only contributed to increasing poverty in our country and deceiving foreign partners by promising them economic stability and social peace. The government promised to conduct "a careful evaluation of the impact of NAFTA." That evaluation has not been made. The Mexican people, however, can help save the time and money that will be spent by a commission "to evaluate the impact." The impact of the free trade agreement may be observed on the tables of any poor household in Mexico. In reply to a national demand for dignified work and just salaries, the government continues to implement an economic policy that increases unemployment and underemployment and decreases the purchasing power of workers. Union corruption continues to be the foundation of the neoliberal economic project. The demand to end the looting of national wealth has been ignored, and government action has been limited to the ecological aspect. There is no national policy to defend the country's natural wealth. The demand to pardon all debts acquired by poor segments of the population has been met with unfulfilled government promises to conduct a study, the result of which will certainly be to postpone any solution to the problem. As in the previous examples, in response to a demand to end hunger and malnutrition among our people, there have been attempts to limit solutions to certain areas of Chiapas as if hunger and malnutrition were only a problem of the Indians of Los Altos and of the jungle area. As if the programs were food, the government has responded with promises to implement child nutrition programs. In reply to our demand for the release of all political prisoners and all the poor people unjustly detained in Mexican jails, we have received promises of creating commissions to study those cases. The unjust Mexican judicial system, which only favors the powerful, will remain intact. In sum, in no way did the federal government reply satisfactorily to the just national demands presented by the EZLN. Therefore, the EZLN rejects points 1, 2, 4, 7, 18, 20, 21, 22, and 23 of the peace agreement proposed by the government. 7. Some of the EZLN demands for peasants, which include all Mexican peasants are: a) Making Article 27 of the Constitution respect Emiliano Zapata's original spirit: Land belongs to those who make it produce. b) Constructing hospitals and clinics for the countryside in all rural areas, with doctors and medicine. c) Just prices for farming products, the elimination of mediators, and direct commercialization with peasants. d) The Army and police should not act in rural communities for the benefit of political bosses and landlords. 8. The supreme government has refused to reply satisfactorily to national demands from peasants: The government's refusal to abolish amendments to Article 27 of the Constitution promoted by President Salinas de Gortari and to restore the right to land in the Constitution was repudiated by broad peasant sectors throughout the country. Amendments to Article 27 of the Constitution, which are the basis for neoliberal policy in the Mexican countryside, must disappear. The Political Constitution of the United Mexican States should resume Emiliano Zapata's struggle. The reply to the demands for hospitals, clinics, doctors, and medicine for the Mexican countryside is limited to offers for the areas affected by the conflict. The right to health in the Mexican countryside will continue to be neglected. Demands for fair produce prices and for the elimination of the middleman system have been met by the government with a vote-buying office, Procampo, [Program of Direct Support to the Countryside] whose efficiency is measured by its ability to corrupt peasant leaders and commit their votes to the party of the state. Promises of projects are the government's response to a Mexican countryside that is just barely surviving. Demands for the departure of policemen and Army troops from rural areas have been met by the government with promises of changes in the administration of justice, the increased presence of troops and war materiel in conflict zones, and attempts to force the Federal Army to fulfill police duties. The arrogance of powerful cattlemen, who enjoy government economic support, bothers common land peasants and Indians in general. In sum, the just national peasant demands of the EZLN have not received adequate responses from the federal government. It has only promised partial and local solutions. Thus, the EZLN rejects the peace agreement proposals in points 8, 9, 19, and 24. 9. Among the EZLN's national Indian demands are: a) The right of the Indians to receive true and timely information through an Indian radio station that is independent of the government and led and managed by Indians. b) Complete and free education for all Indian peoples. c) Declaring the languages of all Indians official, and making their teaching obligatory at all school levels. d) Respect for the culture and tradition of Indian peoples. e) Eradicating discrimination and racism against Indians. f) Cultural, political, and judicial autonomy for Indian peoples. g) Respect for the Indian people's right to liberty and to a dignified life. h) Economic and social support for Indian women. 10. The supreme government partially responded to the EZLN's national Indian demands. Although the government promised an independent Indian radio station, its response to the education issue has been limited to the selective scholarship method that deprives many Indians of their right to education at all levels. The rest of the government's responses to these points are limited to promises to carry out studies and programs in time periods that, in most cases, already expired. In sum, the partial government responses to our national Indian demands and its failure to comply with previous commitments lead us to reject the peace agreement proposals in points 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 27, and 29. 11. Among the EZLN's demands at the state level are: a) Holding general elections in Chiapas and legal recognition of all political forces in the state. b) Installing electricity in the Chiapas countryside and a percentage of petroleum revenues. c) Compensating war victims. d) Repealing provisions in the Penal Code of the State of Chiapas that restrict the political struggle. e) Halting expulsions and promoting the free and voluntary return of those expelled from their lands of origin and compensation for damage inflicted. f) Holding political trials for Messrs. Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido, Absalon Castellanos Dominguez, and Elmar Setzer M. 12. The supreme government unsatisfactorily answered the state demands of the EZLN: The electoral reform in Chiapas does not allow groups to organize themselves to participate in elections, the demands for the electrification of the Chiapas countryside are answered with programs and promises, expulsions continue and those responsible are not punished, and there are only promises of economic support for the Indians in the state. When the support is finally given, it is in exchange for votes. The political trial of the three former governors, who forced us to rise up in arms, is omitted. In sum, the unsatisfactory answers and our lack of confidence in the real fulfillment of government promises lead us to reject the government peace agreement proposals in points 5, 6, 25, 27, 28, 29, and 30. 13. Finally, the EZLN demanded that the government recognize it as a militant force. The Mexican people, through the various organizations, have already granted us that recognition. To our demand for recognition as a militant force and to the recognition of our troops as authentic fighters, the supreme government responded by offering guarantees of worthy and respectful treatment of the members of the EZLN and offering legal status for the EZLN. The bad government cannot offer full security guarantees to its components, nor can we expect it to give worthy and respectful treatment to those who, interpreting the legitimate goals of democracy, freedom, and justice for the Mexican people, rose up in arms in a just struggle. The EZLN was created as an army to demand respect for the people's will. This respect continues to be denied, and the people's will is disregarded by the usurping government. The reasons that led to the birth of the EZLN prevail; the EZLN will remain up in arms until the demands for democracy, freedom, and justice for all are met. The EZLN agreed to observe international treaties regulating combat in war.... the EZLN has observed such treaties. We will continue to do it. The EZLN reiterates its demand to be recognized as a militant force and demands the recognition of its troops as authentic fighters. To achieve this, the EZLN will resort to the various international forums to demand this recognition from the peoples and governments of the world. The recognition of the EZLN as a militant force is necessary so that the dialogue process can have firm bases for development. 14. The supreme government, in the dialogue in San Cristobal, presented its peace agreement proposal. The EZLN answered by explaining that it had to consult its members because the people who created us were the ones who ordered us into war and only they can give us the order for peace. Following multiple setbacks, the consultations ended; this is our reply to the government's proposals. 15. For all the above and based on the free and democratic voting of its members, the EZLN answers NO to the peace agreement proposal of the supreme government. It is terminating the San Cristobal dialogue; it reiterates its willingness to continue searching for a political solution that can lead to a peace with dignity and justice, and it calls all progressive and independent groups to a national dialogue of peace with democracy, freedom, and justice. We will not surrender! Democracy! Freedom! Justice! Respectfully: From the mountains of southeastern Mexico. The EZLN's CCRI-CG. Mexico, June 1994
