FBIS4-24093 "drafr121_e_94010" FBIS-AFR-94-121 Daily Report 23 Jun 1994 WEST AFRICA Nigeria Abiola Arrested Following Appearance at Rally Abiola Arrested Following Appearance at Rally Police Official Comments on Arrest AB2306112094 Lagos Voice of Nigeria in English 1030 GMT 23 Jun 94 AB2306112094 Lagos Voice of Nigeria English BFN [Text] The Nigerian police has accomplished a major feat by finally tracking down Chief Moshood Abiola who allegedly declared himself president of Nigeria about a couple of weeks ago. It will be recalled that Chief Abiola, the presidential candidate of the defunct Social Democratic Party, was declared wanted about two weeks ago by the police to answer a charge of treason leveled against him following his self-declaration as president of Nigeria. The deputy inspector general of police in charge of operations, Mr. Nuhu Aliyu, confirmed the arrest in an interview a few hours ago with Mohammed Okoresho. [Begin recording] [Aliyu] The arrest is no longer a rumor; it is confirmed, yes. We are very positive. [Okoresho] Now, how did it happen? Did he surrender himself or he appeared as reported in some of the media, or you sought him out? [Aliyu] He did not surrender himself. He appeared, and we were very cautious but eventually we arrested him. [Okoresho] Now, before his appearance in public, did you get a tipoff of his hideout or that he was going to appear in public? [Aliyu] Yes, yes, yes we got a tipoff that he was appearing. [Okoresho] Now, how come, according to press reports, that he was able to address a rally and drive through the traffic all the way to his own house until he was picked up much later? [Aliyu] It's a strategy; I do not want to explain further. [Okoresho] A foreign radio has been relaying an interview with Chief Moshood Abiola while supposedly being taken away by his captors. Are people under arrest normally allowed to do that kind of interview? It does not seem like a police style to me. [Aliyu] Normally, somebody who.... [pauses] whoever is under arrest is not supposed to grant any interview. It's very unusual. We are looking into this report. [Okoresho] What are going to do with Chief Abiola now? Where is he right now? [Aliyu] Chief Abiola? [Okoresho] Yes. [Aliyu] Of course, he is going to be interrogated. You know, after accusation he has to sit down with us, we interrogate him. He will have to make a statement to us. [end recording]
