Testing of this project still has 1,500 hours to go and the completion of these tests will have importance for making practical use of national energy resources by industrializing the coal liquification process. In the early 1980s, the CAS Shanxi Coal Chemistry Research Institute began to study two new industrial processes for coal-based synthetic gasoline, and an intermediate test was conducted at the Daixian Fertilizer Plant in Shanxi with good results. In 1990, the State Planning Commission gave the go-ahead for an industrialization test for coal-based synthetic gasoline. The test was undertaken jointly by the Pucheng No. 2 Chemical Fertilizer Plant and the CAS Shanxi Coal Chemistry Institute. The test project was designed for an annual production of 2,000 tons of oil and 7.5 million cubic meters of coal gas. Altogether the central government, Shanxi Province, and Pucheng Municipality invested over 22.33 million yuan. On 16 December, after nearly three years of effort, the researchers and technicians successfully completed the chemical-starter test-vehicle mission, and when they reached the oil production stage, they immediately launched into the 1,500-hour test and assessment stage. Shanxi Province will build a pilot plant with a 50,000- to 100,000-ton output capability based on the outcome of this industrial test.
