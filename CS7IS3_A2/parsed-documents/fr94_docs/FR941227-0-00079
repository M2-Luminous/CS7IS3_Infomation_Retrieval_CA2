FR941227-0-00079 FR941227-0-00015 The Notice of Violation option was developed to address the Coast Guard's concern that the civil penalty assessment process was too lengthy when applied to small (under 100 gallons) oil discharges and minor pollution prevention regulation violations. The lengthy process time meant that a party frequently would have additional violations before being notified by a Hearing Officer of the initiation of action for the first violation. The NOV option provides for early notification of alleged violators and offers early resolution of uncontested small oil spill and pollution prevention violations. Early resolution of these minor violations saves time and reduces costs of internal reviews, improves deterrence, and facilitates corrective action by providing a party with earlier notice of violations. The interim rule amended 33 CFR 1.07 to add the optional alternative procedure and the Coast Guard conducted a pilot program for six months in the Captain of the Port zones of Charleston, SC; Galveston, TX; and Los Angeles, CA. The result of the pilot program was favorable. During the pilot program 197 NOVs were issued for oil spills and 21 NOVs were issued for pollution prevention violations with a total penalty value of $96,400. As of October 13, 1994, 160 NOVs had been paid totaling $57,275 in penalties. The optional procedure allows early settlement of cases in which a Coast Guard issuing officer issues a NOV. A Coast Guard issuing officer is a commissioned, warrant or petty officer with specific training and authority to issue a violation notice. A party has the option of paying the penalty proposed on the NOV, declining the NOV, or taking no action on the NOV. If a party pays the proposed penalty indicated on a NOV, the case is closed without further processing by a District Program Manager or Hearing Officer. If a party declines the NOV or takes no action, the case is processed as if an NOV had never been issued. A complete case file, report and recommended penalty amount is sent to the District Commander for review prior to being forwarded to the Hearing Officer for processing as any other civil penalty case. The Hearing Officer's Letter of Notification would specify a penalty deemed appropriate based on the case file. The proposed penalty is not limited to the amount proposed in the field on the NOV. The NOV option will be implemented by Coast Guard Captains of the Port as soon as sufficient numbers of personnel have been trained in the issuance of NOVs. Representatives from each district, marine safety office, and detachment are being sent to a ``train the trainer'' course on the NOV option at the Coast Guard Reserve Training Center in Yorktown, VA. After the initial Yorktown training, each unit will be able to properly train additional personnel. Each district will publicize the dates when its units will start to use the NOV option. Use of the NOV option is initially being limited, by Commandant Directive, to violations of specified regulations and statutory requirements subject to Class I Administrative Civil Penalties under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA), as amended. A NOV can be issued for two types of violations: (1) oil discharges in violation of the FWPCA, if they are 100 gallons or less, and (2) violations of pollution prevention regulations (33 CFR Parts 154, 155, 156) for which the current penalty guidelines list a penalty not greater than $2500. Coast Guard issuing officers can issue a NOV only in cases that meet specific written guidance. Penalty amounts are taken from a penalty schedule and may not be increased or decreased by the issuing officer. Any case in which aggravating or extenuating circumstances are involved, or in which the violations do not meet the specific written guidance, is not eligible for NOV issuance and will be processed for referral to the Hearing Officer in accordance with normal procedures.
