Once again, our voices rise from the lofty mountains of Gharyan. [passage omitted] Libyan people have now realized the truth of what we have said here brothers. Libyan people, brothers, are aware of all that we have said. We have stated that what happened in Iraq was bound to happen in every Arab country. They said no, because Iraq occupied Kuwait. We now have Yemen which is being divided and torn part as was Iraq. Did Yemen occupy Kuwait? Come on, answer me, you reactionaries; you the agents of the United States. Why don't you answer this question? This Yemen which is being torn part by U.S. Arab reaction and Israeli plots, did it occupy Kuwait? You claimed that Iraq was torn apart because it occupied Kuwait. Now, Yemen is being divided, did Yemen occupy Kuwait? We said that what happened in Iraq will take place in every Arab country. This is now happening before our own eyes in Yemen. What is happening in Yemen is a reactionary Arab-U.S. plot so that Yemen will not be a strong country; so that there will not be a strong republic in the Arab peninsula. This is an exposed scheme; Arab reaction has been exposed in this plot. The role of the United States is clear and exposed. Those who received orders from Washington to divide Yemen admitted before the whole world that they were in the United States and received their order there. Brothers, who can be fooled by these lies? Who can be fooled by these fabrications? The Arab reaction, which is siding with the United States, is responsible for the destruction of the people of Iraq, the land and Iraq; the killing of the children of Iraq, and the starvation of our people in Iraq. They claimed that they did so because of Kuwait. Now the Arab reaction, which allies itself with the United States, is tearing Yemen apart bit by bit. It is killing the children of Yemen. What will the cowardly reaction which is allied with its imperialist master say? Will it say that Yemen was implicated in Kuwait, that it occupied Kuwait? We say to the simpletons in the rest of the Arab countries that your turn is certainly coming. Arab oil which is under imperialist control will be used to the last drop against the future, the dignity, and the freedom of the Arab nation. It has been decided to use the last drop of Arab oil which America controls against the Arab nation. The turns of Syria, Egypt, Algeria, and Sudan are coming, just as the blockade and the confrontation that have now been imposed on Libya. [passage omitted] The partitioning of Iraq will lead to the partitioning of another Arab country. This has now been achieved. This is now the conspiracy in Yemen. They provide justifications for each Arab country which are different from those for a previous Arab country. We say to the stupid who think that they are safe by being submissive and agents of the West, we say to them that western imperialism, the coward Arab reactionary forces and Zionism, this filthy bloc, are determined to tear the Arab nation apart and to trample down every single inch of Arab land and divide it again into states of factions. History is repeating itself. It is only here that the voice of freedom is raised. Here in Gharyan the homeland, with the voice of the free people, we say to them, to the old and contemporary Arab tribes who have populated Libya, that confrontation starts here, preparation starts here, and we accept the challenge. We do not bargain, we do not recognize, and we do not give up. We say to them that all their attempts and pressure to force the free people of Libya to kneel down, are hopeless. We say to them that free Libya, revolutionary Libya will not recognize the enemy, will not yield to him, and will not give up the Arab nation's future. We are prepared to pay with our blood for every single particle of sand. We are raiising our voice, here in Gharyan, with the sons and grandsons of the heroes and martyrs of the Jandubah and al-A'aqib battles and the historic al-Jabal battles. [passage omitted] Now you can see everything. The reactionary and imperialist alliance has been exposed. We told you that the United States has controlled Mecca; they refused to believe us. Yet we found Libyan pilgrims barred from travelling on board their planes to perform the pilgrimage; they were forced to use camels because of an order emanating from the United States, Britain, and France. The sacred Qa'bah is now being subjected to an order from the United States, Britain, and France. This is sad. It is sad what has happened to the holy and sacred Qa'bah. Brothers, the Qa'bah is no longer sacred because it is being subjected to an order from the United States, Britain, and France. It is being governed by orders decreed by nonbelievers and Christians. We now find that the cross is more sacred than the Qa'bah; the cross is more significant and important than the minarets, no matter how tall they may be, I regret to say. The sound of the church bells is now lounder than the voice of the mu'ezzin in Mecca and holy al-Madina. The sound of the bells of Christian churches, the churches of the United States, Britain, and France is stronger and lounder than the voice of any Mecca and Medina mu'ezzin. This is a bitter reality. Brothers, the jihad has become better than pilgrimage, brothers. Not a single one of those submissive people felt an iota of shame when they saw Libyan women riding camels or walking to perform the pilgrimage, because they were observing a resolution that was adopted by anti-Arab states. They were implementing an unjust resolution that was adopted by the United States, Britain, and France by which they wanted to bring the Arab nation to bow to their will. They seek to put on trial the sons of the Arab nation within their homeland. They also want to try them in the United States and Britain. We would like to tell them no, and a thousand times no. We are ready for the confrontation. We are ready for any ensuing repercussions for the sake of our dignity, our future, independence, and honor. We are ready for sacrifice. Forward we go, and the struggle continues.
