This is the announcement that might have been expected, but it was never uttered. The lack of money said everything, and therefore the airplanes did not fly yesterday, operations being suspended until the company is privatized. If the airline had continued to operate it would have lost $4.3 million this month. A quick decision by Congress is expected for its privatization. The bill will be submitted to the Chamber of Deputies on 10 March. Yesterday at noon, the LAPSA Board of Directors suspended the DC-10 flight to Miami. Then the Privatization Council announced to the Board of Directors the suspension of all flights. The operations were suspended because without state aid the company had no funds to continue operating. The president of the Bicameral Privatization Committee said if operations continued the company would lose $4.3 million in March alone. [passage omitted]
