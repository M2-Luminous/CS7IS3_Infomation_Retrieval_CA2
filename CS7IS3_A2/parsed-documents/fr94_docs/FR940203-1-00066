FR940203-1-00066 FR940203-1-00013 Division of Energy Regulation, Virginia State Corporation Commission, PO Box 1197, Richmond, VA 23209, (804) 371&hyph;9264 Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission, PO Box 47250, Olympia, WA 98504&hyph;7250, (206) 586&hyph;1154 Public Service Commission of West Virginia, 201 Brooks Street, PO Box 812, Charleston, WV 25323, (304) 340&hyph;0473 Gas, Water & Federal Intervention Division, Public Service Commission of Wisconsin, 4802 Sheboygan Avenue, PO Box 7854, Madison, WI 53707, (608) 266&hyph;8128 Wyoming Public Service Commission, 700 West 21st Street, Cheyenne, WY 82002, (307) 777&hyph;7427 Operation and Maintenance Information This notice proposes to require gas distribution operators to advise customers of any information that the operator has concerning the operation and maintenance of its lines that could aid customers. This information could include the following: Excavation damage prevention: Excavation damage is the largest single cause of gas pipeline incidents. Section 192.614 currently requires gas pipeline operators to notify the public in the vicinity of their pipeline on how to prevent damage to the pipeline from excavation activities. Section 192.614 currently exempts pipelines in class 1 and 2 locations and pipelines in class 3 locations which are marked in accordance with ยง192.707. However, in a pending rulemaking (``Excavation Damage Prevention Programs for Gas, Hazardous Liquids and Carbon Dioxide Pipelines'', Docket 101, 53 FR 24747, June 30, 1988), RSPA has proposed removing these exemptions. Type of pipe: Different pipeline materials require different maintenance procedures. An operator's knowledge of the environmental conditions affecting the service pipe connected to the customer-owned service line may assist the owner in the maintenance of the customer-owned service line. Age of the pipe: The installation date of customer-owned service lines, installed by individuals other than the operator, may not be known. However, many operators will have a record of the date gas service was initially established to the customer. In such cases, operators may reasonably assume that the installation date of the customer-owned service line is approximately the date of initial gas service. This information may then be relayed to the customer to assist in estimating the condition of the pipeline. Potential Hazards: This notice proposes to require an operator to inform customers of the potential hazards of not maintaining a customer-owned service line. Improper maintenance or lack of periodic maintenance of customer-owned service lines may result in corrosion of metallic pipeline materials, separation of piping components, gas leaks, property damage, environmental damage, personal injury, and even death. Regulatory Analyses Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures This proposed rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and, therefore, was not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget. The rule is not considered significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). A regulatory evaluation is available for review in the docket. Executive Order 12612 The proposed rule has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria in Executive Order 12612 (``Federalism''), and does not have sufficient federalism impacts to warrant the preparation of a federalism assessment. Regulatory Flexibility Act This proposed rule would apply to operators of natural gas and petroleum gas distribution systems. Small gas distribution systems are characterized in this proposal as distribution systems serving fewer than 10,000 customers. They include master meter systems, which usually serve mobile home parks, housing projects and apartment complexes, and public, private, and municipal natural gas distribution systems. Master meter systems, as defined in ยง191.3, are pipeline systems for distributing gas within, but not limited to, a definable area, such as a mobile home park, housing project, or apartment complex, where the operator purchases metered gas from an outside source for resale through a gas distribution system. The gas distribution pipeline system supplies the ultimate consumer who either purchases the gas directly through a meter or by other means, such as by rents.
