His majesty the king's statements and clarifications were heard with great interest by various media and political quarters, because these statements and stands showed a clear vision, an accurate depiction of the existing situation, and adherence to the stands and policies that have always been followed by Jordan. At the top of the stands emphasized by His Majesty King Husayn is Jordan's sacred right to restore its rights and complete sovereignty -- the objective for which Jordan has been waging the battle of negotiations. Meanwhile, the king was eager to clearly note that Jordan still has to wage a long and difficult battle to seize its rights and that the success in this battle depends both on continuous Jordanian steadfastness and on an Israeli readiness to give up occupied Jordanian territory. The direct and deep meaning of this is that Jordan has never departed from the battle of extracting its rights and that there is still an important, and perhaps long, phase before achieving the legitimate national objectives. If we add to this Jordan's commitment to work for a comprehensive peace, in accordance with which all Arab rights will be restored -- as the peace agreement will crown the achievement of a solution to all problems in the region, as his majesty put it -- we will find that the road is still long and difficult. And this in itself requires moral and political support from the Arab brothers and the continuation of a fair and earnest U.S. policy to make the achieved progress reach its expected and logical end of Israeli withdrawal and the restoration of Jordan's international borders as demarcated between Palestine and Transjordan during the British mandate. Therefore, the next weeks and months are expected to witness a serious, active, and intensive political move on this level under the agreed international sponsorship of the U.S., as happened and is happening on the other tracks. In light of this, it is too early to predict swift and categorical results, although it is certain that Jordan will continue its firm adherence to its rights and sovereignty to achieve Israeli retreat. This is considered a national right and an important and major step on the path toward restoring all Arab rights and territories.
