FR940124-1-00015 FR940124-1-00005 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: David Calkins, Chief, Air Planning Branch, (A&hyph;2), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 9, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, California 94105, (415) 744&hyph;1500. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Requirements for Inspection and Maintenance Programs A. Applicability of the Enhanced I/M Program in California As amended in 1990, the Clean Air Act requires states to make changes to improve existing I/M programs or to implement new ones for certain nonattainment areas. Section 182(a)(2)(B) of the Act directed EPA to publish updated guidance for state I/M programs, taking into consideration findings of the Administrator's audits and investigations of these programs. The Act further requires each area required to have an I/M program to incorporate this guidance into the SIP. Based on these requirements, EPA promulgated I/M regulations on November 5, 1992 (57 FR 52950). Under sections 182(c)(3) and 187(b)(1) of the Act, areas designated as serious and worse ozone nonattainment areas with 1980 populations of 200,000 or more and CO nonattainment areas with design classifications above 12.7 ppm and populations of 200,000 or more, in addition to metropolitan statistical areas with populations of 100,000 or more in the northeast ozone transport region, are required to meet EPA regulations for ``enhanced'' I/M programs. These areas were required to submit a SIP revision to incorporate an enhanced I/M program into the SIP by November 15, 1992. In California, the State must adopt and implement enhanced I/M programs for the following urbanized areas: Bakersfield Fresno Los Angeles Oxnard-Ventura Riverside-San Bernardino Sacramento San Diego The I/M regulation establishes minimum performance standards for basic and enhanced I/M programs as well as requirements for the following: Network type and program evaluation; adequate tools and resources; test frequency and convenience; vehicle coverage; test procedures and standards; test equipment; quality control; waivers and compliance via diagnostic inspection; motorist compliance enforcement; motorist compliance enforcement program oversight; quality assurance; enforcement against contractors, stations and inspectors; data collection; data analysis and reporting; inspector training and licensing or certification; public information and consumer protection; improving repair effectiveness; compliance with recall notices; on-road testing; SIP revisions; and implementation deadlines. For enhanced I/M programs, all requirements must be implemented by January 1, 1995 except that areas switching from an existing test-and-repair network to a test-only network may phase in that change between January 1995 and January 1996. Each State required to implement an I/M program was required to submit by November 15, 1992, a SIP revision (here and after referred to as the ``I/M committal SIP'') including two elements: (1) A commitment from the Governor or his/her designee to the timely adoption and implementation of an I/M program meeting all requirements of the I/M regulation; and (2) a schedule for adoption of the program with interim milestones including passage of enabling statutory or other legal authority and adoption of final regulations. Acceptance of I/M committal SIPs in lieu of full SIPs was justified by the fact that States could not have been expected to begin development of an I/M program meeting the requirements of the Act and the I/M regulation until the I/M regulation was adopted as a final rule, which did not occur until November 5, 1992. A complete SIP revision which contained all of the elements identified in the adoption schedule, including the authorizing legislation and implementing regulations, was required to be submitted no later than November 15, 1993.
