Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali which on Monday circulated as an official document at the U.N. hearquarters. On February 9, the North Atlantic Council threatened to launch air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs unless they withdrew their heavy artillery 20 kilometres from the centre of Sarajevo within ten days. NATO also demanded from the Moslem side to place its heavy arms under U.N. control. Sarajevo is the scene of a Moslem-Serb conflict in the tragic three-sided civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina among local Moslems, Serbs and Croats. NATO adopted its decision on possible air strikes against the Bosnian Serb positions under strong influence of a suspicion, but lacking evidence, that the Serbs are responsible for the massacre at a Sarajevo market on Febuary 5, in which, according to Moslem reports, 68 civilians were killed and nearly 200 wounded. "We believe that decisions, and especially those setting ultimatums in international relations, cannot be based on assumed guilt because any such decision would be a crime itself," Lilic said in the letter. He stressed the need for a peaceful settlement of the Bosnian conflict and assessed as alarming NATO's decision to seek solution to the Bosnian crisis through ultimatums and the use of force. "It is clear that such decisions stimulate continuation of war and that peace can be achieved only through negotiations on equal footing," the Yugoslav president said in the letter to the U.N. secretary-general.
