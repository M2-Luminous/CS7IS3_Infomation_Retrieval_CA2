Two people were killed in Microryan district, the scene of some of the worst fighting last week, sources said, while others reported that fighting also resumed around noon Sunday (0730 GMT) in Kabul's volatile southeastern districts. The fresh fighting ended an exodus of civilians from the capital who had been taking advantage of a 24-hour ceasefire which officially expired at 6.00 a.m. but had held for several more hours, sources said. It also came as some 65 diplomats, United Nations personnel and some foreign nationals reached the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar from Kabul. The diplomats include Iranians, Libyans, Indians, Turkish, Somalians and Palestinians who temporarily closed their missions in the Afghan capital.
