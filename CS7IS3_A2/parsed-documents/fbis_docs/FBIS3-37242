According to information allegedly received from people around the president, Boris Yeltsin has a serious pneumonia, which called for hemodialysis [gemodializ], rather than a slight cold as the president's press service maintains. According to experts, these rumors were provoked by U.S. President Bill Clinton's statement about a "technical impossibility" of contacting the Russian Federation president.
