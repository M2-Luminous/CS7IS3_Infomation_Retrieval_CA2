FR940325-1-00063 FR940325-1-00008 Section 1784.2&hyph;1␣Composition This section would be amended to remove the eligibility requirement for grazing advisory board members. This requirement would no longer be necessary with the discontinuance of the grazing advisory boards. Composition for multiple resource advisory councils and their rangeland resource teams and technical review teams would be provided for in the specific sections of the proposed rule pertaining to such councils and teams. Section 1784.2&hyph;2␣Avoidance of Conflict of Interest The proposed rule would clarify that permittees and lessees would be eligible for service on multiple resource advisory councils, rangeland resource teams, and technical review teams. This change is necessary to ensure that all stakeholders, including those with financial interests in the management of public lands, are able to provide input to multiple resource advisory councils so that resource advisory councils would be able to develop recommendations based on direct community and user input. The proposed rule would also provide that no advisory committee, rangeland resource team or technical review team member could participate in any matter in which such member is directly interested. Furthermore, members of multiple resource advisory councils would be required to disclose their direct or indirect interest in Federal grazing permits or leases administered by BLM. Section 1784.3␣Member Service The proposed rule would establish that appointments to advisory committees would be for two-year terms unless otherwise specified in the charter. Specific references to grazing advisory board, district advisory council and National Public Lands Advisory Council appointments, terms and election procedures, would be removed. Advisory committees are established through individual charters or by statute. Membership requirements, terms of appointments and election procedures must be prescribed in these charters and are, therefore, not necessary in this proposed rule. Also, the provisions for reimbursement of committee members' travel and per diem expenses would be modified to make clear that individuals selected by committees to provide input, but who themselves are not appointed committee members, shall not be eligible for reimbursement. Under the proposed rule the newly formed multiple resource advisory councils would play a greater role in advising BLM land managers than the district advisory councils and grazing advisory boards they generally replace. The Department expects that the expanded role of the councils would require more frequent council meetings, resulting in greater administrative, travel, and per diem expenses to be incurred by BLM. The provision that members of rangeland resource teams and technical review teams who are not also members of the parent advisory council would not be reimbursed for expenses is intended to limit the expenses to be incurred by the BLM. However, the limitation on reimbursements for travel and per diem could affect the ability of some persons to participate on the input teams. The public is asked to provide specific comments and suggestions on whether this limitation is appropriate or how it might be modified. Section 1784.5&hyph;1␣Functions and Section 1784.5&hyph;2␣Meetings These sections would be amended by replacing the term ``authorized representative'' with the term ``designated Federal officer.'' These changes provide consistency with the terminology of FACA. Section 1784.6&hyph;1␣National Public Lands Advisory Council, Reserved Sections 1784.6&hyph;2 and 1784.6&hyph;3, Section 1784.6&hyph;4␣District Advisory Councils, and Section 1784.6&hyph;5␣Grazing Advisory Boards References to the National Public Lands Advisory Council, district advisory councils and grazing advisory boards are removed in their entirety and replaced with three new sections that would establish multiple resource advisory councils and associated input teams. Reserved sections 1784.6&hyph;2 and 1784.6&hyph;3 would be removed. The new sections are discussed separately below.
