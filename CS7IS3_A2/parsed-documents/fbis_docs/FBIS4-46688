By the end of the quarter they had already reached R104,000.

At the same time the differentiation of economic regions by monetary incomes in the first quarter of 1994 in comparison with the fourth quarter of 1993 has not changed essentially--2.4 and 2.3 times respectively. When comparing the data on per-capita monetary incomes of the population in January 1994 with the data of January 1993, it is necessary first of all to note the overall improvement of the situation in the area of the population's incomes during the period under consideration. Per-capita monetary incomes have increased 8.8 times in Russia during the year. The maximum growth by economic regions has been recorded in the North-Western and Central regions--10.1 and 11.8 times respectively (including in Saint Petersburg--13.8 and in Moscow--13.5) and the West Siberian region--9.8 times. These regions in many respects have assured the overall improvement of the situation with the population's incomes in Russia as a whole. The growth of incomes has gone the slowest in the Central Black Earth (7.5), Urals (7.6), Far Eastern (7.9), North Caucasus (7.7) and East Siberian (6.2) regions. The monetary incomes of the population for Russia as a whole in dollar terms has increased approximately 3.1 times as against 8.8 times in rubles. That is, in freely convertible currency per-capita monetary incomes grew almost three times slower than in rubles. The level of monthly average per-capita monetary incomes (API) has amounted to approximately $56 in the first quarter of 1994. This is less than in the fourth quarter of 1993. A quite decent growth--21.2 percent--is obtained when the calculations are in rubles. The calculations in freely convertible currency indicate another trend--a drop in per-capita monetary incomes during the quarter by almost 8 percent. The rise in the price of the goods needed to achieve a minimum living standard continued in the first quarter of 1994. For Russia as a whole the monetary value of the minimum substince budget (BPM) has amounted to R53,900 and has increased more than 1.4 times in comparison with the fourth quarter of 1993, i.e., the BPM has increased by 12-13 percent each month on average. In January 1994 the maximum size of the BPM was registered in the Far Eastern economic region--R91,100. Based on the level of the BPM the Far East, as previously, substantially outstripped the East Siberian and Northern regions following after it (R60,900 and R57,900). As with a year ago, the lowest value of the BPM has been registered in the Volga region--R33,100. In the Russian Federation Ministry of Labor's officially approved procedure the BPM is defined as an increment (doschet) to the value of the food basket, the relative share of which on average per capita is established at the rate of 68.3 percent. Taking objective factors into account, in particular the more rapid growth of expenditures for services and non-food goods, the Living Standard Center proposes the reduction of this percentage to 59.3. Taking this adjustment into account, the value of the BPM in January 1994 for Russia as a whole will rise from R48,000 to R55,300, i.e., by more than 15 percent. The grouping of economic regions as a function of the monetary valuation of the BPM also has undergone changes. If in January 1993 the differentiation of regions on the basis of the size of the BPM came to two times, then in January 1994 it was already 2.5 times. Given an equal number of the regions (seven in each) in the group with a "low" BPM in January 1993 and in January 1994, the share of the population living in these regions has increased by almost 10 percent in 1994. The share of the population living in regions with an "average" BPM value has shrunk by as much--from 30 to 20 percent. The magnitude of the real incomes of the population (RDN), expressed in the number of BPM baskets (nabor) in the average per-capita income, has amounted to 1.47 baskets in the first quarter of 1994 as against 1.17 baskets in January 1993. In January 1994, the maximum RDN values have been registered in the West Siberian, Northern and Central economic regions, 1.76, 1.74, and 1.86 baskets respectively. The minimum RDN values have been noted in the North Caucasus, East Siberian and Far Eastern regions, 1.09, 1.12, and 1.27 baskets respectively. Attention should be paid to the fact that in the East Siberian region in January 1994, the RDN level has turned out to be lower than the level of the beginning of 1993, 1.12 and 1.45 baskets respectively. A very insignificant absolute annual increase of the RDN has been recorded both in the Urals region--0.05 baskets--and in the Far Eastern--0.1 baskets. The maximum RDN increase has been observed in the Central region--0.92 baskets, taking into account the 1.43 baskets increase in the city of Moscow. The RDN situation has become better in the beginning of 1994 than in the beginning of 1993. This has manifested itself, firstly, in the absolute increase in the size of the RDN in all economic regions except the East Siberian; secondly, in the decrease in the number of regions with a low RDN level. The overall number of regions in the group with a "high" RDN level has increased in the beginning of 1994. Interregional differentiation based on the RDN has increased somewhat. If in the beginning of 1993 the coefficient of differentiation based on the value of the RDN came to 1.6 times, then in the beginning of 1994 it is 1.7 times. Both for Russia as a whole and for the majority of the regions (the North Caucasus and East Siberia constitute the exception), most of the population possessed per-capita monetary incomes in the interval of from one to two BPMs in the fourth quarter of 1993. For Russia as a whole the share of such a population came to 40 percent in the fourth quarter of 1993. In other words, in the majority of regions, irrespective of what group it belonged to based on the size of the BPM, there is a stable block of the population with incomes above one and up to two BPMs. For Russia as a whole the share of the population with monetary incomes greater than two BPMs came to 25.5 percent and was less than the share of the population with incomes lower than one BPM--34.4 percent. An indicator of the differentiation of the monetary incomes of Russia's population equal to 11 is often published in the press. This is the accepted in statistics decile coefficient of differentiation, which is calculated as the relationship of the minimal monetary income in the group of the 10 percent of the population with the highest income (in the fourth quarter of 1993 this value equalled R180,000) to the maximum monetary income in the group of the 10 percent of the population with the smallest monetary income (R19,900). In its estimates of differentiation the Living Standard Center uses a relationship of the average incomes of these two groups of the population (R289,000 and R13,900 respectively), equal to 20.79, which is double the officially used estimate. In the fourth quarter of 1993 the average per-capita monetary income of the three groups of the population--workers and employees, pensioners, and the rural population--correlated as 1.92:1.19:1. The monetary incomes of the rural population are characterized by the lowest average level and a high indicator of differentiation not only with respect to the families of workers and employees but also to pensioners. It should be noted that the incomes of kolkhozniks always were characterized by a low average level and their relatively higher differentiation in comparison with the analogous indicators for workers and employees. However, that among the rural population the incomes of kolkhozniks have become lower than in the families of pensioners is a fact that is completely negative. One should also bear in mind that the positive dynamics of average per-capital real incomes does not always reflect the changes in the real incomes of the various social groups. Thus, the share of the population of Russia having an income less than the PLB has increased during the past year.
