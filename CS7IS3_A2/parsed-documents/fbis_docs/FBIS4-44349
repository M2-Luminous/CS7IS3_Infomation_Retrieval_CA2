And, in what amounts to a golden scenario for the Government, it said prices would rise more slowly than at first thought. The more optimistic outlook for growth is coupled with a big downward revision to the expected level of underlying inflation -- the Government's preferred measure which excludes mortgage interest payments. According to Treasury calculations, it is set to average 2.5 percent in the last three months of 1994 against 3.25 percent previously forecast -- well within the Government's 1 percent to 4 percent target range. The combination of higher growth and lower than anticipated inflation has allowed the Treasury to reduce the amount of money it expects to borrow to plug the gap between its spending and income. The Public Sector Borrowing Requirement [PSBR] in the financial year 1994-95 is now put at 36 billion pounds sterling -- 2 billion less than predicted last November. The improved performance of the economy is expected to continue next year when growth is again forecast to be 2.75 percent. However, the Treasury warned that inflation may be pushed up temporarily to 2.75 percent by the end of 1995 as the amount of slack in the economy is taken up. The PSBR is expected to fall to 28 billion pounds sterling in 1995-96 -- 2 billion lower than previously forecast. Mr Clarke said the figures showed that the Government's monetary, fiscal and supply side measures were having their effect, "placing this country in an excellent situation with the chance, if we are prepared to take it, of having good recovery with low inflation, falling unemployment and rising prosperity for several years ahead." He said the forecast was "prudent and sensible," adding: "This is not a government that is encouraging its forecasters to go wild with over optimism." Addressing a news conference at the Treasury, Mr Clarke issued a series of health warnings about the figures contained in the Government's first summer economic forecast. He said: "The figures in the forecast are objective, the best we can produce and show a combination of very favourable circumstances at the moment. But I don't believe we should look at them as if every figure is bound to be accurate and a spot forecast of where we will be in 12 months time," he said. "They are a guide to policy but I have no intention of being dominated by them," the Chancellor added. Mr Clarke stressed that there was "quite a margin of error in forecasting of this kind." But he said the figures in the forecast were "good news" for the British economy. "We have quite the best combination of circumstances pointing to sustainable growth and low inflation that I can remember for a very long time." Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown told PA [PRESS ASSOCIATION] News: ``The Chancellor is being complacent about the short-term because millions of people have seen their living standards fall and complacent about the long-term because he has done nothing to address the fundamental problems of the economy. ``Growth will not reach even 3 percent before 1996, if the Chancellor is to be believed. The prospects for long-term and high sustainable growth needed for rises in the standard of living are simply not there.'' It appeared that Mr Clarke was heading for a fight with Bank of England Governor Eddie George over the direction of the economy. "It is clear that the Governor of the Bank of England now believes that interest rates and therefore mortgages are going to have to rise. For that to happen so early in the recovery is not good news for the long-term prospects of the economy." Mr Brown claimed that the Government had little room for manoeuvre by bringing in tax cuts as a sweetener before the next election. He added: "There is nothing that this Chancellor can do on taxes that is going to impress the electorate. He can't undo the damage done by what he himself has had to admit is the equivalent, with all the tax rises he was sought, of a 7 percent rise in income tax."
