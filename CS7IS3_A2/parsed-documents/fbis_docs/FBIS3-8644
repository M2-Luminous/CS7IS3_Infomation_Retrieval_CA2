Prime Minister Dr. Janez Drnovsek was the first to greet the guests in Bled. They met with Defense Minister Janez Jansa and Foreign Ministry Under Secretary Ignac Golob in Ljubljana. Tomaz Gerden has more details: [Begin recording] [Gerden] Following the talks in Villa Podroznik, Count Von Moltke was the first to give a brief statement: [Von Moltke, in English fading into translation by Gerden] I am very pleased that NATO has the opportunity to cooperate with Slovenia within Partnership for Peace. This plan initially pooled former Warsaw Pact countries, which are members of the NATO Cooperation Council. Partnership for Peace aims to strengthen stability in Europe and cooperation between NATO and other countries in peace initiatives within the United Nations and the CSCE. The NATO delegation discussed details of Partnership for Peace with our representatives. The initiative will be officially signed by Prime Minister Dr. Drnovsek in Brussels on 30 March. He said the following about today's talks: [Drnovsek] Today's visit is dedicated to the preparations for this signing, as well as the concrete activities that will ensue--joint planning with NATO, preparation of cadres, and exchange of opinions on the security situation. I believe that everything is progressing well, that Slovenia is being treated very seriously as a NATO partner, and that there is a belief on both sides that we will develop a partnership very quickly. [Gerden] Dr. Drnovsek believes that neutral countries like Switzerland and Sweden will also join Partnership for Peace soon and that our country is in no way in any worse position than the members that have already been admitted. Defense Minister Janez Jansa assessed the Partnership for Peace plan as follows: [Jansa] From a security viewpoint, membership in Partnership for Peace for Slovenia is almost as equally important as international recognition. This represents a starting point for us, the beginning of a road, at the end of which is the greatest possible security that a country can obtain in a family of like-minded states. This is particularly important because geographically, Slovenia on one side borders a relatively solid region of stability and on the other side, a region of instability. Membership in Partnership for Peace will allow us to strengthen relations with the part of Europe that represents a factor of stability, which is, of course, a precondition for any sort of social and economic development. [Gerden] The NATO delegation was also received by President Milan Kucan. The delegation also met with the ambassadors of NATO member states. [end recording]
