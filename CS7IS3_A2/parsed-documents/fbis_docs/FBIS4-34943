FBIS4-34943 "drlat123_r_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-123 Daily Report 14 Jun 1994 Peru Investigation of Released SL Leaders Ordered Investigation of Released SL Leaders Ordered PY2406151094 Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 14 Jun 94 p A6 PY2406151094 Lima EXPRESO Spanish BFN [Excerpts] Supreme Court President Luis Serpa Segura reported that on 13 June, the Supreme Court ordered an investigation into the release of three Shining Path [SL] leaders. This investigation is to be conducted by the Office for Judicial Overview. Serpa explained that "Office for Judicial Overview chief Carlos Giusti Acuna has been duly informed. We hope a preliminary report will be submitted sometime this week." A television report, disclosed a few days ago, said that the judicial branch ordered Luis Alberto Arana Franco, also known as "Abel;" Juan Carlos Rios Fernandez, also known as "Norman;" and Monica Feria Tinta, all of whom are SL leaders, released from jail. It was learned that Luis Alberto Arana Franco, also known as "Comrade Abel," a SL leader in charge of the logistics apparatus that operated at the Cesar Vallejo academy, is on parole. On 13 June, Daniel Espichan, special prosecutor for terrorist crimes, said Arana Franco's sentence was commuted because he helped disrupt important SL groups. Espichan added that Arana Franco continues to supply information to antisubversive forces. He explained that after he finishes testifying, Arana Franco will be given a new identity and will leave the country with his family. Those who resort to the "repentance" law can be exempted from prosecution and punishment; they can change their identities and leave the country with a small amount of money whenever it is approved by a small committee that works in utmost secrecy. Serpa stated that so far, several of those who resorted to the "repentance" law have been granted new identities because several SL members were arrested through their testimony. He added that all of them have been allotted money until they get jobs. Juan Carlos Rios Fernandez and Jesus Monica Feria Tinta [name as published], as well as 27 other terrorists who were released by the courts, are in a different situation because requests were submitted to the Supreme Court to nullify their sentences. Serpa stated: "These judges are obviously biased." He explained that some members of faceless courts are reportedly being subjected to "pressure" or to accept "bribes." [passage omitted] So far the faceless courts have sentenced only two or three and absolved the rest. Carlos Blanco, president of the congressional Human Rights Committee, has demanded that the Office for Judicial Overview conduct an exhaustive investigation. Blanco believes, nevertheless, that this situation resulted from a misinterpretation of the repentance law. Moreover, Justice Committee President Cesar Fernandez (NM) [New Majority] will submit a bill to close the "legal loopholes" in the antiterrorist law that have allowed the release of SL leaders. Fernandez Arce has demanded drastic punishment for those judges responsible for this release. Fernandez Arce specifically requested that the special prosecutor for terrorist crimes be duly informed about the court rulings so he can appeal these decisions. Prior to the Attorney General's Office decision, any release ordered by a "faceless court" should be subjected to a Supreme Court review.
