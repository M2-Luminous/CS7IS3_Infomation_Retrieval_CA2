The presidential candidacy of Professor Ruben Dario Carles became official this afternoon. The conventions of the Civic Renewal Party first and the National Renewal Movement [Morena] later approved Carles' nomination by a majority vote. Here are the details: During its convention today, Civic Renewal nominated Ruben Dario Carles as its presidential candidate. The ticket will include Dr. Gloria Moreno de Lopez as first vice president and Dr. Tomas Herrera as second vice president. The convention, which began this morning, was suspended for an hour, because convention delegates could not agree on two vice presidents. Civic Renewal insisted that its president, Tomas Herrera, should be the first vice president; it was explained later that Carles himself chose his running mates. Tomas Herrera accepted the nomination for second vice president and asked the delegates to support him, citing the need for unity against the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] ticket. With Herrera's acceptance, Civic Renewal approved the presidential ticket in an open vote. After the results were disclosed, former political adversaries Ruben Dario Carles and Gloria Moreno de Lopez arrived at the convention together. [Begin Carles recording] Following 21 years of dictatorship, we have not yet rid ourselves of the bad habits and corruption imposed on our country by the military, which is now attempting to return. [end recording] After Civic Renewal nominated him as presidential candidate, former comptroller Carles went to the Morena convention at the Atlapa Convention Center. Amid shouts of: Carles for President, Morena's convention delegates unanimously supported Carles' presidential candidacy with Gloria Moreno de Lopez as first vice president and Tomas Herrera as second vice president. The 76 convention delegates agreed to form an alliance with Civic Renewal and open negotiations with other parties. During his speech, Carles said that over the past few weeks he has focused on preparing his political platform. [Begin Carles recording, in progress] ...while others elbowed, punched, and kneed each other [applause] to win a nomination and others cast unjustified insults at people who were entitled to civic nominations, I have traveled throughout the countryside to update the information I had. [end recording] The government platform of the Carles-Moreno de Lopez-Herrera ticket broaches such issues as the improvement of public services, the Canal's operation, and how the reverted areas will be used. Meanwhile, Molirena [Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement] elected today its convention delegates throughout the country. The 1,040 elected delegates will decide the course the party will take in the forthcoming May elections. In most of the provinces the delegates were elected by sole consensus lists, except in the city of Santiago, where there are two lists, and Colon Province, where the delegate positions were disputed by factions split between Jaime Ford and Legislator Alonso Fernandez. The Molirena elections, which went normally, were attended by 20 percent of party members. Molirena's convention is scheduled for 23 January, when the delegates will decide whether to nominate Ruben Dario Carles or Guillermo Ford.
