This was stated at an enlarged collegium of the Ministry of Fuel and Energy of the Russian Federation by first Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets. "The miners deliver coal to metallurgists who give metal for cars which are now in great demand. If the directors come to an agreement among themselves, it will be possible to pay the debts both to the metallurgists and miners after selling these cars." Such is the opinion of the vice premier. He said that this year nobody would forgive debts to anybody. However, "there is no going away from this problem any longer," said Soskovets and added that "it is useless to harbour illusions that somebody will come and do everything for the directors of enterprises." As an example of the non-balanced work of the Directors' Corps Soskovets adduced the fact of purchasing 700,000 tons of pipes in Japan, Italy and Austria, while the Russian pipe-producing plants had to cut their output last year.
