No work was done, and most of the roads in the town were closed. In the suburbs of Musaga, Kinanira, and Kanyosha, properties were damaged, and people are said to have been killed. It has been reported that peace is returning this evening, although tires were burning at road blocks between Ngagara and the town center. Security officials have tried to put out the fires but movement has been difficult, especially for cars. We have not seen any vehicles in circulation apart from those of the security services. The government has taken the opportunity to say a few words about the events through Cyriaque Simbizi, the minister of youth, sports, and culture who is also the interim information minister and government spokesman. [Begin Simbizi recording] [passage omitted] As things stand, those who oppose the government which was put in place by the people are also those who pretend not to recognize that the current problems have arisen from the killing of the head of state. They have been blocking roads, burning, and killing. Such behavior at this time is contrary to the spirit of the return of peace. In fact, if one takes a close look one finds that many opposition leaders are planning to start a war in the country. [passage omitted] It is surprising to see that there is no security in Bujumbura town though everybody knows that the security forces are there in strength. Those who have a complaint against the government should not be allowed to express their complaints through killing and looting. Is the thirst for power alone responsible for the current damages, or do they not know that the actions of the opposition are also responsible for those who have died? Yesterday more than 30 people died in Musaga zone. They were killed by [words indistinct] stones and knives. In Kinindo, two people were killed. Tonight, a grenade killed six people in Nyakabiga. Also today, some citizens were sho,t and a grenade was thrown at others who were trying to remove stones that had been put in place by the warmongers. A wise politician looks for power through peaceful means and first tries to see if the people he wants to lead will accept him. Otherwise we would be heading for dictatorship.
