Former President Ben Bella's Movement for Democracy in Algeria has also decided not to attend. [passage omitted] All the boycotting parties have denounced the conference as a put up job with its outcome decided in advance by the authorities. Hocine Ait Ahmed, president [as heard] of the Socialist Forces Front, had this to say: [Begin Ahmed recording] The conference organized by the authorities is a pseudo-conference. I believe that not only can we not conceive of a transition based on a fire that is raging and spreading but also that it would be too facile and stupid not to involve the Islamic movement in the government, thus forcing them into an underground existence and turning them into heroes with clean hands. For the past 30 years in Algeria we have not been engaging in politics but rather in plotting and scheming. This national conference has been brought about solely to endorse what has already been decided behind the scenes, by what I call the family conclave. Organizations and persons determined beforehand are going to be imposed on us. What is being pursued is a policy of the fait accompli, hence the utmost contempt in which it is held by Algerian public opinion and by the political parties. [end recording]
