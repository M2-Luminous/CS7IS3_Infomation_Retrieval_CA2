We managed to telephone the head of the Musaga zone, who first of all briefed us on the security situation in the zone in an interview with our colleague, Antoine Kaburahe. [passage omitted] We have not managed to link up with the head of the Nyakabiga zone, but there is trouble there, as well, which reportedly has caused between 20 and 40 deaths since yesterday afternoon. The killings are still going on up to this moment, despite the presence of security forces on the spot.
