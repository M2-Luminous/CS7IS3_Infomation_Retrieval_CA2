Following the introduction of China's reform measures in 1994, major headway will also be made in foreign economic and trade structural reform. Prior to the opening of the "75th Chinese Export Commodities Fair," a GUOJI SHANGBAO reporter interviewed Wu Yi, Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC] minister, on some favorite current topics in foreign trade. [GUOJI SHANGBAO] Last year there were deficits which have been rare in China's foreign trade. Will you talk about the main cause of these deficits? [Wu Yi] In 1993, China continued to maintain good growth in foreign trade on the basis of rapid development over the last few years. In 1993, imports and exports totaled $195.72 billion, an increase of 18.2 percent over the previous year, fulfilling the target of 11.7 percent growth set by the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC]. Of this total, exports amounted to $91.77 billion and imports to $103.95 billion, increases of 8 and 29 percent respectively. Last year China's foreign trade was mainly characterized by a slow increase in exports and a rapid growth in imports, the import growth rate being 21 percent higher than the export growth rate and the trade deficit stood at $12.18 billion. Last year exports increased slowly but imports increased by a wide margin, mainly because the domestic economy grew rapidly; investments expanded; market demand was strong; some commodity prices, particularly the prices of primary products, soared; commodities were in short supply; and exports were reduced. In addition, the imports of raw and semiprocessed materials, energy, and goods and equipment for economic development increased by a wide margin. According to statistics, imported commodities worth more than $1 billion included planes, automobiles, steel, crude oil, processed oil, chemical fertilizers, industrial chemicals, and full sets of equipment. This indicates that China is a market with a huge potential and that the Chinese market is open. China's basic principle in foreign trade is to maintain a basic balance between imports and exports. It is our opinion that to maintain a basic balance between imports and exports, there is a need to expand exports, instead of reducing imports. In 1994, we should make efforts to expand exports so that they will develop further and there will be coordinated development between imports and exports. [GUOJI SHANGBAO] It was said that there were deficits in bilateral trade with some countries last year; what is your opinion on this? [Wu] In my opinion, deficits in bilateral trade are inevitable. It is our opinion that to maintain a basic balance between imports and exports, there is a need to expand exports, instead of reducing imports. China's purpose in exporting is to import advanced technology and equipment for the country's modernization and to import goods which are in short supply in the country. According to an estimate, China's imports will amount to $400 billion during the Eighth Five-Year Plan. As everyone is aware, 80 percent of China's foreign exchange income is from foreign trade and exports. If deficits remain unchanged because of a slowdown in exports, foreign exchange income will reduce and imports will also be affected. I hope our trade partners will increase their imports from China to maintain coordinated development in bilateral trade. [GUOJI SHANGBAO] We have learned that foreign countries' antidumping lawsuits against China's exports have increased; will this affect China's exports? Will you please express your views? [Wu] Because some countries are experiencing economic depression, their industrial production has come to a standstill, their tariff barriers can no longer control imports and, in addition to this, they do not understand what China is doing in establishing the socialist market economic structure and they discriminate against Chinese products and use antidumping measures to prevent Chinese commodities from entering their markets. This is something we are unwilling to see. We favor promoting exports according to international trade standards and object to expanding exports by dumping commodities. China is a developing country and does not have the economic power to dump its commodities on foreign markets. The prices of Chinese export commodities are low mainly because China's labor force is cheap and its production costs are low. We hope the governments of the relevant countries, as well as their industrial and commercial circles, will view the prices of Chinese export commodities in accordance with the facts. Of course, we will impose sanctions against enterprises which sell their products to the international market at prices lower than production costs. For this reason, we will soon promulgate "Regulations on Handling Antidumping Lawsuits Against Chinese Export Commodities" and "Regulations on Punishments Against Low-Priced Exports." It is necessary to stress that under the Chinese socialist market economic structure, enterprises have the right to set prices. If an enterprise dumps its products at prices lower than production costs, this is entirely its own behavior and antidumping can only be meted out against this enterprise's products; similar products of other enterprises should not be subjected to antidumping. I would like to reiterate that we object to expanding exports by dumping commodities and are also opposed to the practice of trade protectionism by means of antidumping. [GUOJI SHANGBAO] How good is the quality of Chinese export commodities? [Wu] Following China's economic development, and its scientific and technological progress since the introduction of reform and opening up, the quality of Chinese export commodities has improved. Particularly since the implementation of the strategy of "scoring successes by means of quality" in 1991, all trades and undertakings have improved their awareness about quality, applied stricter quality criteria, and strengthened commercial inspection work and methods. As a result of the common efforts of foreign trade, commercial inspection, customs, and production departments, as well as their close cooperation and effective measures, the quality of products has improved markedly, product variety has increased, products have been upgraded, a number of crackdowns have been carried out against counterfeit products achieving prominent results, and foreign businessmen's claims for compensation have reduced. According to statistics by commercial inspection departments, from January to October last year, 941,000 batches of export commodities worth $30.317 billion were examined, with a commodities approval rate of 99.05 percent and a total amount approval rate of 99.21 percent, increases of 0.24 and 0.52 percent respectively. The general situation was good. The implementation of the strategy of "scoring successes by means of quality" is the fundamental way to ensure the sustained, rapid, and healthy [chixu, kuaisu, jiankang] development of China's foreign trade. We will persistently adhere to this for a long period. [GUOJI SHANGBAO] What are the main contents of the next step in foreign trade structural reform? [Wu] According to the overall arrangements by the State Council, this year China will carry out foreign trade structural reform together with taxation reform, financial reform, investment structural reform, planning system reform, and foreign exchange structural reform, and will make major steps in these reforms. In deepening foreign trade structural reform, we will hold firm to the orientation of standardized policy, open management, equal competition, assuming sole responsibility for losses and profits, integrating industry and trade, and introducing the agent system. The purpose of foreign trade structural reform is to establish a foreign trade operational mechanism which conforms with international economic rules. The main contents of the next step foreign trade structural reform are: First, further improving foreign trade macromanagement, during which the state will mainly use foreign exchange rates, taxation, credit, and other economic means to regulate foreign trade activities. The import and export management system will be reformed, mandatory plans will be abolished, administrative intervention will be reduced, and control will be exercised over the total amount of some commodities. Management over these commodities will be exercised according to the principle of good results, fairness, and openness, with the introduction of quota tenders, auction sales, and regularized distribution. The policy of encouraging exports will be implemented, the export tax refund system will be improved, and a credit policy favorable to foreign trade development will be put into effect. A practical overseas enterprise management system will be established. Foreign trade legislation will be expedited and management will proceed according to law to maintain good operational order in foreign trade. Second, deepening foreign trade enterprise reform and reorganizing state-owned foreign trade enterprises according to the modernized enterprise system. New ways of "macroeconomy and trade" will be explored looking toward the integration between trade and industry, trade and agriculture, trade and technology, and trade and commerce and the integration between foreign trade, foreign capital, and foreign economic relations. Production enterprises, scientific and technological units, and some commercial and material supply enterprises which possess the necessary conditions will be entrusted with the right to engage in foreign economic relations. Third, establishing a foreign trade coordinating service mechanism, improving it, and fully displaying the coordinating and service functions of import and export chambers. Fourth, maintaining the unity between foreign trade policies and system and increasing their transparency. I believe that under the correct leadership of the State Council and with the common efforts of people in all fields, the anticipated results will be achieved in the next step foreign trade structural reform. [GUOJI SHANGBAO] China will introduce major reform to the foreign exchange system. What impact will this have on foreign trade development? [Wu] Foreign exchange system reform is the key to deepening foreign trade structural reform and will produce a major and farreaching impact on China's foreign trade development. In my opinion, it will create a fine environment of equal competition for all kinds of export enterprises, greatly expedite the transformation of foreign trade enterprises' operational mechanism, more effectively display the role of foreign exchange rates in regulating foreign trade, and play quite an important role in expanding foreign trade and exports. This reform will enable China's foreign exchange and foreign trade structures to comply more closely with the requirements of the socialist market economic structure, help form an operational mechanism which corresponds with international economic rules, and play a positive role in restoring China's GATT status. [GUOJI SHANGBAO] After the implementation of the foreign exchange conversion system [jie hui zhi 4814 0565 0455] and the abolition of foreign exchange retention, how will the normal use of foreign exchange by export enterprises be ensured? [Wu] Some people are worried that after the implementation of the foreign exchange conversion system and the abolition of foreign exchange retention, export enterprises' normal use of foreign exchange cannot be guaranteed. As a matter of fact, this worry is uncalled for because first, with the abolition of the approval system for the use of foreign exchange on the basis of the foreign exchange conversion system, banks will practice a foreign exchange sales system and conditional conversions between renminbi and the foreign currencies through current accounts. If an enterprise wishes to use foreign exchange, it can exchange renminbi for foreign currencies through a bank by presenting an effective certificate, provided this conforms with the state industrial policy. This will provide much convenience for all kinds of enterprises. Second, to ensure the use of foreign exchange by export enterprises, as a transitional measure, they can use 50 percent of their foreign exchange conversion quota to open an account with a designated foreign exchange bank. The bank will provide the export enterprises with the necessary foreign exchange facilities for expanding their exports, including funds for processing materials, packing, export bases, payment of claims, transportation insurance, after-sales service, and affiliation, all to be provided with preferential treatment and guarantees in their accounts. The export enterprises can still have their foreign exchange converted in the designated foreign exchange bank even if their use of foreign exchange exceeds their account balance. Therefore, export enterprises' normal use of foreign exchange is reliably guaranteed. Of course, during the transition from the old structure to a new one, all sorts of problems will crop up. We will further deepen reform and formulate detailed operational methods to resolve these problems. [GUOJI SHANGBAO] What impact will foreign exchange structural reform have on export enterprises' foreign exchange retention? To put it more specifically, can they still use their foreign exchange retention? [Wu] This question involves enterprises' interests and all export enterprises are concerned about it. Here, I can say explicitly that in the current foreign exchange structural reform, we will fully consider enterprises' interests. First, we will allow enterprises to retain their accounts for foreign exchange retention quotas and cash and to continue their use. Second, enterprises are allowed to continue to use the balance in their foreign exchange quotas according to the original exchange rates listed one day before the standardization of foreign exchange rates. Enterprises which have not entered their foreign exchange quotas in different bank accounts must complete the necessary procedures within one month and their foreign exchange retention can still be used according to the above principle. Third, enterprises' foreign exchange cash accounts can still be used, allowing withdrawals and forbidding deposits; their accounts can be used to cover normal expenditures or sold to the banks. [GUOJI SHANGBAO] How is the situation in China's foreign trade legislation? What are the plans? [Wu] Since the introduction of reform and opening up the NPC, its Standing Committee, and the State Council have formulated and promulgated more than 500 foreign-related economic laws and regulations, including the "Joint-Venture Enterprise Law," "Cooperative-Operated Enterprise Law," "Foreign-Invested Enterprise Law," "Foreign-Related Economic Contract Law," "Customs Law," "Commercial Inspection Law," "Animal and Plant Quarantine Law," and the "Maritime Commercial Law." The state has also explicitly stipulated that to ensure the standardization and transparency of the country's foreign economic and trade policy, all laws and regulations involving foreign economic relations and trade must be promulgated by MOFTEC with the exception of laws and regulations formulated and promulgated by the NPC and the State Council. Our ministry has also promulgated four batches of valid documents, totaling 93 copies; it has also revoked four batches, totaling 744 copies. In the future, we will still continue to strengthen the legislation of foreign economic and trade laws so that foreign economic relations and trade will develop along the legal track in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner [chixu, kuaisu, jiankang]. [GUOJI SHANGBAO] To converge with the international economy, what foreign economic and trade laws and regulations will China promulgate? [Wu] Following the deepening of China's foreign economic and trade structural reform and the progress of talks on China's resumption of GATT status, China is changing its foreign economic and trade management modes and transforming the old practice of mainly relying on administrative means into mainly relying on legal and economic means. For this reason, China will introduce a series of foreign economic laws and regulations, of which the most important is the "Foreign Trade Law." The draft of this law has been submitted to the NPC by the State Council for examination and formal ratification is expected to come out in the first half of this year. China will also adopt some international methods to protect its domestic industries. We are drafting "Antidumping Regulations," "Antisubsidy Regulations," and "Regulations on Protective Measures." These three sets of regulations will soon be submitted to the State Council for examination and approval. Moreover, we have started formulating a series of regulations in coordination with the "Foreign Trade Law," such as the "Regulations on Ratifying Foreign Trade Enterprises" and "Regulations Governing Import and Export Chambers of Commerce." [GUOJI SHANGBAO] Would you please talk about the main contents and significance of the "Foreign Trade Law." [Wu] It has taken 12 years to draft the "Foreign Trade Law," during which time 10 revisions have been made. It has now been submitted to the NPC by the State Council for examination. Hopefully, it will soon be promulgated and put into effect. Apart from providing terms on equal benefits and standardized policies, the "Foreign Trade Law" also contains principled stipulations on foreign trade management methods which have remained valid for the last 40 years, such as regulations on examining and approving foreign trade enterprises, regulations on import and export quotas, and regulations on license control. To cope with the situation after China's resumption of GATT status, the "Foreign Trade Law" will provide stipulations on service trade, antidumping, antisubsidy, and protective measures. Apart from being a management law, the "Foreign Trade Law" will provide stipulations on measures, applicable internationally and suitable for China's national conditions, to promote foreign trade development such as: Establishing a foreign trade risk-bearing fund, a foreign trade development fund, a special foreign trade financial organization, export tax refunds, and strengthening the role of import and export chambers of commerce. The "Foreign Trade Law" serves as a milestone in foreign economic and trade legislation and is a basic law in the foreign trade field. It will establish major foreign trade policies and laws in a legal form. It is the basis for formulating detailed laws and regulations and serves as a precondition for putting foreign trade under the legal system. [GUOJI SHANGBAO] How are the talks on China's resumption of GATT status progressing? What is the crux of the problem? Is there a timetable for China to resume its GATT status? [Wu] During the seven years of talks, the Chinese delegation has made detailed explanations about China's economic and trade structure and the signatory nations have obtained an overall understanding of China's foreign trade system. In the last seven years, China has carried out profound economic and trade structural reform, which has brought China's foreign economic and trade structure quite close to the GATT provisions. Detailed discussions are now under way on the agreement's contents relating to China's resumption of GATT status. Most of the signatory nations are hoping for rapid progress in the talks. A number of countries are beginning to conduct tariff negotiations with China or will soon announce their readiness to conduct such negotiations. The main problem in China's resumption of GATT status is that some major signatory nations have set very high demands on China-- demands which are a little distant from China's economic capacity; on the other hand, it is necessary for some major signatory nations to have the political will so that they can really support China's reentry into GATT. On the timetable for reentry, China of course wishes to renter GATT as soon as possible, to enhance the vitality of the global multitrade structure. The Uruguay Round of talks ended smoothly on 15 December last year. Objectively, this set a timetable for China's resumption of GATT status. According to the regulations, China must reenter GATT before the whole package of Uruguay Round agreements come into force; in this way, China will be able to finally sign the agreements and become a member of the World Trade Organization. [GUOJI SHANGBAO] What is the influence of the Uruguay Round of talks on China? [Wu] The conclusion of the Uruguay Round of talks has increased China's sense of urgency to reenter GATT. Because China was an overall participant in the Uruguay Round of talks, only by resuming China's GATT status as early as possibly will China be able to sign the final agreement of the Uruguay Round of talks and perform all the duties clarified by the agreement. This will help expand the achievements of the Uruguay Round of talks and strengthen the comprehensiveness of the multilateral trade structure--the World Trade Organization. [GUOJI SHANGBAO] What are your comments on the Uruguay Round of talks which concluded at the end of last year? [Wu] The conclusion of the Uruguay Round of talks will help prevent the spread of trade protectionism, promote international trade development and world economic growth, and create a comparatively stable international trade environment for China's economy, which is developing speedily. Therefore the Chinese Government always hoped that the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks could end smoothly. China has always favored strengthening the multilateral trade structure and is opposed to unilateral trade retaliation and trade protectionism. This position corresponds with the principle of the Uruguay Round of talks. As an overall participant in the Uruguay Round of talks, in accordance with the procedures, China submitted an initially agreed opening price list for service trades and a reduced and concessionary opening price list for agricultural and nonagricultural products, thus fulfilling its duties and making contributions to the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of talks together with other participants. However, the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of talks did not remove all trade and investment obstacles and the final agreement and documents from the talks were unbalanced and could not fully portray developing nations' interests. In future the multilateral trade structure should provide developing nations with more rights to speak.
