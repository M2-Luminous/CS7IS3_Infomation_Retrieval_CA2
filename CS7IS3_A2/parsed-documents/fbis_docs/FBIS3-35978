[passage omitted] On Tuesday international mediators T. Stoltenberg and David Owen (EU) arrive in Moscow for consultatuions. The Russian leadership's position, which will be set out for them at the Foreign Ministry, will probably differ from the pronouncements by LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who said in Belgrade that the bombing of Serbs in Bosnia will mean a declaration of war on Russia. Nonetheless, the mediators will again be advised to think twice before reaching decisions on Bosnia. Their talks with the Russian Federation foreign minister will probably center on the new Russian initiatives and the future of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia.
