With the Japan-U.S. summit talks set to be held on 11 February, no way is seen to break the deadlock in the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks which have become a focal point in their relations. The Clinton administration is increasingly irritated with the Hosokawa government which has continued to hesitate to cut the income tax and take measures to stimulate Japan's economy. The question is that politicians are increasingly looking inward and failing to feel a sense of crisis despite its existence as ruling and opposition parties are locked in their negotiations on a package of political reform bills. What concerns us the most is that both Japan and the United States are losing their coordinating capabilities to avert clash between them. Looking at the profiles of both Japanese and American delegates to the Japan-U.S. vice ministerial economic framework talks which are being held in Washington, professional bureaucrats from the Foreign Ministry, the Finance Ministry, and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] are attending the talks as Japanese delegates, while lawyers, scholars, economists, and former bankers in Wall Street are attending the talks as the U.S. delegates. It is said that the U.S. delegates are acting based on their consensus of placing importance on trade results and speaking in unison at the talks. The unity of American bureaucrats is more cohesive than that of their Japanese counterparts. The U.S. side has repeatedly insisted on setting numerical targets for the sectors of automobile-auto parts, insurance, and government procurement. In response, the Japanese side has continued to refuse to comply with the U.S. insistence, saying, "Setting such numerical targets will lead to managed trade." The Japan-U.S. economic framework talks have run into rough sailing from the start and a way out is not in sight at all. In Japanese-U.S. relations during the Cold War era, the coordinating capabilities of the two countries worked on their own when their negotiations were deadlocked because they were Western allies who were committed to defending the principle of free trade. A Japanese negotiator has said that during the Cold War era, the State Department and the Treasury Department placated the hard-line U.S. Trade Representative and the Commerce Department whenever individual trade frictions occurred between the two countries and the Defense Department came out to defuse the bilateral trade frictions when they got worse. Meanwhile, an American negotiator has pointed out that during the Cold War era, pro-international trade bureaucrats in the Finance Ministry and MITI worked to persuade hard-liners in Japan. The leaders of the two countries should display their political leadership transcending the bilateral working-level talks and the argument between the two countries over free trade and managed trade. This is the only way to break the impasse in the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks. The Hosokawa government has been preoccupied with political reform and this cannot be an excuse for the government to leave the Japanese-U.S. relations worsened. Rather than continuing to argue against setting the numerical targets, the Japanese side should present the U.S. side with concrete steps to open the Japanese market in the individual sector. It goes without saying that the Hosokawa government needs to speedily take stimulus measures centering on the income tax reduction to pull Japan out of a prolonged recession. Those measures also will result in reducing Japan's huge current account surplus. We hope that Prime Minister Hosokawa will display his leadership when he makes political decisions as he said to U.S. Treasury Secretary Bentsen. It is said that President Clinton himself is the hardest-liner toward Japan in his administration. With the conclusion of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the multilateral trade negotiations (the Uruguay Round of GATT), the President is now aiming to gain trade results from Japan through the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. The President, however, should consider that the idea of placing importance on the trade results may undermine the relations of G-2 (Japan and the United States) which are in a position to jointly manage the post-Cold War world economy. The continuing confrontation between Japan and the United States at a time when they have to come up with common values for the post-Cold War world is unfortunate not only for the two countries, but for the world economy.
