This gang, in which 45 non-native persons were active, purchased narcotics from individuals in Kerman, prepared them in 50-780-g packages, hid them in their bodies, and traveling on airplanes to the provinces in the north, west, and northwest transported them for sale. All 45 persons were captured, and on them more than 10 kg of opium were seized. The sellers in Kerman were also identified and arrested. The commander of Kerman law enforcement added: After four people from Zarand were taken hostage last month by armed outlaws, the personnel of the Zarand law enforcement region, after a long period of intelligence work and surveillance, succeeded in capturing five of the kidnappers and contacts of the outlaws. In conclusion, he said: After a person was kidnapped by the armed outlaws, with the round-the-clock efforts of the self-sacrificing personnel of the Jiroft law enforcement region, the location of the outlaws was identified, and in an armed skirmish, two of the outlaws were killed and seven arrested. Five Klash weapons, some amounts of combat ammunition, and two motorcycles were also seized on them.
