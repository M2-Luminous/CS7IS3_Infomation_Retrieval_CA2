FR941116-0-00052 FR941116-0-00011 B. Cost-of-Service Methodology AOPL and Marathon argue that the Opinion No. 154&hyph;B methodology is inadequate for establishing rates. AOPL asserts that this methodology has never been used to set individual rates, and continues to argue for a stand-alone cost methodology. 18 As explained in Order No. 561, the regulations providing for an Opinion No. 154&hyph;B submission are merely the filing requirements for the cost-of-service alternative to indexing. An oil pipeline seeking cost-of-service rate treatment for some or all of its rates will submit the information required by new Part 346. Absent challenge to the rates proposed, that is all that is required of the oil pipeline. Matters of rate design and cost allocation will be at issue only if the rates are protested and a hearing is conducted. 19 As the Commission stated in Order No. 561&hyph;A, the issues of fully-allocated costs for oil pipelines have not been determined in a fully litigated case by this Commission under the ICA. 20 The Commission also stated that proponents of costing methodologies other than fully-allocated costs will not be precluded from advocating such methodologies in individual cases. 21 The Commission reaffirms that statement here. 18 AOPL, pp. 25&hyph;28. 19 The Commission has never established individual rates for oil pipelines on a cost-of-service basis, since no contested case has come to the Commission for final decision on issues of cost allocation and rate design. However, nothing in the Opinion No. 154&hyph;B costing methodology would limit the Commission in deciding how to allocate costs to establish individual rates. 20 Order No. 561&hyph;A, Regulations Preambles, III FERC Stats. & Regs. ¶␣31,000, at p. 31,107. 21 IV FERC Stats. and Regs. ¶␣31,000, at p. 31,107 (1994). Chevron suggests that the filing requirements should include a requirement that the carrier provide cost allocation and rate design schedules with its rate filing. 22 The Commission will not adopt this recommendation, since there will be no need for allocation and rate design information except at a hearing on a challenged cost-of-service rate filing. Thus, the Commission does not believe that a point-to-point rate showing, for example, is necessary as a filing requirement. The burden that this requirement would impose is not justified, particularly since the cost-of-service methodology is an alternative to indexing, and the initial filing need only show that there is a substantial divergence between the costs of the pipeline, as reflected in Statement A, and the revenues that would be produced by the indexed ceiling rates, as reflected in Statement G. 23 22 Chevron, p. 7. 23 See 18 CFR 346.2(c) (1) and (7). Similar requests are made by Alaska and Total. 24 These commenters also request that the Form No. 6 data be provided in such a fashion. For the same reasons, the Commission will not adopt these suggestions. 24 Alaska, pp. 1&hyph;2 and the appendices to its comments; Total, p. 1. AOPL urges the Commission to discard Opinion No. 154&hyph;B, arguing that this must have been Congress' intent in passing the Act of 1992. 25 To the contrary, Congress mandated only that the Commission establish a simplified and generally applicable ratemaking methodology. It did not specify what methodology should be used. The Commission has given full weight to the Congressional intent by providing that indexing will be the simplified and generally applicable methodology for oil pipeline ratemaking. Under this scheme, cost of service continues only as an option that pipelines may choose to use if they meet the threshold requirement. 26 25 AOPL, p. 19. 26 See 18 CFR 342.4(a), adopted by Order No. 561&hyph;A. AOPL further argues that pipelines should be allowed to use a variety of methods to justify individual rate changes. 27 Buckeye also seeks alternatives to indexing for partly competitive pipelines to use in less competitive markets. 28 These issues are beyond the scope of this rulemaking, but parties are free to make proposals in individual cases. 27 AOPL, p. 28. 28 Buckeye, pp. 2&hyph;4. ARCO seeks clarification of several items. It first asks that the Commission require that pipelines seeking to use a cost of service approach file a full system-wide cost of service. Protestants then would be required to be specific in their protests. 29 The Commission has determined that the Opinion No. 154&hyph;B filing will be required for a cost-of-service filing, and that a cost allocation and rate design showing would only be required if the pipeline's rates are protested. This will reduce the burden on the pipeline and the Commission in those cases where there is no protest. The information required to be filed by Part 346 of the regulations adopted by this order will be sufficient for a cost-of-service showing if there are no protests. 29 ARCO, p. 3. ARCO further requests clarification that, if a pipeline can show that its total revenue requirement is not being met, it may charge cost-of-service rates above the index without any other showing, and that, in that case, no information on point-to-point rates would be filed except in an investigation. 30 ARCO is generally correct. All a pipeline need show to make a prima facie case under the cost-of-service alternative is that the revenues to be produced by the indexed ceiling rates substantially diverge from its costs. Upon challenge, however, the pipeline must provide data supporting its proposed individual rates, including allocation and rate design. It will not be allowed to charge rates higher than its properly allocated costs would justify for any one service. 30 ARCO, pp. 3&hyph;5.
