FR940328-1-00034 FR940328-1-00016 48 CFR Part 45 [FAR Case 91&hyph;83] Federal Acquisition Regulation; Government Property AGENCIES: Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to emphasize the Government's policy on providing facilities to contractors, to clarify the exceptions to this policy and the procedures for authorizing the exceptions, and to remove unnecessary and duplicative language. The purpose in emphasizing the Government's current policy is to reduce the amount of Government facilities provided to contractors. This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September 30, 1993. DATES: Comments should be submitted to the FAR Secretariat at the address shown below on or before May 27, 1994 to be considered in the formulation of a final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to: General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat (VRS), 18th & F Streets, NW., room 4037, Washington, DC 20450. Please cite FAR case 91&hyph;83 in all correspondence related to this case. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Linda Klein at (202) 501&hyph;3775 in reference to this FAR case. For general information, contact the FAR Secretariat, room 4037, GS Building, Washington, DC 20405 (202) 501&hyph;4755. Please cite FAR case 91&hyph;83. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background FAR 45.302 currently states that contractors shall furnish all facilities, with certain exceptions, in performing Government contracts. Despite this policy statement, recent oversight reviews have been critical of the amount of Government facilities in the hands of contractors. The Councils reviewed the language at 45.302 and revised it to clarify current policy and remove unnecessary and duplicative language. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq., because the rule is a recasting of existing policy and does not include any substantive changes. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will be considered in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq., (FAR case 91&hyph;83), in correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq. List of Subjects in 48 CFR Part 45 Government procurement. Dated: March 18, 1994. Albert A. Vicchiolla, Director, Office of Federal Acquisition Policy.
