The Slovak National Party [SNS] sent Deputy Chairman Juraj Molnar to the congress as an observer. His participation in the congress triggered an unusually strong and above all negative response in the mass media. The fact that the congress was held immediately after the conclusion of the Fifth Congress of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], which organized the congress, served as a pretext for spreading speculation. [Zelenayova] With what intentions did you depart for Moscow? [Molnar] My visit to Moscow is being commented on with the expressed aim of generating certain moods and spreading disinformation. Efforts can even be detected to discredit this visit and the foreign policy line of our party. Indeed, the congress was organized by the LDPR and we have been saying openly that we used our participation in the congress to unofficially establish contacts with LDPR representatives, which undeniably represents a real political force. I went to Moscow in order to obtain firsthand information. [Zelenayova] The LDPR is considered to be an extremist party. Your contacts with its representatives allow politicians and journalists to argue that the SNS has also joined this current. [Molnar] Our party also had an observer at the congress of the Coexistence Movement, and no one claimed that our orientation is pro-Hungarian. Our party has carried out a very precise analysis of the developments in Russia. In this analysis, we did not evaluate or consider whether the LDPR is a positive or a negative phenomenon. We merely considered that it represents a real force that must be reckoned with and that can influence developments in Central Europe. [Zelenayova] I do not assume that you consider the LDPR a real force only because of Zhirinovskiy's strong words. His plans to create a Russian empire reaching to the Indian Ocean and his reference to Bratislava as the capital of this empire have rightly alarmed politicians. [Molnar] The real strength of this party does not lie in Zhirinovskiy's vocabulary but in the election results. It has entered the Duma as the strongest party. As for Bratislava, it is being considered as a possible ideological center of the Slavs and not as the capital of a Russian empire. After all, it would be absurd for Russia to try to bring together some empire and hand over its capital to another nation. At the Moscow congress there was talk about creating an association of Slav nations and it is in this context that one has to understand the reference to Bratislava. It would play a similar role as Strasbourg, which fulfills the function of capital for the European Union. However, there has never been talk about a new state formation. [Zelenayova] Do you consider it conceivable for the Slav nations to unite? This is not a new idea. [Molnar] It is interesting that whenever there is talk about Slav nations, someone always makes a tremendous fuss about it. Slovakia is a member of the Central European Initiative, which does not remind anyone of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, although it occupies the same geographic space. But when there is talk of 300 million Slavs, all kinds of noises can immediately be heard about links with the former regime and such like. This is natural. Were the 300 million Slavs to unite, they would constitute a decisive force in Europe and the world. Western Europe is naturally afraid of this because it is ethnically mixed, being inhabited by Latin nations, Germans, Anglo-Saxons, and remnants of the Celts. As for Zhirinovskiy's plans, at the congress in Moscow it was said that the unification of the nations of Russia [as published] should be brought about by nonmilitary means. [passage omitted] While in Moscow, I clearly declared that the Slavs cannot unite on the basis of political parties but on the platform of governments, which should work out the common, basic idea of such a community. I consider the congress as a mere declaration of intent, as the first step that should raise this issue and give it a topical dimension. [passage omitted] [Zelenayova] Could you tell us what you learned from your talks with LDPR representatives? [Molnar] We wanted to find out what their ideas are, because their electoral victory is a realistic prospect. I also inquired how far the empire under discussion would stretch in the west, for example. Would it swallow Slovakia? Mr. Zhirinovskiy clearly said that Slovakia is, and will remain, an independent state. This was also confirmed by the LDPR deputy chairman, and was also published in the press. [Zelenayova] Did you speak with Zhirinovskiy personally? [Molnar] Yes, I had a personal conversation with him. [Zelenayova] What impression did he make on you? [Molnar] It is difficult to form an impression in 10 or 15 minutes. He definitely does not come across as a radical, although one has to admit that he has an emotional mode of expression. I consider this a form of the struggle for power. Apparently, he does not have access to the media and, therefore, opts for this method. Western politicians also used to talk about driving the communists beyond the Urals and so on, before coming to power. Their vocabulary changed when they came to power. But I would not like to evaluate the LDPR; I do not know whether its strength will make a positive or negative impact. We have only established contacts, because it represents a real political force.
