The decision is part of a technological updating process that will provide the Armed Forces with more weapons to fight the guerrillas. Among the weapons that will be changed are the estimated 100,000 rifles currently owned by the military; the same amount of rifles will be purchased. The new 5.56 mm rifles will be of the same brand and will have the same characteristics as the U.S.-made M-16 and Israeli-made Galil rifles currently used in Colombia. Each weapon will cost between $1,500 and $3,000. This means that the investment being considered could cost 200 billion pesos. INDUMIL [State Military Industry Enterprise], which produces ammunition and weapons in Colombia, is conducting the technical and economic evaluation. Although the study is well under way, it may still last several months. In the United States, it took a year to make a similar decision. The new Armed Forces rifles have been characterized as merciful. They were invented to wound instead of kill in combat. According to experts, they are more detrimental to the enemy, because they immobilize not only the wounded soldier but also those who come to his aid. These weapons are also lighter, which makes them more maneuverable, and they allow quicker troop deployment and facilitate the transportation of larger amounts of ammunition. They also reduce risks when there are incidents at checkpoints and during urban patrols.
