Kilibarda said that "one needs to compensate the Italian citizens who used to live in Dalmatia and had their possessions there" especially "because they did not work on the side of the occupier but were loyal to the Yugoslav authorities." The president of the most numerous Montenegrin opposition party emphasized that the sympathizers and members of his party "will not defend Dalmatia from the Italians," and that they would rather see "the Italians living in Split and Dubrovnik than the Croats."
