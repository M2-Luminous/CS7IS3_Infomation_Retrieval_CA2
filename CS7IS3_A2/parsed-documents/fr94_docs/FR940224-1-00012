FR940224-1-00012 FR940224-1-00004 The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: Boeing: Docket 93&hyph;NM&hyph;139&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model 747 series airplanes, line positions 001 through 200 inclusive, certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent rapid decompression of the airplane and the inability to carry fail-safe loads, accomplish the following: (a) Within 1,000 landings after the effective date of this AD, and thereafter at the intervals specified in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3) of this AD, perform inspections at the upper lobe skin lap joints in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53&hyph;2307, Revision 2, dated October 14, 1993: (1) Perform a detailed external visual inspection to detect cracks and evidence of corrosion (bulging skin between fasteners, blistered paint, dished fasteners, popped rivet heads, or loose fasteners) in accordance with the service bulletin. Repeat that inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 2,000 landings until the inspection required by paragraph (f) of this AD is accomplished. (2) Perform a high frequency eddy current inspection (HFEC) to detect cracks in the skin at the upper row of fasteners of the lap joints forward of body station (BS) 1000 in accordance with the service bulletin. Repeat that inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 4,000 landings until the modification required by paragraph (e) of this AD is accomplished. (3) Perform a HFEC inspection to detect cracks in the skin at the upper row of fastener holes of the lap joints aft of BS 1480 to 2360 in accordance with the service bulletin. Repeat that inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 6,000 landings until the inspection required by paragraph (f) of this AD is accomplished. (b) If any crack is found during any inspection required by this AD, or if any corrosion is found for which material loss exceeds 10 percent of the material thickness, accomplish paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this AD in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53&hyph;2307, Revision 2, dated October 14, 1993. (1) Prior to further flight, repair any crack or corrosion found, in accordance with the service bulletin. (2) Within 15 months after accomplishing the repair, accomplish the ``full'' modification described in the service bulletin for the remainder of any skin panel lap joint in which a crack is found, or in which corrosion is found that exceeds 10 percent of the material thickness. (c) If no crack is found during any inspection required by this AD, but corrosion is found for which the material loss does not exceed 10 percent of the material thickness: Accomplish paragraph (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this AD for the entire affected skin panel lap joint in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53&hyph;2307, Revision 2, dated October 14, 1993. (1) Within 500 landings after accomplishing the inspection during which the corrosion was found, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 500 landings until the ``full'' modification required by paragraph (c)(2) of this AD is accomplished: Perform a HFEC inspection to detect cracks of the corroded lap joint, in accordance with the service bulletin. (2) Within 30 months after accomplishing the inspection during which the corrosion was found: Accomplish the ``full'' modification required by paragraph (e) of this AD. (d) The inspections required by this AD shall be performed by removing the paint and using an approved chemical stripper; or by ensuring that each fastener head is clearly visible.
