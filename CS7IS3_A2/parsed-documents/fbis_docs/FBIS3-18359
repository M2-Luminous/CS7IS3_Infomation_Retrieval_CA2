According to government spokesman Dieter Vogel, Kohl said during a cabinet meeting in Bonn today that the accession of these countries would go down as a major event in European history. All parties could be "more than satisfied" with the results of the talks. Kohl emphasized that the German Government, which had spearheaded the opening of the European Community towards southern Europe, had a "decisive interest" in the Scandinavian countries and Austria becoming members. Germany's close cooperation with the new member states would be of great benefit to Germany in particular, he said.
