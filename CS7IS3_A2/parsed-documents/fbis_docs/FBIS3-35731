Marakutsa thinks that the problems which have recently arisen are due to the trial of the "Ilascu group", whose six members, supporters of the Moldovan Popular Front, were convicted by Tiraspol (the capital of the Dniester republic) of committing acts of terrorism during last year's military conflict in the Trans-Dniester region. According to Marakutsa, international organisations have appealed to Tiraspol not to carry out the death penalty given to Ilie Ilascu, the leader of the group. "We are not going to insist" on the ultimate punishment, the republic's parliamentary leader declared, "but the convicted have to be punished somehow". According to Marakutsa, "the possibility of a new independent court investigation of the Ilascu group, as many international organisations have proposed, has not been ruled out".
