Thank you very much. [Unidentified correspondent] Does this mean that you want the Krajina to become a part of the Croatian state? [Churkin] No, this only means that we want the hostilities to stop and we want the situation in this area to return to normal. We hope that such an agreement on the cessation of hostilities will contribute to an improvement and gradual normalization of Croatian-Serbian relations, because this is a very important element for the entire situation in the former Yugoslavia. [passage omitted] [Churkin] This was a working meeting, one of many that we have had in the past year and a half. We discussed the prospects for a political solution of the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina in light of the latest events, namely, the Muslim-Croatian concept of federation. I think that the bottom line we agreed on was that any kind of future political solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina must take into account the interests and sovereign rights of all three constituent peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- the Muslims, Croats, and Serbs. We agreed that there are still paths to be explored in order to further the extremely difficult negotiating process. [Karadzic] We are very satisfied with the fact that it is clear that the Serbian people have their sovereign rights to the same extent as the Croats and Muslims; we have, of course, stressed our need to have special relations with Serbia, Yugoslavia, that is, and we must look for a solution within this context, within the context of realizing our sovereign rights and (?particular) ties; for the time being we do not see a solution, but we do see the way to it.
