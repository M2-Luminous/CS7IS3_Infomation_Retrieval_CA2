The administration has just celebrated its first anniversary, which of course means that the opposition also has a one-year anniversary. What does the leader of the Conservative Party, Hans Engell has to say about that? INFORMATION would like to know, which is why we visited the leader at his office at Christiansborg. Christiansborg is mildly euphoric. It is seething with changes in the administration. Poul Nyrup Rasmussen has just fired Major Bergstein, Arne Melchior, and Karen Jespersen, and Mimi Jacobsen has been appointed minister of coordination and industrial affairs and Bente Juncker minister of social affairs. "Normally we do not comment on such ministerial reshuffling," Engell says on the phone, but nevertheless accepts the call from the journalist at the other end of the line. According to Engell, the reshuffle is a helping hand for a troubled CD [Center Democrats] that thereby obtains "two weighty appointments." "I know Bente Juncker to be a personally involved and dynamic politician," he says, moreover finding it remarkable that Nyrup changed ministers and their jurisdictions so close to a Folketing election. But it was probably the CD's weakened position that made it necessary. Karen Jespersen, who had not made any mistakes, was the person who had to withdraw, because, according to Engell, Bente Juncker's area was social policy, and should she become minister, it would have to be in this position. Particular Mood Would Engell prefer to be a minister or to be in the opposition? He seems to think that is has been difficult to be a minister at times, for instance when he was minister of justice in the summer of 1992 when the Tamil case "lay like a shadow over everything," and he had all together only five days off, which he spent on the phone. The Palestinian problem? In this case people failed to realize that Engell as a minister was unable to do anything about the Refugee Council's rejection of the asylum application and that he had left an impression of trying to avoid the responsibility of being the appeal of last resort. What did he think about that? "One grows to like it. If you find yourself in a besieged castle under constant fire, a special mood arises that has its own charm," says the former minister of defense, whose office is decorated with an impressive collection of coats of arms. "The problem was that I spent too much time solving problems and too little on conducting politics." Of course he would prefer to be in the cabinet, he says, but "we do not tiptoe impatiently outside the door just waiting to take over. We have lived through a difficult year, during which we had to take responsibility for the Tamil case, regroup from being in a position of power to being in opposition, change our leader, and create an opposition policy. We have been able to do this without showing any signs of panic and without changing our policy, and I am satisfied with what we have done. ``I have a feeling that we will be deserving of a return to power.'' Considerable Modesty [Syberg] Will you admit to acknowledging that the Conservative Party was thoroughly compromised by the Tamil case? [Engell] No, I will not say that. I will not say that the party has a collective responsibility, but we have received a psychological nosebleed and it is natural that we will need a time-out to consider. [Syberg] Should there be a basis for a VK [Liberal/Conservative] government after the election, will there also be two candidates for prime minister? [Engell] I feel very hesitant about discussing this topic. First, we have a prime minister; and secondly, we have said that the matter at heart is not a question of who. [Syberg] Is that the same as saying that you know that the Liberals will insist on Uffe Ellemann? [Engell] No, it is not the same. Who will become prime minister is a question of votes. The person who wins the majority of votes in the Folketing will become prime minister. [Syberg] But something says that it is better to remain in the opposition for a while yet? [Engell] No, I will not say that. There appears to be a rule of thumb that says that the longer one is in the opposition, the more difficult it is to escape the role of being in the opposition. [Syberg] You make it sound like a law of nature? [Engell] The more time that passes the more entrenched Nyrup will be in the prime minister's office. [Syberg] But there must be something that the voters determine? [Engell] Of course. But in summing up I will say that my intention is to return after the next election and to coordinate the party's regaining of power and strength. But there is time enough. More Ideology The power and strength of the party is to be regained by creating a more ideological profile, Engell opines. [Engell] I think that we, in the eyes of the voters, stand out like skilled craftsmen able to make agreements and that type of thing. This has cost us something because, strangely enough, we live in a time when ideologies apparently have gone bankrupt; in a very ideological time, when attitudes and values are in the seat of honor. And in those areas the profile we have kept is too low. Schluter would not like to hear this, but we have probably neglected the ideological debate. [Syberg] You appear to be the man in the Conservative wing. Are you? [Engell] That is because the areas I have been responsible for are difficult areas like defense and the judicial system. If, instead, I had been minister of social affairs or culture, my profile would have been different. But as to attitudes, I really am a proper, traditional conservative, thinking for instance, that it should be made easier for the traditional family to survive, and working for a two-track school. "But I do not think that it is the job of society or the party to determine how people should live," the leader stresses, advocating a [tolerance for] a broad variety of opinions, saying that he is happy that the Conservative Party is broad-minded enough to include a range of "members from a middle point of view to something that is on the edge of the Danish Society." [Syberg] Are you happy that some of your members are at the edge of the Danish Society? [Engell] No, no, that is not what I meant. It was the wide spectrum [of opinions] I was happy over! [Syberg] Won't the Liberal Party's more ideological attitude be a problem in a coalition? [Engell] No, it is good to have some ideological luggage. And when it comes to practical politics, in reality nobody lets himself be ruled by ideology. Less Ideology [Syberg] Are you not in reality closer to a social democracy that carries out a middle-of-the-road policy: Is there any alternative to the welfare state? [Engell] I prefer to call it a welfare society; but no, I do not think there is an alternative. I do not want a state with a minimum level of social welfare. The Conservative Party has had a considerable coresponsibility for the social development since the 1940's; we have voted for a majority of the most important new laws and one would be turning one's back on the entire development if one did not acknowledge this responsibility. However, we do think that the richest people should help the poorest; not that everybody should have a long list of similar social benefits. We want a better balance. [Syberg] Why not implement this along with the Social Democratic Party that is working toward the same goals instead of with the Liberal Party which is working in the opposite direction? [Engell] The Social Democratic Party is too much a part of the system we know today. It is the party with the least number of fresh ideas. They are too collectivistic in their way of thinking. * * * The similarity between the "two old city parties" that Engell acknowledges to be there is to a large extent due to the fact that the political agenda has changed, so that there are more issues that the parties must agree on, he thinks. For instance, there is no party that does not demand a responsible environmental policy, nobody who does not think that the government's finances should be in order, etc. * * * [Engell] Today we have more parties than unattached political points of view. [Syberg] That raises the question of whether the party system has outlived itself. When everybody thinks the same, it does not matter who one votes for? [Engell] No, that is not right, because there are always differences in attitude. Most new ideas come from the nonsocialist side. Both the Social Democratic Party and the Socialist People's Party stick with set ideologies. [Syberg] When looking at your new party program "Freedom together," one is struck by one aspect. You always write that "a basic conservative attitude means so-and-so, but...then comes a bunch of qualifications?" [Engell] The reason for that is exactly that we are not an ideological party. Conservatism is an expression of an attitude toward life, an inner compass, but beyond that we have made accommodations to social development. [Syberg] You often ascribe to the basic conservative beliefs something which is impossible to disagree with, even for a non-Conservative, while what comes on the other side of the but might look like it cannot be carried out based on this basic belief. As an example you want a policy that promotes both the environment and growth. There are at least some who think that this is impossible? [Engell] Not all economic growth needs to have environmental consequences. High technology and pharmaceutical products can easily be produced without harming the environment. [Syberg] Is it right to say that you want to further some forms of growth and hinder others? [Engell] No, definitely not. We think that there is a close relationship between growth and the environment. There is an incredible amount of hypocrisy in the environmental debate. For instance, look at the Soya cake. If we say that we do not want this kind of production in the middle of a big city or in this country, it will probably be moved to a place where the possibility of solving the problems is much poorer. This type of a problem must be solved using filters, safety precautions, etc. It is growth that will finance environmental policies. Unworkable Program [Engell] A party program also has the attribute that some part of it is outdated as soon as it is in place -- while other parts will never get done. That is why I think that the process is just as important as the result. When working on this program many new members will be drawn into thinking and formulating political ideas. [passage omitted]
