FR941216-2-00006 FR941216-2-00005 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE International Trade Administration [A&hyph;570&hyph;835] Notice of Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Postponement of Final Determination: Furfuryl Alcohol From the People's Republic of China AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 16, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Brinkmann or Donna Berg, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, D.C. 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;5288 or 482&hyph;0114, respectively. Preliminary Determination We preliminarily determine that imports of furfuryl alcohol from the People's Republic of China (PRC) are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (the Act), as amended. The estimated margins of sales at less than fair value are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. Case History Since the initiation of this investigation on June 20, 1994, (59 FR 32953, June 27, 1994), the following events have occurred. On July 19, 1994, officials of the Department of Commerce (the Department) visited the petitioner's facilities to observe the furfuryl alcohol production process for purposes of developing the questionnaire. On June 21, 1994, we sent a survey to the PRC's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) and certain companies in the PRC requesting information on production and sales of furfuryl alcohol exported to the United States. The names of the companies were found in the petition and in data supplied by the Port Import Export Reporting Service (PIERS). We requested MOFTEC's assistance in forwarding the survey to all exporters and producers of furfuryl alcohol and in submitting complete responses on their behalf. On June 23, 1994, MOFTEC sent us a list of exporters of furfuryl alcohol. On July 1 and 8, 1994, we sent letters to the China Chamber of Commerce of Metals, Minerals & Chemical Importers & Exporters (CCCMMC) for assistance in identifying the producers and any other exporters of furfuryl alcohol. CCCMMC provided a list of producers on July 12, 1994. On July 15, 1994, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) notified the Department of its preliminary determination that there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is materially injured by reason of imports of furfuryl alcohol from the PRC that are alleged to be sold at less than fair value. The Department forwarded to MOFTEC and those PRC producers and exporters identified in the course of this proceeding full questionnaires on August 5, 1994. Additionally, during the month of August 1994, the Department held a questionnaire presentation with company officials in China. On September 2, 1994, responses to section A of our questionnaire were received from the following two exporters of furfuryl alcohol: Qingdao Chemicals & Medicines Import & Export Corporation (Qingdao I&E) and Sinochem Shandong Import & Export Group Corporation Ltd. (Sinochem Shandong I&E). The following three manufacturers also submitted Section A responses on September 2, 1994: Linzi Organic Chemicals Co., Ltd. (Linzi), Shandong Zhucheng Chemical Co., Ltd. (Zhucheng), and Zibo Gaintact Chemical Co., Ltd. (Zibo). On September 20, 1994, we received relevant responses to the remaining sections of our questionnaire from Qingdao I&E, Sinochem Shandong I&E, Linzi, Zhucheng, and Zibo.
