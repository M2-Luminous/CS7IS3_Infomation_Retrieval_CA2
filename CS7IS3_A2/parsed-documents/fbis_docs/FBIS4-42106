They had no idea of the extent of what was waiting for them: a budget crisis, a foreign exchange crisis, a bank crisis, and mass unemployment. But despite what many people were predicting, they are still in office as we approach the finish line. The most competent government's trip down the only path, as the saying went at the time, got off to a flying start. But it may end this spring with the government going from setback to setback in the Riksdag and, like a groggy boxer, staggering around the ring waiting to be rescued by the sound of the bell. The New Democrats are the ones who may mess things up again. A little over a year ago, when Carl Bildt threatened New Democracy with new elections, he brought Ian Wachtmeister to his knees. At least the New Democracy group thought so, and now it is coming back with renewed opposition strength. So far, the threat of new elections has been the minority government's only serious crisis in the Riksdag. And on one occasion it was almost made from within the coalition: in January of this year over the issue of the bridge over the sound. Olof Johansson argued with the other three party leaders about the bridge for 25 hours, he says, and at one point he yelled at the prime minister: "What the hell do you think you are doing?" Center Party Made Threats There were also a few near-accidents during the negotiations over the emergency package in the fall of 1992. The Social Democrats were demanding that the KDS [Christian Democratic Party] and the Center Party be ignored on the issues of the home care allowance and agricultural subsidies respectively, but in the interest of solidarity, Bildt firmly refused. During the negotiations, Bengt Westerberg wanted to raise the value-added tax on food items back up to 25 percent. "If that happens, I'm walking out the door," Johansson threatened, and no more was said about it. So why has the government managed to hold together despite a series of splits that often grew worse because they were leaked to the mass media? The simplest answer is that the four parties had no choice. One more fiasco after the mess they made from 1976 to 1982 would have discredited the nonsocialist alternative for government for the rest of the century. And it is nonsocialism, not bourgeois ideology, that has been the cement holding the government together. Carl Bildt, Bengt Westerberg, and Olof Johansson were also together the last time around, and they benefited from that experience when the new government was being formed. [passage omitted] Johansson has his own explanation for why things have gone better than the last time. He says it is easier with four parties than with three. Four parties provide more opportunities for getting support from some other party on an issue -- it is not just a matter of two parties ganging up on the third. As prime minister, Bildt gets good marks from the other parties. He is considered to be a surprisingly good team leader who has the ability to enliven the atmosphere while also being very dexterous when it comes to finding solutions. But there is a general complaint: Bildt likes to put off difficult decisions, something that irritates the more executive-minded members of the Cabinet Office. Bildt Lacks Warmth It is also said from the inside that there has been a lack of "warmth and feeling" in the political message. That criticism is directed against the entire government, but as prime minister, Bildt sets the tone. The government has also been helped by the Social Democrats. Broad agreements have been reached regarding the European Union [EU] negotiations and changes in the Constitution. [passage omitted] Loyal KDS Johansson was regarded as the doubtful card, especially by the Liberal Party, when the Center Party entered the government. But despite the ups and downs regarding the bridge and nuclear power, Johansson has been a surprisingly positive member of the government. Anne Wibble says in her new book that while Johansson has certainly not been a driving force in the government when it comes to saving money, neither has he been an obstruction. Concerning the negotiations on the government's 81-billion-krona reorganization program, Wibble reports that Olof often said "think about its distribution," while Alf Svensson was constantly interjecting: "We must find room for the home care allowance." The KDS ministers have been very loyal members of the government. In Svensson's words, they have "sat still in the boat." They have almost always stayed close to the Moderates. The KDS' immediate entry into the government put great pressure on the party's political and personnel resources. Its fast promotion was also something of a culture shock as far as the party's voters were concerned, and this can be seen in the public opinion polls. Liberal Party a Concern The man who has caused the most concern among the voters is Bengt Westerberg. After the matter of the New Start program with Bildt was settled, the Liberal Party leader began distancing himself more and more from Moderate Party policy, chiefly on welfare issues. Westerberg has played a very constructive role in the government, but he has also won a few rounds. His defense of general welfare -- and of the tax burden -- has not really caused any serious crises in government work. His Ministry of Social Affairs has probably saved more money than all the Moderate ministers combined. On the other hand, he does not rate highly with Moderates in the Riksdag. Even Center Party and KDS members think that the Liberal Party leader "jumps in everywhere with his lecturing." The four coalition parties would like to view the program agreed on after the 1991 elections as a contract. They pledged to stick together on a policy along those lines, but this did not mean that the parties lost their right to defend their own identities and core issues. That is what we are going to see in the election campaign: each of the four coalition parties going out on its own to attract as many voters as possible with a smorgasbord of good proposals. But not all of those proposals are going to be consistent with that contract. If the government survives the elections, it will soon have to face new and vexed negotiations on nuclear power, welfare and basic security, tax reductions and tax changes, municipal finances, our EU policy when it comes to defense and foreign exchange, and a long list of issues that will face us over the next four years.
