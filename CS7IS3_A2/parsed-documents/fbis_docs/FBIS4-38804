As earlier reported, president of the unrecognised Dniester republic Igor Smirnov has decreed to prolong the state of emergency on the left-hand bank of the Dniester beginning from June 1. The state of emergency was announced on January 18 to prevent the holding of pre-term elections to the Moldavian parliament in the Dniester area. According to Katane, the state of emergency envisages the toughening of the border regime by the self-styled Dniester republic and deployment of additional paramilitary units within the safety zone. He described as far-fetched the arguments of the Tiraspol authorities that the state of emergency was necessary to combat crime in the region.
