It is since that day that the state, for the first time in decades, began to transfer gold into private hands. It may be only the first small step: what is being put into circulation is not actual gold, but state obligations--the Gold Certificates of the Ministry of Finance--but this step already has been made. With it, Russia and its weakened economy become full-fledged members of the world financial community. A year later, on 27 September 1994, citizens of Russia, banks, and firms will be able to possess the most real values in the world. Bars of 24K gold will become part of financial circulation, will help economic recovery, to get a handle on inflation. Russia is far from the only country in the world where circulation of gold had been banned. Even in the United States in 1934 the law on gold bullion forbade ownership of gold bars; this ban was lifted only on 31 December 1974. A virtual boom in the gold market ensued. Now an average well-to-do American holds his assets not only in stocks and real estate, but also necessarily in gold bars. After all, the only thing that is safer than gold is gold that belongs to you and sits in an armored safe. The gold reserves kept in individual safe-deposit boxes in American banks could compete with the famous depository of state gold bullion in Fort Knox. I think that a similar "gold rush" is awaiting us, too, magnified by the factor that after 70 years, Russia is more starved for gold than America. The current factors of political and economic instability also will have an impact. Gold is a crisis commodity; it tends to do well when in other spheres times are hard or a trend is developing toward the worsening of a situation. During the period of political and economic upheaval and growing inflation, the demand for gold has practically no "ceiling." Therefore, we should expect that the Federal Clearing Chamber for Gold Trade is facing a heavy workload. And although the gold market in our country is just beginning to "warm up," judging by how fast the "temperature" is climbing up, we are not far from the "boiling point." Currently the chamber has organized trading in Gold Certificates of the Ministry of Finance, as well as derivative rights to gold, which have been put into circulation by the owners of Gold Certificates. We hope that legislative changes will enable us to begin selling by the fall of 1994 24K gold bars and gold coins--this is a classic exchange commodity. The chamber is currently trading in two modes: the market of currently available commodities and the market of futures contracts. In the current commodities market, there is buying and selling of deeds of ownership of parts of Gold Certificates, issued by the banks--the owners of full Gold Certificates. By its nature, it may be defined as an investor market, that is, depositors who want to protect their money from inflation--not only with respect to the ruble but also from inflation of seemingly hard currencies. It is no secret that over the past few months we have become witness and, what is even sadder, victim to a most paradoxical "dollar inflation." Quantitatively, this is a market of small (from a few hundred to a few thousand rubles) to medium-sized (several tens of millions of rubles) depositors, who do not have the resources to purchase a whole Gold Certificate, which costs 150 million rubles [R]. In their composition, it is mostly commercial and state organizations, as well as individual citizens. In the futures market, the actors are mainly speculators; the state of the market, which actually is not surprising, is set by "bulls." The trend of rising prices in the gold market is quite visible. For instance, in April 1993 at the London metals exchange a Troy ounce of gold cost $326; in November it already cost $375-$378. According to KOMMERSANT-DAILY forecasts (No. 215, 1993), within the next few months gold prices may rise to $410 or even $450 per Troy ounce. Thus, those who purchased last December standard futures contracts from the Federal Clearing Chamber for Gold Trade and sell them, for instance, in April will make a return up to 60 percent at the annual rate in foreign currency; keeping in mind that opening a position in the chamber requires posting an initial margin of 20 percent of the value of the contract, return on the invested capital may reach 250-300 percent at the annual rate. And this is just for hedgers--active speculators, albeit with a certain degree of risk, may earn an even higher return. As to returns in rubles, this does not lend itself to calculation at all, just like the rate of inflation in our country. The effectiveness and attractiveness of investing in a Gold Certificate may be graphically seen from this example: In jewelry stores, the price of 14K gold is R28,000 per gram, while the price of 24K gold in the Gold Certificate is today R18,000; thus, the gold of identical proof is three times less expensive in a Gold Certificate than in a jewelry store. Which means that for those who buy jewelry as a means of protecting their money from inflation, it is much more profitable to purchase shares in Gold Certificates. As is known, the movement of the market is hard to forecast. For instance, J.P. Morgan, a great authority in the area of financial and stock exchange operations, when asked his opinion on the market moves, usually answered: "Expect fluctuations." I, however, am in a position to make the following forecast for the gold market: "Expect growth." We can be reached at the following telephone numbers: (095) 374-69-39; 374-75-43.
