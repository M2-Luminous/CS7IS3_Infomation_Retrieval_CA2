By a majority vote at its session on 19 May, it approved the appointment of General [Volodymyr] Lepikhov to the post of chairman of the autonomy's security service. He was nominated by President Yuriy Meshkov. The directive on reorganizing the Security Service of the Republic of Crimea into the Security Service of Ukraine Main Directorate in Crimea, signed by Ukrainian Head of State Leonid Kravchuk, has thus been ignored. The [Security Service of Ukraine] press service in Kiev emphasizes that the principal aim of the reorganization is the need to enhance the centralization of leadership and the effectiveness of this service in fighting organized crime in Crimea where the scale of it is ever more threatening. The press service at the same time reports via the TV and radio agency Novyny [News] that Crimean President Meshkov has effectively ignored (?a coded telegram addressed to him) from Yevhen Marchuk, head of the Security Service of Ukraine, where he is informed that the Security Service of Ukraine Main Directorate in Crimea, set up in accordance with Leonid Kravchuk's directive, is to remain unchanged in performing its functions (?in order to retain effectiveness). The press service also reports that (Valeriy Malikov), Security Service of Ukraine first deputy chairman, and a number of his staff are now in Simferopol. They are preparing materials on the situation with fighting organized crime in Crimea, which will be under consideration at the (?next) sitting of the Security Service of Ukraine Collegium.
