FR940816-0-00012 FR940816-0-00007 B. Florida Florida initially received final authorization for its base RCRA program effective on February 12, 1985, (50 FR 3908, January 29, 1985). Florida received authorization for revisions to its program on April 6, 1992, for Non-HSWA III, IV, and V, and on January 10, 1994 for HSWA I without Corrective Action. Today, Florida is seeking approval of its program revisions in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3). EPA has reviewed Florida's application and has made an immediate final decision that Florida's hazardous waste program revisions satisfy all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently, EPA intends to grant final authorization for the additional program modifications to Florida. The public may submit written comments on EPA's immediate final decision up until October 17, 1994. Copies of Florida's application for these program revisions are available for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the Addresses section of this notice. Approval of Florida's program revisions shall become effective October 17, 1994. Unless an adverse comment pertaining to the State's revisions discussed in this notice is received by the end of the comment period. If an adverse comment is received EPA will publish either: (1) A withdrawal of the immediate final decision; or (2) a notice containing a response to comments which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses the decision. EPA shall administer any RCRA hazardous waste permits, or portions of permits that contain conditions based upon the Federal program provisions for which the State is applying for authorization and which were issued by EPA prior to the effective date of this authorization. EPA will suspend issuance of any further permits under the provisions for which the State is being authorized on the effective date of this authorization. Florida is today seeking authority to administer the following Federal requirements. ‚ê£ 1Checklist 1Description 1FR date and page 1Florida rule 80 Toxicity Characteristic; Hydrocarbon Recovery Operations 10/5/90, 55 FR 40834; 2/1/91, 56 FR 3978; 4/2/91, 56 FR 13406 17&hyph;730.030(1) F.A.C. 403.72(1) F.S. 81 Petroleum Refinery Primary and Secondary Oil/Water/Solids Separation Sludge Listing (FO37 and FO38) 11/2/90, 55 FR 46354; 12/17/90, 55 FR 51707 17&hyph;730.030(1), F.A.C. 403.72(1) F.S. 82 Wood Preserving Listings 12/6/90, 55 FR 50450 17&hyph;730.020, 030,160,180, & 220 F.A.C. 403.704,721, & 722 F.S. 83 Land Disposal Restrictions for Third Third Scheduled Wastes; Technical Amendments 1/31/91, 56 FR 3864 17&hyph;730.030, 160, & 183 F.A.C. 403.72, & 721, F.S. 84 Toxicity Characteristic; Chlorofluorocarbon Refrigerants 2/13/91, 56 FR 5910 17&hyph;730.030(1) F.A.C. 403.72(1), F.S. 86 Removal of Strontium Sulfide from the List of Hazardous Wastes; Technical Amendment 2/25/91, 56 FR 7567 17&hyph;730.030(1) F.A.C. 403.72(1), F.S. 87 Organic Air Emission Standards for Process Vents and Equipment Leaks; Technical Amendment 4/26/91, 56 FR 19290 17&hyph;730.180, & 220 F.A.C. 403.087, 721, & 722 F.S. 88 Administrative Stay for Portions of the KO69 Listing 5/1/91, 56 FR 19951 17&hyph;730.030 F.A.C. 403.71(1) F.S. 89 Revision to the Petroleum Refining Primary and Secondary Oil/Water/Solids Separation Sludge Listings (FO37 and FO38) 5/13/91, 56 FR 21955 17&hyph;730.030(1) F.A.C. 403.72(1) F.S. 90 Mining Waste Exclusion III 6/13/91, 56 FR 27300 17&hyph;730.030(1), F.A.C. 403.72(1), F.S. 91 Administrative Stay for FO32, FO34, and FO35 Listings 6/13/91, 56 FR 27332 17&hyph;730.030, 180, F.A.C. 403.72, & 721 F.S. 92 Wood Preserving Listings: Technical Corrections 7/1/91, 56 FR 30192 17&hyph;730.030, 160, 180, & 220 F.A.C. 403.72, 721, 704, & 722, F.S. 95 Land Disposal Restrictions for Electric Arc Furnace Dust (KO61) 8/19/91, 56 FR 41164 17&hyph;730.030, & 183 F.A.C. 403.72, & 721 F.S. 97 Exports of Hazardous Waste; Technical Correction 9/4/91, 56 FR 43704 17&hyph;730.160 F.A.C. 403.721(3), F.S. 99 Amendments to Interim Status Standards for Downgradient Ground Water Monitoring Well Locations 12/23/91, 56 FR 66365 17&hyph;730.020, & 180, F.A.C. 403.704, & 721, F.S. 100 Liners and Leak Detection Systems for Hazardous Waste Land Disposal Units 1/29/92, 57 FR 3462 17&hyph;730.020, 180, & 220, F.A.C. 403.721, & 722, F.S. 101 Administrative Stay for the Requirement that Existing Drip Pads Be Impermeable 2/18/92, 57 FR 5859 17&hyph;730.180 (1) F.A.C. 403.721 F.S. 102 Second Correction to the Third Third Land Disposal Restrictions 3/6/92, 57 FR 8086 17&hyph;730.180, & 183, F.A.C. 403.721, F.S. 103 Hazardous Debris Case-by-Case Capacity Variance 5/15/92, 57 FR 20766 17&hyph;730.83, F.A.C. 403.721, F.S. 106 Lead-bearing Hazardous Materials Case-by-Case Capacity Variance 6/26/92, 57 FR 28628 17&hyph;730.183, F.A.C. 403.721, F.S. 108 Toxicity Characteristics Revisions: Technical Corrections 7/10/92, 57 FR 30657 17&hyph;730.030, & 180, F.A.C. 403.72, & 721 F.S. 117B Toxicity Characteristic Amendment 6/1/92, 57 FR 23062 17&hyph;730.030, F.A.C. 403.72(1), F.S. 120 Wood Preserving; Amendments to Listings and Technical Requirements 12/24/92, 57 FR 61492 17&hyph;730.030, & 180 F.A.C. 403.72, & 721, F.S.
