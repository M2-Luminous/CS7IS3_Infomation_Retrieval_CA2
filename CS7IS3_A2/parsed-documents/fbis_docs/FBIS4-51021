The authorities had ordered the strictest security seen in five years in the capital, sources said yesterday. China's leaders are on full alert against a possible uprising as the fifth anniversary of the 4 June, 1989, Tiananmen Square incident looms. A special committee has been set up by the State Education Commission, the Beijing municipal party committee and district party committees to deal with any sudden developments, sources close to the Chinese authorities said. There are strong signs of rising tension in the capital, with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) patrolling the streets and leaders nervous about a possible power struggle as paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's health declines. The sources said protest marches and demonstrations planned for the 4 June anniversary were being forced underground by the clampdown. The authorities have banned large gatherings in Beijing during this sensitive period. A charity fund-raising campaign being organised by a group of Hong Kong businessmen to be held later this week has had to be cancelled because of the emergency order. The authorities fear that another upheaval like the pro-democracy movement of 1989 could spark a power struggle, sources said. A source quoted a state leader's son as saying that Deng Xiaoping had become a "vegetable" because of serious illness. There have been strong rumours about Mr Deng's declining health since he appeared on Chinese Central Television earlier this year looking dull. "State leaders are living in a very tense atmosphere and are alert to every small change," the source said. Leaders fear, a power struggle when Mr Deng dies--a repetition of what had happened after the death of the party chairman Mao Zedong. Meanwhile, high inflation and a large trade deficit had put huge pressure on state leaders, he said. "Many Chinese officials wish that Deng Xiaoping could appear in public again to stabilise public feeling." On previous anniversaries of the crackdown, only armed police have been on patrol, a resident said. But now PLA troops have been seen patrolling day and night in Beijing, including at Chang An Street, the main street and the longest in the capital. Meanwhile, Beijing has sent a circular to institutions, urging citizens to be cautious in the "serious" period between 6 May and 10 June. "Do not listen to the rumours of conspirators, do not gather around to watch in public areas, treasure the present good and stable atmosphere that the opening-up policy has brought," it said.
