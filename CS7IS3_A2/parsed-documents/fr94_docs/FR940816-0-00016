FR940816-0-00016 FR940816-0-00008 For international commercial trade (export and re-export), CITES requires certification that parts and derivatives of the species were acquired before June 11, 1992 ( i.e., that the wood is pre-Convention). Over the last several centuries and especially in this century (until 1970), most guitars (as well as several other fretted musical instruments such as banjos, basses, mandolins, and ukuleles) have been comprised of some to much Brazilian rosewood, and many of these musical instruments are in international commerce. The Service reviewed Brazil's proposal to include Dalbergia nigra (the Brazilian rosewood) in Appendix I. The species occurs naturally only in fragmented populations in remnants of the Mata Atlântica (Atlantic Coast Tropical Rainforest) of Brazil. A substantial amount of new information and data on trade in the wood of this species were received from persons in the music industry. The United States continues to agree that the species in the wild needs strong conservation measures, and did not enter a reservation on the listing of the species in Appendix I. The United States has had experience in the pre-CITES certification of articles (including musical instruments) with elephant ivory, tortoise shell, or hard coral, and will continue to endeavor to make the pre-CITES certification process efficient. Procedural Requirements This Federal Register notice simply implements changes in the list of species in the Convention's appendices that have already been approved by the Conference of the Parties at their eighth meeting, and that the United States is bound to accept unless it entered reservations. The Service does not believe that implementation of any of these adopted amendments would be contrary to the interests or laws of the United States. The period of time during which the United States could have entered a reservation on any of these amendments ended on June 10, 1992. The Service did not recommend the entry of any reservations, and none were taken by the United States. Therefore, these amendments to the CITES Appendices have been in effect for the United States since June 11, 1992. This notice brings the information in 50 CFR 23.23(f) into agreement with the current species listings in the CITES appendices. Earlier Federal Register notices informed the public about these amendments and provided opportunity for comment on them, and they were included in a public meeting on May 26, 1992 (see the May 11, 1992, Federal Register , 57 FR 20126). Therefore, the Department of the Interior has determined that good cause exists for making this rule effective upon its date of publication [5 U.S.C. 553(d)]. Accordingly, paragraph (f) of §23.23 of 50 CFR has been amended at the conclusion of this rule. The Department has determined that amendments to the Convention's appendices, which result from actions of the Parties to the Convention, did not require the preparation of Environmental Assessments as defined under authority of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321&hyph;4347). This rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601) does not apply to this listing process. This final rule does not contain information-collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. An editorial clarification for 50 CFR 23.23(f) under Class Aves (Birds) in the Order Psittaciformes (Parrots, etc. ) emphasizes that Psittacula krameri (rose-ringed or ring-necked parakeet) remains in Appendix III and was not included in Appendix II in 1981 at the third meeting of the Conference of the Parties. This document was prepared by Drs. Charles W. Dane, Richard M. Mitchell, and Bruce MacBryde, Office of Scientific Authority, under the authority of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq. and 87 Stat. 884, as amended). List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 23 Endangered and threatened species, Exports, Fish, Imports, Marine mammals, Plants (agriculture), Transportation, and Treaties. Regulation Promulgation PART 23_ENDANGERED SPECIES CONVENTION Accordingly, for the reasons set out in the preamble of this document, Part 23 of Title 50, Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows: 1. The authority citation for Part 23 continues to read as follows: Authority: Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, 27 U.S.T. 108; and Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq. ).
