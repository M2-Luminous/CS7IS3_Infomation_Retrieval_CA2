FBIS4-46131 "jptot022__l94040" JPRS-TOT-94-022-L JPRS Terrorism FOUO 25 May 1994 NEAR EAST/SOUTH ASIA REGIONAL AFFAIRS IDF Seizes `Terrorist' Leader al-Dirani; Hizballah Reaction IDF Seizes `Terrorist' Leader al-Dirani; Hizballah Reaction News Conference Details Hizballah Reaction NC2505095894 Beirut AL-SAFIR in Arabic 25 May 94 p 2 NC2505095894 Beirut AL-SAFIR Arabic BFN [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Hizballah Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah stressed the need for the "flaccid leadership to stop putting restrictions and limitations on the scope of the work of the resistance, which is a sacred weapon. The scope of the resistance must expand with the expansion of the scope of the aggression." He explained that this does not mean there should be self-security [for Hizballah] or that this will result in chaos but that there should be cooperation and measures that would enable the people to stand on the side of the state. While Nasrallah did not rule out the possibility of an internal breach [of security by a double agent], he said the fate of Israeli navigator Ron Arad is a riddle "we cannot solve." Nasrallah made these remarks at a news conference held at the Hizballah Information Mobilization office in Harat Hurayk [in Beirut's Southern Suburb] yesterday to discuss the kidnapping of Mustafa al-Dirani, one of the leaders of the "Believers' Resistance." The news conference was held amid stringent security measures. Nasrallah opened his news conference by noting that the targeting of one of the symbols of the resistance is an unleashing of the Zionist terrorism that is backed by U.S. equipment and technology and "encouraged by the international collusion manifested in its ugliest form in the way it dealt with the al-Ibrahimi Mosque and the various Zionist enemy attacks on Lebanon and the region." [passage omitted] He warned that the confrontation is no longer restricted to a limited geographic area and that all the Lebanese territories are now vulnerable to Zionist violations and aggression. He said the resistance weapon is sacred wherever it may be and that the scope of resistance can stretch with the expansion of the area of aggression. "Therefore, the relaxed leaders must refrain from laying down restrictions, drawing limits, and specifying the area of resistance activity, because all this is a luxury and theoretical talk that has nothing to do with the reality of the challenge and suffering," he said, emphasizing that enhancing and protecting the resistance in the face of the Israeli profanity is one of the main prerequisites for establishing real national peace in this country. Cautioning that the Gaza Agreement still gives the Zionist enemy an extra footing, Nasrallah called for serious action to thwart it and prepare for a new, massive revival against the Israeli schemes. He maintained that the kidnapping method was a new message with major implications. "It was targeted against the resistance, the homeland, the nation, domestic social peace, and the security of Lebanon and the region. Most probably the goal is far beyond what the enemy has announced regarding the search for information on the seized navigator. It even seeks political objectives within the Zionist entity," Nasrallah said. He stressed that the process of planning, reacting to, and dealing with that incident must be as big as the implications, the risks, and the objectives the enemy has attached to it. Nasrallah concluded by saying: As long as the enemy has opted to expand the scope of confrontation, it must bear the responsibility for that decision, because the resistance fighters' and mujahidin response will come from where they expect and where they do not. Anyway, he said, the battle will be long. Victory will be ours and shame and destruction will be the share of the Zionist occupiers. Nasrallah then answered correspondents' questions. He remarked that "local infiltration is possible" but that the issue "is sheer speculation." He explained that party elements have visited the target area and gathered information from the people. "The picture is taking final shape as far as we are concerned, if it has not already materialized." He pointed out that the area was experiencing storming operations. "We were careful to avoid problems, because our policy is to facilitate the work of the authorities concerned. This atmosphere was used to achieve a better performance in that operation," he said. He revealed that gaps existed, denying the party's responsibility for them. "The Israeli operation could have been costly," he remarked, stressing the need for cooperation with the Lebanese Army and the Syrian forces to block these gaps. Answering a question, Nasrallah said: We demand neither self- imposed nor relaxed security. What we want to say is that there should be cooperation and measures that enable the people to stand by the Lebanese state against any Israeli aggression. The resistance can live with social peace. It is even a prerequisite of that peace. Nasrallah does not expect Israel to achieve what it wants from al-Dirani's kidnapping, because "Ron Arad's" issue has become like a riddle. "We dealt with the issue very seriously because it is part of a process that can help release all POW's and detainees in Israeli jails. Hajj Mustafa cooperated seriously with us. He knows the declared and circulated information on the issue to an extent, after which neither we nor him know anything of the issue. That is why I can swear that the Israelis will reach a dead end with him (Abu-'Ali al-Dirani)." The Hizballah secretary general affirmed that the party has not ruled out a swap. "But we do not know the party holding Arad; we do not even know whether he is being held by a particular party. Besides, Israel rejects any solution involving a swap unless the Israeli navigator is involved in it," he said. He believes that "Arad's" issue might be a mere excuse to target the resistance and its leaders. He expressed surprise that the world is interested in this issue although it ignores hundreds of Lebanese and thousands of Palestinians who are being held in the occupation's prisons.
