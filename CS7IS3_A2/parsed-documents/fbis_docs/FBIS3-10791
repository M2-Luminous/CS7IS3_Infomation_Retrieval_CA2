"The time is ripe for the Clinton administration to propose that Chile join NAFTA and for the U.S. Congress to put the approval of such a proposal on the `fast track' [preceding two words in English]," he stressed. Rebolledo explained that pursuant to U.S. domestic regulations, the executive branch must submit for Congress' approval the names of the countries with which the United States intends to sign a free trade agreement. He moreover stated that both nations might initiate negotiations on this issue during the second half of this year. In any case, the minister-designate -- a PPD [Party for Democracy] deputy at present -- asserted that Chile is deemed the "natural candidate to sign a free trade agreement with the United States." Rebolledo reported that this was one of the main achievements of the recent trip he made to the United States at the invitation of the U.S.-Chilean Chamber of Commerce. Besides his scheduled activities with U.S. businessmen having an interest in Chile, Rebolledo took advantage of his stay in the United States to meet with government officials. [passage omitted] Upon being asked about a possible visit to the United States by Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle once he assumes office as president, Rebolledo noted that in order for the new president to do so, he needs to be officially invited by the U.S. Government first. Notwithstanding this, he said that in view of what he noticed during his contacts with U.S. Government officials, the Clinton administration might "be planning to have the president visit the United States during the course of this year." [passage omitted] Rebolledo further stated that U.S. Vice President Al Gore has proposed holding a hemispheric summit meeting during the second half of this year which would be attended by all the heads of state from the Americas. He remarked that he hopes that Chile will be able to play an important role both in the arrangement and the development of this summmit.
