What is your opinion of 1993? What have we achieved having lived through it? Or, maybe, you think that it will go down in Ukraine's history as a year of lost hopes? [Kravchuk] Well, I would say that this year we did not only have bad affairs. But, unfortunately, good ones were fewer. This is true. Although, to go further and move forward along a more clear-cut course and at a faster rate, it was necessary to live through this time as well. Although, it could have been possible to live through it easier, if so many mistakes of both objective and subjective nature were not allowed to occur. For example, here are some facts. Over the time that has elapsed, though not only this year, Ukraine has withstood such powerful price blows that they are even difficult to imagine. For example, the price for oil and oil products in Ukraine has grown 5,000 times over, not 500, but 5,000 times. Sometimes, I even think on how the economy managed to endure this. I would like to tell you that it is only thanks to our people who are able to work under the most difficult conditions, and to our leaders in industry and agriculture, farmers, those who are already private owners and commercial structures, that we did not collapse altogether and already in 1993, especially its end became, say, the time of even a certain slow-down in production decline. [Word indistinct] I know that figures have a certain meaning when everything is available in the shops, but facts are facts. Well, for example, over the 11 months of last year [1992] the national income decreased by 18 percent. But in January-November of this year [national income decreased] by 13 percent. Certain enterprises, for example, [word indistinct], the Transport Ministry, the State Housing and Communal Economy, corporation Ukrmontazhspetsbud [Ukrainian assembly and special construction], and others achieved volumes of production that exceeded those of last year. Exceeded. The number of electric locomotives, specialized [word indistinct] systems, [word indistinct] equipment, generators, and woodworking machines has grown, in other words, very many other items could be enumerated. Also, something has been done in conversion and saving fuel and energy resources. This was simply a demand of life. Well, I cannot but thank the countryside workers who gathered in 45.6 million tons of grain this year. [Word indistinct] vegetables and fruits more than last year. Milk yields have to increase somewhat. That is to say, something has nevertheless, been done. I would not like us to look at our life with such pessimism, or form it only [word indistinct]. There are grounds to say that something has been done. However, if to assess [word indistinct] on a general scale, I think this year can be referred to as the year of the beginning of a transition toward new forms of economic life. Well, I, for example, would mention only some of these. First, we approved a program of anti-inflation measures. We managed to work out the principles of relations between the state and the agrarian sector. Only recently we discussed this issue at the Coordinating Council and agreed in principle on how to settle debts. This is very important (?as we are responsible) to the farmers who yielded such a rich harvest, and who live in poverty, worse than anyone else. We agreed on how to give more freedom to regions. For example, there was a meeting recently, and I will go through with this affair because I am convinced that they do have possibilities to work better without the direct interference of the center. We managed to agree with Russia and Turkmenistan on the prices and volumes of energy sources, which is principally important for Ukraine. That is to say, certain steps got underway toward, I would say, more active work here based on market and other principles. Therefore, to sum up what I have said, it is already possible to say that our time in 1993 was not wasted. [Correspondent] Leonid Makarovych. All Ukraine had an opportunity to watch our people's deputies working in the session hall. Quite often it happened that there were about 190-200 deputies in the hall. But when it is time to vote, the Narada electronic voting system shows at least 300-320 [word indistinct]. What I have in mind is that some of the deputies vote instead of their colleagues, doing this at a sprinter's speed when it is necessary to vote. They insert their cards by turns and thus adopt relevant documents. But can such documents be considered legal? I mean, for example, the latest events when the deputies imposed [word indistinct] on the president's edicts, in particular, concerning the Blasco-Black Sea Shipping Company. The chosen representatives of the people seem to block the course of the reform deliberately. What is to be done? Who is to blame? [Words indistinct] [Kravchuk] True, from the point of view of law and the Constitution, such decisions, if made with such a gross violation of the rules, are, as a matter of fact, illegal. However, during the past four years the Supreme Council has not adopted permanent rules of its activity. And this is one of such, well, very important gaps, because the rules are the internal law of work. They are the internal constitution. It does not exist. If it does not exist one can act this way, although the temporary rules clearly define the conditions under which the Supreme Council works in a session regime. That is to say, there must be not less than two thirds of the deputies in the hall. However, this electronic display speeds work on the one hand, but, on the other, it gives an opportunity to carry out such manipulations. They are being carried out openly, in public. This is why it could be possible to do it this way: To register at the tables and then vote by a show of hands. This is real. It is possible to appoint a counting commission, for example, and to work. I just do not see any other option. You are correct in saying [words indistinct]. Well, I analyzed this myself and charged my [word indistinct]. I can say frankly that, for example, there are actually no people there on Thursday, especially at the evening session, and on Friday, at the two sittings, but the voting goes on. That is to say, falsification takes place (?in the eyes of) the people. Strictly speaking I am also involved because I sign the laws which are adopted. But is there any way out? For example, it is written in the Constitution that the law, if not signed by me within 10 days, will come into force anyway. Secondly, there is no Constitutional Court where I can appeal and say that I want to consider this or that disputable issue. They blame me for the fact that the Constitutional Court was not elected. I was interested in it most of all, and this is why I had been initiating the election of the Constitutional Court all the time. But it was difficult to elect it, not only because there was a split in assessments by people but, again, because there were no people in the hall. When they were registering themselves at the tables there was no two-thirds majority. I proposed another move when I met the deputies: Let us do as they do it throughout the world, for example, half is to be elected by the president and half is to be elected by you. The Constitutional Court chairman has been elected and let the Constitutional Court decide: If the president's decree is anti-constitutional, the court will say this, if not, the court will also have its say. For example, if the court did exist a veto is imposed. What is to be done next? According to the constitution this veto is to be submitted to the Constitutional Court for assessment. At present, the veto is imposed but who will assess it? Nobody. Therefore, the Supreme Council has no counterbalance that would influence it. For example, there is no law to revoke a deputy. The Constitutional Court is nonexistent. The rules are nonexistent. In general, one can get an impression that the Supreme Council is both the judge and the legislator all together, in one organization, as they say. And the president, for example, has no specific influence. For example, over this period the Supreme Council has already twice given and taken away plenary powers from the president. Should I act correspondingly adequately? There are no regulators, no levers that I have been talking about. This, well, is for example a very dangerous thing. And, if you started to talk about these vetoes, then I understand. I would not like to analyze now whether this veto was imposed correctly or incorrectly. But I would like to say one thing, that this is a purely economic and managerial issue, if we take the issue of the Black Sea shipping company. And I have dozens of telegrams now, very serious telegrams because there are hundreds of ships that sail to all ports. Relevant treaties and agreements with foreign firms have been concluded. And the veto meant that the activities of the shipping company was virtually brought to a halt. One hour spent by a ship, either being unloaded or loaded in a port, costs thousands of dollars. I would like you to know this. And I understand that not everybody knew this. But there were people there who deal with, who know what the sea [word indistinct] is. So, he came out and said: Esteemed people's deputies, this is correct but let us first examine the issue. Let us appoint a commission and then take a decision on veto. But, you know, our Supreme Council is seriously affected by one illness: presidentophobia. If the president submits something, no matter whether it is correct or incorrect, vote it down, because this was submitted by the president. Somebody even told me that they say: If you want this to be turned down, ask Leonid Makarovych to submit it. It will never be adopted. That is to say, the real, the contents are substituted...[sentence incomplete] I do not want to say that this refers to all the deputies. There are some sober-minded, clever deputies. Quite a few political figures came from the Supreme Council and more will come, I am sure. But the situation today is very complicated, extremely complicated and the president cannot protect himself, what is important, he cannot, he has no levers to put the Supreme Council in its place through the Constitutional Court, for example. And the Supreme Council is able to put the president in his place by means of voting. Where are equal rights, I wonder? Both the Supreme Council and the president were elected by the people. But the president has no regulators that could influence the Supreme Council. This is dangerous, simply dangerous, the more so that they vote on their on behalf and on behalf of another person. They can vote for anything and this just evokes my anxiety. [Correspondent] Leonid Makarovych, you probably know better than anybody else that people have gotten tired of price blows, inflation, and impoverishment. What changes in political and economic life of our country do you think can give us hope for the better and realize this hope next year? [Kravchuk] First, I have already told you about the steps which have already been taken. Second, I hope that the people will elect the new Supreme Council; that responsible and well-prepared people, those who take the cause to heart, will be elected; that raging passions and debates will give place to real work; that this Supreme Council will elect the government, appoint a government which will also consist of new people with new thinking, creative and responsible people. They have already come into being in Ukraine over this period. You know, I already observe this process. Someone in the government left, but this in no way means that such a person is incapable of doing anything. There are relevant conditions and situations. In other words, the idea is that people have acquired experience and learned a lot over this time, and I hope we will manage to unite them, to consolidate them under a single idea, a single theme, a single objective. Thus they will be able to work and will be of benefit. I again turn to the fact that in its time the Supreme Council failed to adopt a constitution. You know, they have been working for [word indistinct] years, twice submitted something to the Supreme Council, but nothing [words indistinct]. And there is no hope of it being passed by the Supreme Council. This is why I will make a direct appeal with a legal initiative to the people, bypassing the Supreme Council, to include the law on power on the 27 March referendum, in other words, to provide a constitutional law on power which will determine the system, the forms of the system, state [word indistinct], regional autonomy, thereby determining what Ukraine will be like. For example, I believe we need a parliamentary-presidential system, that the president as head of the state must exercise relevant plenary powers. The government, the prime minister must be head of the executive power and fully responsible for all executive power, for economic policy, for government programs, and for their implementation. The Supreme Council must be a legislative body. That is to say, there must be a delimitation of powers, as is written in our Declaration, but no one abides by this so far. And let the people vote; this will become the basis. It will be easier for the new Supreme Council to adopt all the rest, because, unless this is done now, what can the Supreme Council begin with when it assembles? To work on the basis of the obsolete Constitution which was patched up plenty of times and from which whole chapters were excluded? If you read this Constitution you will find it consists entirely of contradictions. We have to begin with the constitution, but in the meantime laws have to be made. The legislative field is such a difficult one; moreover, it has already been ploughed with government decrees. To some extent it was changed by the president's decrees. If, as sometimes happens, the law differs from the decree, the law may be better than the decree. Which should we lean on? Some say it is better to rely on the decree, others say it is better to rely on the law. So, as you see, there are big problems. I think I will ask people to show understanding and vote for themselves. This is their foremost right, the right of a sovereign people, and when the holder of people's power has made its decision, no one's hand or tongue will be urging people to elect this one immediately, re-elect another one, dismiss someone else, give something to another. Do you see what is happening? For three or four years we, the Supreme Council, have either been giving or taking away, changing or adding. These fundamentals will then be approved by the people and the Supreme Council will work on the basis of this law. This is a political question of principle. If we do this, we will open the way to political and economic reforms and to normal functioning of the Supreme Council. So, if we manage to do this, as I think our people understand, they will know what is soundly based and what is mere foam. If we decide this together, we will make a great step forward. I hope we will do this. [Correspondent] Esteemed Leonid Makarovych, the United Nations declared 1994 the year of the family. Our people know you not only as the head of state, but also as the head of your large, close-knit family, and it was very pleasant to meet your family in the press, magazines, and other publications. What will be your wishes for the Ukrainian family in 1994 and for the families of other nationalities living in our land. What new legislation should we expect in terms of family protection? [Kravchuk] First of all, I am head of state, my wife is head of the family. My hands are so full with state concerns that I am a mere onlooker to what is going on there, and how well it is going, but I do not interfere in the way things are actually done. She supervises it herself, an she seems to be doing a good job. Second, the family is really not just a number of people, be it large or small. It is a source of life, a source where the morals, the nation, and the people are formed. Life is given there, and from there it takes off, develops, and [word indistinct] itself. This would not happen without a family. It is the determining factor. I know the role played by the woman as mother of the family. She gives life, she protects it, and she organizes it. If any man thinks he is the one doing this, he is wrong. If the woman knows her stuff, she will do it in such a way that he will think he did it, but in fact his role is not very big. I can see this in my own family, and in the families of my friends. I can see how cleverly women do this. Third, in conditions like ours, our women are using their (?wisdom), [word indistinct], and skills to solve various problems, concerning food or whatever. We can only thank our women for this. But our family is not just a family circle. Ukraine is a whole family. It is a huge state with a large number of nationalities and peoples, a family of people with different ethnic origins. I would like to take advantage of this question to wish all people living in Ukraine happiness, good fortune, and health. I hope nobody will ever even think of saying anything which could cause tension in relations between people of different ethnic origin. I hope they will all be citizens of our united state, and that they will all be masters of it. To that end, we will do our best in terms of legislation to make sure that no person feels inferior or superior to anybody because of their ethnic background. All are equal, and all will have equal rights and freedoms. I would also like to mention that numerous Ukrainians are living abroad in other states, and that many people of other nationalities are living here. We have been living together in the former Soviet Union, and it is clear that the kind of migration processes still taking place then were a normal fact of life. I would like to wish them health and say that we have lived through a very difficult year, a year laden with doubt, a year of searching. We have been searching within the CIS, there was something we found, there was something we failed to find, but that depended not only on ourselves, I mean not only on Ukraine. The summit in Ashgabat showed how much we have learned in forming and upgrading this structure. It is [word indistinct]. Ukraine will do its best to make it work efficiently and equally for all. As a sovereign state, it requires new principles and new foundations. In the next year we must solve the nuclear problem and everything connected with it, and I think we will succeed in doing this. I hope we will solve the problem of the Black Sea Fleet. There is the will to do this. If there is enough good will in Russia -- and now the United States is getting actively involved in this effort -- it will help us solve many issues. I hope that when all this is put together, all this will guarantee one thing for the family: peace. If you ask, not only a woman or a mother, but any normal person, they will tell you that men always want to look a bit braver than they are, and that leads to pugnacity. Men do have this trait, history knows it. So, even if you ask them what they want most, what they always long for, they will tell you they want peace and quiet in the family, under every roof, within our large state, and in relations with other states. If we have all this -- and I will say sincerely that as long as I am president I will do my utmost to ensure peace in every home, in every house, to prevent bloodshed in our land -- we will manage everything; we will build, restore, and take the democratic and law-governed road of development. This is inevitable, we merely need time. But let us not destroy that which we have, let us not destroy life. We will greatly intensify and take new steps to step up the fight against corruption, crime, and all shameful phenomena now existing. We are not concealing a single fact referred to in the Supreme Council or elsewhere. I have instructed the prosecutor's office to sort this out, and we will show everything to the people -- both facts and analysis. Those guilty will made to bear responsibility, while the innocent will be innocent, and we will not stick labels on them, will not insult them or brand them as criminals before the verdict of a prosecutor or a court. (?Do not think that because) you happen to be a people's deputy you can get away with it. I think we will get over all these diseases in a way worthy of our people who are patient, wise, peaceful, and closely bound, and will do their best to keep it that way. As for families, I wish them good fortune, health, and happiness, health to children and grandchildren. I have children and grandchildren myself and I know how important this is -- when I hear that my daughter or my grandson is sick, I cannot put it out of my mind even with the strenuous and difficult job I have. Whenever I have a free minute I run to the phone to find out how they are, whether their fever is high or not. That's me, with my workload. What about other people? Actually the workload has nothing to do with it, it is a normal thing for a person to want a clearly determined future, to want its family to go on and, as they say, to wish that our family will never become extinct. I also wish you well, as a woman who has her own family and wants her family to be healthy, and all those guarding our family. As for the legislation, it will improve.
