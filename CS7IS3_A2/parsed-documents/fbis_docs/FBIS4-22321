DELOVOY MIR columnist Valentin Khalin talks with him. I did not ask him how he has the time to cope with his roles. I did not ask because at the very beginning Viktor Vladimirovich noted casually: "I work 12 to 14 hours a day." A person of bubbling energy, he literally compresses time even further in the process. We met together on a Sunday and spent about 4 hours, including a trip to the VDNKh (VVTs) [Exhibition of Achievements of the National Economy], where we viewed the farmstead exhibit, ate a quick cold lunch--bread, sausage, and coffee. Though most of the business people I have had occasion to meet have roughly the same mentality and do not take the trouble to separate day from night. I was struck by something else. We had arranged to discuss problems in the development of free enterprise, but my interlocutor began speaking about... space. "A national strategic objective can help Russia out of the chaos into which it has been plunged," he said. "Let us recall how the instigators of World War II were revitalized after the war. Germany counted on foreign loans and advanced technologies, Italy did practically the same thing, and Japan went into the fields of electronics and automotive manufacturing. The USSR lost "the cold war" and collapsed. For the world of today, this geopolitical cataclysm is like the fall of the Roman Empire was for the ancient world. Then the people were plunged into the dismal Middle Ages for a long time. But today, Russia has retained a powerful reserve for a rapid revival. It has been and remains a great space power. And this invaluable potential must be utilized for all it is worth, as they say. Because it is the way to the future. Sooner or later harmful products and radioactive waste will be carried outside the limits of the atmosphere and energy will have to be obtained from new sources in the space near earth. Is it a coincidence that not only the United States, Russia, and the European countries, but China, India, and Japan have turned their attention to space? In this rush by all of mankind, Russia is among the first, and it has produced a valuable commodity. So why shouldn't we take advantage of it? We can and must receive sizable investments to go into space. Then the most advanced technologies will be required, the flywheel of the former VPK [military industrial complex] will begin rotating in the direction needed, plans will be revitalized, young persons will once again exert themselves in fiztekh, the Bauman, and the MGU [physicotechnical and Bauman educational institutions and the Moscow State University], and the brain drain will cease. "Back in July 1988, some persons who shared my ideas and I formed the `Zemlyane' Business Cooperation Association, whose members are associations with a nonstate form of ownership. The economic development of space is a priority for us. We are looking for promising aerospace projects for capital investment. Twice a year--in April and October--we hold international conferences in which scientists take part and we publish collections of materials. These are still just the first steps, of course. Many generations of our descendants will be faced with tasks that are colossal in scope. But this is an objective, tangible strategic purpose, clear and attractive to each and every person, not some kind of mythical communism and sausage for everyone. Although you will see the people rallying together in the right way on the way into space, loving each other, and providing themselves with their daily bread in a friendly manner." [Khalin] You speak about private capital investment in space programs, Viktor Vladimirovich. But what about state and other forms of ownership? Is there really no place for them under the sun? [Shchekochikhin] Of course, why not? But they are very sluggish. The past 70 years of our history have clearly demonstrated that you will not overtake civilization by the roadside. There is no reason to invent the bicycle. I am convinced that the future lies with private ownership. What is good about 30 members of a cooperative, for example, arguing until they are hoarse and laboring in vain to determine the best way for them to enter the market? But a competent decision will have to be made in a short amount of time concerning the investment or transfer of capital, let us say. So it turns out that the private entrepreneur is always ahead, and pays his employees--and pays them well!--for a business gain instead of a dispute about words. I was trained as an accountant and I worked as an auditor in different sectors. I often traveled throughout the former Soviet Union and realized long ago that only personal interest within a legal framework is capable of moving the economy, science, and culture ahead on progressive paths. My path in business began when I opened one of Moscow's first consultation bureaus in the field of economic law and finance. Two weeks after the law on cooperatives was approved I registered a cooperative--actually with the functions of a bank, which began providing insurance, clearing and credit, and financial services. I opened training classes for accountants and cooperative chairmen. When I began accumulating capital, I saw for myself that it is impossible to realize economic plans outside of the market infrastructure, without reliable partners, a strong legal foundation, and a calm if not respectful attitude toward free enterprise and private property in the mass consciousness. I do not intend to take capital abroad; on the contrary, I am actively trying to create an environment as favorable as possible for free enterprise, for foreign investments in domestic programs, and for the enlightenment of minds. I am attending the Diplomatic Academy myself, gnawing on the granite of post-Marxist science about the society we were guarded against for decades, and it has moved farther and farther ahead. Now this is what I have come up with. I think I have been on the right path. The letters also convince me of this. Once I received a letter from 15-year-olds in the Far East: teach us the right way to make money competently, they said, so that we can become rich people and compete with the Americans. I received a similar request from mature persons in Western Ukraine who wondered why they spent the best years of their lives working hard on the century's construction projects. They think they have enough strength to scrape together some capital over the next 10 years or so and pass it on to their grandchildren to give them starting opportunities. Do you sense the mood? People are fed up with living in a country without rich people. And I agree with them. I want to see Russia without poor people. I am sometimnes called a private property fanatic. This is not the case at all. State enterprises, sovkhozes, or kolkhozes do not have to be broken up. Under conditions of market relationships, private capital should simply occupy its proper place in the economy. But for a start, taking into account our traditions of leveling and parasitism, it must be provided for, including through legislation, by giving priority to opportunities for its buildup. Only then will there be a truly competitive environment--the ferment of a country's progressive development. Only then will there be genuine democracy. The owner (it does not matter what he owns--capital, a creative gift, or a profession) is economically free. He will never be suited by a ration, unlike those whose payment depends entirely on the arbitrariness of the state and its officials. An energetic person will always find an energetic employer. And they will not be serving an abstract state interest, but shaping a state which is capable of looking out for the interests of its citizen-owners. In my view, this is what democracy is all about. [Khalin] As I understand it, you are building a bridge from the national idea of space development to the creation of a state with a market economy and prosperous owners. How can this be achieved and in what period of time, in your view? [Shchekochikhin] Not in 30 or 40 years, as the skeptics are promising, but much sooner. In order to consolidate market relationships we need two things--private ownership and a competitive environment. There is only one way to achieve this--through parliament. As owners, we want and should be represented in a legislative organ. We are prepared to join a bloc with parties which really stand up for the rights of entrepreneurs and common human values. I think we will find understanding both in the State Duma and among the people, and together we will work out and adopt a normative foundation for a legal democratic state. The people are tired of the shocks and the futile political brawling, and they yearn for clarity and stability. I am convinced that the healthy, productive forces of our society are capable of offering a clear-cut program to get out of the crisis and awaken Russians' creative spirit. We were not born yesterday! If other states have been able to raise themselves from the ruins to the heights of prosperity, God himself has told us to dare. Our resources--both natural and human resources--are inexhaustible. We need only to get organized, unfetter initiative, and move from populist games to actual reform of the economy. [Khalin] But what do you mean by "a clear-cut program?" [Shchekochikhin] First of all, we need a package of laws on private property: it is sacred and inviolable. Only then will it be possible to stop official arbitrariness and all kinds of social experiments--first given, then taken away, either forgotten or lost. Separately, laws on the priority of domestic private enterprise and the right to own, buy and sell land... [Khalin] Excuse me, but the mass media from government circles are advertising the successes of privatization. At the end of last year, the president's edict "On Regulating Land Relationships and the Development of Agrarian Reform in Russia" was published. Isn't this really a solution of the problem? [Shchekochikhin] I will answer the question with another question. Simply put, for ordinary people to understand. Vanya is lying on a sofa with a share of stock in his pocket. He has not tasted the competitive struggle, and he has not burned his fingers in bankruptcy. He will be receiving dividends without risking anything except his voucher. Well, what kind of owner is he? As before, he is relying on the collective reasoning of some other person. And that person is a member of the nomenklatura--he has not raised a finger, either. Both of them seem to be relying on each other, but both of them would not object to cheating each other. Vanya has been working listlessly, and he is counting on this in the future as well; the bureaucrat could not care less--as before, he is closer to the feeding trough. It does not smell of reform here, either. There is still no owner of capital, no person with work skills--no competition, no ownership, and hence, no market. As far as the land edict is concerned, it does not have direct action; it only declares private ownership of land and contains references to the legislation in force, which does not reflect the questions of buying and selling. In the meantime, land is not being put into private ownership, but leased or inherited for use during one's lifetime. It may be terminated not with the death of an owner, but much sooner: under the new edict the land becomes the object of auction bidding. The farmer who has invested millions of rubles and years of work in his plot risks being deprived of it right away. It may be taken away by the heads of administrations under the pretext that it has been utilized poorly. That is, a wide sluice has been opened for official arbitrariness. This is a deeply personal question for me: I invested a great deal of money in land. I have several thousand hectares in the suburban Moscow area and near Ryazan. Last fall I harvested a good barley crop. With what I received from its sale I bought two tractors and two combines, thereby providing new equipment for future agricultural operations. I recently acquired deserted farms on a sovkhoz--I will be raising bulls. There is an arrangement with a Spanish firm to form an SP [joint venture] to process livestock products. [Khalin] Do you consider yourself a rich man? [Shchekochikhin] There are different kinds of wealth. I want to enjoy all the advantages of land, of course. But for me this is not an end in itself. I do not store up money in a box or go on a spree. I am fascinated by the process of enterprise itself, and I want my money to work for me. Those who formerly were engaged in illegal economic activity, those who grabbed state property in the course of privatization, and those who receive superprofits without any preparation boast about their wealth. These people have not smelled the market or earned every kopeck through bitter experience. They obtained their wealth easily and they lose it easily--on binges, possessions, and in the casino. They corrupt society and their environment, mistreat less fortunate citizens, and disparage the importance of true entrepreneurs, who are increasing capital not for the sake of luxury, but by vocation as production organizers and those who create what is new and advanced. There have been forerunners of the latter in Russian history--Tretyakov, Mamontov, Morozov, and Sytin. Generally speaking, I distinguish between three varieties in enterprise: the nomenklatura variety, that is, the enterprise that is "seized for privatization," the state enterprise, personified by the corps of directors; and finally, our private enterprise, when a person has struggled through all the obstacles with his own brain and has achieved his status by hard work. To us, the first two groups exist as partners which have to be forced out in the course of the competitive struggle. There are few of us at present. As an example, the "Goryachev" Concern in St. Petersburg, which manufactures and repairs pianos. At Ramenskoye, in the suburbs of Moscow, the builder Guskov is well-known... In a word, there are about 5,000 legal entities in our union. In general, the entrepreneurial class in every nation under market conditions makes up no more than 3 to 5 percent of the population. We are far removed from this indicator, of course. But there is a time for everyone. And we will reach our heights, too. [Khalin] Well, all right, one way or another, but you are wealthy and I am not. How does this correlate with your thesis on a Russia without poor people? [Shchekochikhin] The number of poor will be reduced in proportion to the increase in the number of wealthy persons. Well-to-do persons will need hundreds and thousands of skilled workers, engineers, lawyers, and so forth, including artists and journalists. Each one of them salaried in accordance with his services. If you do not want to stand in need, demonstrate the quality of your work. After all, everything is competitive here as well. Perhaps to a certain extent it is accidental or good luck. But this is life. This is what the West is based on. And it does not seem to be especially poor. As far as the sick and the aged are concerned, the state will take care of them if we are meticulous about paying our taxes. And every state is rich with the wealth of its citizens. The more wealthy people there are, the wealthier the budget. Charity cannot be disregarded, either. [Khalin] So we are standing at the gates of paradise? [Shchekochikhin] Paradise will never come if we wait passively for manna from Heaven. If you want to live, know how to spin around. This probably sounds a little crude, but it is 100-percent true about everything. We ourselves are the only ones who will protect our interests.
