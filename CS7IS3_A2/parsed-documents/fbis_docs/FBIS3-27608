Recently, Jinan labor market in the capital city of Fuzhou, the largest labour market in Fujian, celebrated its success in finding the 10,000th job since 1992. Sample statistics show that there are now more than 300 job-finding agencies in the province, which have found jobs for more than a million people. In contrast, job-finding agencies were unknown in China before it initiated its market economic reform in the early 1980s. People were then allocated jobs instead of finding them and had little freedom of choice. The year 1988 saw the establishment of the Fujian Company of Talent Development and Service of the provincial personnel bureau, the first job-finding agency in the province. Over the past five years, it has found jobs for thousands of job seekers, including returned students from overseas. The majority of the job-finding agencies are sponsored by labor departments. By June 1993 some 255 such agencies had been so sponsored. The markets play an important role in the distribution of labor resources. The job seekers in the markets have to show their I.D. cards and other relevant certificates and the markets have a list of employers and job-seekers, to match them up. The agency is paid both by the employer and the job-seeker. In the second half of last year, the provincial government decided to give greater support to non-governmental bodies and individuals in opening job-finding agencies. The decision gave a boost to the prosperous service. in quanzhou, a coastal city where the non-state-run economy dominates, 93 job-finding agencies had been set up by the end of last year. At present, nearly a million laborers needed by the foreign-funded, township and private-run enterprises in the city come mainly from the labor markets.
