This is the second equal part of a credit that was approved Oct. 22, 1993. Under the systematic transformation facility, assistance is provided to post-communist countries encountering balance of payments problems that mainly appear when a country stops using government-controlled prices in trade. Lithuanian Finance Ministry officials said the first part of the credit was used for investment projects and energy needs. Lithuania joined the IMF in April 1992 and has already received around 123 million dollars from it. A number of political forces in Lithuania criticize the government for the country's increasing external debt, but Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius rejects all criticism saying the per capita debt is quite small and that the Lithuanian economy cannot be rebuilt without foreign loans. The IMF approved its first USD 77.6 million loan to Lithuania in the fall of 1992. The loan was given for six years and was used to stabilize Lithuania's national currency. Peter Cornelius, IMF representative in Lithuania, said Lithuania has already used up possibilities to receive loans under the systematic transformation facility. There is also a 28-million dollar stand-by credit that Lithuania may receive if it successfully carries out its current economic policy memorandum. Cornelius said all the necessary information about the first quarter of this year should be available by mid-April and Lithuania can expect the first quarter of the 28 million in mid-May. In its press release, the IMF said Lithuania aims at keeping its financial deficit below one percent of the GDP, in part by adopting an 18-percent value-added tax that comes into effect May 1. The fund said the establishment of a currency board is expected to help curb inflation, cut interest rates and to carry out a strict fiscal policy. The IMF loan supposedly served as one of the principal arguments for adopting the litas reliability law that provides for the establishement of a currency board and pegging the litas to a foreign currency. The law came into effect April 1. Discussing the economic situation in Lithuania, the IMF said privatization, which has already covered around half of all large and small enterprises, has been proceeding smoothly. According to the press release, the government seeks to accelerate the process of privatization by removing all preferential treatment for employees and managers in the privatization process, and by lifting restrictions on share ownership in agricultural processing enterprises. The report said the bankruptcy law is in force, although a clear bankruptcy procedure is still absent. Discussing trade, the IMF said the Lithuanian Government now plans to introduce a uniform 10-percent import tariff. As regards efforts to soften the effect of economic reforms on social life, the IMF said the Lithuanian Government intends to carry out a broad package of pension reforms on Jan. 1,1995, including an increase in the retirement age. The IMF said signs that the private sector in Lithuanian flourishes "give grounds for cautious optimism that the recovery is underway in Lithuania. The recovery remains fragile, however, and the authorities must be vigilant in their efforts to foster a stable and predictable environment for economic activity if growth is to be sustained."
