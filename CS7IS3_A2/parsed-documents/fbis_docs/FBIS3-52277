The Fatah Hawks held a procession in the al-Shati' refugee camp and fired weapons in the air. Earlier, Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] issued its own congratulations to Fatah. [Begin recording] [Eldar] For the first time since the establishment of Fatah in the Gaza Strip 29 years ago, the organization's anniversary celebrations are designed to prove its strength and size. This is the first time that the organization is celebrating as a future establishment body and not as an underground movement. Nevertheless, the festivities are taking place under the shadow of a crisis. Fatah is finding it difficult to make the transformation from an underground terrorist organization to a body that is recognized as the legitimate authority in the Palestinian autonomy. The struggles at the top are greatly undermining Fatah's activity in the Palestinian street. Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, the former head of the Palestinian delegation, who is considered an opponent of the Declaration of Principles, said that anyone wanting to celebrate today, still had some waiting to do. [passage omitted] Isma'il Haniyah, a returned Hamas deportee, was among the well wishers in the crowd. He came to congratulate Fatah on behalf of Hamas and to express solidarity. Fatah, Haniyah said, was the first to fire the guns of the struggle. People in the audience noted that Haniyah's participation was an indication of the desire by Hamas to be integrated in the autonomy's founding institutions. Tomorrow afternoon, Gaza city will host the main rally, in which approximately 20,000 people are expected to take part. This will hopefully prove that the Fatah is still in control of the Gaza Strip.
