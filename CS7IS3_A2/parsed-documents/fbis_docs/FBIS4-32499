In its headquarters on Sancova Street, he works in an office he inherited. With its customary modern furnishings, it would probably give the impression of being run-of-the-mill and most of all impersonal, if it were not for the small penguin sitting on one of the black cabinets. This creature, which moves so awkwardly on the ground, is exceptionally nimble in water. Will the reinvented DS maneuver as nimbly in the political waters as its mascot? [Hagyari] I believe so, but our mascot represents, above all, a gentleman. Gentlemen, not boxers, should go into politics. The penguin is a decent, unaggressive creature, capable of overcoming extremely difficult conditions with extreme ease. [Lenicka] On the same floor, just a few steps from where you are, is the editorial office of the weekly journal MOSTY [Bridges]. Don't you think we are unnecessarily burning those bridges that still connect us with the Czech Republic? [Hagyari] That is why our foreign policy follows the Czech foreign policy. It is out of the question that we could join West Europe without the Czechs, but the Czechs can join even without us. [Lenicka] Isn't a tactical election move hiding behind your parcel of concrete initiatives for closer cooperation with that republic? [Hagyari] Certainly it is a tactical election move. I do not do anything without a reason. [Lenicka] But the Czech side reacted neurotically not only to your initiatives, but also to the installation of Moravcik's government, being concerned whether, along with it, goes a renewed pro-Czechoslovak sentiment or an attempt to establish a confederation.... [Hagyari] No, I do not see any reason that anyone should feel uneasy about it, and I do not have any information about anything like that. Only Mr. Klaus reacted to it that way. The Czech Government, as far as I know, did not take a position on it. Our proposals for improving cooperation will benefit all Slovak citizens. In the political area, for example, we want to give the citizens of the other state the very same rights our citizens have. For example, the right to vote at the municipal level, with the exception of parliamentary elections and military service. This is common in West Europe. In the area of education, we want our people to have the possibility to study in the Czech Republic and vice versa, and to be compensated for it by the individual governments. As far as cultural matters are concerned, we could consider, among other things, a joint television program or a joint radio broadcast, which would certainly help to maintain good relations with the Czech Republic. [Lenicka] We cannot concede that Slovakia is a near abroad--similar discomfitted reactions all the way to flat rejections were heard mostly from the Civic Democratic Party [ODS] politicians, with whom you cooperate closely. Most recently with the Civic Democratic Alliance [ODA], which won seats only in the Czech National Council [CNR], and that, too, thanks to the "Slovak matter" is not too "favorably inclined" toward us.... [Hagyari] I do not think I agree with you. Mr. Kalvoda asked the Slovak side several times just to say clearly what it wants--federation, confederation, or independent states. Nothing else. When I talked with him unofficially at the ODA congress, he welcomed our initiative. He said that, as soon as he gets to the government level, he will personally support it. Similarly Mr. Dlouhy. I admit that I did not talk about it with Mr. Klaus. The realization of this plan requires that both governments be compatible. After all, only in the Czech Republic is there a civic right-wing government, whereas in Slovakia the national left was in the government. [Lenicka] You consider the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] the national left? Are you not worried about the prediction of the chairman of the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] that the Slovak right will not grow out of Hagyari's DS but from the vulgar, populist HZDS? [Hagyari] We shall see after the elections. I respect comrade Weiss as a man who placed himself at the head of a party that had 800,000 members. It is easier for him to build from something, and when, for 40 years, he was an administrator here. It is another thing to build a civic right wing. I am surprised that Mrs. Schmognerova is following rightist, so-called antisocial politics.... [Lenicka] Are you saying that rightist politics are antisocial? [Hagyari] What is one to call what they are doing? They defend the interests of the workers, and they say about us that we are antisocial. And all of a sudden, Mrs. Schmognerova is more rightist than Ivan Miklos or Dzurinda. [Lenicka] In what way is she more rightist? [Hagyari] Note the cuts in social programs that she is making in an effort to keep as many resources as possible for the state budget! [Lenicka] If you were in her place, could you afford not to make cuts, given the kind of shortfall that exists in the state budget today? [Hagyari] No, we embrace that policy. We maintain that we can spend on social programs only when we can afford it. [Lenicka] You also assert that the difference between the left and the right is that the left distributes and the right contributes. Isn't this too cheap a shot? Don't you think that, when the SDL insists on implementing certain unpopular measures, without which the revival of the economy would be unthinkable, that it does so precisely for the benefit of the working people? That a postponement of these steps would be antipeople? [Hagyari] I agree that no other solution exists. We evaluate the course of action of this government positively, in spite of the fact that, from the politico-logical standpoint, the government is more to the left. [Lenicka] L. Kovac, the former minister of education in the first post-November government, therefore from circles close to you, came to the conclusion during the polemic touched off by J. Carnogusky's strict rejection of liberalism that Slovak conservatism has always been reactionary. Reactionary in the sense that it solved problems with delays measured in tens, sometimes even hundreds, of years.... Will you reverse this trend? How will you convince the citizens that, as a conservative party, you are offering a modern program? [Hagyari] There is a great difference between us and the Christian Democratic Movement [KDH]. Especially in the fact that, while it addresses itself to Christian-oriented people, we are for everybody--without regard to sex, age, education, or religious affiliation. The greatest difference between us is the fact that our stance on abortion is definitely more liberal. In contrast to the KDH, which, as is known, calls for strict prohibition of abortions, we think that a woman must make her own decision. Another difference between us and the KDH is the way we view the Slovak State of 1939-45. In our opinion, it was a satellite of fascist Germany, and one has to take a stance on history accordingly. As far as parties are concerned, we are closest to the ODS or ODA. [Lenicka] But there are more sticking points in the dialogue between the Slovak secular and religious right. If one could have said until recently that it was the KDH that was impeding this dialogue, now the situation appears to be turning around. As if you were the ones impeding it. [Hagyari] Who told you that? [Lenicka] Press that is favorably inclined toward you. I even read there that the only problem that prevents the creation of a clearly defined and unified right-wing bloc is Hagyari's DS. [Hagyari] That is an interesting opinion, but it is not based on any realistic premises. I do not know of any politician on the Slovak political scene who is more pragmatic than I. In the year and a half that I have been in politics, we succeeded in uniting, under my leadership, six right-of-center political entities. My politics are realistic and pragmatic; I am ready to meet others halfway. I was the one who a year ago said that we must create a large right-of-center bloc. That would ensure that every voter would find his own leader and his own party, and that not even one right-wing vote would be wasted. In this respect, one can only take one's hat off to the left-wing parties, which so quickly and without any problems came to an agreement. A sane mind would say that we can do likewise on the right. So far, that has not happened, but I firmly believe that somehow things will be settled and we shall find a common language. [Lenicka] But the Cernak people do not hide their antagonism toward your profederation orientation. The Moravcik people's ambition is to get into the parliament on their own, similarly Randa's party of small businessmen. Obviously, it will not be possible to create even a counterbalance to the religious right--the KDH, let alone a unified right-wing bloc. [Hagyari] There are a number of possibilities. We can also accept the KDH offer to put our top people who are running for office on their slate of candidates, but that carries certain risks. In the sense that not everybody will be ready to accept I. Miklos and me on that slate as long as they harbor, for whatever reason, a certain distrust of the KDH and distance themselves from it. From opinion polls, we know that the majority of our sympathizers do not want to accept the KDH. And it really is questionable whether they would accept having us on their slate of candidates. There is still the possibility of creating a bloc of civic-oriented right-wing parties if the KDH goes into the elections on its own. It there is no other possibility and the executive council comes to the conclusion that our presence on the KDH ticket will be the best way, we will act accordingly. We think that there is not that much difference in voter preference for us and for the KDH that we need to accept the KDH proposal immediately. [Lenicka] But you still have not crossed the mandatory 5-percent threshold. Your risk is greater. When will you make a definitive decision? [Hagyrai] It depends on the offer of the KDH, which is still very unspecific. It did not tell us whether it is offering us five of 10 slots, for which positions, etc. That is one thing. It depends on our executive council, which will meet on the penultimate Saturday in May. I assure you that I will do all I can to see to it that not even one vote is wasted. [Lenicka] Do you make so bold as to convince voters in case you will be courting them on your own? [Hagyari] That is a premature question. That will depend on what the voter preferences are in May and June. We want to demand more television time so we can address at least the 10 percent of sympathizers whom we united. [Lenicka] Do you consider the fusion of the KDS and the DS into the DS the final stop? [Hagyari] No, I maintain that life will always find the best way, that it will reject anything that is artificial, unnatural. [Lenicka] You decided on the old, tried-and-true logo. However, ingrained in the mind of our public is the DS, with its "sunflower effect." Moreover, in the leadership of the party are people who are too closely connected with Public Against Violence [VPN], transformed into the Civic Democratic Union [ODU], which perished because it was held in disfavor even by voters with rightist views. Don't you think that certain psychological barriers will again play a role? [Hagyari] I do not know what barriers you have in mind because Ivan Miklos is an economist par excellence. Today's DS is not the DS that was marked by the sunflower effect. We have a clear program of conservative democrats who place a clear emphasis on economic reform, and we are oriented toward the European Democratic Union [EDU]. We have completed our party structures. We want to convince Slovakia--and do not be offended now--that it is rightist, even though in the last election it voted for the left. [Lenicka] For the time being, Slovakia is not like that. Why, in your opinion, does it not believe in rightist values? [Hagyari] It is a matter of personalities. [Lenicka] Are you saying that the right has too few personalities? [Hagyari] Yes. In addition, it is unable to convince the citizens. It is not the nation that is dumb and bad but the politician who does not manage to address it. How we can address it is another matter. We can go from door to door, which we are doing, but the media are decisive. As long as television does not give me enough time so that I can express my views in comparison to others and have the citizen choose, I can hardly become a personality. The media, and especially television, can make a personality into a zero or a zero into a personality. We often appear in private, local media, but, unfortunately, television is providing us with too little time. We consider it discrimination against the civic right wing in Slovakia. And it would be a good thing if Slovakia had a balanced political scene, which so far is overwhelmingly left-wing. We see that the KDH, with all due respect to the KDH and the 70 percent of Catholics, speaks only to one-tenth of them. [Lenicka] ODU and the original DS left a debt of more than 2.5 million korunas. Are you going to settle it? [Hagyari] I was never a member of ODU. [Lenicka] But many of its people are members of your party. [Hagyari] Ask Langos or Porubak about that.... [Lenicka] Not your deputy chairman at the time, Ivan Miklos? He was not in ODU? [Hagyari] He was, but I do not think he was the chairman.... We assumed the debt left by the old DS, and we are paying it off. I see no reason to have anyone suffer a loss on anyone's account. [[Lenicka] Are you planning to borrow money for these elections? Do you think there should be a limit on the amount spent on campaigning? [Hagyari] I will not borrow money. Limits are unnecessary because there are many ways to get around such a law. A law that has loopholes is useless. [Lenicka] You already used one superlative--sense for pragmatism--to praise yourself. Are there others? And what about the weak points? [Hagyari] I will not tell you about the weak points. I am exactly the way the citizens of Slovakia are. I am not any smarter, nor am I any dumber. I know exactly what bothers them. I am no demigod, even if I think we have a program to solve Slovakia's problems. [Lenicka] You went into politics only recently. To do that, you left a lucrative job--adviser on legal matters. Why? [Hagyari] Yes, I gave up my work as a lawyer. It is because everything I do I want to do well. I decided to give all of my energy to returning the civic right to the parliament and eventually to the government. Unfortunately, politics does not have logic. You cannot always persuade people by logical arguments. Since the 1992 elections, people have become much worse off--there are no medicines, physicians receive minimum wages, one must pay for schoolbooks in the schools, tuition will be charged in institutions of higher learning, lunch programs will be canceled.... When we realize that inflation is at 30 percent but pensions rose by only 6 percent, that privatization was halted and when it was resumed it changed into a giveaway to loyal subjects, etc., etc., therefore, when you look at any area, the situation has deteriorated, and, in spite of that, a certain movement's popularity is on the rise. I found out after being in politics for several months that politics has no logic. Few people can imagine what terribly hard work it is to build a party with a solid structure, clear objectives, and orientation.
