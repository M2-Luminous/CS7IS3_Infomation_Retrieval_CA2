Emerging from a staff meeting presided over by Chairman Kim Chong-pil, Party Spokesman Ha Sun-pong issued a statment rebuking the U.S. State Department statement. Noting that the National Security Law's abolition has been one of North Korea's consistent demands, Ha said the question of repealing this law must be dealt with carefully because North Korea has not yet guaranteed the transparency of its nuclear program and because the North's military threat still exists. Chairman Kim said, "I don't think Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Hubbard made such remarks with any knowledge about North Korean laws... I can't understand why he raised such a sensitive issue at this point of time." Secretary-General Mun Chong-su called Hubbard's remarks "an intervention of domestic affairs" and criticized the opposition party for its support of the comments. Chief Policy-maker Yi Se-ki supported Mun, saying the opposition party should take a stand against such remarks.
