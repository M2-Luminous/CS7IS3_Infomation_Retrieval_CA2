FR940406-0-00143 FR940406-0-00011 28. A new §86.098&hyph;28 is added to subpart A to read as follows: §86.098&hyph;28 Compliance with emission standards. Section 86.098&hyph;28 includes text that specifies requirements that differ from §86.094&hyph;28. Where a paragraph in §86.094&hyph;28 is identical and applicable to §86.098&hyph;28, this may be indicated by specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. For guidance see §86.094&hyph;28.'' (a)(1) Paragraph (a) of this section applies to light-duty vehicles. (2) Each exhaust, evaporative and refueling emission standard (and family particulate emission limits, as appropriate) of §86.098&hyph;8 applies to the emissions of vehicles for the appropriate useful life as defined in §§86.098&hyph;2 and 86.098&hyph;8. (3) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.094&hyph;28. (4) The procedure for determining compliance of a new motor vehicle with exhaust, evaporative and/or refueling emission standards (or family particulate emission limit, as appropriate) is as described in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) introductory text, (a)(4)(i)(C), (a)(4)(ii)(B) and (C), (a)(4)(iii), (a)(4)(v), (f) and (g) of this section and §86.094&hyph;28 (a)(4)(i)(A) and (B), (a)(4)(ii)(A), (a)(4)(iv)) except where specified by paragraph (a)(7) of this section for the Production AMA Durability Program. (i) Separate emission deterioration factors shall be determined from the exhaust emission results of the durability-data vehicle(s) for each engine-system combination. Separate evaporative and/or refueling emission deterioration factors shall be determined for each evaporative/refueling emission family-emission control system combination from the testing conducted by the manufacturer (gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled vehicles only). Separate refueling emission deterioration factors shall be determined for each evaporative/refueling emission family-emission control system combination from the testing conducted by the manufacturer (petroleum-fueled diesel cycle vehicles not certified under the provisions of paragraph (g) of this section only). (a)(4)(i)(A) and (a)(4)(i)(B) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.094&hyph;28. (a)(4)(i)(C) Evaporative deterioration factor determination. An evaporative emissions deterioration factor (gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled vehicles only) shall be determined from the testing conducted as described in Section 86.094&hyph;21(b)(4) (i) (A), and in accordance with paragraphs (a)(4)(i)(C) ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of this section, for each evaporative/refueling emission family-emission control system combination to indicate the evaporative emission level at the applicable useful life relative to the evaporative emission level at 4,000 miles as follows: ( 1 ) Factor = Evaporative emission level at the useful life mileage for that standard minus the evaporative emission level at 4,000 miles. ( 2 ) The factor shall be established to a minimum of two places to the right of the decimal. (D) A refueling emissions deterioration factor (gasoline-fueled, methanol-fueled and petroleum-fueled diesel-cycle vehicles not certified under the provisions of paragraph (g) of this section) shall be determined from testing conducted and described in §86.098&hyph;21(b)(4)(i)(B) for each evaporative/refueling emission family-emission control system combinationto indicate the refueling emission level at the applicable usefule life relative to the refueling emission level at 4,000 miles as follows: ( 1 ) Factor = Refueling emission level at the useful life mileage for that standard minus the refueling emission level at 4,000 miles.
