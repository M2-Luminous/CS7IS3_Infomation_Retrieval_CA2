In the aftermath of the massacre at Hebron's al-Ibrahimi Mosque, most of the occupied territories were for a time under extended curfews; this resulted in a sharp drop in economic activity and considerable disruption to regular essential food supplies. To alleviate this situation, UNRWA [United Nations Relief and Works Agency] carried out an urgent distribution of food rations to some 75,000 families in the West Bank and 95,000 in the Gaza Strip. The present allocation of the European Commission will pay, through ECHO [European Community Humanitarian Office], for a further 8,500 tonnes of flour for distribution by UNRWA to respond to the current needs of this emergency situation in the occupied territories.
