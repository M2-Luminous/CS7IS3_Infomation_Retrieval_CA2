Otherwise we would have had a Yugoslavian version here after the collapse of the Soviet Union. History shows that such apprehensions are grounded," Uzbek President Islam Karimov told a joint press conference here, devoted to the results of French President Francois Mitterrand's state visit to Uzbekistan. Replying to an ITAR-TASS question, the Uzbek leader noted that he believed the future of the CIS lay in economic integration, including the formation of inter-state transcontinental corporations, which could unite Russian and Uzbek enterprises in joint-stock societies. "We believe that the future of the CIS depends precisely on the formation of such associations, uniting the enterprises of Russia, Uzbekistan, and other republics. It will be even better if such associations are created not on a bilateral, but on a multilateral basis," Karimov stressed. Asked by ITAR-TASS to comment on the idea of the Euro-Asian union, recently voiced by Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, Karimov said: "Much is left unsaid when the term Euro-Asian is used. If this implies a single parliament, single suprastate structures and even a single citizenship and a single constitution, it means the restoration of the old union, no matter how it is called. I am vehemently opposed to any comeback of the past. It is not for this that we have achieved sovereignty and are now engaged in national revival. There is no return to the past. History moves only ahead." "To put it in a nutshell," Karimov stated, "the Euro-Asian idea smacks very much of populism, no matter who voices it."
