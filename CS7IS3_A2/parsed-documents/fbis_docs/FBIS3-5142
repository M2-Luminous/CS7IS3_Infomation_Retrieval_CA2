"The Trend of North Korean Economy for the Second Half of 1993," released by the National Unification Board [NUB] on 28 February revealed that agricultural production in North Korea showed a 15 to 20 percent decrease from the previous year due to damage by cold weather; and the mining and construction industries maintained only the production level of the previous year due to supply shortages of energy and raw materials. Cho Kon-sik, an intelligence analysis officer in the NUB, said that "the plant operation rate in North Korea last year remained merely 40 percent of that in 1992, thus showing no improvement. This level is very close to the lowest productivity limit in North Korea. Therefore, we may say that the North Korean economy has achieved no more than 'zero-point growth,' no matter how generously one may evaluate the situation." Viewing the result of North Korean external trade, it is true that trade with China has increased. However, trade with Russia and Japan decreased. As a result, the trade amount remained $2.7 billion--the level of 1992. According to a latest statistic of the Korea Trade Promotion Corporation, North Korea's export of steel, iron, and cement to China was very active, while its import of grains and oil drastically increased, thus marking a trade amount of $90 million -- a 29.2 percent increase from the previous year. Meanwhile, border trade of daily necessities has been brisk between small-scale businessmen and local governments in North Korean-Chinese border areas. Such trade amounted to approximately $70 million last year. As North Korea has not been able to overcome such economic difficulties, it applied laws and regulations pertaining to the opening of Najin and Sonbong free economy and trade zone, and has now launched full-scale economic cooperation with China. Nevertheless, North Korea still tightly controls its citizens, counter to the policy of opening. As a result, two contradictory situations, namely "opening" and "maintaining the system," coexist in North Korea. In fact, North Korea concluded 11 agreements on economic cooperation with China, Cambodia, and Finland during the second half of last year. Taking a step forward from merely receiving Chinese trade investment delegations, North Korea dispatched a Nampo municipal trade delegation on 11 October; a Chonjin municipal friendship delegation on 1 December; and a North Hamgyong Provincial economic delegation on 13 December, to three provinces in the northeast China and to Yonbyon autonomous district, thus showing the active will for opening. It is believed that North Korea's positiveness in opening will gradually become more visible with the ultimate change in the political situation, including the inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency and progress in the North-South dialogue.
