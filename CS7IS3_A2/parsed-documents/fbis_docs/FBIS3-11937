[Begin recording] [Figueres] I congratulate President Gaviria and tell him that Costa Rica and other Latin American OAS member countries will always be willing to support worthwhile causes in Latin America. [Unidentified reporter] Do you think the United States had its hand in the election? [Figueres] There was a democratic process in which every country voted for the person it regarded as the best to consolidate leadership at the OAS. Therefore, I congratulate President Gaviria for his victory. [Reporter] Your opinion on Foreign Minister Niehaus' remarks on the behavior of other countries' foreign ministers and the United States? [Figueres] I am sure that Foreign Minister Niehaus spoke from a personal viewpoint and that his position does not represent the Costa Rican Government's position, let alone that of the government that will assume office on 8 May.
