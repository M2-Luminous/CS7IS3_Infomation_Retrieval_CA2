Senior leaders of the U.S. Defense Department, including Secretary of Defense William Perry, show keen interest in the proven high level of Japanese civilian technology. They have been approaching Japan on this for some time. For the United States, which now hopes to promote interchangeability between civilian and military technology to strengthen its defense industry, while simultaneously reducing the defense budget, the introduction of Japanese civilian technology is necessary. For Japan, maintenance of the Japan-U.S. security setup is an "irrevocable theme" (according to a senior Defense Agency official). As bilateral relations are constantly plagued by trade frictions, Japan's agreement to this new framework on defense technology, which was demanded by the United States, represented an "opportune occasion" for upholding close cooperation in security and defense. Thus, both countries' interests coincided. However, the present agreement will mostly result in a technological transfer from Japan to the United States. There are concerns that "This may result in the United States alone walking away with the benefits." The utilization of civilian technology and exchanges with the United States are also top priority issues for Japanese defense-related industries. These industries mainly look at the agreement as a framework for "joint development with both sides contributing the technology they possess." There are lingering concerns about a one-sided flow of technology to the United States.
