FR940128-2-00220 FR940128-2-00141 [Release No. 34&hyph;33500; File No. SR&hyph;MSE&hyph;93&hyph;05] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Midwest Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to Agency Crosses Between the Disseminated Exchange Market January 21, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on March 2, 1993, the Midwest Stock Exchange, Inc. (``MSE,'' ``Exchange'' or ``Chicago Stock Exchange'') 1 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. On December 10, 1993, the MSE submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change in order to summarize and respond to a comment letter it received in opposition to this proposal. 2 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 1 As of July 8, 1993, the Midwest Stock Exchange, Inc. (``MSE'') changed its name to the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX''). See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 32488 (June 18, 1993), 58 FR 34284 (June 24, 1993) (File No. SR&hyph;SME&hyph;93&hyph;13) (immediate effectiveness of proposed rule change to amend the MSE's Certificate of Incorporation and Constitution to effect a name change) and 32489 (June 18, 1993), 58 FR 34285 (June 24, 1993) (File No. SR&hyph;MSE&hyph;93&hyph;16) (immediate effectiveness of proposed rule change to make conforming changes to the MSE Rules). 2 See letter from David T. Rusoff, Foley & Lardner, to Beth A. Stekler, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated December 9, 1993 (``Amendment No. 1''). I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The MSE proposes to add an ``Interpretation and Policy'' to Article XX, Rule 23 of its Rules which would allow MSE floor brokers to ``cross'' stock on the Exchange floor without the possibility of break-up by a specialist under certain circumstances. The policy would apply where a broker has an order to buy and an order to sell the same stock at a price between the disseminated Exchange market. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of an basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 1. Purpose The purpose of the proposed rule change is to increase the possibility of immediate execution of agency crosses 3 on the Exchange when the cross price is between the disseminated MSE market. 3 For purposes of this proposal, the Exchange has defined an agency cross to be a cross where neither the order to buy nor the order to sell is for the account of any member or member organization ( i.e., including, but not limited to, the member or member organization executing the cross). Telephone conversation between David T. Rusoff, Foley & Lardner, and Beth A. Stekler, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, on January 5, 1994. At present, Exchange rules require members, or member organizations, with both an order to buy and an order to sell the same security to offer publicly such security at a price which is higher than the bid by the minimum variation permitted in such security (generally an 1/8th) before making a transaction with himself, or itself. The ability of specialists, in particular, to participate in agency crosses, even when they are not disseminating a bid or offer at the cross price, greatly decreases the likelihood of immediate execution of the cross orders for order sending firms. The proposed rule change therefore is designed to give order sending firms greater assurances that their cross orders will be executed quickly and without interference. Because this proposal addresses only the circumstances under which an MSE specialist must refrain from participating in a cross transaction, the proposal would not excuse members from the requirement to bid and offer stock as set out in Rule 23. As such, the proposal would still permit a member in the crowd to participate at the cross price, or better, during the bidding and offering at the post. However, a specialist would not be permitted to interfere with the cross during the bidding and offering at a price which he is not currently disseminating in his quote. 4 However, a specialist could participate in the cross at the cross price if he was previously sought out for assistance in executing any part of the cross trade. 4 Conversely, this proposal would allow a specialist who has a disseminated bid or offer at the cross price to participate at that cross price, even in a size greater then the specialist's disseminated market. Telephone conversation between David T. Rusoff, Foley & Lardner, and Beth A Stekler, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, on December 20, 1993. Under the proposed rule, a customer order in the book could not be ``disadvantaged'' by a cross transaction because the proposal would apply only to crosses at prices between the disseminated Exchange market. Moreover, the Exchange's existing rules of priority and precedence would not be affected in any way under this proposal. Therefore, even though a specialist would be precluded from participating with a cross at a price between his disseminated market, he would still be required to satisfy orders in this book at the cross price, even if those orders are not being disseminated through an oversight on the part of the specialist. Finally, the proposed rule would apply to only floor-brokered orders where neither order is for the account of a member or member organization. 5 The proposed rule would apply to all agency crosses regardless of size. 5 See supra, note 3.
