Volatile compounds classified by EPA as having negligible photochemical reactivity are listed as ``exempt'' in 40 CFR 51.100(s) (except those on the HAP list). b To convert from g/L to lb/gal, multiply by: [(3.785 L/gal)(lb/453.6 g)] or (lb-L/120 g-gal). c Alternate volatile organic HAP (VOHAP alt ) limits (for compliance option 5) are expressed in units of mass of VOHAP per volume of solids, a value that assumes the volumes of all components within a coating are additive. d For compliance purposes, the metric limits are the standard.
