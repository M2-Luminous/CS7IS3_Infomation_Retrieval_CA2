FR940426-0-00023 FR940426-0-00004 Accordingly, 9 CFR part 51 is amended as follows: PART 51_ANIMALS DESTROYED BECAUSE OF BRUCELLOSIS 1. The authority citation for part 51 continues to read as follows: Authority: 21 U.S.C. 111&hyph;113, 114, 114a, 114a&hyph;1, 120, 121, 125, 134b; 7 CFR 2.17, 2.51, and 371.2(d). 2. In §51.3, paragraph (a) is amended by adding a new paragraph (a)(4), to read as set forth below: §51.3 Payment to owners for animals destroyed. (a) *␣*␣* (4) Cattle or bison from a brucellosis-affected herd . The Administrator may authorize 3 the payment of Federal indemnity by the United States Department of Agriculture to any owner who has brucellosis exposed cattle or bison destroyed that were previously sold or traded from any herd that has subsequent to the sale or trade been found to be affected with brucellosis. Epidemiological information such as test results, herd history, and related evidence would be used to establish a probable date when the herd was first infected with brucellosis. Animals sold after that date would be considered to be exposed; those sold before that date would not. In all States except Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States, the amount of Federal indemnity shall not exceed $250 for any registered cattle, $250 for any nonregistered dairy cattle, $150 for any nonregistered cattle other than dairy cattle, and $150 for any bison. In Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States, the amount of Federal indemnity shall not exceed $250 for any cattle or bison. Indemnity payments shall be made only for brucellosis exposed cattle or brucellosis exposed bison and only when the Administrator determines that the destruction of such cattle or bison will contribute to the brucellosis eradication program. Prior to payment of indemnity, proof of destruction 4 shall be furnished to the veterinarian in charge. 3 The Administrator shall authorize payment of Federal indemnity by the United States Department of Agriculture at the maximum per head rates in §51.3: (a) As long as sufficient funds appropriated by Congress appear to be available for this purpose for the remainder of the fiscal year; (b) In States or areas not under Federal quarantine; (c) In States requesting payment of Federal indemnity; and (d) In States not requesting a lower rate. 4 The Veterinarian in Charge shall accept any of the following documents as proof of destruction: (a) A postmortem report; (b) A meat inspection certification of slaughter; (c) A written statement by a State representative, APHIS representative, or accredited veterinarian attesting to the destruction of the animal; (d) A written, sworn statement by the owner or caretaker of the animal attesting to the destruction of the animal; (e) A permit (VS Form 1&hyph;27) consigning the animal from a farm or livestock market directly to a recognized slaughtering establishment; or (f) In unique situations where the documents listed above are not available, other similarly reliable forms of proof of destruction. * * * * * Done in Washington, DC, this 20th day of April 1994.
