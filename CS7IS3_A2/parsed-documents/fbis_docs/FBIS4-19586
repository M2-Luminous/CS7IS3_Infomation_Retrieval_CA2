While watching the ceremony described by Mrs. Ciller as "historic" I must admit I was upset on a few counts. First, I was upset because the ceremony, to which such great importance was attached, was very badly organized. It was difficult to discern any press members among the numerous True Path Party [TPP] ministers, bureaucrats, and sympathizers who kept on applauding Ciller and Karayalcin like soccer fans. While nothing was said about the heavy applause, journalists were not allowed to ask questions verbally. After the conference, the journalists had to squeeze themselves through the crowd to be able to get the text of the package. The second reason I was upset was because the package failed to give me and many other people any hope, even though it was prepared by Ciller and her team with intense efforts and probably with goodwill. With her purple scarf and an attitude aimed at depicting determination, Mrs. Ciller repeatedly asked everyone to "look forward, not back," but it is not easy to forget the recent past so quickly. The prime minister would have been more convincing had she voiced serious self-criticism and had she made a more comprehensive and realistic assessment of the situation. She did not do that, and therefore failed to create the impression that she will not repeat her past mistakes. If you translate the headings of the measures into English, you can say that the program looks like one that might draw the attention of say, the IMF. Most of the following measures constitute the basic elements of stability programs: - Real reductions in budget expenditures, real increases in revenues, and a very significant reduction of the budget deficit. - The suspension of personnel hiring in the public sector, and the prevention of real salary increases. - A legal reorganization that will prevent the Central Bank from financing the public deficit. - Adopting an approach that places the burden on the various sectors of the community and demanding sacrifices. - Announcing that the necessary steps will be taken to close down the public economic enterprises that are incurring losses. Yes, all these are very important for stabilizing an economy, but unfortunately they were announced with a delay of at least two and one-half years. Had Mr. Demirel given instructions for a similar program to be drawn up two years ago and let his then state minister responsible for economic affairs, Mrs. Ciller, announce it to the public, it would have been much more convincing. The TPP-Social Democratic Populist Party coalition was not weakened in the spring of 1992, and if it had announced such a program then, the package would have been much more convincing and promising both at home and abroad. Today, this is not possible any more. Mrs. Ciller and the coalition she is trying to keep alive are not viewed with much confidence by anyone. Their performance of the past two and half years is casting a shadow on any hope for the future. Under these conditions, it is unfortunately very difficult for the program to be promising because: -- its targets in connection with the budget savings seem too ambitious, -- bills regarding the public economic enterprises and the taxes will have to be passed by the Assembly, -- and close to 100 sentences in the written text of the implementation plan are in future tense. I hope that I am wrong, that the program will be successfully implemented even under the present conditions, that it will achieve its targets in the first three months, and that the Turkish economy will begin a stabilization process. I hope that I can be happy, and not upset, about the package.
