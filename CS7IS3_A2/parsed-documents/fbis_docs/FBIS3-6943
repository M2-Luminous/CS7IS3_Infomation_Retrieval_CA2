Ilagan] [Text] Top leaders of the National Democratic Front (NDF) now living in exile in the Netherlands have expressed their willingness to resume anew peace negotiations with government representatives based on the joint declaration agreed upon by the government and communist leaders in The Hague last year. Tarlac Rep. Jose Yap who is a member of the government panel, said in a television talk show late Thursday night that NDF leader Luis Jalandoni told him over the phone from the Netherlands last Sunday that they are willing to proceed with the peace talks. Yap said that after their exploratory talks with Jalandoni and Jose Ma. Sison, founder of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) who is also seeking political asylum in the Netherlands, the peace initiative will now deal with the establishment of committee level talks in preparation for the holding of formal negotiations. The peace negotiations with top leaders of the CPP, the New People's Army (NPA), and the NDF have remained suspended following a deadlock on the issue of venue. While the government has adopted a "shifting venue" concept as part of the confidence-building process, Hague-based NDF leaders led by Sison have not made any decision on their choice for the next meeting place with government representatives. The initial choice of the NDF was in Hanoi, Vietnam, but Sison later rejected the venue for still undetermined reasons. On the other hand, former communist leader Saturnino Ocampo said that the impending amnesty declaration of President Ramos should not provoke the NDF into changing its position of including the rebels who have not availed of the government's amnesty package. Ocampo also opposed the imposition of a deadline on the peace negotiations once the presidential amnesty for rebels, may it be conditional or unconditional, has been declared by the Chief Executive. Col. Rufo de Veyra, spokesman of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), declined to issue any comment on the possible effects of President Ramos' amnesty package, adding that any statement on the issue will only be speculative. However, any decision made by the president with regard to the amnesty issue will be fully supported by the military, he said. Joint Meeting President Ramos has called the chairmen and members of the three government peace panels to a joint meeting in Malacanang [presidential office] on Monday, 21 March, to review the progress of the peace process with all the rebel groups in the country. In a handwritten memorandum, the president instructed Executive Secretary Teofisto Guingona Jr. to also invite advisers from the Cabinet, Senate, and House of Representatives to attend the conference. During the meeting, the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process (OPAPP) will brief those attending the meeting on the status of the peace negotiations with the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), the National Democratic Front-New People's Army- Communist Party of the Philippines, and the military rebels. Internal Reforms Camp Capinpin, Tanay, Rizal -- Lt. Gen. Arturo Enrile, Philippine Army commander, said yesterday that with peace within "arm's reach," his command has embarked on a program of sustaining internal reforms and upgrading equipment and resources as part of its general shift from counter-insurgency to external defense of the nation. Speaking at the 18th anniversary celebration of the Army's Second Infantry (Jungle Fighters) Division, Enrile said that the military has already dismantled the political-military structure of the New People's Army (NPA) in most parts of the country, particularly in the Southern Luzon and Bicol countrysides. He said that the communist rebels have now been pushed deeper into mountain enclaves where they are isolated and deprived of the popular support essential in the conduct of the insurgency war. Enrile praised the officers and men of the Army division under Brig Gen. Regino Lacson for having done much toward the achievement of peace in Southern Luzon and Bicol. Enrile also cited the Army division's "Galloping Clouds" campaign that maximize the opportunities to reach out to the masses and "give an entirely new and larger meaning to the traditional concept as a civil military operation."
