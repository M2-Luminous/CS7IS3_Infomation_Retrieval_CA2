It contains a reference to a statement made by Baturin, assistant to the Russian president on national security, who doubted the ability of our republic to control its borders properly with China. The Foreign Ministry press service is obligated to inform relevant parties that in accordance with the information given by reliable sources, illegal attempts to cross the border are not numerous. Transgressors are usually always detained. As far as border control is concerned, a visa agreement on traveling between Kazakhstan and China, which envisages the need for exit-entry visas for trips by citizens of both Kazakhstan and China, was concluded. Such conclusions on the ability of an independent country to defend its borders should be based on facts, the more so because the Republic's relevant services exchange border information on a regular basis with the leadership of the Russian border troops.
