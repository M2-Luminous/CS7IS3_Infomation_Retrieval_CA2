The unlucky ones -- those who fled horror and persecution in their own country aboard a flimsy boat that capsized off the Bahamian coasts -- became fodder for the sharks that swarm these waters after they called insistently and unsuccessfully on the U.S. Navy to help them. Complying with the provisions in effect in the United States, the U.S. Coast Guard opted to conduct another task at that time: to pick up a group of Cuban rafters who were on their way to Miami and escort them to U.S. territory. In this case, as always, the Cuban rafters were received as heroes. The media were called to interview them, and they were asked to condemn the Havana government publicly, which seems to be an essential requirement to being welcomed warmly and affectionately. The U.S. immigration provisions, which Havana deems as political tools used in a campaign against the revolutionary process taking place on the Caribbean island, encourage this type of arrival along the U.S. coast. These policies even include the right to possible employment. As if this were not enough, the so-called rafters -- some of whom fall prey to drug traffickers who charge high fees for the odyssey and some of whom never reach their destination because they disappear at sea -- can apply for permanent residence in a year. This option is repeatedly denied to other applicants. The daily, weekly, monthly, and annual publication of the number of Cubans who, according to U.S. statistics, avail themselves of this possibility after leaving Cuba illegally is part of the anti-Cuban strategy being implemented by Washington. Of course, this policy is complemented by repeated rejections given to many Cubans who go to the U.S. Cuban Interests Office in the island's capital to request a visa to visit their relatives or to opt for residence in the United States. An immigration agreement signed years ago by the governments of the two countries states that Washington will authorize up to 20,000 visas for Cubans, but the Cuban Government has repeatedly accused the other party of violating this agreement by granting a ridiculous number of travel permits. This contrasts with Havana's evident easing of its immigration process, which now allows any citizen over age 20 to travel freely, as long as he has the required visa to the place he wants to go. Because accepting Haitian refugees is not a U.S. political priority, the conditions established for these people are completely different. All boats taking these emigrants to U.S. territory are intercepted and forced to return to their place of origin, even though this might mean, according to repeated reports by Haitian organizations, delivering them back into the repression from which they escaped. Tragic events such as this are repeated and, more than once, have caused international scandals, as was the case of the confinement of thousands of Haitians at the Guantanamo Naval Base that is occupied by the United States in eastern Cuba. These Haitians were detained there for months and lived in dire conditions. Nevertheless, on this occasion, the tragedy reached unsuspected proportions, because the refusal to help the 35 Haitians who were trying to find haven in the United States simply turned them into food for sharks; indeed, those who could help them were absolutely unconcerned about this. An eloquent depiction of the U.S. position was the desperate attempt made by another Haitian to pass himself off as a Cuban named Felipe Gonzalez, but the authorities discovered his true identity and arrested him upon his arrival in U.S. territory. Haitian protests and the tragic results of the aforementioned event could definitely become a powerful topic of discussion at the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva.
