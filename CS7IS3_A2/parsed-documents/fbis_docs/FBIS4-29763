The party's planning and management section submitted a report on the current political situation to the Supreme Council stating that since the inter-Korean summit has been agreed in principle by both sides' presidents, it is likely that procedures for the summit will progress rapidly. "If South and North Korea broad-mindedly push for the summit, it is highly likely that all the procedures for realization of the summit may make rapid progress," the report said. North Korean leader Kim Il-song has conveyed his hope to South Korean President Kim Yong-sam of an early summit "at any time, any place and without any preconditions" through former U.S. President Jimmy Carter. Kim Yong-sam in turn welcomed the offer. It added that the ministerial-level working contacts for the summit would probably be held in June or July and that the summit could occur this year -- that is, if things go well and if North Korean-U.S. talks also make progress. Considering the historical significance of the first inter-Korean summit, the two sides are expected to meet in Seoul and Pyongyang, according to the report. The summit is expected to address all issues pending between South and North Korea including the standoff over Pyongyang's nuclear program. "Especially, the meeting will deal with the two basic agreements concluded at the sixth high-level inter-Korean talks in February 1992 -- the South-North denuclearization declaration, disarmament and unification," the report predicted. The report said the summit's chances of coming off are good, citing the former U.S. President's mediation between the two sides and both presidents' emphasis on meeting without any preconditions. Both Seoul and Pyongyang are in a difficult situation because of the nuclear dispute, the report pointed out, and the agreement to hold a summit was made with the world closely watching, the report added. "The inter-Korean summit will act as great momentum to change overall inter-Korean relations, including the North Korean nuclear situation, and to clear away the national history of hostility and antagonism over the past 50 years." The report suggested that the DP actively support the government so that the mood can change from sanctions to dialogue and so inter-Korean relations can be normalized.
