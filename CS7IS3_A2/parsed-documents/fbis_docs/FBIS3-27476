The three tasks set by the central authorities have been successfully carried out to various extents. Negative and decadent phenomena have been somewhat restrained; the masses have been initially aroused to action; the number of corruption cases reported by the people has increased sharply; and several activists daring to fight corruption and good party members and good cadres serving the people industriously and honestly performing their official duties have come to the fore." The meeting, which was called by the Yunnan Provincial CPC Committee, was designed to sum up experiences to further carry out the antigraft campaign successfully. The provincial procuratorate and higher people's court briefed the meeting on how cases had been investigated and dealt with. According to the statistics, procuratorial organs across the province last year placed on file for investigation and prosecution 1,348 economic cases, including corruption and bribery, of which 749 were serious and important cases. Of all the cases placed on file, 13 involved 1 million yuan each, and 12 involved cadres at the county or section level and above. A total of 1,285 cases involving 1,524 people have been closed. Through trials, illicit money and stolen goods totally worth 39.07 million yuan have been recovered. The anticorruption campaign has won the wholehearted support of the broad masses of the people. Last year, the procuratorial organs heard 3,248 cases reported by the masses, and the number of cases reported in the August-December period was 2.4 times that of the previous seven months. Of all the cases placed on file for investigation by the procuratorial organs, 53 percent were reported by the masses. A number of serious and important cases were made public at the meeting. The most spectacular cases were against the former deputy chief of the provincial personnel department who took a bribe of 200,000 yuan and a certain person called He, the former chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference of the Dehong Dai-Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, who embezzled 2 million yuan in public funds. In commenting on the successes, people here are saying that the provincial government meant what it said this time. Provincial Party Committee Secretary Pu Chaozhu emphasized: "We must not overestimate the achievements made in the recent anticorruption drive and must not be content with these initial successes. We must be ready to carry out the struggle for a long time. We must, in accordance with the law and discipline, resolutely handle and promptly close those cases for which we have conclusive evidence, regardless of who is involved and in spite of any interference.
