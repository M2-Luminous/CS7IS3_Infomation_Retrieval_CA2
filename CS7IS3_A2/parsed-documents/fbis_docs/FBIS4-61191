What Language Will Moscow and Groznyy Use?"] [Text] From an interview with Dzhokhar Dudayev: [Dudayev] Two years ago the Chechen republic acquired its independence. But even now one can say with confidence that my presidency and our state are coming into being in very precarious conditions . Although even in these conditions there is no doubt that the state does exist. [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] What is your opinion of the activity of law-enforcement bodies? Do you not think that you are to blame for the disorganization there? [Dudayev] This is a problem not only for us but also throughout the former Union. We have adopted a government program for combating crime during the transitional period. [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] What about the parliament? Does it or does it not exist? [Dudayev] The deputies are still meeting. (We would remind you that a few months before the tragic events in Moscow the same kind of crisis blew up in Chechnya when Dudayev used force against the opposition in order to retain power. Over 50 people died then -- editorial note). They are putting all the parliament's previous work on a legal footing. [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] What mistakes have you made during your rule? What reasons do you have to reproach yourself? [Dudayev] We are a nation today. And the people who trust in me -- around 80 percent of the population support me -- are convincing evidence that I have not committed flagrant mistakes that they regret. I do not know of a single state that does not want to cooperate with us. So we are pursuing the right policy. But we cannot agree to the terrorism that is being foisted on us by Russia's leadership. We have given no cause for it, and are not about to. Terrorism is for the weak. We cannot live in isolation, especially from Russia. But that is what is being imposed on us, as it was on Albania and Cuba in the past. They want to create unbearable conditions here so as to arouse people's indignation and cause the overthrow of the "Dudayev regime." There is a 100-percent probability that Russia will try to "have it out" by force with recalcitrant Chechnya. Russia can do nothing else. When has it refrained from resolving national issues by force? That is its downfall. [Dudayev ends] From an interview with Yaragi Mamodayev, leader of the Chechen opposition and head of the government of people's confidence: [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] What is your view of the situation in Chechnya today? [Mamodayev] To put it briefly, it is worse than in other regions of the North Caucasus. There are virtually no state deliveries. Industry -- the backbone of the national economy -- is coming to a standstill. The petroleum complex is on its last legs. Agriculture has been paralyzed, and most educational establishments have been closed down. The republic's population has been reduced to poverty amid wholesale unemployment. And the few people who are in work have not seen wages for months, just as pensioners have not seen pensions. Moreover there is a terrible crime situation, with robberies and banditry. In a word, there is every sign that we have not a regime, as many people think, but absolute powerlessness and anarchy. As for Dudayev's regime, there is a Chechen Constitution which he has flagrantly violated. There is also a ruling by our Constitutional Court deeming the president's actions illegal. [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] What is the reason for your long stay in Moscow? [Mamodayev] In theory any of us can go to Groznyy when necessary and stay there are long as necessary. We have simply moved away from the republic's internal problems and concentrated our efforts on resolving foreign policy tasks, in other words we are working on the future. In Moscow it is easier for us to establish contacts with Russian leaders and afford the republic real assistance. At the same time we are following the general course of building an independent Chechen state, which accords with the will of our people. We realize that the process of acquiring a new state system is a long and complex one. It cannot be accomplished on impulse, by arrogant lunges. It is Russia that plays the key part in recognizing our independence. And we are now seeking ways to stabilize the situation at Caucasus-wide, regional level -- which in turn will ease the lot of the Chechen Republic. In order for this to occur it is primarily necessary to secure unequivocal rejection of strong-arm pressure on Chechnya. Dudayev is doing everything to cause bloodshed in the republic -- either by provoking civil war or by causing Chechnya to fall out with Russia. You get the impression that Chechnya's present rulers do not understand what they are doing or what kind of violence they are perpetrating against the people. Yet Dudayev is still saying: "I have the support of 80 percent of the population." He could cite a figure of 99 percent just as successfully. It costs him nothing and commits him to nothing. [Mamodayev ends] From the life of the Chechen republic: Eight people died and several were wounded in an exchange of fire between two groups in the center of the Chechen capital. The reason for the "shoot-out" was a long-standing financial dispute: One side owed the other a large sum of money. A third force -- a group run by one Labazanov, the local "authority" -- ended up embroiled in the conflict. Of late it has acted as arbiter in such contentious situations. Labazanov turned up with an armed crew of around 20 people. The "home team" lost four men, the attackers lost two. Labazanov himself was wounded. Immediately after the clash his comrades in arms brought him to the hospital in an ambulance where, after "releasing" all the other patients, they posted a strong guard throughout the premises, including men with machine guns on the roof. Their fears were unfounded. Labazanov is a well-known figure in Chechnya. His popularity in some circles is rivaled only by the president's. Moreover they are worthy of one another. A former sportsman and boxing master of sport, from the start of the Chechen revolution Labazanov found himself on the barricades. His subsequent activity is shrouded in mystery. Although on paper he and his team rank as presidential structures. According to reports from Groznyy, there is total confusion among the leaders of the republic's relatively sound farms. The reason being not the economy but crime. A crime wave has swept through rural areas of Chechnya, with agricultural producers being shot and blackmailed and their enterprises being robbed. Gangs masked in camouflage gear "national guard-style" are rifling through cattle pens, farms, and grain stores. Country people are having to organize self-defense detachments. Sheltering behind national interests, clan thugs are living with the threat of reprisals from non-Chechen leaders. And their recalcitrant patrons are "punished according to the law of the mountains." Thus one night "Sarysuyskiy" Sovkhoz Director Yanali Deniyev was killed with an assault rifle, "Rossiya" Kolkhoz Chairman Iosif Nisanov was shot with a machinegun, and Boris Yerik, chairman of the "Terek" Joint-Stock Company," was carted off somewhere from a team meeting. Meanwhile Dudayev is once again shuffling the leaders of the power structures: He has sacked the general prosecutor and replaced the internal affairs minister, the head of the criminal police department, the chairman of the Supreme Court.... While policemen chase old ladies through bazaars to combat speculation, the state security service is "watching over" "enemies of the Chechen people" in the opposition; criminal proceedings are being instituted against the boss fighting organized crime, whom the regime considers undesirable. The unknown troublemaker who fired a grenade thrower at the presidential palace was evidently the parting shot here.
