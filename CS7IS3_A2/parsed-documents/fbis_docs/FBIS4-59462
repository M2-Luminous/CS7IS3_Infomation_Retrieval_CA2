A spokesman for the Foreign Office was adamant that there was no official response to hidden microphones being found in the newly renovated mission, which only reopened six months ago. He did not expect any comment would be made about the illegal bugging. The tight-lipped reaction was met with a news blackout in the British media, which even extended to the PRESS ASSOCIATION, the UK's national news agency, not carrying the Wednesday night report of the disclosure by Iran's president, Hashemi-Rafsanjani. With dailies exercising the same trend and only a few carrying extracts from foreign agencies, the suggestion was that there had been a blanket ban imposed to hide the government's humiliation of being caught red-handed contravening international law. The disclosure also reveals that the UK's recent propaganda campaign to discredit Iran was orchestrated to cover the embarrassment of being found spying on a foreign embassy in London. The Iranian Foreign Ministry disclosed that the devices were discovered before the UK Government, assisted by the British press, launched smears two weeks ago that claimed Iranian intelligence had links with the IRA. Bugging a foreign mission is nothing new to British intelligence. Former agent, Peter Wright, has revealed in his "Spycatcher" book that such clandestine activities extended to even embassies of Britain's allies. It has also been disclosed that the UK has tapped the telex lines of IRNA in London, when the interception warrant was found to be still in place long after the location of its bureau was removed from Leicester Square in 1987. All international telecommunications are commonly assumed to be monitored by the government's communications headquarters (GCHQ) in Cheltenham, western England.
