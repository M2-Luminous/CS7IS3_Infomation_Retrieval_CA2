More than 200 Chinese and foreign specialists, scholars, and entrepreneurs gathered in Beijing today to attend a four-day international conference on integrating and developing economics, science and technology, and laws. The main theme of the conference, which is jointly sponsored by the China Association for Science and Technology and the Chinese Society of International Economic, Scientific and Technological, and Legal Personnel, is to study and explore the operational mechanisms for integrating and developing the economic, scientific and technological, and legal fields; to search for ways to groom and train interdisciplinary personnel suited to these efforts; to further promote economic prosperity, scientific and technological advancement, and the sound development of laws; to increase exchanges and cooperation between specialists and scholars in various countries; and to advance social development and progress. Chen Muhua and Li Ximing, vice chairpersons of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, attended the opening ceremony this morning. This was the first time that an international conference of interdisciplinary personnel from a wide range of fields was held in our country. Chinese and foreign specialists and scholars submitted 65 academic papers to the conference. The papers show that they share this common understanding: The integration and development of economics, science and technology, and laws is a very important research project. Science and technology are the motive forces for social progress, the economy is the foundation of social development, and laws are guarantees for social progress. The integration and simultaneous development of these three aspects represent a general trend in today's social development. In his speech, Justice Minister Xiao Yang said: The convocation of this international conference will facilitate the efforts to explore the operational mechanisms for integrating economics, science and technology, and laws; to search for ways to groom and train interdisciplinary personnel; and to promote academic services, peace, and development in the world. Moreover, it will benefit contacts and exchanges between people in economic, scientific and technological, legal, and business circles in various countries, thereby creating conditions for forging effective links and cooperation in the future. In his speech, Zou Yu, president of the Chinese Society of International Economic, Scientific and Technological, and Legal Personnel, said: The present-day world is characterized by very close economic contacts between various countries and regions, and by an extremely rapid pace of interaction between the economy on the one hand and science and technology on the other. The development of these two fields should be guaranteed by law, and it is increasingly urgent to coordinate and harmonize various laws. This dictates long-term exchanges and cooperation between specialists and scholars in various countries in carrying out strenuous, in-depth exploration and studies in a joint effort to promote social progress and development. Attending the conference are more than 60 economic, scientific and technological, and legal specialists and scholars from such countries and regions as Germany, Canada, the United States, Australia, and Austria.
