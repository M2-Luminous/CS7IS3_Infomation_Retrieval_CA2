Let us recall that the GKI's previous attempts to establish a new state program ended with the program being recalled for further work while the GKI ultimately issued a statement on the extension of the operation of the old 1992 state program for a further three years. The GKI has several reasons for wanting the program to be adopted right now. The main one is the desire to avoid a detailed examination in the new parliament which would end in an as yet unknown way. The document is being put into operation by a president's edict. It is characteristic that its draft lacked the point, traditional for the president's October and November decrees, according to which the document should be examined and approved by the Duma. But in the end it was decided not to bypass article three of the law on privatization, in accordance with which the state program is put into operation by parliament. One of the document's clauses is extremely curious, banning the use of procedures for re-registering debts on which state enterprises have defaulted as bills of exchange and circulating these bills on the secondary market in securities. In practice that means one thing: The opportunity for demanding the payment of debts from state enterprises is closed. As a result sooner or later the need will arise for another reciprocal setting off of debts. By defending its own property from being dragged apart in accordance with bill of exchange commitments, the GKI is in fact creating a situation in which no one is responsible for state enterprises' debts: neither the state nor the state enterprise itself. The government session particularly criticized the benefits for investment funds (and that is tax legislation, not privatization legislation), procedures for the participation of foreign investors, and also the need to adopt a state program "for just half a year," that is until the voucher's term runs out. Although changing the privatization concept at a moment when the population has already used 80 percent of the vouchers is quite obviously already impossible. Despite the fact that the state program provisions have been worked through, individual "underwater rocks" could prove too sharp. One of them is the privatization of uncompleted construction projects. This point is internally contradictory and provides unjustified benefits for the enterprise personnel and does not coincide with this question's interpretation by the recent Russian Federation Supreme Arbitration Court plenum. The program also contains points which allow an expanded interpretation and which go beyond the framework of privatization legislation. But the program's main feature lies elsewhere. Without declaring new slogans, the new document fully confirms the thesis that within the framework of the current privatization there has been an internal substitution of its aims which has gone almost unnoticed. Instead of the "free" issue of state property to citizens proclaimed at the start, a different aim has emerged -- the speediest removal of vouchers from circulation and the retention of the maximum proportion of unprivatized property under GKI patronage. To judge by Ye. Gaydar's speech at the government session, the subsequent scenario looks like this: The actual concept of privatization will change and the rights of labor collectives will be substantially curtailed. By the end of the vouchers' term no more than one third of state property will have transferred to private hands. Although 110 million vouchers have already been put to use. In this connection serious doubts are strengthening that each voucher will be worth one 160 millionth of Russia's property. In that sense the indexing of vouchers looks very attractive. But it looks as though it is possible only on paper as, indeed, is the indexing of fixed production capital. But for some reason the latter is being carried out for the second time in the past 18 months. Yet the indexing of vouchers has become something like a banned topic. In fact only enterprises' working capital is being privatized for vouchers now, that is the proportion of fixed capital at 1987 prices is becoming insignificantly small in the structure of the property of any enterprise. They can be spared this either by a decision of the GKI on indexing the voucher or by an analogous GKI decision on bringing working capital into line with 1987 prices through reverse inflation indexing. Either measure would fill the voucher with real values and not inflationary working capital. To all appearances the SKI will not make up its mind to do that. The reasons are understandable. By leaving the "sweet course" for dessert it is reliably ensuring itself work for many years to come.
