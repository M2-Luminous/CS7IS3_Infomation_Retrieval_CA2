For the Black Sea Fleet"] [Text] If Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, were alive today he would surely have written a book about slips of the tongue by politicians, their press secretaries, and journalists who write about politics. Because these slips of the tongue demonstrate in a very curious way a connection which exists between problems in the subconscious of all those people but which, aloud, is flatly denied. The recent Russo-Ukrainian talks are a prime example of that. Let me remind you that initially it was stated that the meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian heads of government would be dedicated to the situation in the Crimea, which has deteriorated. However, it emerged that this was a slip of the tongue. The two countries' delegations concentrated not on the confrontation between the authorities in Kiev and the Crimea but on the division of the Black Sea Fleet. As far as I am aware, no one at an official level has made a direct link between the problems of the fleet and mutual relations between Kiev and Simferopol, which deteriorate periodically. But this slip of the tongue makes you wonder. At the very least it sheds light on why it has proved impossible for so long to reach final agreement on the fate of the Black Sea Fleet. A miracle has not happened now either. The Russo-Ukrainian talks have become bogged down again. Once again on the problem of the basing of the Russian Black Sea Fleet and the Ukrainian Navy. Let us be frank here: Even though the technical details of the forthcoming division are highly complex, that is not the essential matter. The nub of the problem is the political will of the contracting parties or rather the lack of it on the part of one of them. The fate of the Black Sea Fleet at the end of the 20th century is paradoxically reminiscent of the fate of Poland at the end of the 18th century. Two hundred years ago that country was also being constantly partitioned. The slightest fluctuation in the balance of relations between the major European powers aroused in them an irresistible desire to engage in a trial of strength with one another by embarking on yet another partition of Poland. The paradox of the Black Sea Fleet is that the initiator of each new attempt to divide it up is the country in the weaker position, namely, Ukraine. A debtor forced to settle its account with Russia using its most valuable assets -- its oil and gas reserves -- finds consolation for its complexes in a petty squabble over for a legacy which will not bring Ukraine either economic or military-political advantage. The question here is not so much one of Russo-Ukrainian relations as of the internal political struggle in Ukraine. In Kiev they forgot long ago, if they ever knew at all, that the fleet was designed to safeguard the security of the state. Just as they seem to have forgotten that it is dangerous to turn the nuclear missiles stationed on Ukrainian territory into a bargaining counter. But how else can you explain the fact that whenever the situation in the Crimea hots up, politicians close to the Ukrainian president suddenly begin alluding to the possibility of Kiev's withdrawal from its international commitments on these weapons. And this causes considerable unease in the world. The whole point of this is that in the minds of the Ukrainian politicians the fleet is first and foremost a symbol. Not just of a naval presence but also of the right to Sevastopol. A city which was created and which exists primarily as a naval base. But Sevastopol, in the minds of many people in Ukraine, is the key to the Crimea, which is so determinedly trying to break free from Ukraine's embraces. But whenever the talk turns to the symbols that are used in the political struggle, all rational discussion becomes impossible. That is because whenever attempts have been made to reach agreement on the Black Sea Fleet, Ukrainian politicians on returning to Kiev began interpreting those accords in such a way that they effectively rendered them meaningless. The solution to these riddles is simple. The Ukrainian president understands perfectly well that if he concludes a more or less reasonable agreement (which, in any event, will be a compromise) his political opponents will not be slow to accuse him of betraying the national interests. The fact that it proved impossible to demonstrate even a semblance of agreement during the present talks is evidence that on the eve of the presidential elections Kiev is bound hand and foot. Meanwhile, REUTER reports from Kiev that a Ukrainian Government representative, who asked to remain nameless, has stated that Ukraine "is going to ask the UN Security Council to examine the question of the unlawful stationing of foreign troops on its territory and demand their complete withdrawal." "We mean the Black Sea Fleet, of course," that representative stated. The matter is further complicated by the fact that, by all accounts, it is in Ukraine, not Russia, as many people feared, that the military are beginning to play an autonomous political role. The attempts at strong-arm actions against the Black Sea Fleet followed by threatening statements from Ukrainian Defense Ministry spokesmen -- all these things are in conflict with President Kravchuk's official line. It must also be said honestly that despite its partner's constantly improper conduct, Moscow is quite limited in the ways that it can exert pressure. Suggestions about "switching off" the oil and gas supply in retaliation should be regarded as an emotional response. After all, a sharp worsening of the domestic political situation in Ukraine and an increased threat of the disintegration of Ukraine are certainly not in Russia's interests. The balanced stance adopted by Moscow during the present crisis in the Crimea confirms that. Incidentally, it is obvious that by no means everyone in Simferopol realizes that the "war of nerves" that nearly began accompanied by overtly provocative rumors about "tank columns" heading toward Sevastopol could have extremely regrettable consequences. By all accounts Russia is going to have to negotiate patiently and consistently without letting itself be sidetracked either by Kiev's improvizations or the appeals of extremists, and such people exist in the Crimea, too. It remains to be hoped that those people who would like to turn the fleet into a pawn in a political game will remember that we are talking here about a major naval grouping equipped with the most modern weapons. After all, during the incident in Odessa the bolts of the Kalashnikovs were already being released.... Let us hope that in the event of further confrontation the Moscow-Kiev-Simferopol triangle (where only Moscow is demonstrating a balanced approach) does not become a Bermuda Triangle for the Black Sea Fleet.
