At today's contact, the South side stressed that this year's Team Spirit exercise will be suspended, and that the third round of North Korean-U.S. high-level talks will proceed smoothly only if the exchange of special envoys is held. In relation to the actual procedures, the South side revealed it would be willing to consider flexibly accepting North Korea's proposal on amendments to the agreement on exchanging special envoys if the North side renounces its four demands that include President Kim Yong-sam taking back his remarks regarding the North Korean nuclear issue. While repeatedly demanding that "the South side must express its position, in any form, regarding the North side's four demands," Pak Yong-su, the North side's chief delegate, receded slightly from his previous position by saying that he would "take note of the South's indication that the North side's four demands were problematic." Chief delegate Pak also proposed that they issue a joint communique on the will of both sides "to exchange special envoys" prior to adopting an agreement.
