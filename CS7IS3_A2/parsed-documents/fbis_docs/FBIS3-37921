The document lists the causes of the crisis: 1. The government promised to much to pay and so had to print more money, which is likely to trigger hyperinflation. 2. Factories transfer their own funds and credits into deposits, foundation capital of joint stock societies and hard currency reserves rather than use them to pay debts. 3. Factory managers cannot be made answerable for failure to pay debts to their suppliers or to the taxation service. 4. The mechanism of putting businesses in order and liquidating them under the Insolvency (Bankruptcy) Act is not working. 5. There is no supervision of the transfer and use of centralized credits. 6. The production continues to decline against a background of high inflation. The analysts suggest that the head of state should: -- Set up regional commissions which would urgently check the financial health of debtor businesses. Local administration, banks, taxation office and law enforcement agency officials must be members of the commissions. The commissions would identify debts which are attributable to failure on the part of the state to honor its commitments to the factories; identify factories which have hard currency accounts in the deposits in commercial banks, notably abroad and still are not non-payers; determine the export hard currency revenues of factories that failed to reach Russia; identify hopeless debtors and enter them in a special register to be handed over to the State Property Commission. -- Approach different kinds of factories in different ways. The experts think that the state should pay its debts to the coal mining and defense industries and to the farmers shortly. Credits should be given to enable power stations stay in business until the spring starts; after power stations should discontinue supply of debtor factories. Managers of other enterprises, notably of the gas and oil mining the president should be made additionally responsible if the commission finds that they failed to pay their suppliers by used the funds to deposit them in banks, to buy shares of joint stock societies or to buy equipment or if they have funds on hard currency accounts but do not exchange them for rubles to pay their suppliers. Factories must be compelled to pay their overdue debts from their hard currency accounts. -- Order the government to rule that every legal entity must have a maximum of three ruble and two hard currency accounts. The entity should submit data on all the accounts to the taxation inspection. Those who fail to do so must be forced to pay considerable sums. This ruling should be made consistent with criminal responsibility for tax evasion. In this way funds would be discovered that could be used for timely payment of debts to suppliers and tax evasion would be prevented. -- Order the government to introduce a procedure of mutual payment of debts by using LC-contracts that are used internationally. The essence of this procedure is that when a contract on supply of products is signed, the bank freezes the sum of the future payment in the payer's account. Once the product has been shipped, the bank transfers the sum to the supplier. In this way the customer cannot avoid payment of debts under the pretext of having no funds on his accounts and unreliable suppliers cannot cheat the consumers. -- Order the Central Bank to credit chiefly the final consumers so as to breath life into the chain of production financing and product sales. -- Tighten controls over use of appropriated budget funds and centralized credits so that they are used chiefly to pay debts. -- Impose stringent sanctions for delaying the payment documents going as far as withdrawing licenses from commercial banks and levying administrative punishment on cashier center managers. -- Regard organizing circulation of promissory note a priority task. Make additional organizational and material resources available to the State Property Committee for this purpose. -- Sell some of the debts incurred by factories to commercial banks, state financial institutions and foreign customers. Exchange the debts in some cases for long term liabilities of the state or state bonds at rates that vary with the status of the factory and chances of recovering the debt (the lower the chance, the lower the rate). -- Following in the footsteps of Western Europe, attract private firms for cyclic offsetting of claims (using the system of clearings). -- Hold an inter-agency conference of the State Property Committee, the Supreme Court of Arbitration, the Economy Ministry and the Finance Ministry with a view to working out a program of specific steps designed to make the Insolvency (Bankruptcy) Act work. No financial discipline is thinkable without bankruptcies.
