That is common knowledge in Nagata-cho. The ruling and opposition parties are divided over whether they are pro-Ozawa or anti-Ozawa. Factions and groups are being sorted out even within the coalition parties and the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. An incredible person whose name is listed among the top 10 "men disliked" and "men liked." He turns out to have played a lead role also in the course of events leading up to the rejection of the bills on political reform. Mr. Ichiro Ozawa, supreme power-wielder in the Hosokawa regime and acting director of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], enjoys the game of chess His skill there is between that of a beginner and a second-class amateur. In Nagata-cho that puts him into the category of "strong man." Chess is a "game of decisions. "Should I gamble here, or should I wait patiently for my next chance? -- one is constantly being pressed to decide. A weak person is frequently defensive when he should take the offensive and fades into a loss. Mr. Ozawa is different in that respect. One who has gone up against him rates Mr. Ozawa's chess this way: "He's the type who initiates offensive moves. He's not good at closely watching his opponent's moves. He tries to cut the way open on his own. There's no `defense' in Mr. Ozawa's moves. Another characteristic is that, when the situation is unfavorable, he doesn't struggle fruitlessly. Before really getting into a bind, he accepts defeat. I don't know if you'd call that gallant, but he's a man more embarrassed by a vain struggle than by defeat." Such a tendency can be glimpsed also in his politicking. "He has the image of a schemer; but his tactic is the tactless method of frontal attack. He's the direct opposite of former premier Noboru Takeshita, who would just wait for the ripe fruit to fall. Seeking `a frontal breakthrough' by force, he has often failed." So said an LDP leader, referring to the Tokyo gubernatorial election of three years ago, on 21 January [1994] after the political reform bills were rejected in the upper house plenary session. The LDP secretary general at that time, Mr. Ozawa had former Japan Broadcasting Corporation newscaster Hisanori Isomura run so as to topple the incumbent governor, Shunichi Suzuki. Conversely, however, that had angered Mr. Suzuki and led to an election splitting the conservatives. With Mr. Isomura's crushing defeat, Mr. Ozawa said, "I accept full blame for the outcome. It is enough for me alone to take responsibility." And he just resigned from his position as secretary general. The recent rejection of the political reform bills may be an even greater failure than the earlier defeat. Mr. Ozawa seem to have misread the outlook; he shows the sign of being disturbed. During the week before the vote in the upper house plenary session, Mr. Ozawa was acting quite energetic. On the 14th, he showed enthusiasm when the LDP side secretly approached him with the compromise proposals that 1) a proportional allocation be made of 280 single-seat constituencies and 230 seats for proportional representation; 2) proportional representation would be done by totaling votes for nationwide units, and those successfully elected would be determined for each of seven blocs nationwide; and 3) corporate and organizational donations to individual politicians would be allowed only for politicians in local constituencies. He met successively with Yoshiro Mori, LDP secretary general, on the 15th; with Wataru Kubo, general secretary of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], on the 16th; and with Takeshi Noda, LDP director of the lower house Ad Hoc Committee on Political Reform, on the 17th. In the meeting with Mr. Kubo, he said, "We counted the votes, but it's close (whether it will pass), isn't it." While up to that time he had raced ahead with his strong course for handling the Diet, he may have become perplexed because the chance of a rejection had emerged. It had seemed that his talks with the ruling and opposition parties, other than the Communist Party, might pull it together; but the situation changed after newspapers reported the floating of the compromise proposals as the front-page lead story in their morning editions on the 19th. By pushing secret negotiations over the heads of upper house members, he had angered all the upper house LDP members. It is even said that a memo in which Mr. Noda leaked the contents of his talks with Mr. Ozawa was copied and circulated among upper house LDP officers. In it was detailed the arrangements for presenting a compromise plan by LDP Secretary General Mori, then negotiating between the opposition and ruling parties in the upper house, next having a summit meeting between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and LDP President Yohei Kono, and then agreeing. It is no wonder the upper house side was angered; it was as though, before negotiations on a wage increase, an agreed figure had come out. On the evening of the 19th, Mr. Ozawa made a phone call to an LDP Diet member to whom he had a pipeline and asked, "How is it going with the upper house LDP members? Now we've led the horse to the water trough, it'll be bad if we can't make it drink." After that, Mr. Kono made an intercessory phone call to Mr. Ozawa, but two hours later Mr. Ozawa again called his LDP Diet member contact and made this parting shot: "We've decided on adoption. Tell Kono." This means Mr. Ozawa had again switched to a hard line. Had something happened during this two-hour interval? Had he seen the LDP in the upper house not pulling together, or had he recovered his confidence in the outcome of a vote which he once had viewed as uncertain? But the outcome was rejection. The SDPJ rebels were more numerous than expected--20 (17 opposing the bills and three abstaining) -- while the LDP rebels numbered five--less than he had expected. Ozawa Repeated "Not Yet" Three Times Beaming after the rejection, Mr. Kono said, "The style of managing the Diet by force brought on a reaction," implicitly criticizing Mr. Ozawa. At the time of the Kaifu cabinet, while he was a candidate for cabinet and party official posts, he was opposed by the "Kono- hating" Mr. Ozawa and lost out in both cases, so the grudge he holds toward Mr. Ozawa is especially deep. When Mr. Ozawa professed himself to be in "the reform faction" and raised the banner of Shinseito, Mr. Kono snapped at him sharply, saying, "What needs to be reformed first of all are the very dispositions of those men." Criticism of the Ozawa line is swirling about Nagata-cho. LDP upper house Secretary General Tomio Yamamoto says, "It was an antifascist struggle," while coalition officials also offer the analysis that "Mr. Ozawa's forceful style invited the outcome of increasing the number of SDPJ rebels." If it were chess, Mr. Ozawa would quickly admit defeat at this point. However, it is no longer so-called era of "Kon-Chiku-Sho" [Kanemaru, Takeshita, and Ozawa -- also, a common Japanese curse, "Damn it"] when Ozawa was LDP secretary general and had the backing of Takeshita and Shin Kanemaru, former LDP vice president; things have changed and Ozawa faces with a fierce power struggle. An SDPJ official says, "Mr. Ozawa appears to have been defeated, but actually has not. Hereafter, if the governing coalition parties swallow the LDP's demands whole, within both the LDP and the SDPJ internal struggles will begin between pro-reform group and the go-slow group over whether to accept them. His real aim probably is to induce the breakup of both the LDP and SDPJ." However, the LDP plan was once rejected and killed in the lower house. The , SDPJ will also find it hard to concede to regulations barring corporate and organizational donations. Even if the Executive Department decides on a concession, if more rebels emerge and lead to a party rupture, the coalition regime will collapse. If the political reform bills are killed, would Prime Minister Hosokawa dissolve the lower house and call for general elections or have the cabinet resign en bloc since he has said that he "will take political responsibility? With this recession, could he dissolve the Diet without having drawn up a budget for this fiscal year? Even Komeito, a coalition partner of Shinseito , strongly opposes. Calling for an en-bloc resignation, however, if it were just to replace the prime minister with deputy prime minister, Tsutomu Hata, or the foreign minister, for example, would scarcely win the understanding of the nation. It indeed appears that Mr.Ozawa is now in a fix and is truly waging a fruitless struggle that will embarrass himself. At the government-ruling parties leadership meeting, the night of the 21st, when the draft bills had been rejected, he said, exposing the details of his compromise maneuvers with the LDP, "I had an agreement with the LDP Executive Department, but they broke their promises," thus trying to pin responsibility on the LDP. It was unusual for Mr. Ozawa, who is known for being tight-lipped. That might very well be an indication of his sense of defeat and frustration. When the bills were rejected, Mr. Ozawa said as if to rouse himself to action, "Well then, it's one more round." To the reporters' question, "Is it a plan gone awry?" he answered three times, "Not yet, not yet, not yet." About the same time, the leaders who had gathered in the LDP's lower house secretary general's office broke out in cheers when they saw the rejection on television. But, just one person, Chairman Ryotaro Hashimoto of the Policy Affairs Research Council, rebuked them all, saying, "Don't whoop it up!" Mr. Ozawa's rival knows well what his "next move" will be.
