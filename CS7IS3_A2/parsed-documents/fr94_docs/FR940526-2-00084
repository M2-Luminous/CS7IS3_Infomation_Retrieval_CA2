FR940526-2-00084 FR940526-2-00057 b. After the death of the surviving spouse, amounts withheld due to the surviving spouse's foreign residence and deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3330(b), and amounts not paid as a result of 38 U.S.C. 5308 (which bars payment of non-contractual veterans' benefits to aliens located in the territory of an enemy of the United States), may only be paid in accordance with the accrued-benefit provisions of 38 U.S.C. 5121. Those provisions require that an application have been filed within one year of the surviving spouse's death. They also limit benefits to those to which the surviving spouse was entitled at death based on existing ratings or decisions or on evidence in the file on the date of death and only authorize payment of benefits due and unpaid for a period not to exceed one year. Effective date: February 8, 1994. O.G.C. Precedent 5&hyph;94 Questions Presented How, if at all, are the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 5101(a), 5110(a), and 5110(g) and 38 CFR 3.114(a) to be applied in establishing an effective date for service connection of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) based on an original claim made pursuant to 38 CFR 3.313? Held An effective date for service connection of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma under 38 CFR 3.313 may generally be based on the date of receipt by the Department of Veterans Affairs of an original claim for that benefit filed on or after August 5, 1964, regardless of whether the claim had previously been denied, if the claimant was otherwise eligible on the date of claim. As a practical matter, the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 5110(g) and 38 CFR 3.114(a) permitting payment of retroactive benefits for periods prior to the date of receipt of a claim under certain circumstances could not be applicable in determining the effective date of an award of service connection under ยง3.313 because no one could have met all eligibility requirements for benefits under ยง3.313 on its effective date of August 5, 1964. Effective date: February 18, 1994. O.G.C. Precedent 6&hyph;94 Questions Presented a. Prior to March 10, 1976, did Diagnostic Code 5296 contain a system for rating skull loss under which single skull holes were rated exclusively by comparison to coin size and multiple skull holes were rated exclusively based on reference to a specified area in square inches? b. If so, what was the rationale for such a system and was it legally supportable? Held a. Former Diagnostic Code 5296, as in effect prior to March 10, 1976, established a bifurcated system of assigning disability ratings for partial skull loss, under which ratings could be assigned either on the basis of the aggregate of two or more areas of skull loss or on the size of a single area of skull loss. Prior to the 1976 revision, this diagnostic code provided for assignment of a 50-percent rating where: (1) There were two or more areas of skull loss whose aggregate area exceeded 2 square inches, or (2) there was a single area of skull loss which was greater in size than a 50-cent piece. Similarly, the prior provisions of the diagnostic code provided a 30-percent rating where: (1) There were two or more areas of skull loss whose aggregate area exceeded 1 square inch, or (2) there was a single area of skull loss which was greater in size than a 25-cent piece.
