A discussion with FDP [Free Democratic Party of Germany] federal chairman Klaus Kinkel was disappointing for Rau. During the meeting, which had been planned months in advance and repeatedly postponed by the FDP because of an alleged lack of time, Kinkel promised Rau his sympathy and support, but made it clear that he felt obliged to recommend Union candidate Roman Herzog to the FDP electorate before the third round of voting. Kinkel assumed that most of his party colleagues will follow his example. This support for Herzog is essential, claimed Kinkel, otherwise, following the go-ahead to form a coalition with the Union, he might risk splitting the FDP and alarming the voters.
