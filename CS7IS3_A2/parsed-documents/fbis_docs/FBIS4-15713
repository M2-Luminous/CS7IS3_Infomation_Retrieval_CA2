The executive committee of the "TRUDOVAYA ROSSIYA" (LABOR RUSSIA) movement told ITAR-TASS that it recently adopted its own version of the agreement on accord in Russia. The movement is ready to sign the memorandum only if it accomodates their demands. Among those demands are: to immediately and unconditionally halt the "course on the restoration of capitalism in Russia, to restore the power of the Soviets everywhere, to immediately and unconditionally freeze and then lower prices on the main food products, to outlaw and prosecute speculating, and to restore the buying power of bank deposits as of the 1 January 1990 status." Georgy Gusev, the executive secretary of the "Civil Accord" committee, which was formed about three years ago, thinks the idea of an agreement on civil accord in Russia is good, however all the sides will hardly be able to reach a consensus on concrete points of the agreement. Overall, he said, the work on the draft agreement reminds one of the work on the 1991 union treaty and, therefore, may share the treaty's sad fate. The signing of the union treaty was prevented by the 1991 August attempted coup, then the agreement simply fell behind events.
