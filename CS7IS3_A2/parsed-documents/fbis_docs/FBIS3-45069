After China began pursuing the open policy, I met from time to time with Mr. Deng Xiaoping at meetings of the central government. I also had opportunities to meet with Chairman Mao Zedong, Premier Zhou Enlai and Marshal Zhu De. I met with CPC leaders when they needed an urgent discussion with me about the Chinese Government's policies. At the time, Mr. Deng asked us to make full use of our experiences to contribute to pushing for China's open up policy. In particular, Mr. Deng asked me to work to attract foreign capitals. I immediately visited Germany, France, Switzerland, Japan and the United States and Australia. I briefed people there on China's reform and open up policy and they responded to my briefing, saying the policy was fresh and splendid. I believe that the underlying strength, that has developed the China International Trust and Investment Corporation [CITIC] as it is today, is China's reform and open up policy. All employees of the CITIC have worked hard and foreign entrepreneurs have been convinced that there will be no change in China's reform and open up policy. I believe that these have contributed to the development of the CITIC. [Hajime Takano] Mr. Vice President, I would like to ask what role overseas Chinese have played in developing China's economy? [Rong Yiren] I believe that the issue of overseas Chinese is a very complicated one. Some overseas Chinese already hold dual citizenship. I hope that they will cooperate with China's economic development while abiding by laws of countries where they live. If those overseas Chinese hope to carry out economic and investment activities for China and countries where they live, we will of course welcome their hopes. [Takano] The creation of a grand China economic sphere has frequently been reported by newspapers and magazines. I would like to ask about the possibility of forging such an sphere. [Rong] Taiwan is part of China, and Hong Kong is set to revert to the Chinese rule in 1997. Macao, too, will revert to Chinese rule in 1999. These regions hope to build a cooperative relationship with China. We intend to discuss with people there how to develop the regions and China, while cooperating with them. We have never talked of a great China economic sphere. I do not think that China supports such a concept.
