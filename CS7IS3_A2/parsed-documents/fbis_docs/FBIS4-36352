He also called for an urgent Arab move led by Egypt to unify the Arab fold and clear the Arab air. The Iraqi foreign minister affirmed his country's readiness for a serious contribution in the future to any measures led by Egypt or the Arab League to clear the atmosphere and plan for a successful Arab summit. The sources added that Egypt told Iraq of the need to settle bilateral problems with Kuwait, especially the Kuwaiti prisoners, and to agree on a new method governing inter-Arab relations in the coming stage. AL-SHA'B learned that Egypt turned down an Iraqi plan to develop bilateral ties between the two countries through ministerial committees and that Egypt postponed discussion of any issues concerning bilateral cooperation to a later stage.
