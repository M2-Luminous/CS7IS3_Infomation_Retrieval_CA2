It was pointed out that after the State Duma's resolution on political amnesty, the parliamentary commission for investigations into these events had been dissolved. According to the Communist activists, this lets those responsible for the bloodshed avoid punishment. The Communist Party's plenum also addressed the Russian government with an open statement expressing concern over "unprecedented destruction of Russian agriculture." The statement emphasized that the current government's policy was making Russian agriculture insolvent since it was supporting foreign farmers. Communist Party activists believe that the issue must be discussed urgently before the situation gets out of control. This could trigger off unpredictable consequences, the statement said. The plenum adopted the party's draft program "From Crisis to Sustained Development." The program states that Russia must finally become a state with a socialist economy established after the nationalization of private property." The Communists stressed that a regime of personal presidential power had been set up in Russia after the new constitution had been adopted by a minority of the population. The Communist program considers it to be a "juridical and political confirmation of dictatorship by corrupted capital." The program of the Communist Party is to be submitted for consideration at the party's third congress this autumn.
