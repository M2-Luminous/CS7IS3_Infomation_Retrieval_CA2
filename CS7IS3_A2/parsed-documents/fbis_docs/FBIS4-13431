After the artillery shelling of the coastal city of Sidon, Zionist planes raided several areas in the south. Dozens of civilians were killed or wounded and a large number of houses were destroyed in the raids and the shelling. Despite these recent acts of aggression, which once again turned world attention to the developments in southern Lebanon and to the brutal Zionist policies there, Washington, in a public, biased step toward the usurper entity, called on the Lebanese Government to bring the situation under control. The U.S. Administration's message to the Lebanese Government yesterday, Friday, said Lebanon must take the necessary measures to calm the situation in the south and put an end to violence there. This, naturally, is not the first time Washington has adopted such a biased position in favor of Israel, despite all its flagrant violations of international law and its blatant aggression against Lebanon. Over the past 10 years Washington has persisted in its illegitimate support for Israel's occupation. The Zionist forces are occupying hundreds of square meters of Lebanese territory, deploying thousands of Zionist soldiers and officers in that area, which Israel calls a security belt. But this is not all: Tel Aviv has repeatedly invaded Lebanese territory, and its aggression has reached the Lebanese capital itself. The continuation of these acts of aggression deprive the Lebanese people of security and stability. Nevertheless, the United States insists on its support for this aggressor and usurper entity. Not only did the United States fail to condemn the Israeli aggression, but it also asked the Lebanese Government to apply effective pressure on the Islamic resistance movement in south Lebanon, the movement that fights the Zionist occupation from inside Lebanese territory. The United States, which gave several warnings to the Lebanese Government on this subject, forgot that the international public knows that self-defense is a right of any nation under foreign occupation. International laws give the Lebanese people the right to defend their land. These laws condemn Israel and its aggressive and expansionist policies. Israel is still disregarding Security Council Resolution 425 some 15 years after it was issued; the resolution says Israel must withdraw from the occupied Lebanese territories.
