Thank you for finding that report. It will help here for the people to realize that someone actually trusts us with something, after all the doubting Thomases we have here. Their mistrust is unfounded. But you see, there are other people who can see it from a distance and who can see that everything is all right. The minute I got here a magazine from Israel telephoned me asking for an explanation of all this, citing the article from THE ECONOMIST, you see. [Petrovic] Can we expect an Israeli economic or financial magazine to publish soon an exchange list that will have our dinar on it? [Avramovic] I am certain that this will go further. The next paper to carry it will be THE HERALD TRIBUNE. [Petrovic] Can you please comment on the fact that this [USA TODAY] exchange list literally carries our exchange rate concerning the dollar, that is, the German mark? [Avramovic] Yes, yes. Exactly. They have put here foreign currency [two words in English], it says 1.71 per dollar, which is our official exchange rate. The dollar has weakened against the German mark, so this is exactly right, according to parity. [Petrovic] What does this mean in practical, concrete terms? [Avramovic] In practice it means that we will most likely appear -- at this price, or very close to this price -- in exchange offices worldwide. This practically means that when you travel to Switzerland and so on, you will be able to go to the Union de Banque Suisse and sell your dinars there, and not at some scandalous price either. First it will appear, then there will be some margin, and then the margin will drop -- if everything continues to go well here. It also works the other way around. You will buy dinars there. They will become a thing to buy and sell in the world. That will solve the problem of the internal convertibility -- and I do not know who invented that -- that is stupid, you see. It is either convertible or not, it either has value or not. If it has value, then it has value both here and in Milan. If it has no value, then it has no value either here or in Milan. Then soon, it will inevitably appear in Vienna, in Zurich, then it will appear in New York.
