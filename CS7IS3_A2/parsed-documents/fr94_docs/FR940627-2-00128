FR940627-2-00128 FR940627-2-00052 In the absence of any request for hearing, the provisions specified in Section IV above shall be final 20 days from the date of this Order without further order or proceedings. An answer or a request for hearing shall not stay the immediate effectiveness of this order. VI In addition to issuance of this Order Suspending License No. 49&hyph;27356&hyph;01, the Commission requires further information from the Licensee in order to determine whether the Commission can have reasonable assurance that in the future the Licensee will conduct its activities in accordance with the Commission's requirements or, lacking such assurance, whether the Commission should proceed to revoke the license. Accordingly, pursuant to sections 161c, 161o, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's requirements in 10 CFR 2.204 and 10 CFR 30.32(b), in order for the Commission to determine whether License No. 49&hyph;27356&hyph;01 should be revoked, or other enforcement action taken to ensure compliance with NRC regulatory requirements, the Licensee is required to submit to the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, within 20 days of the date of this Order and Demand for Information, the following information, in writing and under oath or affirmation: A. State way, in light of the violations and managerial failures discussed in II and III above, NRC License No. 49&hyph;27356&hyph;01 should not be revoked. B. State why, in light of the facts described above, an order should not be issued to Mr. Wicks as an individual prohibiting Mr. Wicks from performing NRC-licensed activities. In addition, if an order is not issued to prohibit Mr. Wicks from performing NRC-licensed activities, then why should the NRC have confidence Mr. Wicks will comply with Commission requirements. Copies also shall be sent to the Assistant General Counsel for Hearings and Enforcement at the same address, and to the Regional Administrator, NRC Region IV, 611 Ryan Plaza Drive, Suite 400, Arlington, Texas 76011&hyph;8064. After reviewing your response, the NRC will determine whether further action is necessary to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 16th day of June 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Hugh L. Thompson, Jr., Deputy Executive Director for Nuclear Materials Safety, Safeguards, and Operations Support.
