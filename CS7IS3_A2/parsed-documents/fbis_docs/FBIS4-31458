FBIS4-31458 "dreeu111__a94027" FBIS-EEU-94-111-A Daily Report 6 Jun 1994 ANNEX Slovakia Kovac Adviser Supports Sudeten Germans Kovac Adviser Supports Sudeten Germans AU0606160194 Prague CTK in English 1338 GMT 6 Jun 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0606160194 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Bratislava June 6 (CTK) -- Imrich Kruzliak, whose recent statement as an external adviser to the Slovak president that the Czech Republic should recognise Sudeten Germans' right to homeland, has aroused a great response, believes that the Germans should acquire this right as a "moral satisfaction." He made the former statement at the Sudeten German congress held in Nuremberg in mid-May. The latter statement he made in an interview with CTK. "I wish the Sudeten Germans gain understanding on all sides and acquire the right to their homeland," Kruzliak told CTK. "It is impossible either to blame Sudeten Germans for the Munich Agreement or condemn them on the principle of collective guilt. Not only the Landsmannschaft but also official German representatives require a solution to the problem," he stated. "The older generations are dying out. They will not return to the Czech Lands. The young people apparently have no strong relation to the Czech Republic," Kruzliak commented on the Czech fears of the return of Sudeten Germans to the Czech Lands. "None of them insist on the revision of borders," he said, adding that the question of Sudeten German rights to homeland could be settled by a sort of ethnic minority rights codex, whose adoption is being considered by the Council of Europe, the United Nations and the European Union (EU). "I would be glad if Czech journalists found the courage to admit the truth about history," Kruzliak said in reaction to "distorted information" in the press, which pointed to his presence in Nuremberg. He resolutely denied the idea that the statement he had made in Nuremberg on Sudeten German rights was a call for the abolition of the Benes Decrees (providing for the transfer of Sudeten Germans from Czechoslovakia after World War Two). "The Benes Decrees cannot be simply cast off," he said. "I was invited to the (Nuremberg) congress as a private person," Kruzliak stressed. He added that Sudeten German leader Franz Neubauer had introduced him as an adviser to the Slovak president by error. "I am nearing my eighties and I wanted to use the opportunity to thank the Landsmannschaft (SL) for its support from the time of the communist oppression and for the presentation of SL's European Charles Prize to the former Chairman of the World Congress of Slovaks Stefan Roman in 1986," Kruzliak explained. He described as "ridiculous" the information by the Czech left-leaning daily RUDE PRAVO that he and Neubauer embraced and kissed. "This is not usual in the West. We always used to laugh at the kisses exchanged between former East German and Russian top leaders (Erich) Honecker and (Leonid) Brezhnev," added Kruzliak, who lived in emigration for 40 years. Jan Klepac, who is in charge of the staff of external advisors and consultants of Slovak President Michal Kovac, said that the "Slovak Presidential Office does not believe that Imrich Kruzliak appeared in Nuremberg on behalf of the head of the (Slovak) state, and Kruzliak does not claim such a position." "We should not waste time in discussing the fact that somebody quoted Kruzliak as having said something he has never said," Klepac commented on Kruzliak's alleged statement on the abolition of the Benes Decrees.
