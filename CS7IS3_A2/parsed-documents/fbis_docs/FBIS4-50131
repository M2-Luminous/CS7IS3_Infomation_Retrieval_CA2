Leading comrades of the State Council, including Li Peng, Li Lanqing, Chen Junsheng, and Luo Gan, met today at Zhongnanhai with representatives from the Third National Forum on Developing Animal Husbandry in Farm Zones. Li Peng said: In developing agriculture, it is not only necessary to do a good job in grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crop production, but also to develop diverse operations to increase farmers' incomes. Cattle-raising is a good way to increase farmers' incomes. He added: Using straw as animal feed may promote development of the cattle industry and development of relevant processing industries. The cattle industry can be said to be a type of ecological farming. Using straw to feed cattle and turning cow dung into fertilizer will benefit the virtuous cycle of farming. In developing the cattle industry, he suggested combining the methods of collective, large-scale cattle breeding with individual cattle raising, bringing superior labor resources into play, placing more emphasis on scientific cattle-raising techniques, and modernizing the cattle industry. He also proposed developing the leather-making industry as there is a great market potential for leather products. He urged scientific, technological, and industrial departments to develop relevant machinery equipment so as to raise the industrial level of the leather-making industry. Li Peng stressed, seeing that as China has rich straw resources, that there is great potential for using straw to develop the cattle industry. He called on localities to adopt positive measures to further promote the use of straw to develop the cattle industry. State Councillor Chen Junsheng spoke at today's closing meeting about the great potential for developing animal husbandry in farm zones. He said when promoting the use of straw to develop the cattle industry throughout the nation, it is necessary to consolidate and further develop beef production areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Huang He [Yellow River]; to develop beef production areas in the northeast; to explore beef production in South China; to devote about eight years to launching a major drive to accelerate the development pace of the cattle industry; and to help raise China's total beef output to new heights. [passage omitted on cattle raising in Shandong, Henan, and other areas] A decision was also adopted at the current meeting to promote the use of straw for raising sheep. The nation's farm zones will experiment with using straw to raise sheep starting next year. [passage omitted on giving titles to advanced cattle-raising collectives and individuals]
