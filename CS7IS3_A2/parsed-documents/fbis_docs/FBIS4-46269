In this regard, the staff at the Belgian Embassy has been reduced to a minimum. Two gendarmes have acted as bodyguards for the ambassador and have protected the premises for six months now. An armored car is eagerly awaited and should arrive in the next few weeks. To reduce the risk of shots from the outside, the embassy wall has been raised almost a meter and fenced off. All entrances are being closely guarded. In the visa section, people are kept under strict surveillance by a guard until one of the two counters becomes free. For several months, no more than five people have been permitted in the room at any one time. The other applicants have to wait outside and come in one by one to submit their applications. Suspicious movements have been observed in recent days around a number of embassies, and rumors are circulating that the terrorists intend to attack foreign representatives. [passage omitted]
