FR940622-1-00010 FR940622-1-00003 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Office of Thrift Supervision 12 CFR Part 567 [No. 93&hyph;239] RIN 1550&hyph;AA71 Regulatory Capital: Common Stockholders' Equity AGENCY: Office of Thrift Supervision, Treasury. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Office of Thrift Supervision (OFS) proposes to amend its minimum regulatory capital regulations by revising the definition of the term ``common stockholders' equity.'' This proposed amendment will revise OTS's definition of common stockholders' equity in order to incorporate a recent change in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), made by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities (SFAS No. 115). DATES: Comments must be received on or before July 22, 1994.

Background Under OTS's capital rule, 12 CFR 567.1, common stockholders' equity, the primary component of core capital for most savings associations, includes items that are generally the same as the items that comprised GAAP equity, when the capital rule was adopted. Today's proposal would revise the OTS's definition of common stockholders' equity in order to incorporate a change in GAAP made by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, in May 1993, when it issued SAFAS No. 115. SFAS No. 115 requires that most debt and equity securities be reported at fair value, rather than at amortized cost. It supersedes SFAS No. 12, Accounting for Certain Marketable Securities. When SFAS No. 115 becomes effective, 1 unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities will be included in GAAP equity. On August 10, 1993, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council announced that it will adopt SFAS No. 115, and that it will require all federally supervised banks and savings associations to adopt SFAS No. 115. The OTS and the Federal banking regulatory agencies announced their intention to proposed amendments to their respective capital rules to make the rules reflect the accounting and reporting standards contained in SFAS No. 115. 1 SFAS No. 115 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1993. SFAS No. 115, however, includes early adoption provisions, under which savings associations may adopt its standards as early as June 30, 1993, depending on when their fiscal years end. Section 4(b)(2) of the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933 (HOLA), 12 U.S.C. 1463(b)(2), requires the OTS to prescribe accounting standards that ``incorporate [GAAP] to the same degree that such principles are used to determine compliance with regulations prescribed by the Federal banking agencies.'' The proposal revises the OTS definition of common stockholders' equity so that it will be consistent with the change in GAAP made by SFAS No. 115. It is similar to amendments the other Federal banking agencies have proposed to their respective capital rules in order to incorporate the modification of GAAP made by SFAS No. 115. II. Comment Solicitation The OTS solicits comment on all aspects of the proposal, but is particularly interested in comments on the following specific questions: 1. If the SFAS No. 115 unrealized gains and losses are included in regulatory capital, how should OTS include these adjustments in its calculations? a. Should SFAS No. 115 unrealized gains and losses be included in core capital for purposes of the leverage ratio requirement?
