As was announced by Janos Martonyi in Warsaw on 22 March, the request will be submitted in coordination with Poland. NEPSZABADSAG interviewed Martonyi on the background of this decision, among other things. [Szego] In the past the Hungarian wish has been expressed many times, namely that Brussels should not treat the East Central European states requesting EU membership as a bloc or a group; rather, their readiness for membership and the fulfillment of the requirements should be assessed. Considering this, it is rather unexpected that we are making this step together with Warsaw. [Martonyi] I do not think that any major change has taken place or that the announcement in Warsaw was unexpected. From the very beginning, we indicated that Hungary would consult with the Visegrad countries on the issue of handing in the membership request. We had already had consultations with Warsaw in connection with other talks, and this also included consultations between the relevant ministers. As a result of all these, the decision was made that we would submit our membership request essentially at the same time. [Szego] So not at the same time after all? [Martonyi] Due to technical reasons, it will not happen exactly at the same time. Instead of the originally planned 31 March, 1 April seems to be a definite date, and the Polish Government's statement of intent will come a few days after this at the latest. It has not yet been decided when Foreign Minister Olechowski will find a suitable time for travelling to Athens. Minor issues like Easter Friday falling on 1 April might also influence this, therefore, it is quite possible that this event will only take place on the following week. [Szego] Is the Warsaw government also past the phase of parliamentary approval? [Martonyi] The situation is different in Poland, they do not need a legislative decision, only a simpler parliamentary procedure has to be completed. This is planned for 25 March, therefore, by the end of the month they will also have finished the preparations. The essence of this procedure is that, in the name of the government, the foreign minister informs Parliament of the decision on presenting the membership request, then the parliamentary group leaders have five minutes each to comment on this issue. However, there is no voting, the chairman of parliament sums up the speeches, and then the session is closed. [Szego] Do we need to worry that, due to the heated debate that has developed in the European Union in connection with the membership of the European Free Trade Association [EFTA] countries, this is not the best time for new applicants to appear? For example, Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes simply said the other day that there is a "complete crisis" in the Union. [Martonyi] The current "mini crisis" has nothing to do with the presentation of the Hungarian request for membership, it is wise to separate these two issues. In addition to this, by the time the actual negotiations on membership begin -- at the end of 1996 or in 1997 at the earliest -- the European Union will have gone through many crisis periods. Therefore, this is an important step in the often mentioned long process of gaining membership that began in 1990: After handing in the request, we will be official candidates in a diplomatic, legal, and political sense.
