Largely deprived of logistical support, the PKK is also losing its leading cadres. Muslum Durgun, alias Dr. Baran, who was known to be [PKK leader] Abdullah Ocalan's right-hand man, recently committed suicide when the security forces cornered him during an operation. [Begin unidentified off-screen correspondent recording] The loss of logistical support is cited as the main thing causing the PKK to bleed. The organization has reportedly started sustaining losses, because it is finding difficulty in obtaining shelter, food, and militants. The latest example is the loss of Dr. Baran, who was known to be close to Ocalan. Dr. Baran, the so-called official responsible for Dersim [the Tunceli and Erzincan regions] Province, used a hand grenade to commit suicide when he was cornered in a clash with the security forces. The Interior Ministry announced that the militant using the alias Dr. Baran was found dead on 12 March 1994. According to available information, the PKK, which is gradually losing strength, is preparing for a show of force during the local elections. The PKK asked for a boycott of the elections. If the boycott succeeds, the PKK is expected to become active again to regain strength. But reports from the region show that the PKK's call for a boycott will not succeed. There is reportedly enthusiasm in party headquarters in east and southeast Anatolia three days ahead of the elections. Reports from the region indicate that the security forces have completed their preparations for dealing the final blow to the PKK soon after the local elections. [end recording]
