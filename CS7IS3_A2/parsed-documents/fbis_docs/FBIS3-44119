Radio Mozambique, however, learned from a Renamo source this morning that no date has been set yet for the Renamo leader's visit to South Africa. In the interview he granted to that radio station, Dhlakama said his visits to South Africa and other southern African countries are intended to help build a climate of postwar trust with the political parties and governments of those countries. The Renamo leader plans to visit the United States in the second half of February.
