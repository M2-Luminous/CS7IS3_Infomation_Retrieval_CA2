The UN secretary general, Butrus Butrus-Ghali, has asked NATO to authorize air strikes against Serb artillery in Bosnia following the mortar bomb attack on a crowded Sarajevo market place. Mr. Keating says the conflict is outside Australia's sphere of influence and a matter mainly for the United Nations and Europeans. He says Foreign Minister Gareth Evans will be seeking advice from the U.S. and Europe about their intentions and the prospects for a diplomatic resolution. [Begin Keating recording] Where any further consideration goes on the part of other participants in the United Nations about arming one side of the conflict against another, or, in fact, taking military action is a matter for a closer judgement than I think we are able to bring from this distance.
