This facility will include a group of hotels of various classes. The hotels will have 1,700 rooms. Talks in this regard are being held among the Africa-Israel Investments Limited [preceding name in English as heard], an Israeli investment and tourist affairs company managed by Mr. Shlomo (Groffmann) and two investment groups, one Palestinian and the other Jordanian. (Groffmann) said his firm is also in touch with investors in other Arab and Islamic states to launch economic and tourist projects in these states. This Israeli firm had concessions to manage the cartel of Holiday Inn hotels in Israel, a well-known international cartel. (Groffmann) added that his company has recently created a special framework that it called the peace tourism project, in cooperation with Dr. Yosef Hadas, who was the director general of the Foreign Ministry only a few months ago. The aim of this framework, he noted, is to launch joint tourism projects with Palestinians and neighboring Arab states. With regard to the Kaliya project north of the Dead Sea, it will extend over a tract of land with an area of 310 donums, territory completely owned by his company, and another tract, whose area totals 670 donums, one-third of which is owned by his company. The final cost of this project stands at $250 million.
