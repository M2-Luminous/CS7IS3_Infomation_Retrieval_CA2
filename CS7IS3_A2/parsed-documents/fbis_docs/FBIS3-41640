The examination of this report, on December 10-11 at the EC Summit in Brussels, will be a highly risky business. The Commission speaks of several hurdles that need to be cleared, otherwise EC activities could become totally paralysed. This year alone, the EC has repealed 158 proposals thought to be technical or politically out of date because of the subsidiarity principle. This first hurdle consists of making sure that this examination does not lead to a fresh in-depth debate and the possibility of controversial texts being called into question. Second, the simplification process is nonsensical unless the Commission has a free hand to negotiate international agreements and avoid duplication. Third, the EC has to decide just how far the EC's exclusive area of business extends, for there is every chance that ``the application of proportionality will meet resistance from some national administrations, which because of a lack of mutual confidence are anxious to obtain the most detailed regulations possible.'' The Commission also wants to extend the mutual recognition principle and to make better use of the way in which it delegates its powers of implementation. These conditions are nigh impossible. The enshrinement of the subsidiarity principle in the Maastricht Treaty was a highly political matter during the negotiations and the result of a difficult compromise between those seeking to extend EC activities and those resisting the idea. John Major was the main architect of the principle. The UK Prime Minister agreed to the proposal to enlarge the Community's areas of business only on condition that it would be compensated for by a control principle, namely subsidiarity. Because of the No vote in June 1992 during the first Danish referendum on the Maastricht Treaty, the principle became very popular in Denmark and Germany, even though on first sight it hardly seemed a vote-catching concept. It became so popular that at the Edinburgh Summit in December 1992 half a dozen or so pages of the European Council's conclusions were devoted to this subject. Over above the issue of political rehabilitation, this still leaves the basic problem: what is sought from Europe varies quite considerably from one Member State to another and from one national administration to another. ``Delegations which are most in favour of subsidiarity at a political level are those which call for harmonisation in the finest detail at legal level,'' notes the report.
