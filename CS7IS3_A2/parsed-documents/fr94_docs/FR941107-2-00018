FR941107-2-00018 FR941107-2-00006 Excluded from the scope of this investigation are primary magnesium anodes, granular primary magnesium (including turnings and powder), and secondary magnesium. Granular magnesium, turnings, and powder are currently classifiable under HTSUS subheading 8104.30.00. Magnesium granules and turnings (also referred to as chips) are produced by grinding and/or crushing primary magnesium and thus have the same chemistry as primary magnesium. Although not susceptible to precise measurement because of their irregular shapes, turnings or chips are typically produced in coarse shapes and have a maximum length of less than 1 inch. Although sometimes produced in larger sizes, granules are more regularly shaped than turnings or chips, and have a typical size of 2mm in diameter or smaller. Powders are produced from grinding and/or crushing primary magnesium and have the same chemistry as primary magnesium, but are even smaller than granules or turnings. Powders are defined by the Section Notes to Section XV, the section of the HTSUS in which subheading 8104.30.00 appears, as products of which 90 percent or more by weight will pass through a sieve having a mesh aperture of 1mm. (See HTSUS, Section XV, Base Metals and Articles of Base Metals, Note 6(b).) Accordingly, the exclusion of magnesium turnings, granules and powder from the scope include products having a maximum physical dimension ( i.e. , length or diameter) of 1 inch or less. The product subject to this investigation is currently classifiable under subheadings 8104.19.00 and 8104.20.00 of the HTSUS. Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope is dispositive. Period of Investigation The period of investigation is April 1, 1993, through March 31, 1994 for pure magnesium, and September 1, 1992, through March 31, 1994, for alloy magnesium. Nonmarket Economy Country Status The PRC has been treated as a nonmarket economy country (NME) in all past antidumping investigations (see, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Sebacic Acid from the PRC, 59 FR 28053, May 31, 1994). No information has been provided in this proceeding that would lead us to overturn this designation. Therefore, in accordance with section 771(18)(c) of the Act, we have treated the PRC as an NME for purposes of these investigations. Surrogate Country In accordance with section 773(c)(4) of the Act, we must, to the extent possible, value the factors of production in one or more market economy countries that (1) are at a level of economic development comparable to that of the non-market economy country, and (2) are significant producers of comparable merchandise. Accordingly, we considered potential surrogates that produce comparable merchandise. Although the material inputs used to produce magnesium and aluminum are different, according to both U.S. Bureau of Mines and Department of Commerce experts, both (1) are light metals in terms of molecular weight; (2) are electricity-intensive products; (3) are produced using an electrolytic process, and (4) share some common end uses ( e.g. , dye casting). Therefore, in these investigations, we have determined that aluminum constitutes comparable merchandise in the context of surrogate selection. The Department has determined that India and Indonesia are the countries most comparable to the PRC in terms of being significant producers of comparable merchandise (aluminum) and of overall economic development. (See October 21, 1994, Memorandum from the Office of Policy to the File.) However, our research indicates that electricity rates in India are relatively high as compared to other countries which produce electricity-intensive products. Because high industrial electricity rates normally are inconsistent with significant production of electricity-intensive products such as aluminum, we do not believe that India is an appropriate surrogate country for valuing the factors of production for these products. Accordingly, we have based foreign market value (FMV) on the values of the appropriate factors of production in Indonesia. We have obtained and relied upon published, publicly available information, wherever possible. Fair Value Comparisons In cases involving the PRC, the Department assigns a single rate to all PRC exporters unless a company establishes that it is entitled to a separate rate (see, for example, Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Silicon Carbide from the PRC (59 FR 22585, May 2, 1994)). In these investigations, we have assigned a single rate to all PRC exporters in each investigation. To determine whether sales of pure magnesium and alloy magnesium from the PRC to the United States were made at less than fair value, we compared the United States price (USP) to the FMV, as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice.
