FR941011-0-00056 FR941011-0-00015 40 CFR Part 52 [FL09049091095818a; FRL095067092] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans State: Approval of Revisions to Florida Regulations AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Direct final rule. SUMMARY: EPA is approving revisions to the Florida State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions were submitted to EPA through the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) on January 8, 1993. The revisions correct minor deficiencies in the Motor Vehicle Inspection Program (MVIP) and revise the air quality classifications to coincide with the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments in Florida's SIP. This plan has been submitted by the FDEP as an integral part of the program to achieve and maintain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. These regulations meet all of the requirements and therefore EPA is approving the SIP revisions. DATES: This direct final rule will be effective December 12, 1994, unless adverse or critical comments are received by November 10, 1994. If the effective date is delayed, timely notice will be published in the Federal Register ADDRESSES: Written comments should be addressed to: Alan Powell, Regulatory Planning and Development Section, Air Programs Branch, Air, Pesticides & Toxics Management Division, Region IV Environmental Protection Agency, 345 Courtland Street, NE., Atlanta, Georgia 30365.

Reference file FL0491095818. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On November 15, 1990, the President signed into law the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (CAA) includes new requirements for the improvement of air quality in ozone nonattainment areas. Under section 181(a) of the CAA, nonattainment areas were categorized by the severity of the ozone problem, and progressively more stringent control measures were required for each category of higher ozone concentrations. The basis for classifying an area in a specific category was based on the ambient air quality data obtained in the three year period 1987091989. The Jacksonville area (Duval County) was classified as transitional because it did not have any ozone violations; the Tampa/St. Petersburg (Hillsborough and Pinellas counties) area was classified as a marginal ozone nonattainment area, and the South Florida (Broward, Palm Beach, and Dade counties) area was classified as a moderate ozone nonattainment area. The CAA delineates the SIP requirements for ozone nonattainment areas based on their classifications in section 182. On January 8, 1993, Florida through the FDEP submitted a revision to the Florida SIP that made minor corrections to the emissions testing program and revised the air quality classifications to coincide with the CAA. The revisions address requirements of section 182 of the CAA. Rule 1709242, Motor Vehicles Emissions Standards and Test Procedures The regulation for this rule was originally approved March 3, 1992 (57 FR 7550). The revisions to this rule address several minor problems which have arisen during the first years of operation of the MVIP. Specifically, definitions have been changed to correct some ambiguity in testing requirements, and the pass/fail criteria for emissions testing are amended to test based on vehicle weight only instead of vehicle body type. The latter change was made to make the testing criteria consistent with the vehicle registration databases. The regulation also shortens the equipment calibration requirement time frame from 7 days to 72 hours and establishes specific training requirements for vehicle emissions inspectors. The Florida I/M regulation meets all of the pre-enactment guidance as required by section 182(a)(2)(b) of the CAA. Rule 1709275, Air Quality Areas These changes coincide with the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments definition for nonattainment areas. The rule specifies current ozone nonattainment areas and outlines redesignation procedures. These changes reaffirm EPA's promulgation of designations and classifications for areas of the country with respect to the NAAQS for ozone, CO, PM0910 and lead in accordance with the requirements of the CAA (56 FR 56694, November 16, 1991). Final Action The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this Federal Register publication, the EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action will be effective December 12, 1994, unless by November 11, 1994, adverse or critical comments are received. If the EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent document that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective December 12, 1994. The Agency has reviewed this request for revision of the federally-approved state implementation plan for conformance with the provisions of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments enacted on November 15, 1990. The Agency has determined that this action conforms with those requirements. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(1), petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by December 12, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(2).) This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214092225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for two years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for a revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq. , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. U.S. E.P.A. , 427 U.S. 246, 2560966 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).
