Participants in today's 6th meeting of "Slovaks Living in Southern Slovakia" appealed to President Michal Kovac and Slovakia's state bodies not to allow a possible anticonstitutional contents and consequences of the meeting which had been convoked by the Association of Towns and Villages of Zitny Ostrov (SMOZO) in Komarno, south Slovakia, on January 8. The alleged aim of the meeting is to create "a special status" (Hungarian minority's) territory in the nationally mixed south of Slovakia. According to earlier reports, a 100-man assembly is to be elected at the meeting. Most of the 560,000 ethnic Hungarians (11 per cent of Slovakia's total population) live in southern Slovakia. The appeal also calls for the passage of a law on the protection of the republic, a law on the protection of the state language and demands that at least one Slovak school be functioning in every community, something that ceases to be natural in southern Slovakia. The appeal demands that the resolutions in which the Slovak Parliament pledged to fulfil the CE recommendations made when Slovakia was admitted to the council on June 30, 1993, be revised. The recommendations include bilingual road signposts in ethnically mixed communities, the possibility to use Hungarian first names, and others. A second part of the document calls on ethnic Hungarians not to help foment conflicts between the Slovak and Hungarian population. The Surany meeting was attended by the deputy premiers, Jozef Prokes (Slovak National Party, SNS) and Roman Kovac (Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, HZDS), Culture Minister Dusan Slobodnik, chairman of Matica Slovenska cultural and educational organisation founded in 1863, Jozef Markus, deputy chairman of the Democratic Left Party, SDL) Pavol Kanis, and HZDS Deputy Chairman Augustin Marian Huska. Speakers at the meeting of 500-600 people expressed Slovaks' fears of alleged attempts by the Hungarian parties represented in the Slovak Parliament at gradual "ethnic cleansing" of southern Slovakia of Slovaks and subsequent revision of the state border with Hungary. Kovac stressed that the government would not allow any territorial-administrative rearrangement of Slovakia on the basis of the ethnic principle which would aim to expel Slovaks from newly created micro-regions and would soon initiate the conclusion of a treaty with Hungary on the inviolability of the state border.
