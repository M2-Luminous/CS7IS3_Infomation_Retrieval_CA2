FR940214-0-00029 FR940214-0-00004 FmHA feels it necessary to standardize the way need is calculated in order to provide some uniformity in market studies. The revised Exhibit A&hyph;8 outlines the sources of demand which will be accepted by the Agency. There was a discrepancy between this section and the Exhibit A&hyph;8 language in delineating sources of need. This section of the regulation has been changed to agree with the language of Exhibit A&hyph;8. Paragraph II.F Comment: One respondent suggested that the tax credit income information be provided with the application and not with the preapplication. FmHA response: Feasibility must be determined during the preapplication stage and the ranges of local incomes must be established at that time. For this reason, the Agency cannot change this requirement. Other discussions concerning tax credit incomes is found under ยง1944.215(w)(3). 50. Exhibit A&hyph;7 Paragraph III.C Comment: One respondent suggested adding a provision that the option to buy be with the current owner of public record. FmHA response: We agree with this suggestion and have added that provision. 51. Exhibit A&hyph;7 Paragraph IV.F Comment: One respondent objected to applicants who publicly bid their projects having to submit a Form FmHA 1924&hyph;13. One respondent felt that requesting this much detail information at the preapplication stage would not prove useful since cost estimates change markedly between preapplication and application. One respondent supported this section. FmHA response: FmHA's new cost tracking system will track the trade item costs of each project. The Form FmHA 1924&hyph;13 provides a breakdown of trade item costs which will readily facilitate the use of the cost tracking system. Otherwise, the value of the tracking system will be diminished, thus not allowing the Agency to establish cost data comparisons. Persons submitting bids must have prepared extensive cost estimates in preparing the bid. Therefore, we do not feel this will cause an undue burden on the contractor. 52. Exhibit A&hyph;8
