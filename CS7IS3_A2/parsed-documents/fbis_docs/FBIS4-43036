Officially, nothing has changed: Support for the European plan, without forcing the Muslims to accept a "shameful peace." However, there are a number of signals in the background to suggest that President Clinton has been convinced of the urgent need to find a political solution. At a meeting in Istanbul with his Atlantic alliance colleagues, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe was able to stress his satisfaction that "the United States has, for the first time, shown a very strong commitment to quickly arrive at a negotiated settlement." London is also said to hold this view, which would appear to have taken hold during Bill Clinton's recent visit to the Elysee [the French president's residence]. Reports from the French and American sides are consistent in underlining that, on this occasion, Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who favors a heavy-handed approach toward the Serbs, wisely chose to remain silent as President Clinton agreed with Francois Mitterrand on the need to impose the partition plan and that any lifting of the arms embargo would risk extending the conflict. An American colleague told us yesterday: "This is a subject of great controversy in Washington, not just between the Pentagon and the State Department, which is nothing new, but also in Congress, where the `lobbying war' is currently raging with reports of `ethnic cleansing,' and counterreports on `the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in the region.'" In fact, in recent weeks THE NEW YORK TIMES and THE WASHINGTON POST, while coming down hard on Serbian aggression, have been reporting on arms from Iran and the dispatch of new contingents of mujahidin to fight alongside the Muslims." As a result, the word sanctions has been revived to threaten negotiators blocking the path to peace. The Sword of Damocles certainly hit the mark when Germany hung it over Croatia, forcing Zagreb into a reconciliation with Sarajevo. THE NEW YORK TIMES, however, this time envisages a kind of reverse pressure, whereby the possibility of lifting an arms embargo on Belgrade would pressure the Muslims into accepting a compromise. In official Yugoslav circles, too, people are more or less convinced that "positive signals are, for the time being, being sent to the federal authorities." These include, according to a Serbian diplomat, "a degree of flexibility in applying sanctions. Import and export operations have become somewhat easier and we have even been able to ship 200 tonnes of raisins to, of all people, the Germans." The coming week should be very informative. The Russian-American-European "contact group" without the belligerents will pore over new maps for the partitioning of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The aim is to reconcile the "51/49" project with the territorial demands of Sarajevo. They may well map out "gray zones" based on the Unpas model for Krajina, in other words, regions that fall directly under UN control. Will there be a return to the reality of the French and British standpoints when the interludes of American air strikes and Russian deployment have been forgotten? It is not a glorious solution for the international community, nor an exultant situation for Bosnia-Herzegovina, but it may also be the birth of common sense....
