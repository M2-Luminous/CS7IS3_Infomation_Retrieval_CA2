FR940613-1-00030 FR940613-1-00004 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Parts 52 and 81 [WV9&hyph;1&hyph;6419, WV9&hyph;2&hyph;6425 FRL&hyph;4997&hyph;8] Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; Designation of Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes; Redesignation of the Charleston West Virginia Ozone Nonattainment Area to Attainment and Approval of the Area's Maintenance Plan AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: On November 13, 1992, the West Virginia Department of Commerce, Labor & Environmental Resources; Division of Environmental Protection; Office of Air Quality (WVOAQ) submitted a request to EPA to redesignate the Charleston moderate ozone nonattainment area (Kanawha and Putnam Counties) from nonattainment to attainment. On November 13, 1992, the WVOAQ also submitted a maintenance plan for the Charleston area as a revision to the West Virginia State Implementation Plan (SIP). On February 28, 1994, West Virginia submitted an update to its November 13, 1994 submittal. The EPA is proposing to redesignate the Charleston ozone nonattainment area from nonattainment to attainment and proposing to approve the maintenance plan submitted by the WVOAQ as a revision to the West Virginia SIP because the relevant requirements set forth in the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, have been met. This proposal to approve the redesignation is contingent upon West Virginia's submittal of a revision to its maintenance plan's provisions for implementation of contingency measures. These actions are being taken in accordance with the Act. The approved maintenance plan will become a federally enforceable part of the SIP for the Charleston area. DATES: Comments must be received on July 13, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be sent to Thomas J. Maslany, Director, Air, Radiation, and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region III, 841 Chestnut Building, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107. The state submittal and EPA's Technical Support Document (TSD) prepared on these proposed actions is available for public review at the above address and at the West Virginia Division of Environmental Protection, Office of Air Quality 1558 Washington Street, East Charleston, West Virginia, 25311&hyph;2599. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michael Dubowe at (215) 597&hyph;1109 or Todd Ellsworth at (215) 597&hyph;2906. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background The Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977 (1977 Act), required areas that were designated nonattainment based on a failure to meet the ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) to develop SIPs with sufficient control measures to expeditiously attain and maintain the standard. (1977 Act, sections 110(a)(1) and 172.) The Charleston, West Virginia nonattainment area was designated under section 107 of the 1977 Act as nonattainment with respect to the ozone NAAQS on September 12, 1978. (40 CFR 81.347) In accordance with section 110 of the 1977 Act, West Virginia submitted a part D ozone SIP on November 15, 1979 which EPA approved as meeting the requirements of section 110 and part D of the 1977 Act. In its SIP, the State of West Virginia projected that the Charleston, West Virginia nonattainment area would attain the ozone standard by December 31, 1982. The area failed to attain the standard. On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (hereafter the Act) were enacted. Public Law 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. The nonattainment designation of the Charleston, West Virginia area continued by operation of law according to section 107(d)(1)(C)(i) of the Act, furthermore, it was classified by operation of law as moderate for ozone pursuant to section 181(a)(1) of the Act. See 56 FR 56694 (Nov. 6, 1991) and 57 FR 56762 (Nov. 30, 1992), codified at 40 CFR 81.347. The Charleston, West Virginia ozone nonattainment area more recently has attained the ozone NAAQS, based on air quality data from 1989 through 1991. In an effort to comply with the Act and to ensure continued attainment of the NAAQS, on November 13, 1992 the WVOAQ submitted an ozone maintenance plan for the Charleston, West Virginia area as a revision to the West Virginia SIP. On November 13, 1992, the State of West Virginia also requested that EPA redesignate the Charleston, West Virginia area to attainment with respect to the ozone NAAQS. In addition, on February 28, 1994, West Virginia submitted an update to its November 13, 1992 submittal, collectively referred to hereafter as the ``State of West Virginia's redesignation request.'' II. Evaluation Criteria According to section 107(d)(3)(E) of the Act, five specific requirements must be met in order for EPA to redesignate an area from nonattainment to attainment: 1. The area must have attained the applicable NAAQS; 2. The area has met all relevant requirements under section 110 and part D of the Act; 3. The area has a fully approved SIP under section 110(k) of the Act; 4. The air quality improvement must be permanent and enforceable; and 5. The area must have a fully approved maintenance plan pursuant to section 175A of the Act.
