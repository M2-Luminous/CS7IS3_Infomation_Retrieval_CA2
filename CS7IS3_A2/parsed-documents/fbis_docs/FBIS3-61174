Kozhemyakin by Pavel Koltsov; place and date not given: "The Intelligence Officer Who Returned to the Cold: He Does Not Promise To Swell the Ranks of the Righteous and Miracle-Workers"] [Text] On 20 December 1990--Chekist Day--a minister-counselor of the Embassy of the USSR in Stockholm was summoned to the office of the chief of the Protocol Department of the Swedish Foreign Ministry. He was notified that Vladimir Kozhemyakin, third secretary of the embassy, had to leave the kingdom "for activity incompatible with his diplomatic status." That evening Lieutenant Colonel Kozhemyakin was returning to 31 Jorvelsgaten Street, to the Soviet Embassy, from a routine operation ("a meeting in the city"), still unaware that his mission in Sweden was over. This had been preceded neither by a foulup in work nor negligence, even. The chance of an intelligence professional being deported from a country always increases if he is an active worker. An analysis of the Center showed that Kozhemyakin's deportation was also in fact a "preventive action" of the SEPO Swedish counterintelligence. When, that inclement day around Christmas, the five-deck ferry Ilich, sounding its horn in the fog, approached the Leningrad moorings, Lieutenant Colonel V.N. Kozhemyakin (a native of Moscow, born in 1956, career officer of the KGB First Main Administration, member of the CPSU, married with two sons, from a serviceman's family) was in a state in which, in everyday language, his heart was not where it should be. For he had after long soul-searching adopted the firm decision to quit intelligence without waiting for a new assignment. He had written in his report that he had serious reasons for leaving the profession and testing his mettle in another field. In February 1991 V.N. Kozhemyakin, political adviser, showed up in the administrative system of the Supreme Soviet of Russia. The operations officer had become a desk analyst. Today Vladimir Kozhemyakin stands at No. 11 on the electoral slate of the PRES (Party of Russian Unity and Accord) and is running for the State Duma in Moscow's Tsentralnyy District 202. [Koltsov] You are a retired intelligence officer and fledgling politician. Do you feel yourself to be in the right place? [Kozhemyakin] I would not say that I have become a real politician. I will say only that the world of politics is tougher than that of intelligence. [Koltsov] When you handed in your discharge application, did the KGB turn its back on you? [Kozhemyakin] Far from all my colleagues in the First Main Administration approved of my decision. But nor did anyone try to throw a wrench in the works. I have kept up friendly relations with many of my fellow employees. We hoist a glass on Chekist Day. [Koltsov] The opinion has often been expressed that the KGB was called upon to defend the safe transformation of Soviet society ("perestroyka"), but failed to cope with this assignment. It is said that the KGB was inefficient, and reference is made to amateurish miscalculations in the performance of operations, in Vilnius, for example. What do you think about this? [Kozhemyakin] Truly, the KGB, as the powerful custodian of state interests, not only the untroubled dominion of the nomenklatura, was required to make smooth the risk-fraught maneuver from totalitarianism to an open society. And many people in the committee understood this. But there were in the leadership people who were living in the past. And if the authorities had to oppose nationalism and centrifugal forces, they should not have done so as ineptly as in Vilnius in January 1991, when, in addition, there was no one willing to assume responsibility for the mess. [Koltsov] When television is now showing old American movies about Soviet agents operating in the West, where they are portrayed as half-wits and criminals, what are your feelings? It is doubtful whether even the intelligent "Dead Season" has been shown on American television. Or is this self-flagellation also part of the course of "repentance" following totalitarianism? [Kozhemyakin] Even the penitent should show moderation. But on a broader plane I will answer with lines from our party program: "Russian culture cannot develop without extensive contacts with world culture, of which it is a part. But international terrorism in the sphere of culture supported by the mass media should be rebuffed at the level of official cultural policy. Limits on the permissible amount of television time used for showing foreign mass-culture programs should be established, at the 30 percent level." [Koltsov] Many foreign intelligence people have become defectors. And on almost every occasion this has coincided with the recall home of an agent at the end of an assignment or mistakes in his work. Does this not point to a dual mentality, when a person secretly identifies with the value system against which he is working? Or is there a more prosaic explanation? [Kozhemyakin] A traitor is a traitor. The not-unknown Gordiyevskiy, incidentally, was one of my first instructors in the First Main Administration. Intelligent, urbane.... But an alien soul--darkness. I believe that there were various motives behind his switch to the side of the enemy: self-interest, some scores with the authorities, unpleasantness at work, even. "Dostoyevskiyism" is not to be sought in such characters. In any event, in switching to the "other" side you give away your comrades and those who placed their trust in you. [Koltsov] You are on the slate of the PRES, the party of new state absolutists. Someone said that the PRES had jumped like the devil out of the snuff box, having performed some political somersault. People who died for the sake of democracy, the sovereignties, and the overthrow of the "imperial" paradigms made a complete about-face, becoming state absolutists, federalists, and geopoliticians.... [Kozhemyakin] I shall cite the eternal rightness of the well-known idea of self-determination in politics: Whoever in his youth was not a radical has no heart, whoever by his mature years has not become a conservative has no brain. The PRES appeared in the political arena not in connection with a particular occasion--the Duma elections. Had there not been elections tomorrow, this conservative and constructive current among democrats would have detached itself and presented a program of new federalism all the same. In my view, the PRES embodies a coming of age in Russian politics. [Koltsov] If you had to confess, what sins in the field of intelligence and politics would you acknowledge? [Kozhemyakin] Like all Soviet employees, I am guilty of the sin of padding. I would have recourse in my reports from Stockholm to the Center to the following subterfuge. By the method of analysis of information flows I would extract valuable and reliable information and attribute it to a specific "source," that is, a foreigner who was being cultivated. I am sure that this is a sin of all the world's intelligence services, for that matter. And I have not yet amassed any mortal sins in politics on account of the brevity of my length of service. [Koltsov] The West is dismayed at how far the democrats in Moscow have gone in defending their policy against malcontents. In turn, there are hardly any people left here who ardently believe that the establishment of representative democracy in Russia is a sacred goal of the West. Does it not seem to you that we were all of a far more "pro-West" frame of mind in the so-called stagnation years than today, when Moscow and Washington are on intimate terms with one another? I refer not to politicians, but to the mood among the people.... [Kozhemyakin] There is no denying it: I myself am less of a "pro-West" frame of mind than when I worked in Stockholm. We are certainly over the period of euphoria at the surmounting of the confrontation with the Western world. There is coming to be an understanding that both the fate and interests of each are unique, although there are many common nonmaterial values. Henceforward, I am not wrong here, I believe: If we are of a pro-Russia frame of mind, we will be more quickly understood. [Koltsov] To what did the president refer, in your view, when he told Ryazanov that at the time of the events of 3-4 October the Ministry of Security occupied a position of noninterference and was "protecting itself"? [Kozhemyakin] It would have been far worse and more dangerous had the Ministry of Security displayed undue zeal those days in October. Consequently, democratic instincts are taking hold in our society. It is a bad omen for a normal society when the special services acquire a taste for participation in domestic political opposition. [Koltsov] All parliamentary candidates say that they will do good things for the electorate if they obtain a mandate. But to put the issue the other way about: What would you, as a deputy, not do under any circumstances? [Kozhemyakin] I would not promise prosperity in one constituency by itself and I would not swear that the voucher is a particularly valuable piece of paper and that I would in parliament swell the ranks of the righteous and the miracle-workers.
