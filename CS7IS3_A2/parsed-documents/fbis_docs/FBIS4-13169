FBIS4-13169 "drnes074_l_94014" FBIS-NES-94-074 Daily Report 17 Apr 1994 ISRAEL Update on Contacts With Syria, Jordan Update on Contacts With Syria, Jordan TA1704065194 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English 0400 GMT 17 Apr 94 TA1704065194 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el English BFN [Excerpts] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says that without secret talks with Syria, a peace agreement cannot be reached. In an interview with the Cairo newspaper AL-AHRAM, Rabin says Israel had tried to arrange secret meetings with Syrian leaders, but they had refused. In the interview, Rabin accused Syria of talking peace, while simultaneously supporting Palestinian organizations opposed to negotiations. Major General Ilan Biran, who today takes over as the head of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] Central Command, has presented Prime Minister Rabin with a working paper on security arrangements on the Golan. Biran discussed the issue with the prime minister and with Chief of Staff Baraq on Friday and on a previous occasion. [passage omitted] [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 17 April reports: "Israel has expressed its displeasure over the harsh criticism Syria had leveled at Oman for its willingness to host an Israeli delegation. Our correspondent in Washington Arye Golan reports that Professor Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's ambassador to the United States, spoke to U.S. coordinator Dennis Ross on the matter, and told him that the Syrian remarks do not contribute to the establishment of a proper atmosphere in view of the upcoming Middle East tour by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, and toward the resumption of the peace talks."] The Prime Minister's office in Jerusalem says there were contacts involving Syria, after katyusha rockets landed in Israel, during the early hours of Friday morning. Jerusalem says those contacts brought quiet to the Israeli side of the border over the Sabbath, even if katyushas did land in southern Lebanon. [Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew on 17 April carries a report by Ron Ben-Yishay on pages 1 and 15, adding: "Over the weekend, the Israeli Government relayed a warning to Hizballah and Syria that if murderous attacks on the SLA [South Lebanese Army] and Lebanese civilians in the security zone continue, the IDF will feel free to ignore the understandings made after Operation Accountability last summer." The report adds that "there is growing concern among Israel's top security echelons that the SLA might gradually disintegrate, physically and morally, and that the security zone in south Lebanon might crumble."] Also at the Prime Minister's Office, there is expectation for more progress with the PLO on Gaza-Jericho first, as the Israelis prepare for the resumption of those talks today. If the Palestinians raise the issue of the closure of the territories imposed a week and a half ago, an official in Jerusalem said last night they will be told that the possibility of lifting restrictions has been and will continue to be checked on a constant basis, including at this morning's cabinet meeting. There is no reaction in Jerusalem to King Husayn's news conference on Hamas. Prime Minister Rabin's media adviser 'Oded Ben-'Ami says Israel will know whether in fact Jordan has acted against Hamas operations in the country, based on whether or not we hear from the Hamas people in Jordan again. For now, says Ben-'Ami, we have said what we wanted to say.
