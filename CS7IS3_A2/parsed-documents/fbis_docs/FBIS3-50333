The result indicates a traditionally high level of popularity, one that cannot be achieved by other institutions or any individual in Bulgaria! The president, who enjoys the confidence of 49 percent of the respondents, continues to lead the list of politicians, followed by Aleksandur Tomov, Georgi Pirinski, and Lyuben Berov. The police maintain the popularity figure of 43 percent that they reached at the end of last year. Of those polled, 27 percent have faith in the government, while parliament's rating continues to be low -- only 12 percent. Despite this, more than half of the 19 most popular politicians are National Assembly deputies.
