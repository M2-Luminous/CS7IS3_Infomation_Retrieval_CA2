ACTION: Notice; request for comments. SUMMARY: The Department of Transportation solicits public comment on a third draft of a National Program Plan (the Plan) for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), formerly called Intelligent Vehicle-Highway Systems (IVHS). ITS applies advanced technologies such as information processing, communications, and electronics to surface transportation needs. The Plan is being developed based on a set of user services, each of which is designed to respond to the needs of particular users. The draft Plan attempts to integrate Federal, State, local government, and private sector activities in a single document to present a coherent picture of how the public and private sectors will work together to achieve ITS program goals. The Plan seeks to reflect the consensus view of all parties interested in the development and deployment of ITS. DATES: Comments on the November 1994 draft are due December 30, 1994. Comments received after that date will be considered to the extent possible. ADDRESSES: Comments should be sent to: Docket Clerk, Docket No. 94&hyph;2, room 4232, United States Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, D.C. 20590.
