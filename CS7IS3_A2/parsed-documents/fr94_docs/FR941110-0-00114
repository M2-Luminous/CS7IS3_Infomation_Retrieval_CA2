FR941110-0-00114 FR941110-0-00016 Several providers noted that residents could suffer transfer trauma, the facility's business could be destroyed, and facility employees could lose their jobs, none of which could be restored if the facility were ultimately successful on appeal. A few commenters noted that a prior hearing is often the only safeguard against a mistake or incorrect judgment of a less experienced surveyor. A few people commented that when penalties become incrementally more severe for repeated non-compliance, and imposition of penalties takes into account a facility's compliance history, the need for hearings becomes more critical. A few commenters urged that facilities be given an opportunity to correct deficiencies before any remedy is imposed. Response: We believe that post-sanction hearings are entirely compatible with due process. Courts that have addressed this issue have concluded that, because the facility has numerous opportunities to prevent mistakes from occurring and to present its side of the story both during the survey process, at the exit interview, and by submitting written statements and a plan of correction, due process is satisfied by the availability of post-sanction hearings. See, for example Case v. Weinberger, 523 F.2nd 602 (2nd Cir. 1975), Caton Ridge Nursing Home v. Califano, 596 F.2d 608 (4th Cir. 1979), Green v. Cashman, 605 F.2d 945 (6th Cir. 1979), Northlake Community Hospital v. United States, 654 F.2d 1234 (7th Cir. 1981), Geriatrics, Inc. v. Harris, 640 F.2d 262 (10th Cir. 1981), cert. denied 454 U.S. 832, 102 S.Ct. 1295. Although the Supreme Court has not directly decided the issue of due process requirements when a provider is terminated, the Court has decided in O'Bannon v. Town Court, 447 U.S. 773, 100 S.Ct. 2467 (1980), that residents are not entitled to a pre-termination hearing. The Court reached this result notwithstanding the fact that residents were the intended beneficiaries of the provider agreement through their entitlement to high quality care. Moreover, consistent with the balancing of interests formula first enunciated by the Supreme Court in Mathews v. Eldridge, 434 U.S. 319 (1976), we have concluded, first and foremost, that the private interest that facilities have in their continued participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs must give way to the Government's interest in protecting the health and safety of the resident population. Additionally, in light of the opportunities available to providers to question the accuracy of survey findings at various points during the survey process including during the survey, exit conference, and through informal meetings with State or Federal officials, we believe that the chances for an erroneous deprivation are quite small when compared to the enormous delay in the correction of noncompliance that could occur were hearings to be routinely held prior to the institution of remedies. The use of an informal dispute resolution process, to be discussed later in this preamble, should serve to reduce even further the chances of an erroneous deprivation. Apart from the support of case law, the nursing home reform statutory provisions clearly reflect the desire expressed in the enactment's legislative history that remedies be applied swiftly once deficiencies are identified. Specifically, sections 1919(h)(2)(A) and (h)(3)(C) of the Act require that when States and the Secretary develop criteria detailing the manner in which remedies are to be imposed that they be designed so as to minimize the time between the identification of violations and final imposition of the remedies. Additionally, section 1919(h)(8) of the Act specifies that States may impose a denial of payments for new admissions, temporary management, and facility closures during the pendency of any hearing. We believe it would be incompatible with these pronouncements were we to devise an appeal scheme that would provide for hearings before the imposition of remedies. Moreover, we conclude that this is the case regardless of whether the facility's deficiencies pose immediate jeopardy to resident health or safety since the Act makes no distinction on this basis and because the delay in imposing remedies once noncompliance has been identified could be considerable. Comment: One commenter stated that residents should have the right to remain in their nursing homes until after the alleged deficiencies are substantiated. Response: The Supreme Court has addressed the issue of the right of residents to a pre-termination hearing when the nursing home in which they reside loses its Medicaid agreement ( O'Bannon v. Town Court, 447 U.S. 773, 100 S. Ct. 2467 (1980)). The Court noted that although termination may be harmful to some residents, residents are moved to a complying nursing facility for their own benefit, so that they can obtain the care to which they are entitled as Medicaid residents. The Court noted that Medicaid residents who are forced to move may have difficulty locating other homes they consider suitable or may suffer both emotional and physical harms as a result of the disruption associated with their move, and might have a claim for damages against the nursing home, yet they would not have any claim against the government for deprivation of an interest in life, liberty or property (Id. 447 U.S. at 788, 100 S.Ct. at 2476).
