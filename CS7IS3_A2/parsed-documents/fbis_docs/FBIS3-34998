It approved several bills on its agenda and referred an urgent bill to the Chamber of Deputies to amend the salaries of teaching staff at the Lebanese University. Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz advised the Cabinet on the content of a message he received from U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher warning against the resumption of violence in south Lebanon and western al-Biqa'. The message considers violence to be very dangerous and potentially harmful for the peace process. We will now hear the Cabinet's resolutions as announced by acting Information Minister Muhsin Dallul. [Begin recording] [Dallul] Upon the invitation of Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri, the Cabinet held its weekly session this morning chaired by His Excellency President Ilyas al-Hirawi. At the outset, his excellency spoke of the recent crime perpetrated in Ba'labakk [killing of a woman and her two sons by a young boy, who was later executed by Hizballah according to Islamic shari'ah] and the messages addressed to the government demanding that it protect the Constitution. The prime minister said that the justice minister did his duty as best he could and that the Public Prosecution Office has been notified to apply the law. Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz advised the Cabinet that he received a message from the U.S. secretary of state warning against a resumption of violence in south Lebanon and western al-Biqa'. The message considers that an escalation of the situation would be very serious and could harm the peace talks. The message also said there is a need for self-restraint because violence runs counter to the positive atmosphere that prevailed at the Geneva summit conference. Christopher concluded his message by saying the continuing military escalation can't be accepted because it might torpedo the peace process. In line with the justice minister's proposal, the crime of the killing of Jordanian diplomat Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah has been referred to the Judicial Council. [passage omitted] [Unidentified Correspondent] What about the Lebanese stance on the U.S. message? How will the government respond to the Israeli escalation in the south? [Dallul] The discussions at the Cabinet meeting noted that it is Israel that constantly escalates the situation, that the fedayeen operation that targeted Israeli soldiers was carried out in the border strip and on Lebanese territory, and that as long the Israeli occupation continues, the government cannot halt any Lebanese group that wants to confront the occupation by any available means. [Correspondent] How do you view the timing of the U.S. message, especially as it coincides with talk about Israel proposing to the Lebanese negotiating delegation in Washington the formation of joint military committees? [Dallul] We have rejected the formation of any committees that do not stem from a program for Israeli withdrawal and we hold on to this stance because we are dutybound to defend our rights as people and as a homeland. [Correspondent] Do you expect a large-scale Israeli military operation? [Dallul] We expect anything from Israel, but everything has a price. Israel will pay for any action it may take. [Correspondent] [words indistinct] the General Labor Federation? [Dallul] No, no one proposed it. [Correspondent] Did the prime minister brief you about [word indistinct] meeting? [Dallul] No. [Correspondent] [words indistinct] your request tasking the Internal Security Forces with supervising soccer matches? [Dallul] He rejected the request and insisted that the Army continue this task. [Correspondent] Given the Israeli threats and aggression in the south, [words indistinct] the U.S. [words indistinct] to stop resistance, what is the fate of the peace talks? [Dallul] The peace talks will continue and as long as the Israeli forces occupy Lebanon the resistance will continue. [end recording]
