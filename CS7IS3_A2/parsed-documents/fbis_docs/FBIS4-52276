Judge O Se-ip threw out the suit by the alliance, which was seeking 300 million won in compensation from the president for alleged damages caused by Kim's description of it as an organization sympathetic to communism during the presidential election campaign in 1992. "The alliance, as an unincorporated association, is not entitled to bring a civil suit," O said. "Even though the alliance had the outward appearance of being an organization with a name, an organizational network and operational functions, it could not be a plaintiff in a civil suit because it was not incorporated as an association," he said. The alliance had accused Kim Yong-sam of "wrongly damaging" its reputation by describing its member organizations as followers of North Korean President Kim Il-song's "chuche" ideology. The alliance filed the suit on Jan. 12, 1993.
