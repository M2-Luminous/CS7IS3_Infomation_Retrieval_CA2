FR940711-1-00010 FR940711-1-00003 II. Public Reporting Burden The proposed rule specifies filing requirements to be followed by public utilities seeking to recover stranded costs. The information collection requirements of the proposed rule are attributable to FERC&hyph;516 ``Electric Rate Filings''. The current total annual reporting burden for FERC&hyph;516 is 783,700 hours. The proposed rule requires public utilities seeking to recover stranded costs to provide certain information to the Commission. The public reporting burden for the information collection requirements contained in the proposed rule is estimated to average 50 hours per response. This estimate includes time for reviewing the requirements of the Commission's regulations, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the necessary data, completing and reviewing the collection of information, and filing the required information. There are approximately 200 public utilities. The Commission estimates that approximately ten of these utilities will respond to the information collection annually. The respondents would be public utilities who seek to recover stranded costs. The information will be collected on an annual basis. Accordingly, the public reporting burden is estimated to be no more than 500 hours. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of the Commission's collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services Division, (202) 208&hyph;1415], and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget [Attention: Desk Officer for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]. III. Discussion A. Background Historically, electric utilities entered into long-term contracts to make wholesale requirements sales (bundled sales of generation and transmission) to municipal, cooperative and investor-owned utilities. Under these contracts, utilities often committed to provide all (full requirements) or part (partial requirements) of a customer's power needs for the contract period. Although these wholesale requirements contracts are typically for defined terms, they often were rolled over or extended when the contract term expired. The historical supply relationship between utilities and their wholesale requirements customers, however, has begun to undergo significant change as a result of increased competition in wholesale power generation and greater customer access to transmission services. Increased competition in wholesale power generation began with the enactment of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA). 10 PURPA provided incentives for the development of alternative generation sources known as qualifying facilities (QFs). In addition, state-approved competitive bidding programs paved the way for the growth of non-traditional utility generators. Finally, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Energy Policy Act) 11 provided regulatory exemptions to encourage a new class of wholesale power producers known as exempt wholesale generators (EWGs). 10 16 U.S.C. 2601, et seq. 11 Pub. L. 102&hyph;486, 106 Stat. 2776 (1992). As competition in wholesale power generation has increased, so has the ability of customers to gain access to the transmission services necessary to reach competing suppliers. In earlier years, a few customers were able to obtain access as a result of court proceedings, beginning with the Supreme Court's decision in Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, 410 U.S. 366 (1973). In recent years, a growing number of public utilities voluntarily agreed to file transmission tariffs of general applicability, i.e., tariffs that permit transmission access for any entity that will be making sales for resale of electric energy. 12 In most instances, access was provided in order to obtain Commission approval of a merger or consolidation 13 or Commission authorization of market-based rates for generation services. 14 The Commission, in many instances, conditioned its approval of certain mergers upon transmission access in order to mitigate potential anticompetitive effects. 15 12 See, e.g., Entergy Services, Inc., 58 FERC ¶ 61,234, order on reh'g, 60 FERC ¶ 61,168 (1992), appeal pending sub nom.

Northeast Utilities Service Company v. FERC, Nos. 92&hyph;1165, et al. (1st Cir. May 19, 1993). The trend toward greater transmission access has been accelerated by the passage of the Energy Policy Act, which substantially expanded the Commission's authority to order transmission services. Under amended section 211 of the FPA, the Commission may order wholesale transmission services, upon application, to any electric utility, Federal power marketing agency, or any other person generating electric energy for sale for resale. 16 Thus far, the Commission has granted requests for mandatory transmission services pursuant to section 211 in five of the six cases it has acted on, including four proposed orders and one final order. In addition, several public utilities have filed voluntary wholesale transmission tariffs subsequent to the passage of the Energy Policy Act. 17 16 Under section 212(h), no order issued by the Commission shall be conditioned on or require the transmission of electric energy to an ultimate consumer or to a ``sham'' wholesale customer. However, the Commission may order services to a ``non-sham'' wholesale customer, e.g., a person having an obligation under State or local law to provide electric services to the public and who would utilize transmission or distribution facilities that it owns or controls to deliver all such electric energy to such electric consumer. 17 See, e.g., American Electric Power Service Corporation, 67 FERC ¶ 61,168 (1994); Commonwealth Edison Company, 65 FERC ¶ 61,288 (1993), order on reh'g, 67 FERC ¶ 61,325 (1994); Florida Power & Light Company, 64 FERC ¶ 61,361 (1993), order on policy issues, 66 FERC ¶ 61,227 (1994), order on reh'g, 67 FERC ¶ XXX (1994); Northern States Power Company (Minnesota) and Northern States Power Company (Wisconsin), 67 FERC ¶ 61,240 (1994).
