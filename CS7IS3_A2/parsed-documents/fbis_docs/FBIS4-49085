The visit was the first of its kind ever arranged for Hong Kong compatriots. During their stay in Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province, the delegation paid a visit to the headquarters of the Guangzhou Military Region, where they were warmly received by the region's top officers. The 200-member-strong delegation, which mainly comprised public figures from various circles of Hong Kong, toured the barracks and watched a military performance in the northeastern suburbs of Guangzhou City. The well-trained soldiers of the PLA and their skills and colorful life in the barracks have deeply impressed the delegation. Many of the visitors believed that such tours could promote the communication and understanding between the PLA in the Chinese mainland and people in Hong Kong.
