He said: Although you are unwell, receiving treatment, you have not forgotten my birthday and have come to congratulate me. This moves me deeply. From this I feel warmly again how sincere and cordial our friendship and fraternity are. In spring, in April, every year we have met and shared our inmost feelings, but this year's reunion is more significant than ever. This is the first historic visit you are paying to my country since you came to the throne of the Kingdom of Cambodia. It is an eventful visit on which you have brought with you the fresh news of Cambodia which has greeted the spring of her revival. Today, in support of esteemed Your Majesty's noble patriotic cause, the Cambodian people are working hard to promote national reconciliation and unity, rebuild their country and create a new life. The Kingdom of Cambodia has already established state relations with many countries, and her international position is daily rising. The changes and great successes being made in Cambodia are unthinkable apart from the leadership of Your Majesty esteemed King Norodom Sihanouk, the outstanding patriot and pre-eminent statesman of Cambodia and the father of the Khmer nation. With an intense love for your country and an unbreakable will in spite of many tortuous events and storms since the early days of your political career, you have devoted everything to the struggle to shape a bright future of your nation. Since your accession to the throne of the Kingdom of Cambodia, held in high respect and trust by your people, you have been working harder to build a prosperous country and promote her peace. Even on a sick-bed now you administer state affairs optimistically and unremittingly. We admire you for your patriotic devotion. I sincerely wish your majesty, my most intimate friend and brother, to be in good health and live long to give continued leadership to the Cambodian people in their effort to build a new society. As in the past, so in the future, the Korean people will render an active support to your majesty's independent policies and peace-loving proposals and extend firm solidarity with the just cause of the Cambodian people. Even under the difficult circumstances created by ceaseless challenges and obstructive manoeuvres of the imperialists and reactionaries, our people are stepping up the building of socialism and making every effort to denuclearize the Korean peninsula and reunify their country. Your Majesty and the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia are extending active support to the just cause of our people. This is a great encouragement to our people. Nearly 30 years have passed since we first met in Jakarta. In these years we have deepened our friendship and trust, sharing joy and sorrow. I consider it a great pleasure to have my most intimate brother in Your Majesty who treasure our friendship and loyalty invariably even in the storms of chequered history. The relations of friendship and cooperation between the peoples of our two countries are now developing fully in all fields of politics, the economy and culture. Your present visit will be another important event in further deepening our intimate relations and strengthening the friendly ties between the peoples of Korea and Cambodia. I hope from the bottom of my heart that you will spend happy and pleasant days during your stay in our country by taking rest and recuperating your health.
