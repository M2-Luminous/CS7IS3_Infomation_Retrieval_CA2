It is now the opinion in Bonn that the European JESSI Program, which has been plagued by birth pangs, is finally on the right road to reinforcing the participating European industries against Japanese and American competition. In an interim report on the support program through 1996, the German Minister of Research, Paul Krueger, emphasized that Germany's strengths lie in specialized areas of microelectronics. Chips alone do not create profits, but rather the systems in which they are used, Krueger argues. Owing to a good mixture of both large and medium-sized companies, Germany enjoys a high potential in system engineering. The concurrent development of systems and the chips used in them provides opportunities for Germany industry. Among the particular strengths of German industry, Krueger named high-frequency analog technology, sensor development, and applications-specific memory chips. The Federal Republic is weak where solutions are sought in the market solely with available processors and applications programs. Besides Germany, France, Italy, The Netherlands, Great Britain, and the European Research Cooperative Venture Eureka now participate in JESSI (the Joint European Submicron Silicon Initiative). Funding to the amount of DM900 million, of which half will be provided by industry and half by the various governments and Brussels, will be available to the 140 participating enterprises in 1994. The Ministry of German Research will provide DM 104 million. The total volume of the world market for microelectronic components in the year 2000 is estimated to be at about DM250 billion. In 1980, it was about DM24 billion. Krueger considers the anti-blocking system (ABS), mobile telephony, and digital radio transmission as examples of successful applications of microelectronic developments. Siemens's decision to establish a new microchip development and production capability in Dresden signals a new initiative for Germany and Europe. The new 64-Mbit chip, which is being developed jointly with America's IBM, will be produced in Dresden. This superchip, which can store 6,000 DIN-A4 pages of text in an 11 x 18-mm area, is one of the original priority goals of the JESSI Program.
