Wentzel: "Trees in Germany Dying Earlier and Earlier; The Forest Supervisor: Now Beeches and Oaks Are Hit"] [Text] Tomorrow Agriculture Minister Jochen Borchert will present the eleventh report on conditions of forests. Last year's report, with a slight increase of noticeable leaf loss by 2 to 3 percent, so far marks the climax of all studies. It is noteworthy that the trend of damage continues from coniferous to deciduous forests. If one wants to know more, one must relate all foliage findings between 1983 and 1993 to the up-to-date air quality measuring results and compare those data to the research findings and forestry experience of pollution effects. That leads to the following conclusions: --German forests have significantly sparser needles or foliage than 15 years ago. One of every four trees shows a drop in foliage of over 25 percent, thus being in damage categories II to IV. Until 1985, this applied only to coniferous trees; now it applies to almost all types of trees. --Needle loss and treetop thinning occurred even centuries ago near metal works and, since 1850, also in large areas of industrial regions. But this old damage has disappeared in West Germany since the building of high smokestacks as of 1964, and the 1983 order on high capacity furnace installations. --The large-scale forest death since 1960 at altitudes above 700 meters in the Erz, Iser, and Riesen Gebirge, caused by high sulfur dioxide pollution, has spread in west Germany only to border areas near the former GDR (Harz Mountains, Fichtel Gebirge). In the area it is confined to the regions of the large brown coal power stations in Saxony and Bohemia. --In the eleven previous and present reports on forest conditions, the emphasis of top thinning has shifted from coniferous to deciduous trees. In 1983, it reached a first high watermark with 23 percent of fir and pine trees, dropped to 14 percent by 1989, and then rose again to 24 percent by 1992. In a scissor movement, defoliation of beech and oak trees rose from 11 percent (1984) to 32 percent (1992). "But the Forest Will Not Die as Long as Foresters Nurture it Expertly" --This change in vulnerability of tree types can only be explained by the drastic change in air chemistry, i.e., the increase in nitrogen compounds and ozone with a simultaneous decrease in sulfur dioxide. --For all types of trees, strong defoliation independent of the pollution type is concentrated in forests over 60 years old; in many forests it then intensifies to the dying of shoots and treetop deformation, and finally ends in premature death of the most sensitive individual trees and gradual forest dissolution. Thus air pollution leads to early aging and senescence. Science calls this `senescence acceleration.' --The same trend is also indicated by the scarcely acknowledged experiences registered again and again by some 50,000 foresters of Central Europe in their daily on-site work in the less foliated and sometimes prematurely dying forests. But wherever, however long, and however intensively pollution has damaged forests and soils: A new greening or reforesting of the areas is possible, even with the highest soil acidity; Ground vegetation becomes more profuse, thereby in many places becoming an increasingly bigger obstacle to reforestation. The analyzed facts and findings make clear that the present widespread forest diseases are caused primarily by microchemical interference with the metabolism of leaf organs. Acid rain also leaches vital nutrients from the leaves and soil. Climatic changes, weather extremes, and pests can also accelerate the premature decay of the forest. In regions particularly exposed to pollution, forests have hardly any prospect of reaching the forestry-desired age (on the average, firs reach the age of 100, oaks that of 180 years). After 40 years of professional work on recognition, effect, and prevention of pollution damage to forests, I consider "the age loss" of trees the worst effect of the new, far-flung air pollution on forestry and land culture. But the forest will not die as long as foresters nurture it expertly, fertilize it purposefully, and reforest immediately--be it the case after only 60, or after 180 years. The Professor: Damage Through Environmental Protection The environmental protection of past years has hurt rather than helped the forest. That is the claim of Professor O. Schenck, founding director emeritus of the Max Planck Institute for Radiation Chemistry in Muelheim/Ruhr. His accusation: Since the mid-1950's, filter installations increasingly hold back flue ashes and flue gases--because they are considered pollutants under the federal pollution protection law. But the dust contains useful substances vital for trees: minerals such as lithium and fluorine, sodium, potassium and calcium, iron, phosphorus--and above all magnesium. It forms the central atom of the green pigment, chlorophyll. For instance, if magnesium is lacking, the leaves turn yellow. Every year, 125 kilograms of Sahara dust fall on every hectare of southern Italy. The minerals contained therein neutralize the sulfurous gases emitted by the volcano, Mt. Etna. In Germany, the annual amount of dust is 25 kilograms per hectare. Observations in the surroundings of cement factories showed: After filter equipment was installed, soil acidity increased noticeably. Because: The emissions of sulfur dioxide were not reduced to the same degree. So the percentage share of sulfur increased in the air. Today, the proportion is about 1:8. The smaller amounts of dust no longer suffice for complete neutralization. As a consequence, acid rain results.
