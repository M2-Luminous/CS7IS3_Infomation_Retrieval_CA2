Both presidents assessed the importance of this meeting both at the bilateral and the international level. They expressed the opinion that all possibilities exist between our two countries to strengthen the economic cooperation with reciprocal profit, which can include various fields. The signing of cooperation agreements in tourism, the petroleum industry, and the cooperation between our universities and that of Zagreb mark the first steps in this direction. However, this cooperation can be extended in other fields, such as in agriculture, energy, education, culture, and more. In this context, it is indispensable to create a judicial cadre between both our governments. While treating the situation in the region, both counterparts hailed the NATO decision on Bosnia as a deserved response to the Serb aggressor, something that contributes to reaching a solution for the conflict there. I assess your efforts, President Berisha said to President Tudjman, and I think that the creation of a Croat-Bosnian federation or confederation, about which talks are being held in Washington, would bring peace closer and assist in the long-term stability of the region. In this framework, I consider a solution to the problem of Kosova as indispensable. We estimate that, without the solution of this problem, there can be no solution to the crisis in the Balkans. That is why we request that the embargo on Serbia should be related to the solution of the problem of Kosova. We stress that this solution does not mean a change of borders through force, but a guarantee of the freedoms and rights of Albanians in conformity with the Helsinki Act. President Tudjman said that Croatia is directly interested in stopping the conflict and is making all efforts in this direction. Croatia hopes for positive results from the agreements signed between the Croats and Muslims in Washington.
