The most important of these border points is that of the Jordanian al-Karamah point, previously known as al-Ruwayshad. Those who are departing are troubled by personal worries as well as by worries related to the nation as they cross this border point. Many Iraqis continue to leave by way of this border crossing. It is a continuous journey that started with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, when Iraqis were in search of either a haven or a shelter far from the fighting; the journey presently continues as Iraqis search for an asylum away from prisons and concentration camps. Therefore, the journey in search of suffering, hope, and facing the unknown starts at al-Karamah with the first step of the 1,000-mile trip. A number of Iraqi networks and groupings have been formed outside Iraq, especially in Jordan, during the last few years. Each of these networks has certain motives. The motive behind one network is to help Iraqis; it was established having humanitarian incentives and great urgency that stemmed from within the Iraqi community. Another network is underground, stalks the Iraqi regime's enemies, and learns about their activities. A third network was formed with a goal to exploit and financially drain those who opt to leave for the unknown. Besides, there are smaller networks that have combined more than one of the above mentioned goals. However, this reporting is only concerned with the first kind of these networks, which overshadows other networks. When I met a number of Iraqis in Jordan, as a first reaction, most of them were afraid. However, once I became acquainted with the leaders of the network, my mission became easier. Nevertheless, the most prominent request from those who portray fear remains their wish to be incognito with regard to the information they furnish. One could imagine the fear that Iraqis who live abroad face when one realizes the continuous fear that Iraqis live in--that same fear that drives them to leave their country. This implies that one's safety and the safety of one's folks is placed in jeopardy once one's fate is known. A prominent member of this humanitarian network confirmed to us that he had met with an Iraqi artist after the latter had entered Jordan. Upon asking him about his destination on this journey to the unknown, he replied by saying: "Denmark." But, why Denmark? Did he know anything about that country? Did he know anyone in Denmark? Was there any prospect for him there? All his answers were in the negative. However, Denmark was the only country that would grant him asylum. This Arab artist eventually embarked on his journey to the unknown. An Iraqi journalist who resides in Amman believes that there is a campaign to induce Arab brains, especially scientists, and foremost Iraqis, to immigrate. This inducement is performed through various international bodies, most important of which is the International Council of Churches. This Council and other bodies support Iraqi immigration to Canada, Australia, Greece, and the United States. This journalist confirms that there are about 2 million Iraqis abroad. As a result of that, scientific institutions have lost a lot of their cadres. He gives as an example the case of the College of Agriculture in al-Mawsil University, where this journalist met with one of its faculty members, who told him that he was one of those who deserted this university. This faculty member added that only 18 percent of the faculty of the College of Agriculture did not quit. This small percentage did not emigrate for reasons that were stronger than the attempt to emigrate and leave. Despite the fact that the Iraqi regime requests any Iraqi professional to pay a sum that varies between 500,000 and 1 million Iraqi dinars [ID] in order to be able to leave Iraq, emigration still continues. In fact, the number of emigrants is on the rise. At the same time, the Iraqi journalist confirms that Iraqi's best artists, literary writers, and journalists have also left the country on the journey to the unknown. During the last three years, Iraq has lost about 400 artists, literary writers, journalists, poets, and critics. How much did Iraq spend to prepare these cadres? How much time is needed to prepare new cadres? This loss impacts the whole Arab Nation, not just Iraq. This loss is further magnified if the number of other scientific specializations is added to specializations already indicated. <3> Iraqis in Amman Many Iraqis congregate in the al-Husayn Mosque Square in the heart of the Jordanian capital, Amman. I was filled with sorrow as I reached this square. Many questions came to my mind. All the questions were centered around one single issue: why do people emigrate? Those Iraqis who gathered in this square seemed sad, needy, and poor. In such a situation, grief is mixed with poverty, and poverty with dignity. This is because, though there is great hunger and great poverty, dignity is precious. Injustice and years of suffering and fear have brought about this fate to these groups. I saw many of them struggling with poverty, yet, maintaining the greatness of Arabs. The Iraqi emigrant would roam the avenues of the unknown and not ask for favors. He would face need and yet maintain his/her pride. Dr. 'Adil Ziyadat, professor of journalism at al-Yarmuk University in Irbid confirms that the immigrant Iraqi community lives in dignity. He adds that this community represents a sane society that is free from crime, though the temptation to commit crime may be great. A number of small hotels are located around al-Husayn Mosque Square. Mr. 'Umar al-Natur, who manages one of the hotels, believes there are 40 of them. He also says that Iraqi guests, 60 percent of whom are men, make up 80 percent of the total guests. The average number of rooms in each of these hotels is 50; these can accommodate between 150-200 persons, as more than three persons can share one room. Members of the Iraqi networks meet in these hotels, so do members of the one family, who had been separated from each other by going on different journeys to the unknown. This situation is especially true with regard to those who cannot go back to their country, fearing for their lives. Moreover, these hotels are used as centers where Iraqis receive money transfers and financial aid from friends and relatives. Mr. al-Natur confirms that most of these transfers originate in the Gulf states. This is because of the existence of mixed families, such as Iraqi-Kuwaiti, where members of the one family had been divided as a result of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Those Iraqi families that travel to Amman to collect financial support from relatives and friends in the Gulf encounter much hardship. Having to pay an exit tax when leaving Iraq is the most important of these hardships. Some of those leaving Iraq have indicated that, according to recent Iraqi Government regulations, each passenger leaving Iraq has to pay a tax equal to 200 American dollars (ID15,000). Besides, Iraqis entering Jordan face regulatory problems from the Jordanian authorities. As immigrants enter, they are given two-week resident visas, the same as is given to other nationalities. Subsequently, residents are allowed an extension of three months for their residence, and then a last three-month extension. At the end of the second three-month extension, immigrants are subject to both legal questioning and deportation to their country. An Iraqi poet resident in Amman confirms that at the Jordanian official level, immigrant Iraqis are given permission for residence, as Jordan is a second home for them. However, they get equal treatment as other Arab nationals, with no consideration for their political status vis-a-vis legal questioning. Some Iraqis have actually been deported to Iraq. This poet believes that deported Iraqis encounter great suffering, as there is no fleeing what they had previously fled; they start to face the unknown inside their homeland. This poet also thinks that the Iraqi and Jordanian Governments are cooperating with regard to sending Iraqis back, especially skilled laborers and specialized professionals. An Iraqi photographer resident in Amman indicates that in spite of the fact that all immigrants are considered non-permanent residents when they first enter Jordan, the Jordanian ministry of labor does not grant Iraqis work permits, though these are granted to other Arab nationals such as Egyptians. Jordanian security forces confirm that the number of Iraqis currently resident in Jordan does not exceed 20 thousand persons. This figure is lower than previous figures because of Iraqi emigration to the European countries and the United States. A knowledgeable Iraqi journalist believes that the 20 thousand figure is wrong and that the right figure would be 70 thousand. This last figure would include those who have permanent residence, as well as those who use Jordan as a stepping stone to emigrate to an unknown country. The 70 thousand figure would also include those who are temporary residents, who are waiting either for someone who wants to meet or get in touch with them, or for receiving money transfers that would help them deal with the hectic circumstances of their lives.
