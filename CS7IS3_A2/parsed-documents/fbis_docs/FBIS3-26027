Article 2 According to the state industrial policy and plans for the development of various trades, the state will enforce the quota system in line with international customs for certain commodities imported to meet domestic needs and to adjust market supply; but the import of those commodities in excess quantity may seriously obstruct the development of related industries in our country, which may directly influence the adjustment of import and production structures, and which may endanger the state's foreign exchange stabilization. Article 3 The general commodities mentioned in these procedures are all commodities which need to be controlled by import quotas with the exception of mechano-electrical products. Article 4 The State Planning Commission will be in charge of macrocontrol and coordination of import quotas for general commodities according to the national economic development plan and the state industrial policy. The State Planning Commission may forward opinions in coordination with other concerned departments on adjustment of categories of general commodities to be controlled by import quotas and the change will be announced and implemented after State Council approval. Article 5 The total annual import quota for a general commodity will be suggested by the State Planning Commission in coordination with concerned departments according to the state's foreign exchange situation, the need for industrial and agricultural production at home, market demand, and the need for state security and environmental protection. After State Council approval, the total amount will be included in the annual national economic and social development plan. The State Planning Commission will allocate the amount to various units according to the actual economic development situation and production and construction needs in various localities and departments. Article 6 Under State Planning Commission guidance, various provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities and cities with independent economic decision-making authority, and administrative organizations designated by concerned departments of the State Council ("regional and departmental organizations for the administration of import quotas for general commodities" will be used in following articles for short) will be in charge of the management and coordination of import quotas for general commodities in their respective localities and departments, will make a consolidated study on the need for import quotas for general commodities in their respective localities and departments, and will submit a balanced report to the State Planning Commission.

Article 14. For general commodities which are to be imported as gifts but which are subject to import quota control, their import formalities shall be handled in accordance with relevant state provisions, in accordance with the subordinate relationship of the receiving units, and on the basis of these procedures, following approval by a competent department.
