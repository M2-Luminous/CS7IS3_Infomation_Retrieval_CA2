The source told AL-HAYAH that the Israeli side "has expressed willingness to respond to Jordanian demands with regard to the occupied Jordanian territories, border demarcation, and water rights" -- which are among the Jordanian side's basic demands. The source said that holding the negotiations in the region "means that they will be held on Jordanian territory and Israeli territory" for the first time since the peace process was launched in Madrid about three years ago. The source pointed out that "holding the negotiations on Israeli territory and Jordanian territory -- and in the region in general -- will cause the peace process to move closer to the peoples concerned with it and will influence public opinion." The Jordanian official said that the decision to move the negotiations to the states concerned "reflects the seriousness which will characterize these negotiations." He noted that the Jordanian-Israeli talks held in Washington 6-7 June were "practical and effective in reactivating the Jordanian-Israeli track." On Syrian reservations about moving the negotiations to the region, the Jordanian official said: "I do not believe that the negotiations' venue is going to change their results or is going to change the negotiators' positions." He added: "We agree with Syria that normalization should follow an agreement, not vice versa. However, we must agree first on what is meant by normalization."
