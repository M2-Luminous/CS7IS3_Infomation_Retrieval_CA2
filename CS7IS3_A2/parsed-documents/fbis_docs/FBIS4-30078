"It's too early to decide" on the next budget, but "we must continue promoting fiscal reforms," Fujii told a press meeting after the long-delayed budget for fiscal 1994, which started April 1, passed the Diet. Fujii also said his ministry must avoid issuing deficit-covering bonds and should continue pursuing efficient budget allocations. Brushing aside any intention to present new fiscal measures ahead of the July summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) leading industrialized nations in Naples, Fujii repeated that it is now "most important" to steadily implement the outlays in the budget for the 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package approved by the Diet in February. The outlays include 5.5 trillion yen income tax cuts.
