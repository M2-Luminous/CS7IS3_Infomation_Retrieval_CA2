FBIS4-5978 "dreas074_m_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-074 Daily Report 16 Apr 1994 Thailand Foreign Ministry Denies KR Support Charges Foreign Ministry Denies KR Support Charges BK1604084894 Bangkok Radio Thailand Network in English 0000 GMT 16 Apr 94 BK1604084894 Bangkok Radio Thailand Network English BFN [Text] Regarding the accusations made recently by various leaders of the Royal Cambodian Government on Thailand's assistance to the Khmer Rouge, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs wishes to make the following points: 1. The Royal Thai Government categorically denies the accusations that Thailand has helped certain Khmer Rouge leaders to escape into Thailand and that Thailand has given support, in whatever form, to the Khmer Rouge to launch attacks on the Cambodian Government troops. 2. Thailand is surprised and disappointed by these continuing groundless accusations, because the Thai Government has clearly and consistently stated to the Cambodian leaders that it recognizes and fully supports the elected Cambodian Government. At the same time, we have firmly stated that we shall not interfere in the internal affairs of Cambodia nor do we wish to become involved in the internal fighting of that country. 3. It is certainly not in Thailand's interest to assist the Khmer Rouge or to support a continuing military conflict in Cambodia. As an advocate of peace in Cambodia and a signatory to the Paris Peace Agreement, Thailand wishes to see durable peace and prosperity in Cambodia. This fact is reflected in Thailand's untiring support for the peace process in Cambodia and in our substantial aid and assistance in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Cambodia. We strongly support the noble guidance of His Majesty Phreahbat Samdech Norodom Sihanouk that there should be genuine national reconciliation. Continued conflict in Cambodian would only erase the gains and achievements for which Thailand and ASEAN, together with the international community, have worked so long and hard. 4. The Royal Thai Government wishes to refer to the discussion between the prime ministers of the Kingdoms of Thailand and Cambodia during the official visit of His Excellency Mr Chuan Likphai to Cambodia in January 1994. We recall that the two sides agreed not to resort to the media, but would utilize established diplomatic channels to clear any misunderstandings or settle any issues which may arise. 5. It is regrettable that the Cambodian Government has not approached the Royal Thai Government to seek any clarification concerning the alleged Thai assistance to the Khmer Rouge but instead chose to make unfair and unfounded accusations against Thailand through the press. Continued accusations by the Cambodian Government could adversely affect the good relations and understanding between the two countries and peoples, to which Thailand attaches great importance. We wish to stress once again to the Cambodian Government that the agreement reached by the prime ministers of the two countries should be strictly implemented and we would welcome any proof or concrete evidence from the Cambodia Government in support of the accusations. 6. The Royal Thai Government is seriously concerned over the border situation as a result of the continued fighting along the Thai-Cambodian border. The fighting has in many ways affected the safety and livelihood of the Thai villagers along the border areas. Therefore, we wish to urge the Cambodian Government to be especially vigilant regarding the following matters: 6.1 Not to allow its troops to intrude into Thai territory. There have been many confirmed reports on intrusions by Cambodian Government forces over the past several months in several border areas. 6.2 Not to fire into Thai territory. Shellings by the the Cambodian Government troops' artillery have on many occasions landed on Thai territory causing injuries to Thai villagers and damage or destruction to their property. 6.3 Suppress and eradicate illegal and criminal activities on the Cambodian side of the border.
