The diplomat has not been named. A Foreign Office spokesman said this is in retaliation for the expulsion from Moscow of a staff member of the British Embassy in the Russian Federation [RF] accused of receiving intelligence information from Russian citizens. "The Russians asked us to recall a diplomat," a Foreign Office spokesman said. "We regret that demand, which is at odds with the bilateral relationship we are trying to build. In retaliation, we asked the Russians to recall one of their diplomats from London. Neither diplomat has been declared persona non grata. We hope this matter is now at an end." A Russian Federation embassy spokesman in London said he has "no comment" on this question.
