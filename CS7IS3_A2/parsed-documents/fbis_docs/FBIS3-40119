Liaoning Province is one of the country's major industrial bases. Its state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises account for almost one tenth of the country's total. As the pillar of its economy, industrial enterprises have been pushed to the forefront of Liaoning's reform and opening. The Liaoning provincial government has actively absorbed foreign investment, introduced advanced technology and adopted new operating mechanisms in local industry. So far, 3.5 billion U.S. dollars in funds have been earmarked for technological transformations in industrial enterprises all over the province. Instead of simply buying up advanced technologies from foreign enterprises, a number of Liaoning's major industrial enterprises also stress developing new technologies of their own. As a newly developed economic sector, high-tech industries in Liaoning have scored great achievements. Nanhu science and technology development zone in the provincial capital city of Shenyang, one of the first zones of its kind approved by the State Council, has seen the establishment of 1,100 high-tech enterprises. Technology exports from Liaoning last year topped 100 million U.S. dollars, as compared to previous years when the province was a technology importer only. Economic structuring within enterprises has also been readjusted to meet the needs of the market. Although heavy industry still holds sway in Liaoning, light industry has gained substantial growth and some heavy industrial enterprises have even begun to produce light industrial products as a complement to their traditional production lines. Export-oriented sections of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises have also burgeoned. Technology-intensive and investment-intensive productions have flourished while labor-intensive ones have shrunk. Readjustment of the industrial structure has correspondingly promoted the rationalization of product mix. The output ratio of primary products to finished products now stands at six to four, as compared with the original eight to two. At present, half of Liaoning's products for export are finished products, whereas in the past 85 percent were raw materials. Reform of labor and personnel systems and the introduction of shareholding systems have further invigorated state-owned enterprises. The reform and opening drive has laid a solid foundation for Liaoning's industrial enterprises to implement a modern enterprise system and to better adapt to international markets.
