Brother President Abu-'Ammar delivered a brief speech in which he said: In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. [passage omitted] Dear brother Abu-Iyad [Salah Khalaf], Abu al-Hawl, Abu-Muhammad, Abu-Jihad [Brigadier General Muhammad], 'Atif, Abu-'Ali Iyad, Hamad ['Abd-al-Karim], Ghassan Kanafani, Abu al-Walid, Majid Abu-Sharar, Abu-al-Mundhir; brothers and beloved martyrs. While you rest in you paradise, the members of the Palestinian police force have entered Palestinian soil, the first liberated Palestinian land where the Palestinian flag is flying, and where we are going to set up the first Palestinian authority. We are very aware of the significance of what we have achieved. We have not achieved everything that we wanted, but this is a step on the path of achieving what we want; a step toward the establishment of a Palestinian state whose capital will be Jerusalem. Some people see this as a long-term goal, but we see it as a short term one; we know we are right. Once again brother martyrs, I would like to say that the promise that is between us will remain the same. We realize that the road to Jerusalem is a difficult and long one, but we will fly the flag of Palestine, the flag of the Arab nation, on the walls, churches, and mosques of Jerusalem. [passage omitted] While we bid farewell today to sisterly Tunisia that stood by us and hosted this Palestinian work, this revolution, and leadership, we would like to express to our brother Zine el Abidine, to his hospitable people, and wise government our heartfelt thanks. We say to them we are in this path, the path of the Arab nation. We, the Palestinian people, represent this front, the Arab front on the sacred land, the first of the two qiblahs and the third of the holy places. We are an integral part of our Arab nation, we are an extension of this Arab land and this nation. The Arab columns who today enter Gaza and Jericho will tomorrow enter Nablus, Hebron, Tulkaram, Bethlehem, Ramallah, and every Palestinian territory. We have a date there, brothers. The international resolution sought to undermine this revolution and the PLO, however, this blessed intifadah managed to put our people on the political map of the region. This result firmly puts our people on the political and geographic map, and consequently on the Middle East map. This baby requires all of us to work for him and with him, so that this baby will be able to grow and mature. Once again, let met reiterate to you that our promise will remain the same promise and the pledge the same pledge. Let us stand together as one until the liberation of Jerusalem.
