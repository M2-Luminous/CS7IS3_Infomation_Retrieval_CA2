According to Israeli sources, the Islamic fundamentalist group is using England as a safe haven for planning attacks and transferring funds and operational instructions to its terrorist squads in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Details of how Hamas operates in Britain -- in some cases using Islamic social and charitable organizations as a cover for planning operations, raising or laundering funds, then transferring money and orders to the territories -- have all been passed on to the relevant British security authorities. This is not the first time such information has been passed on to Britain. More than a year ago, the British authorities were told that their country was a major base for Hamas leaders, with direct links to the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam murder squads here. This followed the arrest of two high-ranking Hamas operatives, Muhammad Salah and Muhammad Jarrad. [passage omitted] Now, according to a well-placed source, in the wake of increased Hamas terror activity and especially the bomb attacks in 'Afula and Hadera, the British authorities are more likely to take action. What is needed, according to the source, is formal Israeli diplomatic representations to Britain, along the lines of the diplomatic offensive by Israel and the U.S. to get King Husayn to crack down on Hamas members and their activities in Jordan. For the British authorities to act against Hamas under Britain's Prevention of Terrorism Act, Israel will have to show that Hamas engages in terrorist activity and that while Hamas may not yet be carrying out terror attacks in Britain, instructions, money, or logistic support for Hamas terror acts elsewhere is being sent from Britain. This is now believed to be possible in light of the fact that Hamas has openly and officially boasted of its terrorist attacks and that detailed information on the links between Hamas members in Britain and the territories is now being made available.
