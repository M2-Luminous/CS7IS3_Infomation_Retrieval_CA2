Furthermore, it warns the CARENA organizing members against the many-sided pressures that tend to keep the country under the yoke of foreign trusteeship. Let us listen to Jolibois. [Begin recording] We firmly support the final dual resolution, and warn the participants against the pressures that continue to be exerted and that can lead to the formation of a noncredible government that would have no chance to solve the Haitian problem or enjoy the solidarity of the Haitian people to oppose the dictates of foreign interference. We stand for a government of true national reconciliation through the strict implementation of Article 149. [end recording]
