It is not by accident that the new defiance by the Turkish Cypriot leader came while Tugay Ulucevik, a leading member of the Turkish Government, was visiting the occupied areas. It is also obvious that while Tansu Ciller might pretend to President Bill Clinton that... [ellipsis as published] "she is doing all she can," Denktas does not give in. This is an old trick, since it is well known that the pseudostate is being maintained by the Turkish military presence in the occupied part of Cyprus. This fact alone shows that if it wanted to, Ankara could pull the rug out from under Denktas' feet and lead him by the ear. However, since nothing like this is being done because the same old double talk continues and the occupation is perpetuated, President Glavkos Kliridhis' proposal for demilitarization, which implies the withdrawal of the occupation troops, has particular significance. We expect that the United States, which has openly said it favors the invasion army's withdrawal, will want to adopt and promote President Kliridhis' suggestion instead of trying to resurrect a process that has been killed by Turkish intransigence. Besides, the occupation of Famagusta, on which most of the disagreements on the confidence-building measures are focused, is due to Turkey itself. Consequently, the alternative measures that should ensue after Denktas' defiance must include the UN Security Council's order for the withdrawal of the Attila hordes. We expect that Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's forthcoming contacts with President Clinton will focus on these alternative measures, in full alignment and harmony with the Cypriot leadership and the whole spectrum of the Greek leadership. The primary goal of our political strategy must be the one which President Kliridhis declared before the opening of the talks on the confidence-building measures. That is, it must become evident through specific actions that the Cyprus solution does not depend on Turkey's desire but on the Security Council's will. This goal has become more feasible as a result of the Turkish intransigence and filibustering tactics, which underline this historic necessity. Every evil has its good aspect. Denktas' provocation through his defiance dictates that it be confronted practically in the way we mentioned earlier. President Kliridhis has a strong lead on this issue and he is also indicating to the world powers the course that is necessary. It is inconceivable for this unproductive waiting to continue considering that the Security Council has ruled that the current status quo in Cyprus is unacceptable and must end. Now is the time for words to become deeds and for the state declarations to become specific actions.
