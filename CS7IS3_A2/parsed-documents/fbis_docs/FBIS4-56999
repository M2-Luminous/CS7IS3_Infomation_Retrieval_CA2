They contend that "the problem is not the bull, but rather the herd of cattle that comes behind it." [Perez Balladares] A party comprised of 157,000 people cannot be judged on the basis of the bad reputation of 10 or 15 members. I say that most PRD members are high-minded men and women. Besides, being a member of my party does not mean that one is automatically a member of my government. I will try to govern with the most qualified men and women, regardless of the party to which they belong. [Goobar] How was it possible to rebuild the PRD, which had been virtually annihilated first with Noriega's administration and then with the U.S. invasion? [Perez Balladares] They are two entirely different parties. Today's PRD has nothing to do with the PRD of 1989. The former is a democratic party, under no one's control. The latter was a party that had been ravaged by Noriega and the military. The current PDR is an entirely different phenomenon. It constitutes a return to our origins, to what we intended to do back in 1979 when we founded it together with [General Omar] Torrijos. We recovered the democratic and civil institutionalism that had characterized Torrijos' administration until his death. It was then that Noriega and the military took over the party and started to subvert it. I have worked with several fellow party members who believe in the party's original line, and the people believe us because they know that our objectives are real. [Goobar] How did you manage to get from Torrijos to your administration, skipping Noriega? [Perez Balladares] Noriega's administration was an interregnum. I had nothing to do with it. [Goobar] The pro-Torrijos grassroots voted for populism, and yet there is not much room for populism at present. [Perez Balladares] I believe that rather than populism, they are searching for a system of government that implements ongoing dialogue and consultation. Populism costs a lot of money, and as things stand now there is no way we can finance it. [Goobar] You will have to set into motion an adjustment process that the administration of Guillermo Endara could not accomplish. How are you going to implement it? [Perez Balladares] Do you know why the previous administration could not effect an adjustment? Because it never entered into negotiations. They accepted things that were impossible to implement. We must start negotiating a realistic adjustment, one that can be implemented. It is impossible to make an adjustment without taking grain producers into account, for instance. There must be some degree of protection. Colombia has just obtained 80 percent protection for many of its products through GATT. Panama, however, is absolutely unprotected. It is absurd. Even NAFTA has protected goods, items that are not part of the free exchange system. What happened here is that the government was incapable of negotiating a structural adjustment, an applicable adjustment. It simply accepted the recipe without establishing the importance of its basic components. [Goobar] Panama's main problem is unemployment. Do you have an economic program ready? [Perez Balladares] You cannot start talking about the economy without first establishing the government's political support bases. We cannot just swim against the current. We must implement programs with social content. We must take measures to immediately lower our unemployment rate. [Goobar] How do you do that? [Perez Balladares] By building infrastructure. We have proposals from U.S. companies to build roads, with minority participation by the Panamanian Government. [Goobar] Many people fear that the dismantling of the U.S. military bases will aggravate the unemployment problem. How will you coordinate these issues? [Perez Balladares] In the same way the United States has done this where military bases have been closed. We must use the infrastructure to attract investment and create jobs through the construction of plants for the production of exportable products. Many Argentine investors are interested. [Goobar] How do you explain the fact that Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, the widow of former President Arnulfo Arias, ended up in a surprising second place? All pre-electoral surveys and exit polls placed Ruben Blades in second place. [Perez Balladares] I think Arias followers' are cautious, and do not express their intentions publicly due to their long history of persecution. Arias' followers vote in secret. They do not want to express themselves publicly. I can only suppose that many of them said they were going to vote for Blades or Carles, and then voted for their own candidate. [Goobar] Perhaps it was an anti-PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] vote? [Perez Balladares] I do not think so. It is very difficult to give your political strength to someone else. [Goobar] You obtained 33.1 percent of the vote and the simple majority, which makes you president-elect. But 70 percent of the people did not vote for you. How do you feel about this fact? [Perez Balladares] I must take into account that I have not obtained an absolute majority, but I have obtained more votes than anyone else. I think I represent the Panamanian people's desire to have a government of national reconciliation and unity. I understand the results in this way, and I intend to proceed accordingly. I have already invited some people from outside the party to join my government. [Goobar] Panama and the PRD's relations with the United States have undergone good, not so good, and bad times. Washington, however, considers you one of the best candidates... [Perez Balladares] I am very happy to hear that. I think our relations with the United States will be very good. Besides, we will be responsible for implementing the last leg of the Carter-Torrijos Treaty. Panama and the United States have many interests in common. Very few things can put us against one another. I am sure we will work cordially and closely united to implement our treaties. [Goobar] According to the treaties, a condition for the definitive transfer of the canal to Panamanian hands is that the country must be able to guarantee the canal' security. How will a country that was left without an Army after the invasion do this? [Perez Balladares] The era of intercontinental missiles has made the canal undefendable. We would not be able to defend the canal even if we dedicated our entire gross national product to create an Army to serve that purpose. The United States is not defending the canal against a true or possible military attack, either. The Panama Canal is invulnerable because it is neutral. No one will want to destroy it if every one can use it. There is no need for an Army.
