FR940110-2-00023 FR940110-2-00011 TCM responds that it reported the expenses in question in accordance with the Department's instructions. According to TCM, it initially reported all SG&A expenses that it incurred in the United States as either direct or indirect selling expenses. The Department subsequently requested, however, that TCM segregate G&A from selling expenses, and allocate the G&A expenses to TCM's U.S. further processing operations. Thus, TCM asserts that petitioners' argument is incorrect because the expenses in question are included, at the Department's request, in TCM's further manufacturing submissions. Department's Position: We agree with petitioners. The G&A expenses in question pertain to all of TCM's U.S. sales of subject merchandise, regardless of whether the merchandise is further processed in the United States. Because these G&A expenses are applicable to all U.S. sales, we have included them in our calculation of U.S. ISE for these final results. Comment 28: Petitioners claim that there are two errors in the U.S. ISE that TCM reported for sales by another related subsidiary, Mitsui Machinery Distribution, Inc. (MMD). First, petitioners claim that sale-by-sale ISE shown in TCM's sales listing does not reconcile with the formula provided by TCM (ISE factor x net price). In particular, petitioners state that the amounts reported for certain ESP sales are lower than the amount that results from applying the formula. Petitioners request that the Department recalculate this expense using the formula provided by TCM. Second, petitioners claim that TCM failed to report an amount for MMD's G&A in TCM's reported ISE. Petitioners request that the Department allocate a portion of the ``General G&A'' reported by TCM to MMD's forklift truck sales to derive a G&A ratio for MMD, then multiply this factor by net sales price for each of MMD's sales to compute G&A expenses for each sale. Department's Position: We agree with petitioners that TCM did not calculate a G&A factor for MMD. We have corrected this omission using the factor, calculated using TCM's data, provided by petitioners in their case brief because this factor offers a reasonable estimate of MMD's G&A expenses. We disagree that TCM failed to calculate properly the amounts reported for ISE on MMD's sales. In reviewing petitioners' Attachment 4 to the case brief, we found that petitioners included an incorrect amount for dealer inspection/prep charge and that petitioners did not, as TCM's sample calculation showed, allocate a portion of the ISE to U.S. value-added. After adjusting petitioners' calculations in Attachment 4 to account for the correct dealer inspection/prep charge and the ISE reported in U.S. value-added, we found that for the calculations sampled, the results matched the amounts calculated and reported by TCM. Comment 29: Petitioners argue that for two sales, TCM did not recalculate, as requested by the Department in its supplemental questionnaire, certain value-added costs. Therefore, petitioners assert that the Department should use the highest costs reported by TCM for these expense categories as BIA. Department's Position: We agree with petitioners. For the final results, we used the highest costs reported by TCM for these expense categories as BIA. Comment 30: Petitioners contend that TCM's brokerage expenses are understated because the brokerage allocation factor (total brokerage costs for U.S. forklift sales divided by total revenue from U.S. forklift sales) was multiplied by transfer price instead of sales price. Petitioners request that the Department recalculate this expense by multiplying the brokerage factor by sales price. TCM replies that the total revenue over which it allocated brokerage expenses was the revenue of TCM's factory in Japan, which represents the aggregate of all TCM's transfer prices. Because it calculated its brokerage expense factor by allocating brokerage expenses over transfer prices, TCM argues that it is appropriate to calculate per-unit brokerage expenses by multiplying this expense factor by TCM's reported transfer prices. Department's Position: We agree with TCM. We find TCM's allocation method for calculating Japanese brokerage charges to be reasonable. TCM calculated a factor by dividing total Japanese brokerage paid on its exports of forklift trucks to the United States by the total transfer prices (revenue recorded by the factory at Shiga) of the forklifts exported to the United States. Because the Japanese brokerage charges would have been paid on the basis of the transfer price, it is reasonable that TCM would use this in the denominator of the allocation equation. Comment 31: Petitioners state that TCM failed to report the actual trading company expense incurred for one sale. Petitioners contend that the Department should treat this expense as a movement expense, in accordance with the first review, and should assign the highest reported trading company markup as BIA for this observation. TCM argues that petitioners misunderstand TCM's method for calculating trading company markups. According to TCM, it pays trading companies a single fee that includes movement expenses incurred by the trading companies and the trading companies' markup. In its response, TCM separately reported the movement expenses and the markup; the total of these items represented the single fee that TCM paid to the trading company. In those instances in which the trading company markup is negative, the actual movement expenses incurred by the trading company exceed the fee that the trading company receives from TCM; thus, the negative markup reported by TCM is a downward adjustment to actual movement expenses, paid by the trading company, to reflect the amount paid by TCM. Because TCM's reporting method is accurate and is based on actual expenses, TCM asserts that the use of BIA is unwarranted. Should the Department determine to reject TCM's negative trading company markup, TCM requests that the Department set any negative amounts equal to zero, in order to reflect the actual movement expenses incurred by the trading companies. Department's Position: As in the first review, we treated the trading company markups as a movement charge. The appropriate deduction to USP for inland freight is the expense incurred by TCM. Because the addition of the negative markup yields the actual expense incurred by TCM for this sale, we have, for the final results, recalculated inland freight using TCM's submitted data.
