Sullivan AGENCY: Social Security Administration, HHS. ACTION: Final rules. SUMMARY: These final regulations set out our policy, under the supplemental security income (SSI) program, regarding the treatment of veterans benefits that are increased (``augmented'') to provide for dependents. The effect of these regulations is to clarify our treatment of the ``dependent's portion'' of the veterans benefits. DATES: Effective Date: November 17, 1994. Applicability Dates: The application dates of these final regulations are discussed in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 1612 of the Social Security Act (the Act) specifies certain items that are included as earned and unearned income under the SSI program. Section 1612(a)(2)(B) provides that unearned income includes, among other things, payments received as an annuity, pension, retirement, or disability benefit, including veterans compensation and pensions. With regard to veterans benefits, in certain situations the veteran or the veteran's surviving spouse's benefits are augmented on account of the dependents of the veteran. Prior to November 1981, the Social Security Administration (SSA) counted the entire benefit, including the augmented portion, as income to the veteran or veteran's surviving spouse for SSI purposes. In 1981, after the policy was successfully challenged in the courts, SSA changed its policy, effective November 1, 1981, and published a ruling (SSR 82&hyph;31) which explained that for SSI purposes the dependent's portion of an augmented veterans benefit would not be counted as unearned income to the veteran or the veteran's surviving spouse but as unearned income to the dependent. The Anderson Case SSA was challenged in Anderson, et al. v. Sullivan, No. CV&hyph;88&hyph;036&hyph;GF (D. Mont., Nov. 21, 1989), for not applying the policy published in SSR 82&hyph;31 to a nationwide class of recipients of veterans pensions known as ``protected pensions.'' The protected pensions under Pub. L. 95&hyph;588 include pensions which are means-tested and paid under provisions that predate the current ``improved pension'' program. In Anderson, the plaintiff was a veteran's widow who received a veterans protected pension and SSI disability benefits. Her pension was augmented due to the presence of a dependent in her household. SSA considered the full amount of the veterans pension, including the dependent's portion, as income to Mrs. Anderson in determining the amount of her SSI benefits. She filed suit against the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) seeking relief from our practice of counting the dependent's portion of her veterans protected pension as income to her. SSA had counted this as income to her because of incomplete information received from the computer match between the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and SSA with regard to veterans protected pensions. On November 21, 1989, the court in Anderson ordered the Secretary to promulgate, within 6 months, interim final regulations that provide that the augmented portion of a veterans pension is not to be counted as unearned income to the veteran or the veteran's surviving spouse. Provisions of the Regulations Under Anderson Interim final regulations implementing the Anderson order were published on May 18, 1990 (55 FR 20598). Consistent with that order, we revised section 416.1123 of our regulations, which sets out how we count unearned income. We added a new paragraph (e) to explain that if you receive a veterans benefit that includes an amount paid to you because of a dependent, we do not count as your unearned income the amount paid to you because of the dependent. The Paxton Case The treatment of the dependent's portion of an augmented benefit was also challenged in Paxton v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 856 F.2d 1352 (9th Cir. 1988). In Paxton, the plaintiff was an SSI recipient. Mr. Paxton, the plaintiff's husband, received a pension from the VA. In determining the amount of Mrs. Paxton's SSI benefit in accordance with SSR 82&hyph;31, SSA reduced her SSI benefit by the amount of the dependent's portion attributable to her from her husband's veterans pension. Mrs. Paxton filed suit against the Secretary seeking relief from the practice of counting as her unearned income that portion of her husband's veterans pension that was attributed to her. The court in Paxton held that, as written, the current regulations did not support counting the dependent's portion of the veterans pension directly as unearned income to the dependent. On the same date that we published the interim final regulations pursuant to the Anderson court order, we also published an NPRM at 55 FR 20612 to clarify our policy on the treatment of augmented benefits to prevent future misinterpretation of the regulations, as occurred in Paxton. Further, we published Acquiescence Ruling AR 90&hyph;1(9) on July 16, 1990 (55 FR 28946) to reflect the decision of the Ninth Circuit in Paxton. Under AR 90&hyph;1(9), we do not count the dependent's portion of the veterans benefit as unearned income to the dependent in the Ninth Circuit. Upon the effective date of these regulations, we will rescind AR 90&hyph;1(9) and supersede SSR 82&hyph;31 with a ruling that contains only the policy of the obsoleted SSR 82&hyph;31 that is not the subject of these regulations.
