Their papers include calls for the earliest possible start of channelling of southern China's rich water resources into North China, strengthening of agricultural production and grass-roots education, opening up of a Euro-Asia economic zone, and ways to address the situation in Taiwan. He said that the democratic parties' proposals have greatly helped the Chinese Communist Party's work, as they are the results of actual investigation and meet many of the needs of reform and opening. He said that by offering such advice, the democratic parties have effectively given their roles full play in discussing and participating in the country's political affairs, and made new contribution to country's modernization drive.
