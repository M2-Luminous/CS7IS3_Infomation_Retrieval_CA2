He asserted that no one asked them to cut down their operations during the Geneva summit. His party does not carry out resistance activities based on the negotiations, because "we do not believe in these negotiations," Shaykh Qasim said. He pointed out that resistance operations are escalated and reduced according to the objective situation on the ground, not according to political circumstances. As for information coming from within Hizballah about preparations for a settlement, Shaykh Qasim clarified that the party opposes a settlement in the first place. He said: We are betting on its failure. We believe that there are enough complications and pressures to hamper many of the steps to a settlement. Therefore, Shaykh Qasim continued, the possibility of failure is as great as any other possibility.
