It was only after he had left that the U.S. Embassy informed the Ministry that Lopez had departed but without specifying how, Salvadoran Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Salaverria told LA PRENSA GRAFICA. In addition, Salaverria said the U.S. Embassy has been asked to explain how Lopez left the country. Salaverria pointed out that the Foreign Ministry has no jurisdiction over who leaves the country and that this is the Immigration Department's duty. He said that, according to international law, Maj. Lopez, who allegedly killed bodyguard Crescencio Diaz, enjoys diplomatic immunity and that therefore he will be tried in the United States. "Maj. Lopez' diplomatic immunity precludes his being interrogated in El Salvador," Salaverria said. He also said that the Foreign Ministry had checked Lopez' diplomatic immunity in the Ministry's files.
