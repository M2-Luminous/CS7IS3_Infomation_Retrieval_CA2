The text of the appeal was communicated to ITAR-TASS. Appointments for interviewing prime minister of the Republic of Chechnya government of the people's trust can be fixed by telephone: 278-62-74. Please, ask for Sergey Moyseyev. "The fate has once again given a chance to the Chechen people, perhaps, the last. Russia in the person of the State Duma has for the first time rejected a solution to the "Chechen problem" by using force, and has proposed peaceful means for settling mutual relations. Missing this chance will be a crime in the eyes of the people and history. Our progeny would not forgive us for this. But it is quite reasonable not to take advantage of the prospects opening before us under the conditions of a confrontation between political forces and movements of Chechnya," the appeal stated. The appeal is signed by Prime Minister of the Government of the People's Trust Y. Mamodayev and Chairman of the Constitutional Court I. Gerikhanov. It contains proposals how to take first steps towards practical reconciliation. It asks the president of Chechnya, as a guarantor of rights and liberties to citizens, together with the parliament, constitutional court, lawful prime minister, and with the participation of the masses to take measures for achieving national reconciliation, and also prepare a programme for holding a political dialogue with Russia. The appeal assumes that during the talks with Russia a moratorium will be imposed on all conflicts between parties, movements, different branches of power, state leaders, religious and social workers and individual citizens (in the form of blood feuds, disputes over land, etc.) for the sake of an equal and mutually acceptable treaty with Russia. It also asks for suspending decisions adopted by state power bodies of Chechnya, which can become a subject of talks between Russian and the Republic of Chechnya.
