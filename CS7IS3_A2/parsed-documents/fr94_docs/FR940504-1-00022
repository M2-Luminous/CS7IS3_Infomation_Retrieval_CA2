FR940504-1-00022 FR940504-1-00003 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION 10 CFR Part 51 Environmental Review for Renewal of Operating Licenses: Public Meeting AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ACTION: Notice of public meeting. SUMMARY: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff will meet with the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) and Yankee Atomic Electric Company (YAEC) to discuss their written comments that are responsive to the States' concerns regarding NRC's proposed rule on the environmental review required for renewal of nuclear power plant operating licenses. These concerns focus on provisions of the proposed rule that the States see as being in conflict with the traditional authority of the States to regulate electric utilities with respect to non-safety aspects of nuclear power generation. The purpose of the meeting is to assure that the NRC staff and the public understands the approaches proposed by NEI and YAEC. DATES: The date of the meeting is May 16, 1994. The meeting will begin at 1 p.m. and will finish by 4:30 p.m. ADDRESSES: The meeting will be held at One White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20852&hyph;2738, room 1&hyph;S 7&9. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Donald P. Cleary, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555; Telephone: (301) 492&hyph;3936. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The NRC published proposed amendments to its environmental protection regulations, 10 CFR part 51, which would establish new requirements for the environmental review of applications to renew operating licenses for nuclear power plants (September 17, 1991; 56 FR 47016). Concurrently, the NRC published NUREG&hyph;1437, a draft Generic Environmental Impact Statement (GEIS) that contained the analyses which the NRC proposed to codify in Part 51. In commenting on the proposed rule and the draft GEIS, a number of States expressed dissatisfaction with the treatment of need for generating capacity, and alternative energy sources. The States' concerns involve provisions of the proposed rule that the States see as being in conflict with the traditional authority of the States to regulate electric utilities with respect to non-safety aspects of nuclear power generation. The Commission instructed the NRC staff to develop options for responding to these States' concerns and in doing so to solicit the views of the States. The NRC staff solicited the views of the States and others through three regional meetings and a request for written comments (January 18, 1994; 59 FR 2542). To facilitate discussions with the States the NRC staff prepared a paper, ``Addressing the Concerns of States and Others Regarding the Role of Need for Generating Capacity, Alternative Energy Sources, Utility Costs, and Cost-Benefit Analysis in NRC Environmental Reviews for Relicensing Nuclear Power Plants: An NRC Staff Discussion Paper.'' The regional meetings were held in Rockville, MD, February 9, 1994; Rosemont, IL, February 15, 1994; and Chicopee, MA, February 17, 1994. A number of parties, including NEI and YAEC, filed written comments subsequent to the meetings. The discussion paper, meeting transcripts, and written comments, including NEI's proposal dated March 23, 1994, and YAEC's proposal dated March 18, 1994, may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC 20037. The NEI and the YAEC proposals were not adequately developed for discussion at the time of the regional meetings, and now the NRC staff needs to be assured that it understands the two proposals before reporting to the Commission on the options considered. All interested persons are invited to attend as observers. After the NRC staff's questions have been answered, time will be allowed to take questions and comments from the floor on the NEI and YAEC proposals. The meeting minutes will be transcribed by a court reporter. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 22th day of April, 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Bill M. Morris, Director, Division of Regulatory Applications, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10663 Filed 5&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7590&hyph;01&hyph;P
