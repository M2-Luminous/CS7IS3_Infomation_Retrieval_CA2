The sociological survey showed that the status of people in Chelyabinsk, compared with 1992, the year of the collapse, had improved in terms of all indicators: They are materially better off, the housing situation is less acute, basic living standards and the quality of food have improved and are now above average for the region, and the level of prosperity and social protection has risen. The point is that a system of social protection has started operating this year. Thus, expenditure on food now accounts for 49 rather than 70 percent of the family budget, as it was last year.
