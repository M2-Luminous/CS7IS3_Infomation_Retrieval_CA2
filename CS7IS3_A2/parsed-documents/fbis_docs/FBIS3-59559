The Forum on Law and Business is organizing a seminar with a triple objective: reviewing the stages of deregulation of telecommunications in Europe; anticipating its effect on the different segments of the market; and presenting the attitude of the operators concerned. The important thing here in particular will be to measure the real impact of opening the field up to competition. The British example shows what this means: After ten years of deregulation, BT still holds 90 percent of the telecommunications market on the other side of the English Channel, perhaps with a quasi-monopoly over local communications. A radical change in the regulatory setup is, of course, necessary so as to open telecommunications services up to the private sector; in the light of this, one particular effective opening is determined by the existence of authorities charged with daily monitoring compliance on the part of the competition. Along with Bruno Lasserre, director of the Directorate of General Regulation, Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, Maev Sullivan, of Mercury Communication, the BT challenger, an official from the Brussels Commission, and Joachim Scherer, a professor at Frankfurt University, will share their experiences.
