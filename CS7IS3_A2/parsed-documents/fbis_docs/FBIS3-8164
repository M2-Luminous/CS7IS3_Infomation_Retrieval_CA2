Talks began here Friday after the Bosnian Croats and mainly-Moslem Bosnian government signed an initial agreement there last Tuesday to form a federation. Delegation leader Ivo Sanader, Croatia's deputy foreign minister, said it was "difficult to say" when the new federation would actually be set up, but "the most important thing is that we have to find a solution which can satisfy the new federation and the Republic of Croatia. All of us are ready to do this." Bosnian Justice Minister and delegation head Kasem Trnka and Bosnian Croat leader Kresimir Zubak however refused to comment on the negotiations, saying it was "too early." One of the most difficult issues at the talks, held at the U.S. Embassy here, is how to carve up the cantons which will form the Swiss-style federation. The U.S.-sponsored plan, agreed in principle by Croat and Moslem leaders, aims to establish a federation inside Bosnia-Herzegovina made up of autonomous Moslem and Croat cantons. This would later form a looser, mainly economic confederation with neighbouring Croatia. The Serbs would be encouraged to accept a two-way division of the territory with the federation existing alongside their own Bosnian Serb republic. U.S. officials here said Saturday they would attempt to persuade Bosnian Serbs to back plans for the Croat-Moslem federation. [passage omitted]
