Commenting on the decree by President Boris Yeltsin, instructing the Russian Government to resume consultations with the Chechen side in order to overcome the present social and political crisis, the Chechen opposition leader said on Sunday: "This document, confirming the commitment by the Russian leadership to a political settlement of our differences, gives a historical chance to the Chechen people. But under the current confrontation within Chechen society, we cannot seize this chance and take a civilized path of building our statehood. Those who do not understand this or consciously oppose the process of national reconciliation are taking an anti-popular stand". Mamodayev said his government of people's confidence believes that Russia's attempts to contact not only with Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev but also with his political opponents threatened to mount political confrontation in the republic and complicate the fragile negotiating process. For this reason, we urge all our compatriots not to divide themselves into Dudayev's supporters and opponents but to subordinate their personal or corporate ambitions to the national interests in order to pull the long-suffering Chechen Republic out of the general crisis, the leader emphasised. Mamodayev is convinced that none of the political movements or groups can reflect the will of the whole people. With this in view, we suggest convening a Congress of the Chechen People in the near future and work out a single attitude towards relations between Russia and Chechnya, he said in conclusion.
