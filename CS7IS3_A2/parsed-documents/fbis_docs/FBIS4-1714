This main theme is where the overall interests of the whole party and the whole country lie. With such a theme in mind, this reporter yesterday interviewed provincial Governor Ma Zhongchen, who is also a Henan deputy to the on-going Second Session of the Eighth NPC in Beijing, on how to successfully press ahead with Henan's economic work and quicken Henan's development pace in the years ahead. Ma Zhongchen said: Since reform and opening up, Henan has rapidly developed the economy as well as exploited and utilized superior local resources. In 1993, Henan's gross national product reached almost 160 billion yuan, representing a 10-fold increase over 1978. Nevertheless, due to the limitations of Henan's traditional planned economic structure, including the traditional regional economic setup, the shortage of funds and technology, and so on, Henan has remained to date as a principal producer and exporter of farm and sideline products, energy, raw and processed materials, as well as other key primary products. In view of this fact, Henan has yet to fully develop superior resources and raise resource exploitation efficiency. Ma Zhongchen emphatically noted: The general train of thought regarding Henan's economic growth in the years to come should be: Quickening the pace of turning the province's national economy into a market economy, comprehensively implementing a strategy of building strong industry, improving agriculture, making urban economic development push ahead with rural economic development, effecting omnidirectional opening up, and attaining higher development goals, and take the road of development of carrying out intensive processing, exploiting superior resources according to international and domestic market demands, and turning resource superiority into economic superiority. This train of thought regarding Henan's economic growth was mapped out in a serious manner and in light of the realities in Henan. Mao Zhongchen emphatically noted: In order to implement to the letter the aforementioned train of thought regarding Henan's development, we should first and foremost try to enhance a sense of a market economy, undergo four ideological transformations, and focus on three key aspects. Ma Zhongchen noted: The four ideological transformations are as follows: 1. To build projects in light of market demands instead of available resources. 2. To develop an intensive processing industry capable of speeding up superior local resources exploitation rather than step up superior resources exploitation aimed at building an intensive processing industry. 3. To exploit resources in light of the international and domestic market demands rather than domestic market demands alone. At present, we should vigorously develop export-oriented industries, enterprises, and products. 4. To make full use of both overseas and domestic resources rather than local resources alone. To this end, we should make more use of overseas resources, including overseas funds, technology, qualified personnel, and information, and turn them into a supplement to such local resources as land, farm and sideline products, mineral products, and labor. The three key aspects are as follows: 1. To vigorously step up intensive processing of superior mineral resources so as to further develop coal energy industry, coal chemical industry, petrochemical industry, aluminium industry, and building material industry. 2. To successfully carry out intensive processing of farm and sideline products. 3. To bring local geographical superiority into full play and step up local human resources exploitation. Ma Zhongchen pointed out: In order to really turn resource superiority into economic superiority, we should adopt practical and feasible measures and carry out work in a down-to-earth manner by devoting more energies to the following five things: 1. To deepen reform, adhere to the public ownership system as the basis, vigorously develop various economic factors, fully mobilize the enthusiasm of various parties concerned, and push ahead with Henan's overall economic growth. 2. To further expand opening up and make more use of foreign capital, technology, and qualified personnel. 3. To promote scientific and technological progress with an eye to raising technological levels and output of Henan's national economy. 4. To raise construction funds through more channels and in more forms and successfully build each and every key project. 5. To establish more lateral economic associations and invite coastal and hinterland provinces to invest in Henan and take part in Henan's resources exploitation.
