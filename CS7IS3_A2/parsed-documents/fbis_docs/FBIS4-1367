In his usual Friday's conference with the press, the Unomoz [UN Operations in Mozambique] chief said that this situation is due to shortages of accommodation for the 15,000 personnel who do not have training programs. Until now, the training program has been established for 15 infantry battalions in a total of 12,000 soldiers besides the navy personnel, special forces, the logistical unit, as well as officers and generals who are attending leadership training courses. The concern is to find installations to accommodate the remaining 15,000 troops of the future army in the anti-aircraft, engineering, communications, and air force artillery departments. The Unomoz chief asked, "where are we going to place these men?", and said he is "concerned" about the slowness with which the government is confining its soldiers, and Renamo's [Mozambique National Resistance] slow demobilization of its guerrillas. He said, "Concerning the infantry battalions, we will begin their first training cycle with 5,000 soldiers, but there are army camps in the country which need to be extensively renovated". [passage omitted] Aldo Ajello revealed that Lieutenant General Tobias Dhai, the government's representative in the CCFADM [Joint Commission for the Formation of the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces], has undertaken to hand over the first list of army camps available for the training of the future single army troops. He also said that the two main parties of the Mozambican peace process have undertaken to deliver a list of Mozambican instructors who will be responsible for the training of the personnel. The possibility of involving Mozambican instructors in the training of the FADM had already been mentioned by Labor Minister Teodato Hunguana, who is the government's second in command in the CSC [Supervision and Control Commission]. On the occasion, Hunguana was reacting to a proposal forwarded by Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama to President of the Republic Joaquim Chissano, on the possibility of Zimbabwean instructors coming to train the Mozambican single army. The new proposals come as a result of the significant delays in beginning with the training of the infantry battalions, which is now scheduled for 25 April, with an official ceremony planned for 27 April.
