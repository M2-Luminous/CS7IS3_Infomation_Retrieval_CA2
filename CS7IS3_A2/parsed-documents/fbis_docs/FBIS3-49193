The studio announcer reads a report by the 1st Corps information service and says that "the Chetniks unscrupulously continue to shell the city and the defense lines. From their well-known strongholds on the hills surrounding the city, they are pounding Zuc and the Jewish Cemetery with shells of the heaviest caliber. In the course of the day, the enemy infantry attempted to break through our defense lines in the vicinity of the Jewish Cemetery, but they met with the firm resistance of the defenders and retreated to their initial positions. The Chetniks have been observed bringing in reinforcements of manpower and equipment to Grbavica, Lukavica, Nedzarici, and Azici." Olovo correspondent Velid Djindo reports that "the mortars from (?Bijelis) and (?Silajici) have been joined by howitzers from Kotakov Han, which at the time this report is being filed, around 1408 [1308 GMT], [words indistinct] the defense lines from Krusevo to Musici. In the last few days, the aggressor has been hastily regrouping his forces on the Olovo and Vares fronts. The concentration of enemy forces that began yesterday continued today on the Ajdarovici-Krivajici route. The offensive of the joint aggressors has entered its third month with constant enemy long-range artillery activity against civilian targets and our defenders' positions. The defense lines are stable." The studio announcer says that "some time after 1100 Galeb enemy planes overflew the Tesanj, Teslic, Maglaj, and Doboj regions, and shelled a part of the Doboj free territory." Doboj correspondent Mirudin Aldobasic says that "owing to this, an air alert was sounded, while all antiaircraft units in the 7-South Operative Group zone of responsibility are on alert."
