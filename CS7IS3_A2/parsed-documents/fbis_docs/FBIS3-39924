After talks with Mate Granic, his Croatian counterpart, Kinkel told journalists in Bonn today that it is now important to increase efforts to find a political solution to end the civil war. The prerequisites for this are good. Granic pointed out the negotiations taking place between the Croatians and the Muslim Bosnians in Zagreb today. Kinkel emphasized that "Sarajevo" had been "a first small, but very important step." Now they will, as if working on a mosaic, try to bring peace to the other main crisis areas in the conflict. It is important to open Tuzla Airport. It must be possible to transport humanitarian aid to the people in the disputed areas. The foreign minister announced he would be explaining the overall situation in the former Yugoslavia to the cabinet on Thursday [24 February]. A "new momentum" has entered the negotiations over the past few days that must be exploited. He also spoke to Granic about the repatriation problem regarding Croat refugees in Germany. Both sides are interested in a joint solution.
