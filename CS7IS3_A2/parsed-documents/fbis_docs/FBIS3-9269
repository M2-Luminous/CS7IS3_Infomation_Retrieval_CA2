He told TANJUG Wednesday prior to leaving for Zagreb that people wished normalization of relations with all Yugoslavia's neighbors, especially with Croatia because the situation there was most complex. Knezevic stressed that Croatia behaved differently on the international scene as opposed to bilateral contacts. The Yugoslav office in Zagreb was opened on the basis of an agreement the foreign ministers of F.R.Y. and Croatia signed on January 19 this year in Geneva. The office of Croatia in Belgrade was to be opened soon. Speaking about the first round of talks between the Republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.) and Croatia in Zagreb on Tuesday, Knezevic said that normalization between Knin and Zagreb would surely contribute also to normalization of relations between Belgrade and Zagreb. "It is very important that the talks are to be continued," assessed Knezevic and emphasized that "normalization and political solutions of problems between the R.S.K. and Croatia would be one of the decisive factors for pacifying the situation in the entire territory of the former Yugoslavia." The problem of the R.S.K. was one of the pressing issues in settling of the Yugoslav crisis. The R.S.K. was proclaimed in 1991 in parts of the former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia with predominantly Serb population in response to Croatia's forcible secession from the former Yugoslav Federation and reducing the status of the Serb people from a constituent people to one of a national minority in the new state. The subsequent armed clashes between the R.S.K. Serbs and the Zagreb authorities, which do not recognize the R.S.K., resulted in a decision to declare the R.S.K. a U.N.-Protected Area (UNPA) in the spring of 1992 until a political settlement was reached.
