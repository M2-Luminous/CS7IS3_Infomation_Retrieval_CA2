Speaking at the closing ceremony of an annual meeting of the EBRD board in St. Petersburg Tuesday, Gerashchenko pointed out that quite a number of reliable companies capable of maintaining civilized relations with the bank had appeared in Russia. He highly praised the EBRD's efforts in assisting Russia's small businesses and supposed that its dialog with Russian business would be even more productive, if carried out through the CBR. Commenting on the EBRD's activities last year, Gerashchenko noted that the amount of credits actually used for Russian projects had increased by more than 10 times and reached $120 Mn. In his opinion, the EBRD board of directors might function as the coordinator of various states' efforts for the support of Russian reforms. EBRD President Jacques de Larosiere pointed out that this body would use a more flexible approach to its relations with East and Central European countries and pay more attention to their small and medium-sized businesses.
