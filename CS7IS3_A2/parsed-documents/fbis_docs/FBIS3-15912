He participated on Thursday in a hotline telephone conference with regional leaders and heads of constituency electoral commissions. The conference was held by the Central Electoral Commission together with the presidential staff with an aim to check whether subjects of the Federation were ready for the forthcoming elections. Theoretically, all issues pertaining to the polls have been settled. But there are some facts provoking concern of federal authorities, filatov noted. First of all, these are certain breaches of citizens' voting rights, which have been already mentioned in a resolution by the State Duma. Thus, many experts point to improper "slicing" of constituencies. "There is some doubting that in certain cases the apportionment was politically motivated", the presidential staff's chief suggested. Sometimes, segmentation into constituencies "was carried out along ethnic lines, with distorted proportions in the number of constituents and a shift towards rural areas," he noted. Filatov urged regional leaders not to abuse their powers, since at the moment they are "the only authorities in localities and should always remember that executive and elected bodies of power should be kept in balance." One must not "erect barricades from the very outset of the election campaign," Filatov stressed. If we build up confrontation between different branches of government, reconciliation in the society will be never achieved, he firmly believes. Dwelling upon elections to bodies of local government, the presidential aide noted that some regions did not understand well enough what local government should look like. In this connection, Filatov referred to the Constitution which stipulates that local self-government is separated from bodies of federal power. It is up to local residents to decide what government they need. Local bodies of power should not be unified. Regional specifics and traditions should be taken into consideration. Filatov stressed the need for a law to give a clear definition for bodies of local government. He encouraged participants in the telephone conference to come up with their proposals on this issue, so that a draft law on local government could be submitted to the State Duma. Some officials believe that elections to bodies of local government should be postponed until after an appropriate law is passed. Filatov said the president was likely to issue a decree postponing the polls until this autumn, as the public chamber proposed. As for the regions which have settled all the problems in this field, elections will be held at the discretion of local authorities and residents. Filatov also expressed concern over the population's inertness in the election campaign. He called upon regional leaders to "work for the highest possible turnout in the upcoming elections".
