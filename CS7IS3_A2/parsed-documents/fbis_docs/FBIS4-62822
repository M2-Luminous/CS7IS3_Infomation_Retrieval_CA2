Belarusian representatives supported the resolution of the issue on the basis of a multilateral agreement. They proposed that the chairman of the CIS foreign ministers' council look into the possibility of launching consultations on the issue with the Baltic states. Russia insisted on the merchant fleet's division bilaterally between interested states and the Baltic states. If not approved, Russian experts said they would remove the proposal from the agenda. Finally, the experts' meeting requested that the foreign ministers' council take adequate measures to divide up the Soviet merchant fleet.
