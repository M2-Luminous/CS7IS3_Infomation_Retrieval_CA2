This situation has also impacted on the Palestinian leadership, which has lost a significant part of its credibility as a result of Israel's practices on the ground. Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi noted that after the massacre, the Palestinian popular mood lost confidence in the current political process. It believes that the talks will be futile and harmful if they are resumed without Israel dropping its claims on Jerusalem and the settlements and halting all settlement activities, which seek to create new facts that dictate the outlines of the final stage before the beginning of the interim stage. Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi stressed that the Palestinian leadership, which wants to be apprised of what the people in the occupied territories are saying now, should insist on the terms it has set and not back down. If the leadership wishes to regain its credibility, it should make those terms preconditions for returning to the negotiating table. Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi added: We are not demanding impossible conditions, because the issue of the Palestinian residents' security must be sacred to the decisionmakers. Therefore, we must adhere to our demands, epitomized by disarming the settlers; ensuring effective international protection for our people in the occupied territories; and evacuating the settlements from Arab towns and heavily populated areas, such as the settlement quarter in the heart of Hebron and similar places. Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi pointed out that adherence to these conditions might lead to the derailment of the peace process but that should this happen, the issue must be referred back to the international community to be resolved by it.
