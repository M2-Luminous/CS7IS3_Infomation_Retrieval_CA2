FBIS4-5287 "dreas069__a94022" FBIS-EAS-94-069-A Daily Report 4 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan JNP, Sakigake Surveyed on Political Realignment JNP, Sakigake Surveyed on Political Realignment OW0604141194 Tokyo SANKEI SHIMBUN in Japanese 4 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 3--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0604141194 Tokyo SANKEI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] SANKEI SHIMBUN conducted a survey in late March of 59 members of the Diet belonging to Sakigake [Harbinger], the Japan New Party [JNP], and the United Socialist Democratic Party [USDP] on the future realignment of political parties, including the formation of a parliamentary group and a new political party, which has now been argued within the ruling coalition. The results of the survey were compiled by 3 April. Sakigake and the JNP have formed an intraparliamentary group within the House of Representatives. Because all Sakigake members refused to respond to the survey, SANKEI SHIMBUN received responses only from some members of the JNP and USDP. In the survey, a little less than one-half of the respondents supported a merger between Sakigake and the JNP, which is currently a focal issue, and not many supported the idea of forming a new party among the ruling parties. Thirteen clearly stated that the JNP and Sakigake "should merge into one party," while only one strongly opposed the merger. Eleven said, "I do not know," indicating that they are wavering in their judgment. The results show that although the JNP and Sakigake formed a parliamentary group in the lower house on the condition that they would merge into one party in the future, the majority of the JNP members have begun to feel scruples about the merger due to confrontation between the leaders of the two parties over a cabinet reshuffle and differences in opinions on methods to promote political realignment. Concerning the ideal structure of the ruling parties in the future, nine of the respondents said the parties should form a "parliamentary group," four favored the idea of the ruling parties merging into a "new party," and one said they should only "cooperate in elections." The results show that one-half of the respondents think it is necessary for the ruling parties to strengthen their unity in some ways. On the other hand, nine said it was too early to consider forming a parliamentary group. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has proposed forming a policy study group among the ruling parties. Asked whether they would participate in the policy study group, 10 said they would, while 12 said, "I do not want to participate" or "I do not know." Those who said, "I do not know" pointed out that "the prime minister has not proposed forming a policy study group." They were also asked what would constitute the "nucleus of future political realignment." Most of the respondents said "foreign and security policies" and some mentioned "tax reforms." But as a whole, their answers to this question had an erratic pattern, indicating that it has not yet been decided which policies should constitute the nucleus of the political realignment. SANKEI SHIMBUN conducted the survey in late March. It sent questionnaires to 59 members of both houses of the Diet belonging to Sakigake, the JNP, and the USDP (42 JNP, 15 Sakigake, and two USDP members) and received responses from 26 JNP and two USDP members. At a general meeting of party members on 30 March, Sakigake decided not to respond to the survey, concluding that "because now is a delicate time, it is better not to respond."
