"The period of transition calls for a greater efficiency of executive power and simultaneously, for a greater efficiency of legislative power. However, the latter should deal with laws and not with efforts to create a majority. The president proposes a prime minister and a government but this does not necessarily has [as received] to be a majority government or a government representing some party. The president proposes concrete persons," Walesa told PAP reporters. When asked whether the system he proposes would not lead to excessive concentration of power, the president replied that "one can always criticize and have elections every six months instead of doing work." He upheld his opinion expressed after the September 1993 elections that the present parliament will not function long. Walesa rejected the possibility of running in the future presidential elections as a candidate of the Polish right wing. He announced that he will decide during the next three or four months whether he will take part in the elections as a leader of a presidential bloc.
