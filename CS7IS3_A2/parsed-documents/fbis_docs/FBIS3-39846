According to extremely confidential APOYEVMATINI information, YEETHA [National Defense General Staff] military officials have been particularly concerned. According to these reports, "heading toward the year 2000 and facing a chaotic situation in the Balkans, Turkey in the next three or four years will be well along the path of developing nuclear forces, something that will make it particularly respected in the part of the world stretching from the Adriatic to Kazakhstan." A nuclear program that aims to construct a nuclear bomb is under way. This program will be added to Ankara's already fast-developing arms programs for the Air Force and Navy. The same confidential analysis of Turkey's nuclear activities stresses that in the new geopolitical environment that followed the dissolution of the Soviet nuclear arsenal; Ukraine's acquisition of nuclear weapons; and the general instability in the Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Middle East, Turkey must prevent incidents from happening because the threat of small regional wars with nuclear weapons, such as between Pakistan and India, cannot be ruled out. [passage omitted] To a great extent, Turkey satisfies the basic prerequisites for a nuclear country. It has uranium supplies and is strong in the sciences. If its cooperation with Pakistan, Argentina, and China proceeds, the Turkish nuclear bomb will become a reality. At the same time, Ankara is trying to exploit instability in the Middle East as well as the ambitions of many states in the area, such as Libya and Iran, for weapons of mass destruction (nuclear-chemical) by claiming that Iran or Iraq will threaten it in the future. Therefore, because of changes in NATO policies, it must have a nuclear bomb. [passage omitted] Ankara is trying to acquire nuclear weapons from the former Soviet Union's full and diverse arsenal but is concerned with U.S. and European reaction. All those unemployed scientists have been hired to various "special groups" on a yearly basis for $2,300 per month. Their contracts may be renewed. Scientists from Kazakhstan who are experts on nuclear weapons teach at Istanbul University. [passage omitted] The cost of making nuclear weapons is believed to be great but Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and her staff are concerned with the new world that is being created. They attach particular importance to the country's nuclear infrastructure, which is now making progress and will show results in three or four years. APOYEVMATINI knows that Turkey's nuclear program concerns the Greek military. It is a fact that in the next few years, Turkey's threat to Greece will include a nuclear element. Our side must adopt a strategy that will analyze in depth future threats, mainly by Turkey's many arms programs.
