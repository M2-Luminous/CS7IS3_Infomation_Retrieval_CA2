Mesina, president of the so-called American Union Party, has been released from prison. Mesina is allegedly linked to Mario Aburto Martinez, perpetrator of the Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta murder, which took place one month ago in this border town. Shortly before his release, members of the Special Prosecutor's Office conducted raids at the residence and office of Dr. Ernesto G, Mesina, who has expressed to local media his pleasure over Colosio's killing. Mesina also considers Mario Aburto Martinez as a true hero and patriot for the murder. Regarding this topic, Gerardo Segura has filed this report: [Begin recording] [Segura] Was Mario Aburto a member of this party? [Mesina] Of course not, but I would be honored if he would have said: Dr. Mesina, I have read your book and the title of one of your articles, and they were the inspiration for my action. It is good this happened because this will allow us to have a fair government. I know people may criticize him a great deal now, but history will acquit him sooner or later. [Segura] There is talk he maintained contacts with militants of this party and this somehow inspired him to commit the crime. There is talk he held certain meetings here. It is even said he was at this building planning everything before the crime. [Mesina] Of course not. I did not have the pleasure of knowing Mario Aburto Martinez, but we would have had other meetings in any case. [sentence as heard] I have never met him, but this does not mean I do not admire him for what he did, for his courage. The assertions that this crime was an act of cowardice are not true.
