The amendments to the Act were made through an ordinance promulgated on Monday. The ceiling on voting rights of a shareholder in a banking company has been raised from the present 1 per cent to 10 per cent. This will allow promoters of private sector banks to exercise voting rights up to 10 per cent. The Act has been amended to allow splitting of the post of chairman and managing director. The ordinance provides for a part-time non-executive chairman. The existing provisions stipulate that a bank is to be headed by a chairman-cum-managing director. Section 16 of the Act has been amended to stipulate that no banking company incorporated in India shall have as a director on its board any person who is a director of any other banking company. The amended section also provides that no banking company shall have on its board more than three directors who are directors of companies which among themselves are entitled to exercise voting rights in excess of 20 per cent of the total voting rights. The penalties provided for contravention of the provisions of the Act have also been revised upwards so that they have the necessary deterrent effect. For contraventions or defaults by persons, the penalty has been raised from Rs 2,000 [rupees] to a minimum of Rs 50,000, while for banking companies, the penalty has been increased from Rs 2,000 to a minimum of Rs 5 lakhs. The promulgation of an ordinance to bring about the changes in the Act underlines the urgency the government attaches to the setting up of banks in the private sector. The Reserve Bank of India has cleared a number of proposals from the private sector to set up banks. They, however, could not start operation without the necessary changes in the Act. The demand to raise the ceiling on voting rights was made by promoters of private sector banks, including Mr S.P. Hinduja who is one of the promoters of the proposed Indusind Bank. The provision to split the post of chairman and managing director will not only allow the private sector banks with the flexibility of choosing between the two managerial structures (a full-time chairman-cum-managing director or a part-time chairman plus a managing director), but will also enable the government to bring about a change at the top management of the nationalised banks. The finance ministry is reportedly keen on changing the top heavy structure of the banks to infuse a sense of team work in the emerging competitive environment. In the case of some of the nationalised banks, there is virtually no communication between the chairmen and managing directors and the executive directors. Feed-back from many executive directors indicates that the chief executives will often keep them underutilised or keep them away from important portfolios. The splitting of the post of chairman and managing director will bring about a system in which the chairman will be free to concentrate on business strategies and policy issues, whereas the operational aspects can be looked after by the managing director.
