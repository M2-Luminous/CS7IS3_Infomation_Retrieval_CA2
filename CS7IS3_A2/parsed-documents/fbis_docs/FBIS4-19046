The recommendation is to be presented to the Executive Committee on 2 May and to the federal party congress in Rostock at the beginning of June. FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel had suggested that the Presidium make a quick decision in order to end the debate on the coalition statement. He said that factual work had been pushed too far into the background over the past few weeks. Over the weekend, FDP honorary chairman Hans-Dietrich Genscher said in an interview with DIE WELT that the public debate has made things difficult for Kinkel and announced: "He will clarify things very quickly now." A decision in favor of continuing the coalition under Helmut Kohl had generally been expected. Kinkel did not give the exact wording yesterday. The FDP chairman only said: "Anybody who wants to prevent a red-green [Social Democratic Party of Germany, SPD, and Greens] formation, or a grand coalition, must vote for the FDP." This way the question of whether the FDP reserves the right to cooperate with the SPD in case the CDU/CSU does not manage to achieve a government majority, remains open. Secretary General Werner Hoyer had been talking of a "conditional" coalition statement recently. Kinkel made a point of stating that the coalition statement is not a preliminary decision of the 23 May presidential election. If others establish such a connection "I cannot do anything about it," the party chairman said. Only the timing was surprising for the chancellor, not the contents of the coalition statement, said Helmut Kohl's supporters yesterday. Rudolf Scharping, the SPD candidate for chancellor, is thus coming under pressure to state clearly himself with whom he wants to form a coalition. Bonn is not Mainz, where he could dodge a clear statement before the elections. Also, it is a known fact that the FDP does not consider the presidential election to be a matter of being loyal to their coalition partners. CDU Secretary General Peter Hintze yesterday spoke of a "decision as expected." Thus, the choice on 16 October is either continuing the present coalition or going SPD/Greens.
