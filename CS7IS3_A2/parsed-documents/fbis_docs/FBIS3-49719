State Secretary Geza Entz, chairman of the Office for Hungarians Living Beyond the Borders, spoke to NEPSZABADSAG about this new misunderstanding and the controversy over the parliamentary representation of the national minorities living in Hungary. [Szabo] What did your office misinterpret? [Entz] Nothing. We informed the diplomats and newsmen on the expected events in connection with the rally in Revkomarom on the basis of the Slovak press reports available to us. One of the articles in question was published by UJ SZO [NEW WORD] in Bratislava, and the Slovaks probably misunderstood this article, although it was an objective one. The Bratislava note does not mention what "misleading" explanation we provided. We are not interfering in internal affairs. We are talking about Soviet-type accusations here. Gromyko used to be a great master of such things, and it seems that the Slovak Foreign Ministry has also become a great master in this. [Szabo] What is your opinion about the parliamentary decision that made it impossible for the national minorities in Hungary to come up with individual election lists? [Entz] The government position was the correct one, of course. It is difficult to solve the representation of national minorities in a one-chamber parliament. Their indirect representation can be solved in an extraordinary way by means of a strong positive discrimination. The government proposal wanted this, but the opposition rejected it by bringing up constitutional arguments. It is not true that the ethnic and national minorities in Hungary have no representation. There are several parliamentary deputies who represent the interests of national minorities by following the program of their party. [Szabo] Is this the acceptable solution? [Entz] It is not sure at all that this is the way to solve the issue of parliamentary representation for national minorities living in Hungary. In this particular situation, the issue can also be solved properly by means of the ombudsman. [Szabo] Will the Hungarians living beyond our borders suffer most from this decision? [Entz] The situation of Hungarians living in the neighboring countries is totally different from the situation of minorities living in Hungary. There is no positive discrimination there, because the Hungarians living in the neighboring countries have political and cultural traditions and they ensured their parliamentary representation with the help of their voters. The issue of national or ethnic communities living in a quantitative minority is the problem of the country in question. These problems cannot all be solved according to the same pattern. The 20th century proved this. Individual countries must not copy their neighbors. [Szabo] Do you fear any foreign policy consequences of this decision? [Entz] The decision will not have serious international consequences. Every member of the international community that does not represent a positive position on settling the national minority issue or displays a withdrawing attitude will make use of this. They are those who "argue" that Hungary has territorial demands. The position of the Hungarian Government played an important role in making sure that the law on national minorities contains the need for modifying the electoral law. This is not an issue closed for good. It should not be interpreted as a factor that hinders the positive settling of the minority issue in this region. [Szabo] Does it seem that some political circles will try to use this decision against Budapest? [Entz] This is why we wanted this issue settled in the form of a government proposal. This did not happen, and some circles will make use of this against us. One should not dramatize this fact because, if this decision had not been made, they would find something else. [Szabo] Do you see any chance of solving the parliamentary representation of national minorities in Hungary in a proper way? [Entz] I am sure that this issue will be solved properly, because the law on national minorities itself settled this issue from a more essential and thorough viewpoint. The new parliament will certainly return to this issue.
