The National Association of Open Market Institutions claims that investment in bank deposit certificates dropped by $2.2 billion, while according to the National Association of Investment and Development Banks fund investment dropped by $1.5 billion. In turn, savings deposits grew by $1.5 billion. The investment drop was caused by increased demand for black market dollars, which according to the ING Bank accounted for a drain of $800 million in the first half of June. Open market institutions themselves have also increased their government security purchases. This drop in traditional investment sectors, which amounts to 0.5 percent of GDP, is considered to be a consequence of the currency change scheduled for 1 July.

Franco's decree was published in the 22 June issue of the DIARIO OFICIAL. According to Jose Roberto D'Affonseca Gusmao, president of the National Institute of Industrial Property, this decree will stimulate the purchase of foreign technology. The decision to reduce this tax to zero was based on reports by the ministers of finance and of industry, commerce, and tourism. Last year, Brazil paid $240 million abroad for patent permits, brands, technical assistance, and technology transfer. Gusmao added that this amount is too small for a country such as Brazil, and shows that the companies were evading taxes.
