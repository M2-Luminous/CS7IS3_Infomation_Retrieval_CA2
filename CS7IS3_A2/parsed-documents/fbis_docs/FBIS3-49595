According to the daily which cites well-informed but unnamed sources, Defence Minister Valentin Karabashev gave up his plan to resign at a closed cabinet meeting on Monday [10 January]. His intention was caused by a reportedly "scandalous" talk with the president who treated the defence chief rudely, DUMA says. "Bulgaria Left With no Defence Minister for Three Days," says a headline capping a report on the same issue in the private daily STANDART NEWS. The daily quotes General Lyuben Petrov as saying the defence minister's resignation could trigger a chain reaction destroying the entire army administration. "SDS (the Union of Democratic Forces) To Ask President for Explanation," DEMOKRATSIYA, the daily of the union, headlines its article. The report says that according to the National Coordinating Council (the SDS supreme leadership), the president's decree on a presidential Military Office stirs suspicions of unconstitutionality. The parliamentary Movement for Rights and Freedoms (of ethnic Turks) will support the SDS, if the latter demands a closed plenary sitting where President Zhelev would explain his stand, DUMA says. NATO gave the green light to letting in east European countries through its Partnership for Peace Initiative. Strangely, Bulgaria's name is not mentioned in any of NATO's documents," [no opening quotation mark as received] OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK, quotes Asparukh Panov, member of the Bulgarian parliamentary delegation to the Council of Europe, as saying. Mr. Panov lays the blame on Lyuben Berov's cabinet, which failed to implement the declaration adopted by parliament late last year. In this declaration, the MP's obliged the cabinet to do its best to file Bulgaria's candidacy for membership in NATO. Bulgaria's Ambassador to Brussels Lea Koen was late to submit the National Assembly declaration on membership in NATO. Instead of handing the declaration personally to the alliance's leadership, she sent it by post, a correspondent of the KONTINENT daily in Brussels reports. The daily cites Deputy Foreign Minister Todor Churov as saying that right after the declaration was adopted, it was given to all Bulgarian ambassadors to the NATO member countries. According to the procedure, Ambassador Koen had to meet with and hand the declaration personally to Manfred Woerner, KONTINENT says. "It would be ridiculous and regrettable, if Mrs. Koen really did mail the document," Mr. Churov says. President Zhelev asked for Bulgaria's full integration and membership in NATO in a letter to the Alliance's Secretary General Manfred Woerner on September 27, 1993, i.e., nearly three months before parliament discussed Bulgaria's stance on relations with NATO and adopted a declaration, reports the press. BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party] leader Zhan Videnov yesterday described this "as a new example of the fait accompli policy becoming typical of the president's office," writes DUMA. According to 24 CHASA, the Bulgarian Socialist Party sees the president's letter as a gaffe manifesting his neglect of parliament. KONTINENT reports Mr. Zhelev today will meet with "eminent politicians to discuss the visit to Bulgaria on Thursday [13 January] of U.S. envoy Madeline Albright." [passage omitted]
