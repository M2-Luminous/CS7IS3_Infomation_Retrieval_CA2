['Abd-al-Ghani] That was a criminal and cowardly act perpetrated by the gang of apostasy and secession within the Socialist Party leadership. This is in addition to the previous criminal acts. They fired their missiles on residential areas. The last missile was fired on a hospital. We can see how they are continuing to pursue their destructive policy. While we continue to pursue our constructive policy for rebuilding and development. There is, of course, a difference between the two lines -- a difference which ordinary citizens can see. Their criminal acts will not pass without punishment, and our people know how to respond to these people. [AL-HAYAH] What will be the punishment? ['Abd-al-Ghani] The punishment that every criminal who kills innocent people deserves. [AL-HAYAH] Does that mean you will continue your military pressure on the other side? ['Abd-al-Ghani] Our military actions against the leadership of the rebels and secessionists in the Socialist Party will not be suspended until Yemen's unity returns solid and without these secessionists. [AL-HAYAH] Now that government forces have seized 'Ataq, the axis of the central sector of southern governorates, will they advance toward Hadhramaut? ['Abd-al-Ghani] Military actions against these people will not be suspended in any area until the people get rid of them. [AL-HAYAH] Is there a political solution to this war and the current problem? ['Abd-al-Ghani] A political solution is on the cards when military operations cease and the 16 leaders of the secession gang, whose prosecution has been ordered by the prosecutor general, give themselves up. [AL-HAYAH] We understand that the priority now is the military battle and the destruction of your rivals. ['Abd-al-Ghani] The fighting was started by the secessionist gang in the Socialist Party, and we are defending unity against what these secessionists are doing. [AL-HAYAH] Will the Socialist Party and some of its leaders whom you consider moderate have a role in the future of the political movement and power in Yemen? ['Abd-al-Ghani] We are willing to talk with Socialist Party members who have not participated in the secession crime. [AL-HAYAH] It has been noted that the prosecution and arrest warrant issued by the prosecutor general in Sanaa against 16 Socialist Party leaders does not include the names of important Socialist Party leaders like Salim Salih Muhammad, the party's assistant secretary general; Dr. Yasin Sa'id Nu'man, chairman of the party's Secretariat; and Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, chairman of the party's external relations department. Does that mean that it is possible to engage in a dialogue with these? ['Abd-al-Ghani] We are willing to engage in a dialogue with all the Socialist Party leaders who have not participated in the secessionist operation.
