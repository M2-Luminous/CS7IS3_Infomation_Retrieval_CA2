Thus, he said, the Committee of Relatives of Missing Detainees in Honduras's (COFADEH) petition in this respect is inadmissible. "No private organization has the power to order the suspension of the Armed Forces commander. This action can only be ordered by the corresponding legal authority," he emphasized. Callejas, in his role as general commander of the Salvadoran Armed Forces, opened the session of the Armed Forces Senior Council this morning.
