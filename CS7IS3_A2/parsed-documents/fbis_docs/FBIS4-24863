Addressing the Federation Council (the upper house of the Russian parliament), the South Korean leader also stressed that "It will be impossible to preserve peace in northeast Asia without Russian cooperation." Kim Yong-sam arrived in Moscow on Wednesday afternoon for a four-day official visit to Russia. On Thursday morning, he signed a joint Russian-South Korean declaration together with his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin during their summit talks. He told Russian lawmakers that through an "extensive dialogue" with Yeltsin this morning he was convinced that South Korea and Russia could be "trusted partners in quest of greater shared prosperity well into the 21th century." The South Korean leader said both the two states should cooperate to ensure the success of the reform policies now being pursued in both lands. He expressed the hope that his current visit will boost Russian-South Korean cooperation that "will make us even better neighbors." The countries' two-way trade jumped from only 900 million U.S. dollars in 1990 to 1.6 billion last year, Kim Yong-sam said, adding that South Korean businesses have invested 24 million U.S. dollars in 25 development projects in Russia, and as of March 1994, 29 major South Korean companies had established branch offices in the country. Kim Yong-sam appealed to the Russian lawmakers to actively cooperate in seeking an early solution to the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula.
