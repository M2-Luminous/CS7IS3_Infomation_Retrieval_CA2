Declaring that this individual's responsibility will be proven, he also remarked that it cannot be claimed that a "narcoeconomy" or "narcopolitics" exists in Mexico. When questioned about statements made by the PAN [National Action Party] governor, Ernesto Ruffo Appel, the attorney general noted that, on 4 March, he had informed the state governor himself of the remand. "I, like all Mexicans, have confidence in the Federal Judicial Branch," he commented at the end of the oath-taking ceremony for the class of 1,975 draftees at the Zocalo yesterday. Mr. Ortiz is responsible, and "this will be proven," declared Valades Rios. "And if he should not be culpable, the Judicial Branch will make the decision." However, "there is nothing political about the matter. I respect the governor, who is a PAN militant; I respect the nation's governors and all the political parties. Our only responsibility is to apply the law." Davalos: Does it appear to be a power struggle, or not? Valades: By no means; it has nothing to do with politics. It has been proven that Ortiz was on the site of the violent acts of 3 March. He has also been proven to have helped one of the drug traffickers, nicknamed "El Mayel," to escape. We shall verify that during the course of the trial, and it has nothing to do with politics. He went on to say: "The governor, whom I respect and esteem personally, will surely agree with me that it is up to the Judicial Branch to decide what is fitting." Davalos: Have you been in contact with the governor? Valades: Yes, I have been in contact with the governor, expressing my respect for him, and telling him that I trust in the justice system, as he does. I am convinced that Mr. Ortiz is in collusion with drug traffickers, and I shall prove it. Davalos: What is happening in Tijuana? Has it gone out of the government's control? Valades: Tijuana's problem is something that we all deplore. Both the local and federal authorities are striving, and maintaining levels of cooperation that please me greatly. I have acknowledged this publicly. Davalos: Could it be said that there is a "narcoeconomy" or "narcopolitics" in Mexico? Valades: No, that is not the case. Davalos: Isn't there any evidence that the financial system has been penetrated by the drug traffic? Valades: That has not occurred by any means.
