FR940811-0-00038 FR940811-0-00016 10. Potentiality for the Development or Recruitment of Nuisance Species in the Disposal Site [40 CFR 228.6(a)(10)] Local opportunistic benthic species characteristic of disturbed conditions are expected to be present and abundant at any ODMDS in response to physical deposition of sediments. Opportunistic polychaetes, such as Capitella, may colonize the disposal site. However, these worms can become food items for local bottom-feeding fish and are not directly harmful to other species. No recruitment of species capable of harming human health or the marine ecosystem is expected to occur at the site. In addition, recruitment of nuisance species from within the dredged material disposed at the site is unlikely, due to significant differences in water depth and environment at the disposal site as compared to the relatively shallow dredging sites in the San Francisco Bay region. 11. Existence at or in Close Proximity to the Site of any Significant Natural or Cultural Feature of Historical Importance [40 CFR 228.6(a)(11)] The California State Historic Preservation Officer has determined there are no known historic shipwrecks nor any known aboriginal artifacts at the SF&hyph;DODS or in the vicinity. D. Action EPA Region IX has concluded that the SF&hyph;DODS may appropriately be designated for use over a period of 50 years, with an interim capacity of 6 million cubic yards of dredged material per calendar year until December 31, 1996. After this date, site capacity shall be reevaluated based on the results of comprehensive regional dredged material management planning underway at the time of this rulemaking, or independently by EPA if a comprehensive management plan is not yet completed. No disposal shall occur after December 31, 1996 unless and until EPA establishes a new site capacity. Designation of the SF&hyph;DODS complies with the general and specific criteria used for site evaluation. The designation of the SF&hyph;DODS as an EPA-approved Ocean Dumping Site is being published as a final rulemaking. Management of this site will be the responsibility of the Regional Administrator of EPA Region IX in cooperation with the Corps' South Pacific Division Engineer and the San Francisco District Engineer, based on requirements defined in the Final Rule. Operational details for carrying out the Rule's required management and monitoring activities will be contained in a SMMP Implementation Manual prepared by EPA following the opportunity for public review. Subsequent revisions of the SMMP Implementation Manual will also be proposed through separate Public Notices. It is emphasized that ocean dumping site designation does not constitute or imply EPA Region IX's or the Corps' San Francisco District's approval of actual ocean disposal of dredged materials. Before ocean dumping of dredged material at the site may begin, EPA Region IX and the Corps' San Francisco District must evaluate permit applications according to EPA's Ocean Dumping Criteria. EPA Region IX or the Corps' San Francisco District will deny permits if either agency determines that the Ocean Dumping Criteria of MPRSA have not been met. The requirement for compliance with the Ocean Dumping Criteria of the MPRSA may not be superseded by the provisions of any future comprehensive regional management plan for dredged material. E. Regulatory Assessments Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, EPA is required to perform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for all Rules which may have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. EPA has determined that this action will not have a significant impact on small entities since the site designation will only have the effect of providing a disposal option for dredged material. Consequently, this Rule does not necessitate preparation of a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. This action will not result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or cause any of the other effects which would result in its being classified by the Executive Order as a major Rule. Consequently, this Rule does not necessitate preparation of a Regulatory Impact Analysis. F. Responses to Comments on the Site Designation Proposed Rule and the Proposed SMMP Public Notice EPA received 37 letters in support of the Proposed Rule and 14 letters critical of the Proposed Rule. Many of these 37 letters contained specific comments regarding the proposed SMMP. EPA also received, after the close of the comment period for the site designation Final EIS, a mass mailing of 105 similar letters containing some comments relating to site designation. Finally, EPA received 11 additional comment letters in response to the separate proposed SMMP Public Notice. All these comments have been carefully considered, and appropriate changes have been made in the Final Rule based on them. The comments have been grouped into similar categories for the purposes of preparing the following responses.
