The nuclear issue can be resolved through a "package deal" under which Western countries would "recognize the Pyongyang government while North Korea give up nuclear program," Kim said at a meeting in Taegu, capital of South Korea's North Kyongsang Province Saturday [9 April]. Kim, former renowned South Korean opposition leader, asked the South Korean Government to adopt a soft policy toward the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in order to bring about change. "The Cold War age is over and the conditions causing division of the Korean Peninsula have disappeared. So if South and North Korea continue their exhausting competition, both will turn into third- rate countries," he warned. Kim predicted, "North Korea will eventually abandon nuclear program and the United States will establish an embassy in Pyongyang." Speaking at Pusan University in the country's South Kyongsang Province Friday, Kim Tae-chung said that South Korea and the U.S. should not resume their joint military exercise "Team Spirit" as it would impede dialogue on the nuclear issue.
