FR940325-1-00060 FR940325-1-00008 This proposed rule would establish guiding principles to be addressed in the development of standards and guidelines. The guiding principles represent what the Department has identified as the resource concerns and types of management practices that must be considered in the development of standards and guidelines. The guiding principles for the development of standards are intended to provide focus on riparian area function and the minimum soil and vegetation conditions required for rangeland ecosystem health. The guiding principles for the development of guidelines for grazing administration provide focus on the consideration of management practices that assist in or do not inhibit meeting certain legal mandates and achieving and maintaining rangeland health. Included in these guiding principles are the requirements that State or regional guidelines address: grazing practices to be implemented to benefit threatened or endangered species and candidate species, and to maintain, restore or enhance water quality; critical periods of plant growth or regrowth and the need for rest from livestock grazing; situations in which continuous season-long grazing, or use of ephemeral rangelands, could be authorized; the allowable types and location of certain range improvements and management practices; and utilization or residual vegetation limits. The BLM State Director, in consultation with multiple resource advisory councils, the interested public, and others, would be required to develop standards and guidelines that are consistent with the national requirements and the guiding principles. It is anticipated that there may be a need to add additional standards and guidelines consistent with the national requirements to reflect the State or regional resources, the character of the public lands, local livestock management practices, and community interests. For example, State or regional guidelines may specify limitations on the season of livestock use or thresholds for utilization by livestock in crucial big game winter ranges. Multiple resource advisory councils, and their rangeland resource teams and technical review teams, would play an important role in designing standards and guidelines to meet conditions and concerns encountered within the specific State or region by facilitating open discussion and ensuring that the views of all interested parties are considered in preparing their recommendations for the BLM. The BLM would not implement State or regional standards or guidelines developed pursuant to this proposed rule prior to their approval by the Secretary. The proposed rule includes a provision for fallback standards and guidelines that would become effective 18 months after the effective date of the final rule in the event that State or regional standards and guidelines are not complete. The fallback standards and guidelines would remain in effect until State or regional standards and guidelines are completed and approved by the Secretary. The fallback standards are largely based on indicators of soil stability and watershed function, distribution of nutrients and energy, and the ability of plant communities to recover. The three categories of indicators, when considered in combination, have been found to be key in assessing rangeland health. The standards are generally based on the findings of the Committee on Rangeland Classification presented in ``Rangeland Health'' (National Research Council 1994) and BLM's Riparian Area Management (TR1737&hyph;9, Process for Assessing Proper Functioning Condition, 1993). A fourth fallback standard addresses indicators of healthy flood plain structure and condition, a critical component of healthy rangeland ecosystems and riparian systems.
