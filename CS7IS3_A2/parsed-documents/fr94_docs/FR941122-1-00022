FR941122-1-00022 FR941122-1-00002 Our first proposed change to the rules governing the use of a heating or cooling standard is to provide direct entitlement to a standard by households in private housing who have heating or cooling costs apart from or in addition to their rent. Under the proposal, these households would be entitled to use the heating or cooling standard even if their actual utility usage is not determined by separate metering. The amount of the expense could be determined and verified by means other than separate metering, such as a statement from the landlord. If, in addition to rent, the landlord charges a flat amount for utilities each month which includes the cost of heating or cooling, the household would be entitled to the heating or cooling standard. Regulations at 7 CFR 273.2(f)(1)(iii) do not require State agencies to verify entitlement to a standard allowance. However, entitlement to a standard may be verified if it is questionable, as provided in 7 CFR 273.2(f)(2)(i) or under 7 CFR 273.2(f)(3) as a State agency option. The proposed rule retains the statutory prohibition against use of the heating or cooling standard by households in public housing. This proposed change would extend use of the standard to households that live separately but share a utility meter. Under current policy, if two households live separately but have one meter, the households are prohibited from sharing the standard, and the State agency cannot grant the standard to both households even though both incur heating or cooling costs. Under the proposed change, the State agency would be required to grant the full heating or cooling standard to both households if both incur or anticipate incurring out-of-pocket heating or cooling expenses separately from their rent or receive or anticipate receiving LIHEA. A second proposed change in the standard utility allowance rules stems from numerous policy questions that have been raised regarding when and how often a household has to incur an expense in order to be eligible for an annualized heating or cooling standard. As indicated above, State agencies currently may choose between seasonal heating or cooling standards and an annualized standard that includes year-round heating and cooling costs. State agencies have complained that regulations and policy regarding use of an annualized standard are confusing and difficult to administer. We are proposing in this rule to simplify the regulations for determining when a household is entitled to an annualized standard utility allowance that includes heating or cooling costs. Annualized standards represent the average monthly heating and cooling costs for the entire year. This means that in some months during the year, and perhaps during the certification period, the household may not have any heating or cooling costs. For example, a household that previously had no heating or cooling costs applies in June and does not anticipate incurring any heating or cooling costs during the summer months. However, the household will incur heating costs in the fall. Regulations at 7 CFR 273.10(d)(4) provide that the State agency shall calculate a household's expenses based on the expenses the household expects to be billed for during the certification period. Therefore, if the household above is certified for three summer months and incurs no heating or cooling costs, the household is not entitled to an annualized standard that includes heating costs. If the household is certified for six months and anticipates incurring heating costs in the fall, however, it is entitled to the heating standard. State agencies have complained that this policy is difficult to administer and can result in inequities. To reduce the problems associated with determining when a household is entitled to an annualized heating or cooling standard, we are proposing in this rule that a household that currently incurs or expects to incur out-of-pocket heating or cooling costs during the next heating or cooling season (except a household in public housing with a central meter where the household is billed only for excess usage) is entitled to an annualized heating or cooling standard regardless of when the certification period begins or ends. This rule further proposes that the household shall continue to be entitled to the standard until it no longer expects to incur heating or cooling costs during the next heating or cooling season. The State agency would be required to reexamine a household's entitlement to the heating or cooling standard at recertification, when the household moves, or when the household voluntarily reports a change affecting entitlement to the standard.
