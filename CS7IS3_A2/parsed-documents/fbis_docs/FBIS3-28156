However, North Korea still refuses to accept nuclear inspections, leaving the issue unresolved. SANKEI SHIMBUN reporter Katsuhiro Kuroda has exclusively interviewed Yi Tong-pok, former special assistant at the Agency for National Security Planning, to ask about the prospects for the nuclear issue. Mr. Yi is said to have had profound experiences in negotiating with North Korea at the North-South talks since 1970. He is also known to have been South Korea's toughest negotiator with North Korea. Mr. Yi resigned as the special assistant in late 1993 following an incident involving his ignoring a presidential directive to South Korean negotiators at the North-South talks. It is said that the incident occurred because of a discord within the South Korean Government. In the exclusive interview, Mr. Yi said: Concession Means Weakness It is said that I resigned because of a confrontation between hard- and moderate-liners [in the South Korean Government], but it is not true. It is better to say that I resigned because of differences between professionals and amateurs on North Korea. The Kim Yong-sam government's attitude toward North Korea appeared to be reconciliatory at first, but its attitude has now become tough after experiencing reality. There is no need to worry about the government's attitude toward North Korea. There are some lessons for negotiating with communists. For example, in principle, no "agreement" should be reached with them that leaves room for them to interpret things their way. The agreement would be scrapped because of differences over the interpretation or the communists would press their counterpart to make concessions. The agreement must be phrased unequivocally and specifically. A book entitled "Tactics for Negotiating With Communists," written by U.S. Admiral Joy [name as published] who was a chief delegate to truce talks with North Korea during the Korean war (1950-53) pointed out that North Korea used the tactic to tenaciously repeat its assertions and prolong the truce talks with the aim of getting its counterpart tired. North Korea is invariably using the same tactic. In his book, Admiral Joy pointed out that 1) we must not ease our pressure; 2) we must not be impatient, but we must conclude talks with communists in a short period; 3) we must not make any concessions to which they do not reciprocate; 4) we must not step back from our original political aims; and 5) we must indicate that we will not hesitate to go to war with them if talks are broken off. I agree with his suggestions. North Korea Has the Capability To Build Two Atomic Bombs It is wrong to view that North Korea has simply used the nuclear issue as a diplomatic card. Given the nature of the present North Korean system, North Korea is firmly determined to develop nuclear weapons. If North Korea has extracted plutonium from the operation of a 5-megawatt reactor since 1986, that country could now have about 15 kg of plutonium. This plutonium is enough to manufacture two Nagasaki-type atomic bombs. If international nuclear inspections are put back on track, North Korea would no longer extract the plutonium. Fuel samples should be checked to determine how much plutonium North Korea has extracted and at the same time, international nuclear inspections need to be undertaken at North Korea's undeclared nuclear waste disposal sites. For now, the United States and the IAEA appear to be intending to keep North Korea from extracting additional plutonium by having North Korea accept the international nuclear inspections on its declared nuclear facilities and to deal tenaciously with plutonium in the hands of North Korea with the determination of risking North Korea's manufacturing nuclear weapons. As a precedent, South Africa has dismantled its nuclear weapons after developing them. Economic Sanctions in Near Future In negotiations with the IAEA, North Korea has accepted only one-time inspections of its undeclared nuclear sites. The third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks may be held, but the talks will face an impasse because of North Korea's continued opposition to both special and normal inspections. North Korea will try to negotiate at every stage of inspections and to buy time. In response, argument for imposing economic sanctions against North Korea will grow and the argument may lead the UN Security Council to decide on economic sanctions against North Korea. How long will the IAEA and the United States be patient with North Korea's suspected nuclear development? In the near future, North Korea will stand at a crossroad of making a hard choice between its renunciation of nuclear development and its formal withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Since the nuclear issue has arisen from North Korea's system, the issue cannot be resolved fundamentally without a qualitative change in the system. The United States is moving in the direction of increasing its pressure on North Korea with the aim of causing the qualitative change in the system.
