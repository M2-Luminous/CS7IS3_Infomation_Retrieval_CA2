Brigadier General Carlos Grigoletto Cortijo, commander of the 5th Jungle Infantry Division, said that this operation was supported by the authorities and campesino communities in the area. He added that more than 20 people were arrested and that so far 28 maceration pits built close to the plantations have been destroyed in the provinces of Bagua and Condorcanqui. He indicated that an important volume of precursors for the production of drugs was also seized. Grigoletto Cortijo stated that 500 hectares of coca plantations were destroyed in the Santa Maria de Nieva area. Local residents have reported that there are more coca plantations further up the Nieva River. This region can be reached by motor boats and other types of transportation. He indicated that the strong pressure against traffickers in the Central Huallaga area has caused many of them to move to El Muyo, Miramar, Salinas, Montenegro, Chiriaco, and Santa Maria de Nieva in the provinces of Bagua and Condorcanqu, where they have planted coca and constructed maceration pits. Grigoletto Cortijo said there are many native communities in those areas and the chiefs of these communities are persuaded to support the planting of coca. ``The large sums of money paid by the traffickers convinces many of the chiefs to support the planting of coca in their territories.''
