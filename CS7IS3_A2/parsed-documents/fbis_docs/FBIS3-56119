The most influential of them is the so-called 'party of power,' represented by presidential structures and a majority of lawmakers. The possibility to influence the progress of electoral competition is their privilege. These people are interested in preserving the current state of things, which amounts to preserving their legislative seats. I think that the constituency has had a chance to access the activities of this group and to feel the effects of the latter over the last four years. I do not mean only negative phenomena surrounding us but also genuinely historic events -- the winning of independence and avoiding armed conflicts. Although, I must point out that this achievement should not be attributed to our mutated nomenklatura, because they are rather a result of our nation's wisdom, perseverance, and natural drive for democracy, telling to obey the most mediocre governments out of compassion for the weak and unwise. The current government made promises and humbly repented for not keeping them, but when it comes to losing power and dramatically changing their fate, they will wage an uncompromising war to keep their seats. The merging of powers has resulted in a situation when every oblast has its "presidents" and "fuehrers" ready to use their official status for victory in the elections. The Socialist Party is another significant political force, represented by communists who want to separate themselves from the crimes of the Bolshevik regime and accept existing realities, including Ukraine's independence. However, this does not mean that these people have broken the ideals of "real socialism." Socialists oppose "antipopular reform" and "capitalist ideology." Before the reconstitution of the Communist Party of Ukraine, its members worked within the Socialist Party structures. One could assume that the two parties would form an electoral bloc, but following the Communist Party's official registration, conflicts arose over distributing nominations for candidates. Then, Socialists made the final decision to refrain from forming coalitions and decided to participate independently in the elections. Still, in the political aspect, the Communist Party remains a shadow of the Socialist Party; being not the smallest party in Ukraine, it does not have a lot of supporters. After some aggressive statements by its First Secretary Symonenko, the leadership of the party keeps mysteriously silent, perhaps having a surprise up their sleeve. One may anticipate that depending on the results of the elections, Communists will probably join Socialists or vice versa, disregarding the only basic discrepancy in their programs. Socialists champion Ukraine's independence, while Communists oppose it. However, judging from their fraternization, the similarity of political views, and traditional habit not to keep promises, new realities may bring the two parties together. The electoral bloc of V. Hrynyov's New Ukraine and the Civic Union led by former Prime Minister Kuchma, also has numerous supporters. The two parties have absolute accord on the most crucial issue -- Ukraine can survive only with Russia's assistance and thus, will continue to be dependent on its neighbor. This standpoint puts an end to age-old hopes to join Europe, once voiced by the Ukrainian president. Leonid Kuchma continues to reiterate his hackneyed phrase that the West will not welcome us. However, he has never bothered to ask himself this question: "Why should they?" Yet, a difference in views on Ukraine's economic development seems more surprising. Hrynyov advocates deep political and economic reform on the basis of market relations and private property, while Kuchma, being the prime minister supported the preservation of the state-run sector, representing 95 percent of the Ukrainian economy. Both parties are primarily represented by hardheaded technocrats and big enterprise managers disregarding any psychological peculiarities of the nation. Many of them believe that patriotism is for fools. For example, Hrynyov treats the winning of independence as a given fact and not a progressive phenomenon. In his opinion, Ukraine should become a multinational state. The trick is that this otherwise perfect term in the current realities is devised for granting privileges to Russian culture and Russian mentality. Pragmatists do not care about Ukraine's rocky path to freedom. Finally, the fourth force (due to its numeric strength rather than political significance) is the People's Rukh of Ukraine. Its program lists joining the EC, consolidating economic independence, and a renaissance of Ukrainian culture as the organization's primary goals. According to Rukh postulates, a society devoid of national features cannot integrate in world processes without risk of becoming someone else's appendage. A renaissance of national culture is a prerequisite, or rather the only way to join world culture. Without strengthening patriotism it is impossible to overcome the economic crisis racking the country. This is not romanticism; this is one of the most important factors of stability and democracy, which has been proven by the experience of those European and Asian countries that have become world leaders with regard to people's well-being. The remaining principles promoted by the Rukh coincide with those of New Ukraine -- the building of a market economy and equal relations with all states, including Russia. The chances of political parties and blocs in the upcoming elections depend not only on the number of their members, but also on the number of supporters and sympathizers. It is interesting that out of 450 electoral districts, 300 are urban districts. It is evident that the future fate of the state will be determined in those districts. In Donbass, the south Cisdnieper areas, and a part of northeastern Ukraine, votes will be divided between the Hrynyov-Kuchma bloc and socialist-communist candidates. However, it would be naive to believe that this will grant anyone absolute domination in the legislature. National-democratic forces will probably receive support from central and western Ukrainian oblasts.
