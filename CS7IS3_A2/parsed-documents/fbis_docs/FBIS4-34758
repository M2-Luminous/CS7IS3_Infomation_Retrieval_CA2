Questioned by the media, Robaina said this type of meeting is held only when a country inspires confidence and security for businessmen, who have realized there are true investment opportunities here. Due to Cuba's proximity to Caribbean Basin countries, Robaina commented on Caribbean ties. [Begin recording] [Robaina] Fortunately, we are climbing a path toward normalizing and broadening relations, and we are about to make a very important decision for the Caribbean and Cuba, which not only receives from the Caribbean, but -- to be modest -- also has many things to offer to the Caribbean. We are about to create the Caribbean States Association, thereby taking one important and valid step toward joining the process to participate in the world economy. [Unidentified reporter] [words indistinct] and Cuba and the United States could become trade partners in view of the first [words indistinct] [Robaina] I do not believe in establishing normal relations with the United States. We have a document listing those countries that were with us when we were being besieged. Those countries that helped us when we were being blockaded will continue to play a special role. As for establishing relations with the United States, it may or may not happen; it may come or it may not. To us, Latin America, the Caribbean, and Canada will always be Latin America, the Caribbean, and Canada, because they supported us first. [Reporter] [words indistinct] [Robaina] We will not negotiate the establishment of diplomatic relations. These are things that go without saying; they go without saying insofar as the process to establish relations advances. We can say that we maintain diplomatic relations with China and Belize and that we have contacts with Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Costa Rica. Establishing ties, however, is not part of our plans. We do not want anyone to feel pressured by Cuba, which maintains relations with 147 countries. I believe that should we talk about isolation, we would be the most supported isolated nation. [Reporter] As for last week's OAS meeting held in Belem, Brazil, how do you view Cuba's role within the OAS? How do you view Cuba's rejoining the OAS? What are the steps you think Cuba will take in the near future? [Robaina] As far as Cuba is concerned, we will not take any steps. Being part of an organization that expelled us is not one of our priorities. I believe it is the OAS that must decide whether the conditions to amend an unfair decision have already been met. I believe the OAS will have to make a decision; only then will we issue our opinion. We have much more important priorities than joining the OAS. [Reporter] As for the U.S. blockade on Cuba, when do you believe it will be lifted? [Robaina] I believe this is an important question because our front-door neighbors are the ones blockading us. You will have to ask the same question to the United States with as much fervor as you are asking me now. I believe, however, that sooner or later the U.S. blockade will be lifted; this is a situation that cannot go on forever, but we do not expect the blockade to be lifted sooner rather than later. I believe the U.S. Government is still refusing to lift it. For the first time, however, public opinion and U.S. businessmen and businesswomen are beginning to reject this policy because Cuba is not the only one that is blockaded; they are as blockaded as we are. In the country of freedom, they cannot visit Cuba; in the country of freedom, they cannot invest here. In other words, we Cubans are blockaded, and so are they. [Reporter] Can Cuba survive five more years of U.S. blockade? [Robaina] We already survived 35 years, and I think that, if we survived 35 years under worse conditions, then five more years is nothing. If you ask me, however, I do not want this to happen; but we are willing to accept it. [end recording]
