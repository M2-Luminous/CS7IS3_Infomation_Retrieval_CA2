We have no ambition, aim, or purpose other than the return of right to its people and owners on their national soil and the achievement of a comprehensive and just peace, which future generations can accept, safeguard, and defend in an honorable and secure life. His majesty added: We in Jordan are one family of various origins and are cohesive in the homeland of the free people. Man is valued by the sacrifices he has offered and will offer in the future by confronting the challenges and carrying out the national duty. His majesty also stressed that Jerusalem and the holy shrines would remain in our conscience and that we will continue to work so that they will be for us all with God's sovereignty prevailing and so that these holy lands become a source of enlightenment, as they used to be in the past. His majesty's statements came when he received at the Royal Hashemite Court today a delegation from the Arabs of Nazareth, Akko, Galilee, the Triangle, and the Negev, who came to Jordan to extend condolences to his majesty and the honorable Hashemite family on the death of Queen Mother Zayn al-Sharaf, beseeching Almighty God to have mercy on her soul, grant her paradise, and inspire patience to his majesty and the honorable Hashemite family.
