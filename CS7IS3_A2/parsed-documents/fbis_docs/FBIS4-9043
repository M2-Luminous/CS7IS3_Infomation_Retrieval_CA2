"What we predicted, happened. The Czechoslovakists, pro- Hungarian elements, Slovak janissaries and certainly lots of international lobbies are intensively strangling Slovak freedom," the daily says. It stresses that the "initiators of Slovak sovereignty" are being sacked, while their posts are being occupied by opponents of sovereignty and independence. "Everybody was shocked how rapidly the current government started to destroy the corner stone of our fragile democracy -- the freedom of the press. They want treacherously to liquidate the only opposition daily in Slovakia. Ostensibly because it is published by the Slovak news agency (TA SR)," Smolec notes. He expresses a regret that the "normalization steps and liquidation of the daily" is happening before the eyes of the Slovak president for whom the nationally-orientated journalists had worked. Unfortunately, the head of state placed around himself the sort of Slovaks who were afraid of uttering a word about the Slovak president under the federation (Czechoslovakia) and now they are "servilely jumping around" him. According to Smolec, Kovac has "hesitated and speculated so much" that Slovakia has experienced a repetition of the Victorious February (ascendancy of the communist regime). "These days confirm that Slovak freedom will long not flourish. Independence is threatened. Decision-making is in the hands of people who struggled against it. The era of normalization, corruption and hypocrisy is evidently coming," stresses Smolec who predicts his expulsion from the paper as in the days of the normalization. "Dear readers! Hope dies last. The truth will not succumb to fire or sword. Watch attentively the REPUBLIKA imprint. If we are thrown out, we will raise our voice under another title," concludes Smolec.
