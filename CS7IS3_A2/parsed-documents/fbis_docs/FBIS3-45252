This shows that the central authorities will further speed up the pace of peaceful reunification of the two sides of the strait by strengthening the roles of international contacts. The source said that when talking about the work concerning Taiwan affairs some days ago, a high-level central leader emphasized the necessity of gaining a realistic understanding of the new changes in Taiwan's current situation, such as the resignations of senior party, government, and military leaders of the older generation and the fact that the second generation of leaders are in power. The new generation of leaders are different from the senior leaders of the older generation in their relations with the mainland. The leaders of the older generation have a thousand and one links with the mainland but have a stronger anti-communist sense. The leaders of the second generation have fewer links with the mainland and also a weak anti-communist sense. Instead, they have a stronger sense of being content to exercise sovereignty over a part of the country. We cannot say that they are all advocating "Taiwan independence." The high-level central leader held that under the new situation, work concerning Taiwan does not mean mere contacts with the Kuomintang [KMT]. It is necessary to contact various political parties and factions in Taiwan, including the Democratic Progressive Party. The central leader reiterated the following three principles will never change in work concerning Taiwan: The principle that there is only one China; the principle of resolving the Taiwan issue in a form of "one country, two systems"; and the principle of not promising to give up forces in resolving the Taiwan issue, especially under the situation that foreign powers are interfering in Taiwan's internal affairs or when separation or independence issues appear in Taiwan. Referring to the development of cross-strait economic relations and trade, the central leader said: Judging from current developments, as some big projects invested by Taiwanese businessmen are not coordinated with the planning and deployment of the central authorities and the relevant departments in charge do not have effective coordination mechanisms and corresponding policies, making the approval procedures rather complicated and time-consuming, there are still difficulties for Taiwanese businessmen to come to invest in the mainland. These are also problems to be resolved. The following are decisions made by a recent joint meeting of various central departments concerned, which was presided over by the high-level central leader: 1. A national conference on economic work relating to Taiwan will be held this coming spring to work out special documents on some special subjects, the substantive contents of which have been discussed many times. 2. It is proposed that a coordination group for economic relations and trade with Taiwan is established under the State Council. 3. To adopt "preferential and special policies on special issues" toward Taiwanese businessmen. In comparison with the existing policies on foreign investment, more preferential treatment will be given to Taiwanese investors. In some spheres the policies can be further relaxed, and there will be no restrictions on some projects regarding their distribution and planning. 4. To work out laws to protect Taiwanese investors. 5. To agree in principle to the establishment of Taiwan-funded banks; to satisfy as far as possible the needs of Taiwan-funded enterprises for funds in terms of the renminbi. 6. To make positive efforts to promote cross-strait cooperation in the fields of science and technology and agriculture and encourage Taiwanese businessmen to invest in mainland agricultural production. For example, when they have invested in establishment of farms to produce grain, the issuance of export licenses will be taken into consideration. 7. On the issue of export of labor to Taiwan, a unified policy will be worked out by the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office and the matter will be taken care by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC] in a unified way. The ARATS [Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait] will be authorized to consult and sign contracts with the other side, and concrete affairs will be handled by qualified labor companies. MOFTEC [Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation] will not handle concrete affairs concerning labor exports to Taiwan.
