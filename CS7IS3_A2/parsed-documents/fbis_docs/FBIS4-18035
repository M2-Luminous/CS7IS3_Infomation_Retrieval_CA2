The conference was attended by representatives of the Union of Cossacks and the Union of Cossack Troops of Russia and Abroad. There was a detailed discussion on the Cossacks' problems and on the need to give Cossack formations independent state-legal status. An appeal to Russian Federation President B. Yeltsin was adopted as a result of the discussion, in which the leaders of Cossack formations offered their own proposals to take the Cossacks to a new level of cultural, economic, and military development. The text of the document and the circumstances which made its appearance necessary were commented on by Comrade Ataman Vladimir Naumov from the Union of Cossacks, who took part in the conference: "No legislative act concerning a state formation of the Cossacks has been properly implemented so far. The greatest concern is caused by time wasted developing the entire state service system, despite the fact that Cossack regions ensured the latest draft into the Russian Army. Cossack posts are being brought up to strength at the most dangerous points along the Russian border. Cossack communes have received their first few thousand hectares of land and have become a force capable of protecting Russia's borders. The Cossacks need state status in Russia, because their present status as a social organization has exhausted its possibilities. "Meanwhile, some rather dubious organizations are operating on the land markets of the Don and the Kuban; they have already bought up considerable areas of land, while the Land Bank of Russia, which once backed Stolypin's agrarian reforms, does nothing. But the Cossacks will not serve without land. That is why it is necessary to finally adopt normative documents on a special procedure for Cossack land use, following on from the presidential edict `On the Regulation of Land Relations.' What is happening in the Don region and the Kuban could lead to social uproar. "The situation is critical: There has now formed a potent mix of several former representatives of state services and criminal `authorities,' who have begun to pin all kinds of general's shoulder straps, sabers, and orders on one another. "There are certain forces trying to set the Cossacks in opposition to the Russian state. Imposters are appearing: Laughable figures in Cossack uniform with a rich criminal past, promising everyone everything immediately in their quest for Cossack chieftainship. But, as historical experience shows, those who swear loyalty with excessive fervor are the first to betray you. "Of course, many want power and the benefits that go with it, but giving power over paramilitary organizations to all and sundry is unwise, to say the least. This was clearly demonstrated by the scandalous meeting in Omsk in January. "The president of Russia has clearly said that Russia is a great country, and the Union of Cossacks is prepared to do state service for the good of a great Russia. "With the power of the center weakened, only the full development of state service will make it possible to end the oppression of the Cossacks in the North Caucasus, Tataria, Khakasia, and the former Soviet republics. Unfortunately, the State Duma's draft laws have yet to note the special status of Russia's border regions and the stabilizing role which the Cossacks could play. Very many new faces have recently appeared in the parliamentary arena, but will state wisdom finally appear in the State Duma? The Cossack villages of Taldy Kurgan have been blockaded for more than a week now, and there are other deplorable examples. Every opportunity must be taken to protect the Russian population. It is dangerous to delay. In our view, the first step must be to set up a state committee for Cossack affairs under the government."
