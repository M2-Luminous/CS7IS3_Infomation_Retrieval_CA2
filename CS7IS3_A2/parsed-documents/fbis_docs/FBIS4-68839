Raspopin, chairman of the Novosibirsk Municipal Committee for Protection of Consumer Rights, by Vladimir Krylov, VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK correspondent; place and date not given: "The Law Is on Our Side"] [Text] Last year, starting in May, from the moment the Law "On Protection of Consumer Rights" went into effect and the appropriate municipal committee was established, the committee received about 2,000 complaints, more than 1,500 of which were examined and the rest are in a stage of resolution. More than 37 million rubles [R] has been returned to purchasers. We bring to your attention an interview by our correspondent with A.N. Raspopin, chairman of the Municipal Committee for Protection of Consumer Rights. [Krylov] Aleksey Nikolayevich, I happened to read about this kind of incident once in an American journal. Coming down the stairs in a hotel, a little girl stumbled on the stair carpet, broke the heel of her shoe, and dislocated her foot. A suit was filed in court. Expert analysis established that, first, the runner was not stretched tight and, second, that the screws attaching the heel were not long enough and did not ensure reliability. The victim was paid a big sum in damage compensation. After reading this, you will sigh: Well, that is in their country! You will not get anything like this in our country. Is this really so, is our consumer without rights? [Raspopin] No, not now. Each one of us is reliably protected by the Law "On Consumer Protection." In addition, it is well reinforced by the Statute "On Coordinated Actions To Ensure State Protection of the Rights of Consumers of Commodities, Work, and Services," which was signed by a whole number of responsible government organs. An entire system for the protection of consumer rights has been established in the country. [Krylov] Everything is described in sufficient detail and clearly in the law. But what are the fundamental rights of an individual if he bought a commodity of poor quality, or if he is dissatisfied with work and services performed on his order? [Raspopin] In the event that an article proves to be of low quality, has defects and flaws, and does not meet required standards, the seller is obliged to perform repairs at his own expense or replace the commodity. If the article went out of commission during the warranty period, responsibility is also placed with the selling organization and, in addition, if the purchaser refuses an exchange, he is reimbursed not the former cost but the new cost in effect the day of the appeal. We have mainly had complaints about television sets, refrigerators, and washing machines, and they occurred for wine and vodka items and household services. All the suits were satisfied. I will cite even this example. As a result of a power surge, expensive equipment--a personal computer system and a video set--were burned out at citizen Stankov's place. He filed a suit. The case was decided in his favor, and the cost of the equipment--R1.7 million--was paid, plus punitive damages, and 15 percent of the cost to the state budget; in addition, the guilty organization paid R36,000 for the expert evaluation. [Krylov] But how is trade reacting? [Raspopin] Sometimes it shows opposition and refuses to compensate for damage voluntarily: returning the money, or replacing the commodity. But as soon as the question of bringing the case to court arises, the tone of many people changes, as a rule. [Krylov] It also happens frequently that sellers cannot provide reliable information about the commodity and the manufacturing firm. Either they do not possess it, or they cannot be bothered to answer, or they deliberately conceal things in order to sell a commodity. What is done in such a case? [Raspopin] Articles 6, 7, and 8 of the Law "On Protection of Consumer Rights" obliges the manufacturer and seller to make information about a commodity available to the purchaser in an easily understood form--the manufacturer, the price, the main consumer features, and storage periods. Incidentally, on the basis of the Law "On Answerability of Sellers for Violating Consumer Rights" in the event of a systematic violation of rights, a trade enterprise and a manufacturing firm can be liquidated in the established legislative procedure. It cannot be ruled out that an announcement could be made about the fact that the store is being closed for violating consumer rights. [Krylov] There is not always time in the store to examine a purchase. For example, I brought it home, looked it over carefully, there was something I did not like, then... [Raspopin] Then the purchaser has the right within two weeks from the day of the sale to return the commodity and demand an exchange. [Krylov] The rather widespread rebuke still occurs in trade: We did not produce it, all claims have to be made with the manufacturing plant. [Raspopin] This is absolutely not true. Trade is obliged to sell only quality commodities, to conclude a contract for guaranteed service and repair, or to refuse to sell such a commodity. Even if there is no contract but the commodity is defective, trade is nonetheless obliged to repair or replace it, and it in turn requires compensation from the manufacturer. [Krylov] But what about warranty periods? Household equipment is expensive, but trade frequently establishes ridiculous periods--sometimes several days, sometime a couple of weeks, and, at best, a month. But a hidden defect does not always appear that quickly. [Raspopin] Here trade is wrong. Established standard periods exist--for complicated household equipment, as a rule, this is a year or two. Even if the seller writes that, he says, he is giving a guarantee for only two weeks or two months, in the event the purchased household equipment breaks down the law will be on the side of the consumer. [Krylov] That is, sellers should remember the saying: You cannot back out once you have begun. [Raspopin] Absolutely correct. And also a certificate has to be shown during the purchase. All products that come into the trade network must be certified in a mandatory procedure. Incidentally, if the trade inspection discovers the absence of a certificate--it has a right to remove the commodity from sale. [Krylov] Sometimes in the plant instructions for equipment, notations are made that if there is no date of sale and store stamp or the commodity was sold by a commercial structure, the manufacturer is not responsible and does not provide warranty repair. [Raspopin] The purchaser does not have to pay attention to such notations, just as the court does not take them into account. Such notations contradict the Law "On Protection of Consumer Rights." [Krylov] Thus, if the purchaser acquired a faulty commodity, and trade refuses to satisfy his claim, he should appeal to you? [Raspopin] Yes, but only physical, private persons. We do not examine suits of juridical persons. We will provide the consumer with a consultation, and we will draw up all documents free of charge, and the purchaser himself will not have to pester anyone. [Krylov] As far as I know, the procedure for appealing to the court is rather simple. But why do people, after gossiping among themselves, not defend their rights according to the law? [Raspopin] Most likely because the very word "court" is associated with something unpleasant. But after all, this is a normal civilized means of defense of their rights. Indeed, even the plaintiff may not appear in court himself--our structure will take care of everything for him.
