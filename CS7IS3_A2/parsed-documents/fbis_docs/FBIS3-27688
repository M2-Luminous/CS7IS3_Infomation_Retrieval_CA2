His visits marked the peak of increasingly active exchanges and cooperation between the CPPCC National Committee and parliaments and mass organizations in other countries over the past year. This is the first time for the chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC, the largest united front organization in China, to visit other countries since the founding of New China in 1949. During his visits, Chairman Li Ruihuan briefed the leaders of the three countries and people from all walks of life on China's foreign policy, and its multi-party cooperation and political consultation system under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, promoting exchanges and cooperation between the CPPCC National Committee and parliaments in the three countries. Public sentiments overseas confirm that Li's visits represent the CPPCC National Committee's dual role in expanding both governmental and non-governmental exchanges in the diplomatic area. Established 45 years ago, the CPPCC National Committee consists of various non-communist parties and mass organizations and is considered a creation for enhancing socialist democracy in China. It plays a significant role in political consultation and democratic supervision in managing state affairs. International exchanges held by the CPPCC National Committee in 1993 were characterized by frequent visits to other countries by the committee's leaders. Also in 1993, Ye Xuanping, Wu Xueqian, Seypidin Azizi, Hong Xuezhi, Hu Sheng and Sun Fuling, vice-chairmen of the CPPCC National Committee, paid separate visits to Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Syria, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain. During their talks with the leaders of these countries, these vice-chairmen reiterated China's consistent stand in support of the just cause of the people in developing countries and expounded the positions of the Chinese Government concerning the international situation and regional conflicts. Furthermore, they also explained to their guests the role of the CPPCC organizations in a bid to expand cooperation with parliaments and mass organizations in other countries. To date, the CPPCC National Committee has forged cooperative relationships with 46 organizations in 36 countries. The committee focuses its international exchanges and cooperation on China's economic construction. Various subcommittees also try to expand cooperation with economists and scientists overseas. For example, while visiting Britain in 1993, members of a delegation sent by the subcommittee of science and technology concentrated on learning how scientific and technological findings were applied to industrial production. Moreover, they discussed with their British colleagues the relationship between scientific research and social progress, in an effort to draw on useful experience to perfect the policy governing the development of science and technology in China. Also in 1993, leaders of the CPPCC National Committee received 250 leaders of overseas Chinese organizations in Britain, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, the Philippines and the United States. This year the committee will continue to expand cooperation and exchanges with parliaments in other countries. It will also organize specialized groups to visit foreign countries.
