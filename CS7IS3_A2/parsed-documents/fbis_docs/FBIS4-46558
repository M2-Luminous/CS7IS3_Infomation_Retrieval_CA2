It was being laid down back in prewar time, but the war did not permit construction to be completed. The Kurgan Machine-Building Plant put out the first product, reduction gears and trolleys for travelling cranes, only in 1950. At that time it belonged to the Ministry of Transport Machine-Building. Beginning in 1954 the Kurgan Plant began mastering production of defense products--the ATS-712 medium artillery prime mover. A specialized design bureau was established here for developing prime movers and other combat equipment. Construction of the forge shop, foundry and assembly shop was in full swing. At that time the plant was manned by experienced engineering-technical cadres of the Omsk Plant imeni October Revolution, the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant and other defense enterprises. Following the first vehicle, whose series output began in 1955, a new one, the ATS-650 artillery prime mover, was designed and went into series production in the early 1960's. When the Kurgan Machine-Building Plant was assigned in 1968 to produce an infantry fighting vehicle (BMP-1) that was fundamentally new from the standpoint of military equipment design and technology, over 40 percent of manufacturing equipment already was operating here in an automatic or semiautomatic regime, numerical control machine tools and automatic lines were being actively introduced, and instrument making shops were being developed intensively. Not many know that it was in Kurgan that series production of thin-walled armor hulls with use of original manufacturing processes was adjusted for the first time in the world, which permitted cutting the labor-intensiveness of work in half and achieving high quality of manufactured products. The BMP-1 was mastered at the Kurgan Machine-Building Plant in a rather short time and 2,000 vehicles per year were produced. This number was sufficient to completely satisfy the Army's needs for infantry fighting vehicles [IFV's] and spare parts for them. The plant was awarded the Order of Labor Red Banner for mastering and organizing production of this machine. [Box insert] Our reference The BMP-1 represented a fast, highly maneuverable, armored and very reliable fighting vehicle. It was armed with the 2A28 Grom 73-mm smoothbore gun, a coaxial 7.62-mm PKT [Kalashnikov tank machinegun] and Malyutka ATGM system. A spacious passenger compartment equipped with firing ports and periscopes permitted assault troops to conduct massed fire without leaving the vehicle. [End box insert] The BMP-1 received high recognition not only in our Armed Forces, but in many foreign armies as well, above all of Warsaw Pact countries, and also in many states of the Near East and Africa, in India and in others to which they were exported. The concept of infantry fighting vehicles as a kind of combat equipment proved very successful. The BMP-2 was a further development of the BMP-1. [Box insert] Our reference The BMP-2 already had automatic weapons and antitank missiles of a new generation. In particular, the Malyutka ATGM system was replaced with the more advanced Konkurs antitank system. The Grom gun gave way to a new 2A42 30-mm automatic cannon stabilized in two planes and with a double-belt feed. The BMP-2 is capable of destroying even helicopters. Even today, it is one of the best IFV's. Many designers, engineers and workers of the Kurgan Machine-Building Plant were recognized with high awards and the State Prize for developing and organizing production of the BMP-2. [End box insert] The BMP-2 was used widely in Afghanistan and showed itself to be a very effective means in conducting combat operations in rugged areas, also including the mountains. Our soldiers called it the "swallow," and the enemy dubbed it the "devil wagon." Its appearance at positions struck panicky fear in them. When the BMP-2 was placed in series production, not even everyone at the plant knew that the design of a fundamentally new IFV, the BMP-3, already was in full swing in a specialized design bureau under the direction of Doctor of Technical Sciences Major General A. Blagonravov in close cooperation with the Tula Specialized Instrument Making Design Bureau (General Designer Academician Shipunov). [Box insert] Our reference The BMP-3 differed from its predecessors not only by the weapons complex, but also by its configuration and chassis. A more powerful (500 hp) engine was installed in the BMP-3. A hydromechanical transmission with power takeoff to water-jet propellers was used for the first time on domestic armored equipment, which permits it to cross water obstacles at a speed of 10 km/hr. On the highway the BMP-3 easily develops a speed of up to 70 km/hr and it has a range up to 600 km. The BMP-3's arsenal includes the 2A70 100-mm gun/launcher, 2A72 30-mm automatic gun and PKT machinegun. All this is installed in a single unit in the turret. The IFV combat team has at its disposal two PKT machineguns in independent mounts in the fighting vehicle's hull front section, two Kalashnikov PK machineguns in stowage, six AK-74 assault rifles and a 26-mm signal pistol. [End box insert] The BMP-3 was demonstrated at a 1993 arms exhibition in Abu-Dhabi, where it received high acclaim from military and technical specialists. A number of countries expressed a desire to purchase our IFV for their own ground troops. One lot of them already has been delivered to the United Arab Emirates. Today, when the volume of the defense order has been cut sharply, the Kurgan Machine-Building Plant, along with mastering the BMP-3, is forced to engage actively in conversion programs, particularly the output of machine-building products for the national economy and sophisticated household equipment. Plant shops now assemble not only IFV's, but also the KMZ-012 minitractor with a full set of detachable equipment, trailers, and MKSM-800 small, multipurpose, self-propelled civil construction vehicles. The civil construction vehicle, for example, can be used as a loader, for grading and moving soil, digging trenches and pits, stacking pallets, bricks and concrete elements, and performing other work. Under conditions of an extremely difficult economic situation, all this permitted preserving a more or less stable position of the enterprise and unique specialist collectives. The proportion of civilian products in the overall production volume was 45 percent in 1993. The Kurgan Machine-Building Plant has been one of the best defense industry enterprises for more than two decades. Speaking of the plant and its establishment, it is impossible not to note that all combat equipment developments were carried out here in close collaboration with specialists of Transmash VNII [All-Union Scientific Research Institute], the Military Academy of Armored Troops, Kubinka Scientific Test Institute of Armored Equipment, and officers of the Russian Ministry of Defense Main Armor Directorate. Along with creating and producing a new type of equipment, much attention always has been given to solving social and everyday problems. Every fifth resident of Kurgan (350,000) is connected with plant activity in one way or another. Several years ago the plant was reorganized as an open joint-stock company and now is developing along the path of reorganization as a major financial-industrial group. Under conditions of clear insufficiency of the state defense order and practical absence of other kinds of budget financing, the enterprise is forced to seek new mechanisms for preserving scientific and production cooperation. Essentially the only solution is to orient itself toward carefully calculated market needs and conquer the market, relying on support of nonstate financial and investment institutions. A key point in creating such an infrastructure is the determination and development of an optimum model of relationships which would permit using the industrial and financial potential with greatest effectiveness. The Kurganmashinvest Investment Company is being established for this purpose at the initiative of the plant, of the specialized Russkoye oruzhiye Corporation, and of MENATEP Bank. The Spetsialnoye mashinostroyeniye i metallurgiya AO [Joint-Stock Company] and a number of major suppliers and traditional partners of the Kurgan Machine-Building Plant also became part of the company. Founders of this company see their main task to be a unification of efforts for developing and producing advanced, competitive models of armored equipment by attracting nonbudget funds of commercial as well as state structures; supporting an active marketing program; and providing legal and financial support to the sale of products in markets and to their servicing.
