Throughout April, the banks must either sell the so-called bad debts or regard them as losses. By Thursday [31 March], the seven banks that have emerged from the Polish National Bank in 1989, were supposed to eliminate the so-called bad debts, which are worth approximately Z16 trillion. These are credits that companies have stopped repaying as early as before June 1991. The law on lessening the debt burden allowed banks to decide what to do about dishonest debtors: to lessen their debt burden if the debtors' activity brings profit, to sell their debts, or to move to have the company in question declared bankrupt or dissolved. For banks not to get into financial trouble in the process of lessening the debt burden, the state budget gave the banks bonds worth Z11 trillion. At the same time, the budget imposed an obligation on the banks to get rid of the credits by the end of March. There Are No More Old Debts Anymore According to the Finance Ministry, banks had gotten rid of a majority of old debts by the end of February. "We will not have complete data until mid-May, once the bank's situation is examined by auditors," chief of the Finance Ministry Henryk Chmielak assured his listeners during a press conference held on Thursday. By the end of February, banks have concluded about 50 agreements and contracts, which made it possible for them to restructure about Z3.6 trillion old credits. "We have received signals that many banks managed to come to an agreement with their debtors only at the last moment. Yesterday, the Lublin-based Savings and Credit Bank signed an agreement with the Stalowa Wola steelworks," Minister Chmielak said. "If a bank initiated proceedings before the end of February aimed at signing an agreement, it can continue with the proceedings.. But the agreement must be signed by the end of April," the minister warned. Banks have not yet completed their negotiations with companies that owe the banks about Z4.4 trillion. Unsold Debts Mean Debts Without Value In accordance with the law mentioned before, banks were also empowered to sell debts by bad clients at public auctions. This way, the seven banks wanted to get rid of financial claims worth Z980 billion. Two-thirds of those claims were actually sold. A derivative market for selling financial claims has only begun its activity in March. "Banks are allowed to sell the remaining financial claims by 24 April--that is, before auditors initiate their control measures," employees of the Finance Ministry say. In their view, if banks are not successful in selling the debts of some companies, that will mean that the debts are without value, and the given bank will have to regard the money as a loss. Strategic Debts Not Wanted Banks did not know what to do about debts by those companies that are in trouble but that are of strategic importance to the economy, like, for instance, arms factories. "The Finance Ministry has made efforts to have debts by 38 companies taken over by an Agency for Industrial Development," we were told by Finance Ministry officials. But the agency refused to do that, saying that the companies are hopeless cases. These companies owed about Z1 trillion just to banks, whereas their total debt amounted to Z8 trillion. The ministry decided that the banks must also sell the debts of these companies. Banks have submitted motions to have companies declared bankrupt or to have them dissolved. This applies to those companies that owe the banks Z676 billion. Companies that have not repaid the seven banks' Z1.6 trillion went bankrupt or were eliminated. Some clients have initiated servicing debts worth approximately Z1 trillion. Western Money, Clean Accounts Banks must clean their accounts, and, in this way, they will become more attractive to investors during privatization. "Privatization of those banks will bring two kinds of benefits to the state budget," Minister Chmielak argued. "First of all, the budget will receive revenue from the banks' privatization, and, second, the budget will not have to buy out the bonds that the budget had given to the banks." After the sale of a bank, money to buy out the bonds would come from a State-Owned Fund for Bank Privatizations. The fund has about $650 million at its disposal; it was established out of the old Fund for Stabilization of the Zloty. A majority of the fund's monies comes from donations by other countries. The money is in the Federal Reserve Bank in New York, and it earns interest. Privatization of a bank is the only precondition for being able to use the money. First in line is the Krakow-based Industrial-Commercial Bank, which must be privatized by 20 January 1995. --According to the Finance Ministry, it will not be possible to use the money out of the Fund for Bank Privatizations to buy out Z10 trillion worth of bonds that the General Savings Bank-National Bank and the Food Industry Bank had received. These banks received the bonds later, which means they must get rid of the debts by the end of September.
