Additional threats were made on 30 and 31 December. AL-HADATH reportedly stated that management attached "little importance" to these threats, attributing them to "traffickers in religion" and to "plain assassins," and noting, "This strengthens our belief that we are on the right track--that of fighting for Tunisia."
