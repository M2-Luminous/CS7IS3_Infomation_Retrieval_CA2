FBIS4-39325 "drsov109_p_94001" FBIS-SOV-94-109 Daily Report 6 Jun 1994 CAUCASUS Armenia Cease-Fire Violations, Attack on Border Reported Cease-Fire Violations, Attack on Border Reported NC0606161694 Yerevan Radio Yerevan in Azeri 1330 GMT 6 Jun 94 NC0606161694 Yerevan Radio Yerevan Azeri BFN [Text] Dear listeners, we now present a report on the latest situation in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] and the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Although the mediation effort to find a peaceful solution to the NKR problem is being maintained, Azerbaijan's military forces have continued to fire on the Armenian positions at the NKR front lines with various types of arms every day. We already reported in our previous broadcasts that the Armenian side wishes to remain committed to the agreement that has been reached on a cease-fire. In fact, the Armenian defense units have not returned the fire and refrained from retaliating against provocative activities in Martuninskiy Rayon today. Meanwhile, no incidents occurred on the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan during the past day. Azerbaijan's military forces attacked an area on Armenia's border, which is only five km from Noyemberyan, the night before last. An enemy battalion, supported by armored vehicles, attacked the defense positions in the vicinity of [place name indistinct]. A wave of artillery shelling preceded the onslaught. The enemy units tried to approach the Noyemberyanskiy Rayon center. They managed to advance in a few areas. However, the Armenian border units repulsed their attack at 0300 the next day. Azerbaijan's units were forced to retreat after losing many men and military equipment. The Armenian side also suffered casualties. The Azerbaijani mass media organs claimed several days ago that the Armenian military units penetrated up to five km into the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic. The objective behind the dissemination of such unfounded reports is to justify the Azerbaijani Military Headquarters' aggressive intentions. However, the enemy side must realize that it will not be able to achieve its objectives through aggression. Armenia's border guards are capable of appropriate retaliation against the enemy units. Azerbaijan has been reluctant to relinquish its inauspicious intentions. Consequently, innocent people have been killed or wounded. How will the Azerbaijani Military Command Headquarters account to the families of the troops who have been killed in the latest clashes?
