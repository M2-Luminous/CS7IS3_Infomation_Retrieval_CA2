Prime Minister Jean Chretien says Canada will scale back or cancel its peacekeeping effort if there is no progress toward peace or if the arms embargo on Bosnia is lifted. Mr. Chretien made the warning yesterday while visiting Canadian peacekeeping troops in Visoko, Bosnia. Canada has 800 soldiers there and another 1,100 in neighboring Croatia. Mr. Chretien and other Western leaders discussed troop withdrawal earlier this week during D-Day ceremonies in France. He said a final decision on the peacekeeping force will be made in September when the Canadian peacekeeping mission expires. The prime minister arrived home to Ottawa today after making the first ever visit to a war zone by a serving Canadian prime minister. Meanwhile, a one-month UN-sponsored cease-fire in Bosnia has gone into effect.
