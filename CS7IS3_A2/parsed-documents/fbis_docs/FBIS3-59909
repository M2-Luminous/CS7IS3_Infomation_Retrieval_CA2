Speaking at a meeting devoted to Baykonur's life-support in Moscow on Monday, Soskovets said that "this object is indispensable both for strategic purposes and scientific research." Russia and Kazakhstan have signed two agreements determining the terms of use and exploitation of Baykonur facilities. Under the agreement, the center is considered to be under Russian jurisdiction. Vladimir Ivanov, commander of the Russian Aerospace Forces, said that Kazakhstan is "seeking to reconsider the status of the cosmodrome to make it international." He stressed that despite the signed agreements it is necessary to "reconfirm the cosmodrome's Russian status." Ivanov also called for signing an additional agreement between Russia and Kazakhstan to specify the questions of logistical support and joint financing of the cosmodrome. The participants in the meeting called for a "reasonable compromise between Russia and Kazakhstan on the exploitation of the cosmodrome facilities." They noted that leasing the cosmodrome to Russia could be one of the forms of cooperation.
