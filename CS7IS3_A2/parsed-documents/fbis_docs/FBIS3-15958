Can we call it a crisis now? Here is our commentator Aleksey Sokolov's view. [Sokolov] Indeed, there are quite a few reports in the press on this. A lightweight diplomatic scandal is brewing between Moscow and Washington -- this is how IZVESTIYA, for instance, has headlined one of its articles. The article is about the possible negative consequences of the former U.S. President Nixon's visit to Russia, where, unfortunately enough, he had a meeting with the opposition before meeting the head of state and those who represent the administration. The article's author does not rule out the emergence of new and substantial friction in the relations between Moscow and Washington. State Duma speaker Ivan Rybkin did mention the rough patches that have recently been affecting the relations between the two countries during his recent visit to Washington. Incidentally, I have so far failed to come across the word crisis, evidently because, when all is said and done, there is no crisis as such between Russia and the United States. It is more likely that other aspects do exist here -- it is simply that Moscow and Washington have begun to regard each other from more realistic positions. There is no doubt that Russia's vigorous diplomatic initiative in Bosnia took America by surprise. To detract from its undoubted impact, a jealous White House wheeled out the Ames' spy affair. Pleasantries were exchanged -- the Russian and American residents were expelled from Washington and Moscow. The United States began to fan up the spy hysteria in every possible way here. The halting of U.S. assistance to Russia was even mentioned. Nevertheless, let me reiterate that there are no grounds to speak of a crisis in the Russian-American relations. It simply looks like the United States, which has adopted the unofficial title of the only superpower and which has recently gotten used to Moscow behaving in a certain predictable pattern on the international arena and to its role as a younger brother, as it were, has suddenly discovered that despite its own family difficulties, this brother has become stronger and more confident and that it intends its role in international affairs to be completely independent. It is as though the United States has forgotten that in view of objective reasons, such as the size of its territory and the presence of nuclear weapons, Russia itself was, is, and will be a world power, with a voice and interests of its own. No, it is not a matter of returning to the times of the Cold War. Russia is no longer ideologically hostile to the West -- but, having said that, it does have inalienable national interests with which, judging by everything, the United States will have to reckon in the nearest future. As for America's interests, these can at times continue to coincide with the Russian interests or not, as the case may be, and if the latter is the case, rough patches are possible. However, the essence of the mutual relations between Russia and America ought to remain invariable. As Ivan Rybkin noted in Washington, partnership and cooperation in the name of peace and concord in the world represent the constant features of Russian-American relations.
