These rumors claim that the top officials from the Crimean Government -- President Yuriy Meshkov and Vice Prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov, who comes from Moscow -- are at odds and a new government will be soon established in the Crimea. Moscow economist Yevgeniy Saburov, who was not recognized in his own state, came to the Crimea at the recommendation of Sergey Stankevich, a friend of Yuriy Meshkov. However, local observers believe that Yuriy Meshkov chose Stankevich for his friend only because he needed to create his own democratic image. Meshkov also chose Saburov because the latter was born in Yalta. When Saburov began working as prime minister, he felt a strong opposition on the side of Meshkov's entourage; especially, on the side of Valeriy Grishenkov who enviously and watchfully protected the Crimean president from a "harmful" influence from the vice prime minister. In addition, Yevgeniy Saburov has repeatedly declared his loyalty to Kiev and stated that despite his nationality, he is against the reconsideration of border issues. Given any opportunity, this Moscow expert demonstrated his willingness to promote reforms. On the eve of the elections, according to his reformer's inclinations, Yevgeniy Saburov abolished state subsidies on bread and drafted a resolution, to be signed by the Crimean president, to introduce a single legal tender -- the karbovanets -- on the territory of the Crimea. This, however, does not match the president's election promises regarding the immediate introduction of rubles into circulation on the peninsula. Rivalry and secret conflicts between the Saburov team and the president's entourage, headed by Viktor Grishenkov, a former KGB officer, ended by breaking up the office and the dismissal of almost all of its officers. Saburov's victory was absolute: Moscow resident Viktor Minin was nominated to the post of minister for state service -- responsible for the government's and president's offices -- who, when meeting with journalists, declared that his primary task is to be a mediator between Meshkov and Saburov and smooth their conflicts. The fact that Meshkov abolished the resolution, which had already been signed by Saburov -- regarding the increase in prices for bread and cereal products -- signals that these contradictions are rather serious. Saburov has harshly reacted to this presidential move: "Despite whatever political motives populism is triggered by, it will bring no good." Meanwhile, Yuriy Meshkov tolerates Yevgeniy Saburov because he needs him. However, the Crimean leader feels more comfortable when he meets and discusses various issues with Oleg Rumyantsev, former Russian people's deputy and head of the constitutional commission of the Russian Federation, who promised to draft a concept on the state and legal building in the Crimea. Commenting on these Meshkov contacts, Yevgeniy Saburov said enviously to journalists that Oleg Rumyantsev does not represent anything as a politician and nobody takes him seriously in Moscow. Local observers have concluded that Russian advisers to the Crimean president decided to move their Moscow conflicts -- between liberals (Saburov) and national-patriots (Rumyantsev) -- to the Crimea. However, despite the disparity in positions of Saburov and Meshkov, despite the loyalty of the Crimean vice prime minister to official Kiev, which was publicly declared by him, we should not make him such a devoted Ukrainophile. Simply put, he is much smarter than Meshkov, Rumyantsev, and Grishenkov taken together. Currently, the Crimea is in the epicenter of battles which are being conducted by Russian clans to gain influence over the peninsula and the key goal of Saburov is to provide for the economic expansion and political administration of his clan (Luzhkov -- Shokhin -- Stankevich). This goal demands, first of all, that political stability be introduced in this autonomous republic. The fact that Meshkov does not understand this causes the differences between him and his deputy prime minister. Rumors regarding the rapid end of these contradictions are being spread in Simferopol. It seems to me that the half-Moscow team of Yevgeniy Saburov is living through their last days. First of all, this is due to the fact that anti-Saburov sentiments prevail among the members of the ruling "Russia" faction. So, who will change Saburov? Will this be Rumyantsev or Baburin? Or Zhirinovskiy? At any rate, we have many such persons here with us.
