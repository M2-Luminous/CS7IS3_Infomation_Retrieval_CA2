Parliamentary strategists from the coalition and opposition camps reached the accord in a meeting. The 16 bills are mostly budget-related ones. The provisional budget, which is expected to total around 11 trillion yen, covers government spending in the initial 50 days of fiscal 1994 starting April 1. However, the LDP refused to comply with a coalition request to launch deliberations on the 73.08 trillion yen full budget for fiscal 1994 by the House of Representatives Budget Committee, the officials said. The prospect for the opening of the key parliamentary committee session has remained uncertain, they said. During the day's meeting of parliamentary strategists, the coalition asked the LDP to accept their proposal to allow the cabinet to explain the new state budget before the committee, they said. Sadatoshi Ozato, chairman of the LDP Diet Affairs Committee rejected the request, renewing an LDP demand that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa provide more information about his 100 million yen loan from the scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin trucking group. Meanwhile, Hosokawa again turned down the opposition demand to submit documents that would corroborate his claims that he repaid the 100 million yen loan from Sagawa Kyubin Co. Hosokawa told reporters at his official residence, "there is nothing I can do" to comply with the LDP's demand to see the financial documents on the Sagawa loan to help revive parliamentary discussion on the fiscal 1994 budget bill. Neither would Hosokawa bend on his earlier refusal to arrange for his former financial secretary, Masatoshi Miyama, to appear before the Diet committee to testify concerning LDP allegations that Hosokawa accepted the money as an unreported political donation. Sagawa Kyubin was at the center of a 1992-1993 money-and-mob scandal which involved now retired LDP power broker Shin Kanemaru and former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.
