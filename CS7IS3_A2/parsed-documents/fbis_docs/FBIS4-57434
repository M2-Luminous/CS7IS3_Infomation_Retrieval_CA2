Menem signed the executive order early this morning at Jorge Newbery Metropolitan airport before departing for the fourth Ibero-American Information Science and Law Congress in San Carlos de Bariloche. Federal trustee Juan Schiaretti's tenure in Santiago del Estero was due to end yesterday under the original measure approved by Congress last December following several days of violent protest in the provincial capital. The President sent a bill to Congress last week but the body was unable to make quorum and thus Menem decided to resort to a decree. Earlier yesterday, Santiago del Estero National Deputy Jose Luis Zavalia warned that the use of a decree could endanger the Radical-Justicialist Olivos Pact on constitutional reform because "federal takeovers must be ordered exclusively by Congress." The deputy accused Menem of extending federal control in order to take over the province's social security system and privatize public agencies "without adequate legislative control."
