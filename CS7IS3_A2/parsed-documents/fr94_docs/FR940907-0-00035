FR940907-0-00035 FR940907-0-00015 The State has added the requirement that any person who is responsible for the operation of a vessel that meets 1 of the criteria for exemption shall maintain records of the following: (i) The capacity of the stationary vessel. (ii) The contents of the stationary vessel. (iii) The type of the stationary vessel. and may also include: (i) The type of primary seal. (ii) The true vapor pressure of the petroleum liquid. J. Rule 624␣(Emission of Volatile Organic Compounds From an Existing Graphic Arts Line) The State has rewritten much of the Graphic Arts Rule. The new rule sets forth the emission limits, recordkeeping requirements, compliance demonstration requirements and exemptions for the affected sources. These rules, for the most part, are written to have a statewide effect. K. Rule 625␣(Emission of Volatile Organic Compounds From Existing Equipment Utilized in Manufacturing Synthesized Pharmaceutical Products) The State has added a provision which describes the method for comparing actual emission levels from alternative control technology to allowable emission levels. The method for determining the actual emission level is found in R 336.2004 and the allowable emission level shall be determined using methods found in Appendix B of ``Control of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions From Manufacture of Pharmaceutical Products,'' EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;78&hyph;029. The State has added language stating that a person shall not be required to reduce the temperature of a gas stream flowing through a condenser below the freezing point of a condensible component in the gas stream if it can be shown using intrinsic chemical data that the condenser would be rendered ineffective. The State has added a provision which describes the method for comparing actual emission levels from alternative control technology to allowable emission levels resulting from the use of a pressure/vacuum conservation vent. The method for determining the actual emission level is found in R 336.2004 and the allowable emission level shall be determined using methods found in Appendix B of ``Control of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions From Manufacture of Pharmaceutical Products,'' EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;78&hyph;029. The State has removed the provision requiring interim reduction milestones since the dates of these milestones had all passed several years before this package was submitted. The State has added daily recordkeeping requirements which must be complied with within 3 months of the State's effective date of this rule. The records required shall include: (i) For reactors, distillation operations, crystallizers, centrifuges, and vacuum dryers which are controlled by a condenser or an alternative control technology: (a) A list of all VOCs in the stream. (b) The vapor pressure, as measured at 20 degrees Celsius, of each VOC. (c) The mole fraction of each VOC in the liquid mixture. (d) The gas outlet temperature of each condenser. (ii) For operations that are in compliance with the exemption provisions listed in this rule, the amount of material entering and exiting each reactor, distillation operation, crystallizer, centrifuge, and vacuum dryer. (iii) For air dryers, the amount of material entering and exiting each air dryer. (iv) A person loading a VOC which has a vapor pressure of more than 210 millimeters of mercury, measured at 20 degrees Celsius, from a truck or railcar into an existing stationary vessel of more than a 2,000 gallon capacity using a vapor balance system or alternate control system shall maintain records of the following information: (a) The date and time each vessel is loaded. (b) The type and vapor pressure, as measured at 20 degrees Celsius, of each VOC loaded into each stationary vessel. (v) For centrifuges, rotary vacuum filters, or other filters that have an exposed liquid surface, where the liquid contains a VOC or VOCs and the sum of the partial pressures is 26.2 millimeters of mercury or more, as measured at 20 degrees Celsius, the following records shall be maintained: (a) A list of all VOCs in the liquid. (b) The vapor pressure, as measured at 20 degrees Celsius, of each VOC. (c) The mole fraction of each VOC in the liquid mixture. (vi) For any equipment from which a liquid containing a VOC or VOCs can be observed dripping or running the following records shall be kept: (a) The date and time each leak was detected. (b) The date and time each leak was repaired. L. Rule 627␣(Delivery Vessels; Vapor Collection Systems) The State lists the provisions which must be met by all delivery vessels subject to control by a vapor collection system required by R␣336.1606, R␣336.1607, R␣336.1608, R␣336.1609, R␣336.1703, R␣336.1704, R␣336.1705, or R␣336.1706. The modifications made by the State to this rule are: (1) Listing gauge pressures in inches of water as well as in pounds per square inch, and (2) moving the definition of ``vapor collection system'' from this rule to␣ R 336.1122 (Definitions; V).
