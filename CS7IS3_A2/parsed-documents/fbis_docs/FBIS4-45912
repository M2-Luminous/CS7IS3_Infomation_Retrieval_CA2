At about 18:55, the puppets drove an armored vehicle into the DMZ along the Military Demarcation Line from Sohwa-myon, Inje County, South Korean Kangwon Province, and took a firing posture against the North side. They introduced recoilless guns and large-calibre machine-guns into the DMZ southeast of Kwijon-ri, Jangpung County, in the western sector of the front and installed them in a position on May 1, 3 and 4. They displayed a war frenzy, firing some 70 bullets of large-calibre machine-guns from the same spot on May 5. At about 11:15 May 6, hundreds of puppet Army bandits armed with large-calibre machine-guns and automatic rifles staged a frantic war exercise against the North in broad daylight in the DMZ south of height 1211 in the eastern sector of the front, getting on the nerves of the North. The South Korean puppets brought some ten trucks loaded with hundreds of armed bandits into the DMZ South of Mabang-ri, Chorwon County, Kangwon Province, in the central sector of the front at about 08:46 May 2. The number of the armed bandits brought by the South Korean puppets into the DMZ in the first eight days of May for the reinforcement of the positions and military facilities and for war exercises totals more than 6,400. This arms buildup of the South Korean puppets, timing to coincide with different frantic war exercises against the North with the mobilization of uptodate lethal weapons and fighter planes in collusion with the U.S. imperialists, is a deliberate and premeditated military provocation to drive the situation along the Military Demarcation Line to a dangerous phase. The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets must refrain from rash acts, clearly seeing the grave touch-and- go situation caused by their war provocation moves on the Korean peninsula.
