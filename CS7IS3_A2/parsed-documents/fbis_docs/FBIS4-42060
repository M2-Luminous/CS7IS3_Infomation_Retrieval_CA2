The expulsion order is the latest in a series of rows between the two countries. Iran's charge d'affaires Gholamreza Ansari was told of the decision on Thursday [26 May] when he was summoned to see Foreign Office Minister of State Douglas Hogg, according to THE GUARDIAN newspaper. The Foreign Office refused to comment on the expulsion, but officials confirmed the meeting took place. The expulsion follows a row over British charges that the Iranian intelligence services had been in contact with the IRA. Tehran denied the charge and claimed that Britain had bugged its London embassy. Relations between Britain and Iran have been strained since the Islamic revolution in 1979. Ties between the two countries were severed in 1989 over the Salman Rushdie affair, when Iranian religious leaders issued a fatwa [Islamic legal ruling] calling for the killing of the author. But links were restored the following year.
