Integration Problem for Super Jumbo Engines"; first paragraph is an introduction] [Text] The fan's diameter can be increased in order to lower the fuel consumption of today's turbofan engines. However, it will be ever more difficult to integrate the larger engines into the aircraft. Now this problem has been studied in the wind tunnel. Today's passenger airplanes are propelled by turbofan engines. Unlike jet engines that work with just one region--the combustion region, in such a two-region engine an additional turbine drives a fan. This has exclusively the task of accelerating ambient air to the rear and thus of providing additional thrust. Therefore, the bypass ratio (BPR) is an important characteristic for rating these engines. It gives the ratio of the air mass flow rate in the outside fan region to the air mass flow rate of the inside hot region. The engines used today work for the most part with a bypass ratio of between four and six. The principle of conservation of momentum of physics is used in order to calculate an engine's thrust. As applied to a turbofan, it means: The thrust is equal to the moving air mass flow rate times the change in velocity between the inlet and outlet planes of the engine. From this one can construe that increasing the air mass flow rate makes it possible to reduce the velocity difference with the same thrust. This has the direct result that the requisite fuel consumption and accordingly the emission of pollutants too are reduced substantially. A reduction in consumption of 10 to 15 percent is achievable in practice. Thus, in increasing the air mass flow rate in turbofan engines there is considerable potential for building more environmentally compatible engines. If this principle is embodied, one arrives at so-called very-high or, as the case may be, ultrahigh bypass (UHB) engines. But a higher bypass ratio also means that the engine's outside diameter increases as compared with that of today's turbofans. This is their disadvantage. Because of the larger dimensions, the problem of the interaction of the airframe and engine becomes still more important, because the aerodynamic interference brought about grows strongly in significance. On that account, in order for the possible consumption advantages not to be reduced because of the increasing drag of the overall configuration of the airplane, it is necessary to provide, at the preliminary stage of the development of new aircraft--super jumbos, for example--the theoretical and experimental tools for dealing with the integration problem. The "Ducted Propfan Investigation" (DUPRIN) assignment has been taken up as part of the European Community's BRITE/EURAM subsidy program, in view of the importance of this problem. Under the lead management of Deutsche Aerospace Airbus, 14 European partners from industry, research and higher education are working on supporting, through research on the integration problem, the development of engines having a higher bypass ratio. The DUPRIN team has managed a first step via wind tunnel measurements in the German-Dutch Wind Tunnel (DNW). Important results for the UHB-engine integration problem have been able to be obtained by the first successful employment of UHB simulators with a contrarotating fan. Measurements in the same wind tunnel model with conventional turbofan simulators had already preceded these studies. The wind tunnel model and simulators were made true to scale. According to Heinz Hoheisel of DLR [German Research Institute for Aerospace] in Braunschweig, the development of the UHB simulators was a particular problem. A compressed-air-driven four-stage turbine having an output of 162 kW drives via a reversing gear an eight-blade contrarotating fan having a diameter of 254 millimeters. The prototype of the new engine simulator, designated CRUF, is based on the MTU-CRISP [Motoren- und Turbinen-Union GmbH [Engine and Turbine Union Limited Liability Company] Counter Rotating Integrated Shrouded Propfan] design and was developed by DLR in Braunschweig together with Dynamic Engineering, Inc. of Virginia, USA. A second simulator was developed and built by the Technofan company in Toulouse, France, on the same basis within the framework of the DUPRIN assignment. Encouraging Test Results In contrast to conventional turbofan engines, whose optimal position on a passenger aircraft's wing is known, an expectedly favorable position has to be found first for the new engine design. The capabilities of computer simulation, for one thing, are helpful for this. The flow pattern around the wing and engine can be assessed by means of its evidence. The drag behavior is of quite special importance in the integration problem for new engines having an increased bypass ratio, because the installation drag must not be greater than for conventional turbofans. The first measurements for the complete model were made for this purpose in the German-Dutch Wind Tunnel. The important aerodynamic forces--lift and drag--were determined by means of a new weighing machine incorporated into the wind tunnel model. In addition, pressure measurements were made at a total of about 800 pressure points on the surfaces of the fuselage, wing and engine cowling, in order to be able to assess more precisely the flow behavior. This measuring equipment had to be accommodated in the wind tunnel model, in addition to the air, oil and coolant supplies for the engine simulators. The test results gotten in the measurement rounds have encouraged the researchers. Additional assignments, designated in the DUPRIN program, on the integration problem for UHB engines are to begin now in the near future.
