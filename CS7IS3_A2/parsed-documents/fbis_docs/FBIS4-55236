With Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, he discussed the results of the agreement signed in Vienna today. Senada Cumurovic has the report. [Cumurovic] Charles Redman, who briefed President Izetbegovic on the course of the talks, which ended in Vienna today, and on the results [words indistinct], made the following statement: [Begin Redman recording] I believe that the progress made during the talks in Vienna with regard to the federation is a major positive step. I think that the form on which the agreement is founded is a solid basis for good relations between Bosnian Croats and Bosniaks. However, the federation is only one part of the agreement. Bosnian Serbs are the other part. I have to say that I will have a very important meeting on Friday in Geneva where the most important representatives of the UN Security Council member countries and the EU will be present. The meeting is important from the point of view of future progress. The work of the contact group over the past few weeks is the basis of our talks. President Izetbegovic and I agreed that the most important part is the protection of Bosnia-Herzegovina's territorial integrity and the preservation of a way toward coexistence between Bosnian Serbs and the federation in some form of relationship. [end recording] [Announcer] In his statement for the press, President Izetbegovic assessed the agreement reached in Vienna today as significant, partly because of its influence on the course of the talks scheduled for 13 May in Geneva. [Begin Izetbegovic recording] This is a very important thing and it will strengthen our future negotiating position. Of course, we are awaiting with keen interest [words indistinct]. It is a big chance for peace and we will do everything in our power not to spoil this chance. We will, of course, try to ensure that this is not done at the expense of our people. With the maximum of good will we will examine the proposals. It is with great curiosity that we are expecting the proposals of the international community. We hope it will not be a reward for aggression and for ethnic cleansing. We are expecting just peace proposals. [words indistinct] It is now up to the international community to voice its opinion [words indistinct] and that it is far better for us to wait and see what proposals will be put before us. It is a well- known fact that the withdrawal of Serb troops from the occupied territory is one of our conditions, the other and most important one being the preservation of the territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We will see to what extent the international community will be prepared to [word indistinct] our demands. [Announcer] Although at this stage the Bosnia-Herzegovina delegation is not party to the talks, as President Izetbegovic said, Silajdzic, Ganic, and Bicackic will nonetheless be present in Geneva. Let us say in the end that the journalists were most keen to find out about how cadre issues in the federation will be resolved. Neither President Izetbegovic nor Charles Redman could say anything specific about this, i.e., they did not speak about any concrete problems regarding the federation.
