Autonomous regional leaders Abulaiti Amudurexiti, Wang Lequan, and Keyum Bawundun attended the conference. In carrying out planning and pricing work in 1993, Xinjiang unremittingly carried out the central task of economic construction and endeavored to solve salient problems that had surfaced during the course of economic operations, in accordance with the arrangements made by the autonomous regional party committee's work conference. This helped promote economic development. The gross regional product in 1993 is expected to total 37.7 billion yuan, an increase of approximately 10 percent over the preceding year. In carrying out planning and pricing work in 1994, Xinjiang should strengthen the status of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy, and stabilize the household contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to output, as well as the dual management system that combines household with collective operations. It should make efforts to restructure the rural economy and crop farming, and steadfastly engage in the construction of infrastructure, basic industries, and industries producing major raw and semifinished materials, in order to ease "bottlenecks" and create fine conditions for developing the economy and opening up to the outside world. In 1994, we should place greater emphasis on assessing and making flexible use of our reserves and assets, and intensify technological transformation, while maintaining moderate growth in capital construction investment. To meet the demands of exploration and development at the three major oil fields in Xinjiang, we should closely integrate technical transformation with capital construction, develop a number of related industries that serve the needs of oil fields, and promote oil field development. We should ensure that oil fields and the local economy spur each other on for the sake of common development. While continuing to accelerate economic development in the comprehensive economic development belt north of Tian Shan, we should also place great emphasis on economic development in southern Xinjiang. We should increase capital construction investment, expedite poverty relief work, and gradually narrow the gap between southern and northern Xinjiang.
