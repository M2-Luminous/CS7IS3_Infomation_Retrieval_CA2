FR940418-2-00047 FR940418-2-00021 [FERC Docket Nos. CP93&hyph;258&hyph;000, et al. CA State Clearinghouse No. 94032040] Mojave Pipeline Co.; Preparation/Intent to Prepare a Joint Draft Environmental Impact Report/Statement for the Proposed Mojave Northward Expansion Project and Request for Comments on Environmental Issues April 12, 1994. The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission) will prepare a joint environmental impact report/statement (EIR/EIS) with the California State Lands Commission (SLC) that will discuss the environmental impacts of the construction and operation of facilities proposed in Mojave Pipeline Company's Northward Expansion Project. 1 The FERC will use this EIR/EIS in its decision-making process (whether or not to certificate the proposed project). 1 Mojave Pipeline Company's application was filed with the Commission pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act and part 157 of the Commission's regulations. The SLC will be the lead State agency for California and the FERC will be the lead Federal agency in the preparation of this joint EIR/EIS. The joint document, which will avoid much duplication of environmental analyses, will satisfy the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) will be cooperating with the FERC in the preparation of the EIR/EIS because of the significant amount of BLM-managed land that the proposal would affect. The other Federal agencies we are asking to cooperate (see appendix 1) may choose to participate once they have evaluated Mojave's proposal relative to their respective responsibilities. 2 2 The appendices referenced in this notice are not being printed in the Federal Register . Copies are available from the Commission's Public Reference Branch, room 3104, 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426 or call (202) 208&hyph;1371. Copies of the appendices were sent to all those receiving this notice in the mail. Summary of the Proposed Facilities Mojave Pipeline Company (Mojave) has an existing natural gas transmission system which begins near Topock, Arizona and terminates near Bakersfield, California. Mojave requests FERC authorization to construct and operate certain pipeline and compression facilities that will extend its system into Central and Northern California (Northward Expansion Project). These additional facilities would enable Mojave to transport 475 million cubic feet per day of natural gas to customers in the San Joaquin Valley and Northern California (San Francisco Bay Area and Sacramento). Mojave's application proposes two facility schemes. One plan includes the facilities Mojave would construct in the event the Kern River Gas Transmission Company (Kern River) also expands its existing system. The second plan includes the facilities Mojave would construct without any expansion by Kern River. This EIR/EIS will analyze the most construction-intensive combination of Mojave facilities. 3 3 Kern River's expansion application, filed with the FERC in November 1991 (Docket No. CP92&hyph;198&hyph;000), is pending before the Commission. A separate environmental review of Kern River's proposed facilities was conducted by the Commission staff in the Kern River Expansion Project Environmental Assessment , issued April 1993. The proposed Northward Expansion Project consists of the following facilities: •557 miles of new pipeline with diameters ranging from 4 inches to 30 inches; •100 miles of 30-inch-diameter looping pipeline; 4 4 A loop is a segment of pipeline installed adjacent to an existing pipeline and connected to it at both ends. •Three new compressor stations in California with a total of 73,058 horsepower (hp) of compression, and 24,470 hp of additional compression at Mojave's existing compressor station in Topock, Arizona; and •Construction of 55 new meter stations and the modification of 1 existing meter station. The general locations of the facilities proposed by Mojave are shown in appendix 2. A detailed listing of the facilities is in appendix 3.
