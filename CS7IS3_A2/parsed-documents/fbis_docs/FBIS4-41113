Six candidates have been registered for this post including the republic's Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich. Here is our correspondent's conversation with him. [Yegorova] Vyachaslaw Frantsavich, when the people come to the polling places 23 June and vote for a president, they should make a serious choice: Which path should sovereign Belorussia [Belarus] take -- should it accompany Russia or go it alone, that is orient itself toward the West.... [Kebich] The union with Russia is my life, my policy. Chernomyrdin and I succeeded in agreeing on Belorussia's joining a single ruble zone with Russia and on close economic cooperation between our countries. The treaty was met with applause in the Russian State Duma. Indeed, it would be strange if Slavs were unable to come to an agreement among themselves. There is no problem with the Russian-speaking population in Belorussia. What is more, it would not enter anybody's head in Russia to oppress the Belorussians. Almost 70 percent of our people came out in favor of a military and political and economic union with Russia in a public opinion poll. But the way out of the crisis definitely lies first and foremost in the economic integration of our two countries. We cannot rely on Baltic-Black Sea utopias and assistance from the West. This is why our economic and intellectual potential is oriented on Russia. Can the Belorussian economy survive even for a single day without oil and gas? No. Through our treaty with Russia, we save 30 ECU's on each ton of petroleum and thousands of cubic meters of gas cost us much less than at world prices.... Having seen these future prospects, business circles have supported me. Incidentally, one of the structures which proposed me as a presidential candidate was a scientific-industrial association. [Yegorova] But, on the other hand, it was actually the directors of major Belorussian enterprises who just recently came out strongly against your policy.... [Kebich] That's right. But the shock has passed. The leaders, together with the government, have started to search for a way out of the situation. Many enterprises have been restructuring themselves as they go along. It is precisely here that Belorussia's professional potential has showed through. Labor collectives, which were successfully preserved by hook or by crook, even when the enterprises were at a standstill, have gotten a second wind. On the subject of our treaty with Russia, as yet only its first 10 points are "working." But results have already been achieved. In particular the abolition of customs duties gave us the opportunity to lower by 15-20 percent the prices of the CIS's best refrigerators and televisions which are from Belorussia. We immediately entered the market. [Yegorova] You quite often hear that the bilateral treaty with Russia profits Belorussia alone. [Kebich] This is, of course, untrue. For our part, we do not take any payment, even in "hares" [Belarusian monetary coupons], from the Russians for the lease of land, the transit of oil, gas, and cargoes, and the upkeep of military units.... [Yegorova] What is to be done about the second part of the treaty with Russia, concerning the union of the monetary systems themselves, which, as we know, goes against the Republic's Constitution? [Kebich] The Supreme Soviet should decide whether or not there is to be a ruble zone. The government has carried out its work. Well, if the deputies fail to support this idea, the people can be asked. For example, a referendum can be held. [Yegorova] Do you believe in a referendum? [Kebich] I believe in the people. I rely on our people's character, their industriousness, patience, and kindness. Also, I will not, of course, permit the rural areas, the kolkhozes to become ruined. If I become president, I will support those who feed us. You tell me what private farmer will think about the elderly peasant woman who has damaged her hands working on the farm, in the fields, and has now grown old. I myself am from a rural area, my mother is now approaching 90 years of age, and she simply cannot leave her land and cottage. [Yegorova] Can we expect another historical meeting -- between Kebich, Chernomyrdin, and Kuchma? [Kebich] Yes, and it will happen very soon. [Yegorova] But when? [Kebich] After the presidential elections....
