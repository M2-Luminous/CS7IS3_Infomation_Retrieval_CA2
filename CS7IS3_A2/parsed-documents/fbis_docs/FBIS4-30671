He said that the central bank does not know anything about this. But in principle, the central bank supports promulgating such a law. The details of this will have to be discussed to determine how this law can be promulgated. "I don't think that the Thai government has much experience in such matters. We will try to gain experience by attending international conferences on money laundering. There is general agreement on this," said Mr. Wichit.
