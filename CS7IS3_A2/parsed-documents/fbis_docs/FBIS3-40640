Bhattacharya] [Text] Those who criticize the central government for agreeing to the Dunkel proposals at the Uruguay round of negotiations should now be reassured by the announcement made by the agriculture minister, Dr. Balram Jakhar. He has said that the government would introduce specific legislation to safeguard the interests of domestic farmers. He also said at the Fifth World Sugar Farmers Conference in New Delhi yesterday that India would not allow patenting of seeds. This means that India would evolve its own system of preserving plant varieties. The fact however is that the Dunkel draft has not prescribed any patenting regime for seeds. It is only a figment of imagination of some people that the Dunkel draft will impose restrictions on the use of seeds by Indian farmers. It is being argued by some leaders belonging to the opposition political parties that farmers now have to purchase fresh seeds every time they want to sow them. In other words, they cannot use seeds generated from existing crops. These leaders have aroused the passions of Indian farmers so strongly that recently a rally of agitating farmers ransacked the office of a U.S. multinational seeds company. The agriculture minister has now put an end to such a debate. By ruling out patenting of seeds he has dispelled the root cause of the farmers' apprehension. And since India would now have to evolve its own system of preserving plant varieties, there should be no question of ignoring the interests of Indian farmers. While evolving the new system, Indian farmers and other representative bodies should be consulted. This will be necessary to ensure that all apprehensions of the farmers and the opposition leaders on the issue are addressed adequately. This brings one to the time of applicability of the Dunkel draft. First, it will take at least one more year for the draft to be ratified by parliaments of all member countries of GATT before it becomes operational. Secondly, it is left entirely to national governments like India to take its own time in formulating the new system of protecting plant varieties. This will have to be in broad conformity with the international protocol on this issue. But the key issue which cannot be lost sight of is that the nitty-gritty of such a system will be finalized at home and not on foreign soil as has been alleged by some critics of the Dunkel draft. More importantly, the Indian Government and Indian farmers will have a lot of time at their disposal to discuss and debate the new legislation to protect them as well as the new plant varieties.
