FR940712-2-00046 FR940712-2-00037 Accordingly, and in order to provide additional flexibility to section 20 subsidiaries in the conduct of authorized activities, the Board now believes it is desirable to consider adoption of another optional measure in addition to revenue for applying 10 percent limit on ineligible securities activities. The Board believes that either asset values or sales volume, or a combination of both measures, should be considered as a new alternative measure. B. Asset-Based Test as an Alternative Measure Any asset-based test would limit a section 20 subsidiary's average daily assets held in connection with underwriting and dealing in ineligible securities to 10 percent of its total average daily assets, computed on a rolling 8-quarter basis. Because, as the Board observed when an asset-based test was previously proposed, a measure relying on asset values would be less sensitive to unanticipated changes in interest rate conditions than a test based on revenues, such a test would address these distortions. Also, it appears that for at least some section 20 subsidiaries a test relying on asset values may be easier in practice to apply than the indexed revenue test. Moreover, as explained below, in light of its greater experience with the operations of the section 20 subsidiaries, the Board is now of the view that the concerns previously expressed about the operation of an asset-based test can be appropriately mitigated. The Board believes that the use of assets acquired in connection with particular types of securities activities may represent a permissible measure of compliance with the statutory limitation in section 20 on ineligible securities activities. Asset values do provide a rough approximation of risk to the section 20 subsidiary, and risk to banking organizations was one of the concerns behind passage of the Glass-Steagall Act. The Board notes that the New York State Banking Department, in applying a state law restriction on the level of ineligible securities activities of affiliates of state-chartered banks, allows the use of either assets or revenue as a measure of compliance with the law. 8 8 E.g., letter, dated December 23, 1986, from New York Superintendent of Banks to Morgan Guaranty Trust Company and Bankers Trust Company. Underwriting The Board believes that, if an asset-based test is adopted as an alternative measure, the value of any securities underwritten by a subsidiary would have to be accounted for in computing average daily assets, even where the securities are disposed of prior to the end of the day. The literal language of section 20 covers any underwriting activity. Thus, under the proposed asset-based test, if securities underwritten by a section 20 subsidiary are recorded as assets of the subsidiary, but are disposed of before the end of the day on which underwriting activity takes place, then the securities would be treated as if they were carried as assets on the books of the subsidiary as of the end of that day. If securities are underwritten by the section 20 subsidiary on a ``best efforts'' or agency basis the securities would be treated as assets of the subsidiary for each day that underwriting activity occurs with respect to that particular security. 9 9 Under an asset-based alternative measure, similar treatment would be accorded an entire issue of privately-placed securities when any portion of the issue is taken into inventory pursuant to SEC Rule 144A. Anti-Manipulation Limits Should an asset-based test be adopted as an alternative measure, the Board does not propose that any specific limits be incorporated to address the potential for manipulative transactions carried out solely to inflate artificially a section 20 subsidiary's base of eligible assets. Many of the comments on the previously proposed asset-based test stated that there are sufficient financial and market constraints on the holding of excessive eligible securities solely to support increased ineligible securities activities. Even in the case of matched book-type transactions, counterparties typically impose limits on the amount of transactions they will engage in with any particular section 20 subsidiary, in order to control credit risk. The Board's minimum consolidated leverage ratio and the SEC's net capital rule, which is applicable to a section 20 subsidiary, would impose additional constraints. In addition, the acquisition of significant amounts of eligible securities by a section 20 subsidiary in matched book or similar transactions would also tend to have an overall negative impact on the earnings performance of the consolidated bank holding company organization, given the small profit margins typical in such transactions. Finally, the Board believes that it has the authority to take appropriate corrective action where manipulative transactions are detected. C. Sales Volume Test as Alternative Measure The Board is also requesting comment on adoption of sales volume as an alternative measure. If sales volume data is used as the measure of an alternative test for applying the 10 percent limit, then the dollar volume of a section 20 subsidiary's sales of ineligible securities as a result of underwriting and dealing in such securities could not be allowed to exceed 10 percent of its total sales volume over a rolling 8-quarter period. The Board believes that the value of various types of securities and other assets sold by a section 20 subsidiary bears a relationship to the subsidiary's level of activity with respect to each type of security or other asset. Use of such data is thus consistent with the statutory requirements. Under a sales volume test, intra-day transactions like underwriting and dealing sales would be automatically covered, even if the assets involved were not recorded on the subsidiary's books at the end of the day. In addition, like an asset-based test, a sales volume test would be less sensitive to changes in interest rate relationships. Such a test may also be easier to comply with than the current alternative of indexed revenues.
