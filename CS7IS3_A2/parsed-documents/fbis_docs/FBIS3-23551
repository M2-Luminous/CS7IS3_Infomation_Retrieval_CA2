Documentary evidence proving this fact is in the hands of the Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS], which was the first to pay attention to the strange behavior -- to put it mildly -- by officials in the Russian Armed Forces. The ill-starred mercenaries, who have already left the army of sovereign Azerbaijan, are today unanimously talking about an entirely legal recruitment campaign for contract servicemen which was launched by the oblast military commissariats at the end of last year. Judging by the advertisements that were posted, the call was to service in CIS "hotspots." The terms were tempting: 500,000 rubles [R] per month, one-half of this sum in dollars. It did not occur to any of the dozens of people who fell for these promises that the recruitment was not to the Russian Army but to the armed forces of another state. The volunteers did not immediately realize what they were joining, even after a visit to the military commissariat. Some read the terms for themselves, while others were kept in the dark until the last moment. One thing unites them all -- when flying out to Baku every one of them knew where they were going and what for. A. and N. from Kaluga (the editorial office has their full details) were immediately given to understand what was going on by staffers of Kaluga's Leninskiy Rayon Military Commissariat, who said: "Go to Azerbaijan as mercenaries. You will be able to get a large sum of money. War is of course a risk, but you can make a profit from it...." When the volunteers were brought to the assembly point, there were around 60 men already there from various rayons in the oblast. Addressing them, A. and N. recall, the oblast military commissar did not speak about Azerbaijan, but only said that where the detachment was going "people only died through stupidity." He did not give a direct answer to the question: "Are we going to Azerbaijan?", reporting that representatives of the recipient military unit would arrive in the next few days, and they would explain everything. B. from Kaluga came to the Oktyabrskiy Rayon Military Commissariat following an appeal on local television by a staffer of the Oblast Military Commissariat, who announced the recruitment of reservists for service in CIS "hotspots." Convinced that this concerned the Russian Army, B. arrived in the city of Yefremov, where the Kaluga volunteers were united with the Tambov volunteers. There, for the first time, he saw the "representative of the recipient military unit," elderly Azerbaijani Guseynov, wearing badges of military rank unknown to B. on his military tunic under his civilian coat. In mid-December, the combined detachment went via Moscow to Ivanovo airport, where they united with the contract servicemen from Ivanovo and Vladimir. On 20 December, 92 mercenaries flew out to Baku by an Azerbaijani civil aviation Tu-154. According to Ch. from Kaluga, the recruitment of volunteers was done with the most active participation of officials of the oblast military commissariat, who closely cooperated with representatives of the Azerbaijani Army. However, as a rule, neither the Russian military nor their foreign colleagues enlarged on the ultimate aim of the impending visit. They even kept silent when all the volunteers knew the truth. The Azerbaijanis, the mercenaries recall, freely made use of the military commissariat reservists' discount cards, bought them food in cafes using cash, and apparently did not suffer from any shortage of funds. [passage omitted] All the former mercenaries questioned by the FCS are convinced that the oblast military commissars and their subordinates who were working directly with the contract servicemen could not have failed to realize that they were assisting in the recruitment of Russian citizens to a foreign army. That they participated in deceiving volunteers who did not initially suspect where they were going to serve. The aforementioned A. stated that staffers of local military commissariats had "set up" the volunteers, that all the Azerbaijanis' conversations with the mercenaries were conducted in the presence of Russian military, and the latter responded immediately to the requests of "the representatives of the military unit"....[passage omitted] Although not a single legislative act mentions the concept of "mercenary" at the moment, according to many of my interlocutors from the FCS, the actions of the military commissariats fully come under Article 171 of the Russian Federation Penal Code, which covers cases when officials exceed their power and authority to the detriment of Russia's interests. No matter which side we look from, the damage is clear: The country may be accused of supporting the idea of mercenaries, while the Russian Army failed to recruit all the contract servicemen which it might have recruited. Meanwhile, the Russian Federation Armed Forces command is apparently not noticing the December "recruitment," just like it did not notice such cases in the past. As [counterintelligence officer] Vladimir Makarov claims, the "signals" about the flourishing mercenary business had already reached the military department, the former Supreme Soviet, and the Prosecutor's Office. On 23 February, the FCS leadership (let us note that the department managed to "unravel" this story in a situation extremely unfavorable to itself, straight after the president's December edict on abolishing the Russian Ministry of Security) officially sent a letter to Colonel General M. Kolesnikov, chief of the Russian Federation Armed Forces General Staff, setting forth all the circumstances of the case. The IZVESTIYA editorial office is also waiting for the reply. When called by IZVESTIYA, Mikhail Petrovich Kolesnikov, with whom we are well acquainted because of the January 1990 events in Baku, answered that he does not know anything about the involvement of Russian military commissariats in the recruitment of mercenaries for the Azerbaijani Army. He considers claims about such cases as someone's conjectures, and the conversation essentially premature. "When we obtain documents from the FCS, we will conduct our own investigation, and then we will return to this subject...."
