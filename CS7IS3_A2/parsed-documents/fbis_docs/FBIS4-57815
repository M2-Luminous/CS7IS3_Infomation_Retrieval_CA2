FRAPH commands all its supporters to closely cooperate with the Haitian Armed Forces during this period of hostility created by the threat of intervention: We are saying: Grenadiers to the assault. It is not important who dies. FRAPH says it hopes President Clinton and the United Nations realize that the crisis is political, not military. [end recording] [Announcer] Furthermore, FRAPH denounces the new demands the United Nations is making of the military. The organization led by Emmannuel Constant states that the Governors Island agreement does not provide, at any point, for the departure of the police chief in Port-au-Prince nor of members of the Army General Staff, but in its most recent stand, the United Nations Security Council mentions the resignation of members of the General Staff. Moreover, Constant demands the withdrawal of the military from the negotiation file. The country now has a president in Justice Jonassaint, maintains Emmannuel Constant. FRAPH favors the professionalization of the Army and the separation of the police and the Army. FRAPH calls on the government of Justice Jonassaint to make reforms in public administration and to prosecute President Aristide and resigning Prime Minister Robert Malval. [Begin Constant recording] FRAPH asks the executive to give the necessary orders for the examining office to issues summonses for the following citizens: Aristide, deposed president of the Republic of Haiti; Prime Minister Malval; Ambassador Jean Casimir; Attorney Michael Barnes, for embezzlement -- see Mr. Malval's letter of 14 December 1994. FRAPH solicits help for the Haitian state and the Haitian justice system from the Armed Forces and the forces of order in retrieving some of the administrative files that were taken by ministers of the Aristide/Malval government. As agreed, FRAPH hopes that the Ministry of Commerce will succeed in reducing the prices of essential products by 40 percent. Bravo. [applause] [end recording] [Announcer] FRAPH also criticizes the international civilian mission, which it accuses of writing subjective reports. FRAPH asks the observers to stop their investigation on the human rights situation in Haiti. FRAPH claims it is center-right and denounces the extreme right in Haiti, which it calls opportunistic and without political vision.
