[Waniek] It was the crazy idea of Olek [Aleksander] Kwasniewski. He came up with this idea as the ultimate method of winning on a flank that was not easily accessible. I received the first nomination among the candidates for deputy ministers in the "presidential ministries." [Frydrychowicz] Were you happy to move from one ministry to another? [Waniek] This is a much more difficult task than my previous position. I have had an idea for several years of how the Office of the Plenipotentiary for the Affairs of Women, Family, and Young People should be organized. I fought for the implementation of this concept with consecutive governments. The post I am taking over today is something new in a way. There are certainly people in the Ministry of National Defense [MON] who have also dealt with these matters so far; however, my task lies in steering a ministerial structure the position of which will be different from the position to date. [Frydrychowicz] What will be the range of your duties? [Waniek] I will be the ministry's liaison with parliament and the spokesman for civil rights. I will deal with the issues of military courts and prosecutor's offices. The section dealing with interventions will also be subordinated to me. However, I must still thoroughly study the list of duties that has been handed to me along with the nomination. After skimming it, I can say that I will have certain remarks to make. I suppose that I will have to hold some minor talks with Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk. [Frydrychowicz] Is this a matter of broadening or narrowing your powers? [Waniek] It is a matter of making them more specific. I would prefer to do this right at the beginning so that I will not encroach upon anyone's powers and no one will encroach upon mine. [passage omitted] * * * "At the motion of the minister of national defense, on 26 April 1994 I hereby appoint you to the post of under secretary of state in MON." Such a letter, dated 22 April, was signed by Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak late on the evening on 25 April. On the following day, Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk presented it to Democratic Left Alliance Deputy Danuta Waniek. Asked by journalists whether, as a woman, she "feels the military issues," Danuta Waniek replied: "I have had no relations with MON; however, many males are in the same situation." Even though she was appointed deputy minister, Danuta Waniek has no intention of giving up her activities in the parliamentary women's group. At a press conference, the newly appointed deputy minister said that she had qualifications to fulfill the present function. She is a doctor of parliamentary and constitutional law and a graduate of a political science department in Vienna.
