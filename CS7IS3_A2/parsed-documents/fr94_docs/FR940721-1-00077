ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to exempt 164 generic types of class I devices from the requirement of premarket notification, with limitations. For the exempted devices, FDA has determined that manufacturers' submissions of premarket notifications are unnecessary for the protection of the public health and that the agency's review of such submissions will not advance its public health mission. Granting the exemptions will allow the agency to make better use of its resources and thus better serve the public. DATES: Submit written comments by October 19, 1994. FDA is proposing that any final rule that may issue based on this proposed rule become effective 30 days after the date of its publication in the Federal Register. ADDRESSES: Written comments to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Joseph M.

Background The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), as amended by the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (Pub. L. 94&hyph;295, hereinafter called the amendments) and the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 (the SMDA), establishes a comprehensive system for the regulation of medical devices intended for human use. Section 513 of the act (21 U.S.C. 360c) establishes three classes of devices, depending on the regulatory controls needed to provide reasonable assurance of their safety and effectiveness: Class I, general controls; class II, special controls; and class III, premarket approval. Section 513(d)(2)(A) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360c(d)(2)(A)) authorizes FDA to exempt, by regulation, a generic type of class I device from, among other things, the requirement of premarket notification in section 510(k) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360(k)). Such an exemption permits manufacturers to introduce into commercial distribution generic types of devices without first submitting a premarket notification to FDA. When FDA issued proposed regulations classifying preamendments devices, the agency focused on granting exemptions from the requirement of premarket notification principally when the advisory panels included them in their recommendations to the agency. Subsequently, FDA decided to exempt certain additional class I devices from the requirement of premarket notification in order to reduce the number of unnecessary premarket notifications. This action helped to free agency resources for the review of more complex notifications to FDA. Previously, FDA exempted 293 generic types of class I devices from the requirement of premarket notification, with limitations. Some of these devices were exempted from the requirement of premarket notification when the devices were initially classified into class I. However, the majority of these devices were exempted from the requirement of premarket notification after being classified into class I. These subsequent exemptions from the requirement of premarket notification appear in the following Federal Register publications (see Table 1).
