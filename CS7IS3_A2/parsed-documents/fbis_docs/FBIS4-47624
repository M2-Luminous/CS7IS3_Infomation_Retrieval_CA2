FBIS TRENDS-13MAY94-BOSNIA-YUGO B-H--Yugoslavia: Karadzic as a Threat to Milosevic's Power B-H--Yugoslavia: Karadzic as a Threat to Milosevic's Power A recent interview with a Serb regional leader from Herzegovina has revealed the potential for a rift between Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. In the interview published in the independent Montenegrin weekly Monitor on 6 May, Bozidar Vucurevic, mayor of Trebinje and virtual warlord of eastern Herzegovina, acknowledged that he has promoted the idea that Karadzic should become president of "all the Serbs." After demurring that he had intended the suggestion as a "joke," Vucurevic immediately contradicted himself--and alluded to other supporters of the idea--by declaring that, "if it comes to an alliance of all Serbian countries, we shall propose" that Karadzic be its president. While heaping praise on Milosevic, Vucurevic insisted that he only represents a part of a Serbian leadership triumvirate that includes Karadzic and Bosnian Serb Assembly President Momcilo Krajisnik. Of Karadzic, Vucurevic opined that he is a "great politician" whom "God himself sent to the Serbian people." Vucurevic apparently is not alone in his opinion that Karadzic should supplant Milosevic: The results of a poll published in Belgrade last year claimed that Karadzic was the most popular politician in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), even at the time of the supposed "rift" between the two after the Bosnian Serb assembly rejected the Vance-Owen peace plan in May 1993 (Nedeljna Borba, 5-6 June 1993). Milosevic, who is promoted by the dominant Belgrade media that he controls as the preeminent leader of the Serbs of former Yugoslavia, is likely to be infuriated by the suggestion that Karadzic should supplant him as leader of the Serbian cause. While Karadzic often defers to Milosevic as acknowledged leader of the Serbs of former Yugoslavia, at a time when Karadzic is demanding the eventual creation a unitary Greater Serbia (Borba, 4 May), Milosevic is likely to view Vucurevic remarks as a bid by Karadzic for recognition as chief Serb leader and spokesman for the Serbian cause. Although it is unlikely that Milosevic would withdraw his support of Karadzic as he has with others who challenged his authority such as Krajina Serb leader Milan Babic and former Yugoslav President Dobrica Cosic, he may well seek to undermine Karadzic's support among the Serbs to help create the appearance that his own political base remains solid.
