Information gathered from several sources in Belgrade seems to indicate this. In particular, we have been receiving reports of the mobilization of Serbian refugees in the rump Yugoslavia, who are being called up by the Serbian armies in Bosnia and Krajina. Belgrade authorities are denying all involvement in this mobilization, but the High Commission for Refugees in Belgrade believes that the operation would be impossible without the collaboration of the local authorities. Florence Hartmann [LE MONDE correspondent in Belgrade] reports: [Begin Hartmann recording] A form with the heading -- Your Country Calls On You -- is being sent out to Bosnian [Serb] refugees in Serbia and Montenegro calling them back to serve on the front. Suffering from a shortage of manpower, the Bosnian Serbs are recruiting with the help of threats and with Belgrade's backing. Those who do not answer the call-up will lose their refugee status and could even face a prison sentence. Defying international conventions, the civilian and military authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are providing lists of refugees, distributing call-up papers and transferring the troops to the combat zones. The Belgrade authorities are nevertheless officially denying their collaboration in this activity. For now, we are unable to estimate the scope of this mobilization, but several hundred called-up refugees have alerted the UNHCR to the situation. The UN is advising them to stay in hiding. Several refugee shelters in Serbia and Montenegro have been deserted in recent days by all men of fighting age; or rather by all men of any age, since the call-up also includes refugees of 60 as well as men exempted from military duties for medical reasons. Having failed to obtain a [Muslim] signature on the Bosnia peace plan, the Serbs seem decided to inflict total defeat on the Muslim side. Florence Hartmann, Belgrade, RFI. [end recording]
