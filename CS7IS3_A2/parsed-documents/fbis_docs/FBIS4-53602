Their presence at the privately organized May 31-June 3 meeting would be "inimical to the national interest," a presidental palace statement said. The regional conference had sparked a diplomatic row between Manila and Jakarta, with the latter threatening retaliation if it takes place. Ramos cited the planned participation of Jose Ramos-Horta, a special representative of the East Timor resistance. He ordered Justice Secretary Franklin Drilon to "take immediate steps to exclude such persons and other non-Filipino conferees." On Thursday, Indonesia, angry at the East Timor seminar, had threatened to scrap a meeting it had organised between Manila and group of Filipino Moslem rebels. The meeting is due to take place next month.
