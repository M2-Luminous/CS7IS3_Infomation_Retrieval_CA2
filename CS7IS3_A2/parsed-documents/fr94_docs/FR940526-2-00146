Notes: Realty professionals indicate greater demand for rentals as a result of Iniki but believe prices are stable. (This agrees with broker data trends.) Current data are good at middle and upper income levels but are weaker at lower income levels. Therefore, previous year's rate at lower level is adjusted by the average of the rates of change at the middle and upper income levels. 0 d Maui, Hawaii: Lower 33 $650 52 $601 $669 $635 ^2.3 NA $635 Middle 51 847 60 708 885 797 ^5.9 NA 797 Upper 71 1,085 84 1,020 1,179 1,100 1.4 NA 1,100 s 9 Notes: Realty professionals indicate that prices are stable or declining.

Therefore, no adjustments made. 0 d Mayaguez, Puerto Rico: Lower 10 $408 8 $600 $490 490B 20.1 1.6 $415* Middle 22 596 10 588 638 613 2.9 1.6 606* Upper 10 967 25 760 820 790 ^18.3 1.6 982* s 9 B=Broker only because less than 3 non-broker samples. Overall average: 1.6%. *Adjusted by overall average. Notes: Realty professionals indicate that market is stable but tight because of college student population and demand for units. Data trends are divergent, even among broker data. Therefore, rates of change at all three levels are averaged and result (1.6%) used to adjust last year's results by income level. 0 d San Juan, Puerto Rico: Lower 29 $684 36 $708 $747 $728 6.4 NA $728 Middle 34 1,079 50 1,185 950 1,068 ^1.0 NA 1,068 Upper 50 1,996 98 1,831 1,955 1,893 ^5.2 NA 1,893 s 9 Notes: Realty professionals indicate rental market is stable or decreasing.

However, change at middle income level is incongruous with change at other two levels and beyond what realty professionals would expect. Therefore, rates of change at lower and upper income levels are averaged and used to adjust previous year's rate at middle income level. 0 d St. Thomas, Virgin Islands: Lower 32 $735 62 $643 $925 $784 6.7 NA $784 Middle 25 1,069 60 930 1,025 978 ^8.5 NA 978 Upper 22 1,530 44 1,273 1,488 1,381 ^9.7 NA 1,381 s 9 Notes: Realty professionals believe prices are declining because rental availability is at peak since hurricane Hugo.
