According to the U.S. assistant trade representative who serves as the chief U.S. negotiator, the task force on our country's admission to GATT will soon enter the stage of substantive discussions. The United States is willing to coordinate its actions and assist our country in joining GATT, and in becoming a member of other world trade bodies. It is hoped that during the current talks, the two sides will make substantial progress in reducing tariffs and in opening up the agricultural and service markets. Speaking after the talks, Vice Economic Minister Hsu K'e-sheng, who is our chief negotiator, said: Of the more than 2,700 products in which the United States expressed an interest, our side promised to adjust the tariff rates for 253 farm products and 2,093 industrial goods, but the U.S. side was not satisfied. It also did not accept our country's request that talks on initial negotiation rights be held only after the conclusion of talks on tariffs and the finalization of the tariff reduction scheme. The two sides decided to hold more discussions on tariff reductions on 26 February. The U.S. side, however, accepted our request that tariff reductions in preparation for our admission to GATT be introduced in a single move so that the cow would not be skinned twice. He said: [Begin recording Hsu K'e-sheng] Other than the 2,700 tariff items that are of interest to them, we did not respond to their demands that we set the overall level of our tariff rates and specify the goods to which the U.S. side can claim initial negotiation rights. The U.S. side thought this would make piecemeal discussions with us impossible. [end recording] During the talks, our side also said: After joining GATT, our country agrees to import food grains and to allow the gradual import of some farm products based on tariffication and tariff quotas in accordance with the results of the Uruguay Round of trade talks. The U.S. side, however, emphasized that tariffcation measures are inappropriate for our country, which is not currently a GATT member. As for the opening of the rice market, our side expressed the hope that it be allowed to adopt the South Korean model, but the U.S. side did not offer an immediate response. According to the agenda for the second day of talks, the two sides will continue discussions on opening up the service market and on our country's participation in signing the Tokyo Round agreements.
