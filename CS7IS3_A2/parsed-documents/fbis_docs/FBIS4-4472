Security Council [UNSC] but said it implies "assuming responsibilities" such as peacekeeping duties. "It shall seem fit that countries who pursue their candidature (for permanent membership) proceed with constitutional reforms implied by such membership," Juppe told a news conference. He was alluding to Germany's and Japan's pacifist postwar Constitutions restricting overseas troop deployment. Tokyo enacted a law in 1992 empowering a limited overseas deployment of Self-Defense Forces (SDF) to assist U.N. peacekeeping operations but a legal provision bans the peacekeepers from joining activities that may involve the use of force. However, a constitutional amendment opening the door to participation in proposed peace enforcement units remains highly controversial in Japan. Former Defense Agency Chief Keisuke Nakanishi quit last December following public outrage over a speech advocating a revision of the Constitution for armed peacekeeping missions. Juppe said, nonetheless, the discussed revision of the 15-member Security Council remains a difficult problem, citing misgivings about the efficiency of a bigger council. Should Japan and Germany, both northern nations, be awarded permanent seats, a number of countries from the southern hemisphere should also become permanent Security Council members to maintain "a certain geopolitical balance," Juppe said without elaborating. Juppe, who met Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata on Thursday, and Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and other cabinet members Friday, said the top objective of his four-day visit is "to reestablish high-level dialogue" between Japan and France. Juppe said he conveyed a message from French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur inviting Hosokawa to France. He said he and Hata agreed to hold foreign ministerial talks in principle once a year and to promote regular meetings of senior ministry officials. Japan and France will actively cooperate in the reconstruction of war-shattered Cambodia and coordinate measures to fight AIDS, he said. Japan and France should nurture political dialogue on all international problems, he said, adding he and Hata also discussed security in the Asia-Pacific region, especially North korea's alleged nuclear weapon program. He called Pyongyang's refusal to allow full international inspections at a key nuclear facility "unacceptable" and "a behavior France condemns" because it involves "a great risk of nuclear proliferation." As a party to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), North Korea must accept inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), he said. He added he hopes North Korea "brings itself in compliance with international rules" since the U.N. Security Council adopted a statement Thursday urging Pyongyang to agree to a follow-on IAEA inspection at the controversial site. "Japan must proceed in opening its markets," Juppe said, citing auto parts, aeronautics, public works and the insurance sector as special concerns but stressed that Paris is devoted to "multilateralism" in solving trade issues. Following a trip to Kyoto, Juppe will leave for New Delhi on Sunday.
