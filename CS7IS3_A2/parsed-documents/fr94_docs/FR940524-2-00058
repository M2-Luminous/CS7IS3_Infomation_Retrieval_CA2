Notice of Decision Not To Review an Initial Determination Granting Complainant's Motion for Summary Determination on the Issue of Domestic Industry AGENCY: U.S. International Trade Commission. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade Commission has determined not to review an initial determination (ID) (Order No. 20) issued by the presiding administrative law judge (ALJ) in the above-captioned investigation granting the motion of complainant Farallon Computing, Inc. (``Farallon'') for summary determination on the issue of domestic industry. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Elizabeth C. Rose, Esq., Office of the General Counsel, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E Street, SW., Washington, DC 20436. Telephone: (202) 205&hyph;3113. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission instituted this investigation, which concerns allegations of violations of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 in the importation and sale of certain devices for connecting computers via telephone lines, on November 12, 1993; a notice of the institution was published in the Federal Register on November 17, 1993 (58 FR 60671). Complainant Farallon alleges infringement of certain claims of U.S. Letters Patent 5,003,579. On April 1, 1994, Farallon filed a motion for summary determination on the issue of domestic industry. The motion was unopposed by any respondent. The Commission investigative attorney supported the motion. On April 21, 1994, the ALJ issued an ID granting the motion. The ALJ determined that complainant practices the patent claims in issue, and that there is sufficient uncontroverted information to establish the existence of a domestic industry to warrant granting the motion. No petitions for review of the ID were filed. No agency or public comments were received. This action is taken under the authority of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. 1337, and Commission interim rule 210.53, 19 CFR 210.53. Copies of the nonconfidential version of the ID and all other nonconfidential documents filed in connection with this investigation are or will be available for inspection during official business hours (8:45 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.) in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E Street, SW., Washington, DC 20436, telephone 202&hyph;205&hyph;2000.
