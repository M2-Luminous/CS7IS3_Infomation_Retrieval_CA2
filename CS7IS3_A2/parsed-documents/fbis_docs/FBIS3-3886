Twenty-three Russian scientists are now teaching or doing research at various Taiwan universities, accounting for one-tenth of the total number of foreign high-technology personnel the NSC hires annually, said NSC Vice Chairman Hu Ching-piao. The cabinet-level council has received many job applications from Russia in the past two years, Hu said. "The Russians have mostly applied for teaching and research jobs in Taiwan," he added. "The increase in the number of job seekers from Russia may be prompted by higher pay here," Hu noted. Hu, who visited Russia last June as the head of a delegation of Taiwan officials and scientists, pointed out that Russia is highly advanced in such high-tech fields as material sciences, optoelectronics and aerospace engineering. "Taiwan will benefit from strengthening technological exchanges with Russia," Hu said. He noted that language barriers and Russian red tape may be the two greatest obstacles to promoting Taiwan-Russian scientific and technological exchanges. Hu said the NSC is considering setting up a representative office in Moscow to facilitate bilateral technological cooperation and recruitment of Russia scientists. Meanwhile, the government-funded Industrial Technology Research Institute said it will send officials to Russia in May to recruit Russian engineers and technicians to work for private enterprises here. A group of senior executives from Russian small and medium sized businesses is scheduled to visit Taiwan in may to seek possible trade and joint-venture opportunities, NSC sources said.
