FR940919-2-00089 FR940919-2-00046 By focusing on these objectives, the redesigned process replaces an existing process that is slow, labor-intensive, and paper reliant with a seamless claim process that makes better use of technology, eliminates fragmentation and duplication, promotes more flexible use of resources, and results in dramatic improvements in public service. With the redesigned process, SSA has embarked on an era of change that will revitalize and streamline the way it delivers disability claim services to the public to achieve greater quality, accuracy, speed and efficiency. A detailed description of the redesigned disability claim process is presented in the following section. Description of the New Process Overview Claimants for disability benefits under the new process will be provided a full explanation of SSA's programs and processes at the initial contact with SSA. Claimants will be offered a range of options for filing a claim and conferring with decisionmakers, using various modes of technology to interact with SSA. Claimants, who are able to do so, along with third parties and representatives who act on their behalf, will assist in the development of their claims, deal with a single contact point in the Agency, and have the right to a personal interview with decisionmakers at each level of the process. The number of steps will be consolidated and the issues on appeal will be focused. If the claim is approved, the effectuation of payment to the claimant, eligible dependents and the representative will be streamlined.
