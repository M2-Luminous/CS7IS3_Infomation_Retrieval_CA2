After an exchange of views with Klaus Kinkel, which lasted for approximately three hours, Kozyrev left it open whether the parties to the conflict should participate in the conference. On the other hand, however, he stated that a comprehensive cease-fire agreement should be concluded with the parties to the conflict at this meeting "in the near future," and that a political solution should be initiated. Apart from the United States and Russia, France, Great Britain, the United Nations, and the "troika" of the three leading members of the European Union, Belgium, Greece, and Germany will probably participate in the conference. Kozyrev arrived in Germany after holding talks in Geneva and Paris. After a working lunch at the government's guest house in Petersberg near Bonn, Kinkel expressed the hope that the conference would be held "in the near future." Russia must continue be involved in the peace efforts and exert influence on the Serbian side. It must be clear that "aggression is not rewarded." Referring to the state visit by President Boris Yeltsin in two weeks' time, Kinkel spoke of "untroubled and good relations." Kozyrev expressed satisfaction with the West, stressing that military intervention should only be the very last resort. There are also limits for the Serbs that must not be exceeded. One such limit was the shelling of the hospital of Gorazde. Officials close to the Russian foreign minister openly warned against attacking the Serbs because this might "mobilize an entire people." The first step of the proposed foreign ministers' conference will be the determination of safety zones in Bosnia. After this measure, the next political solutions must be specifically initiated. Afterward a summit meeting of all parties involved can be convened, Kozyrev, who has departed for Moscow, stressed.
