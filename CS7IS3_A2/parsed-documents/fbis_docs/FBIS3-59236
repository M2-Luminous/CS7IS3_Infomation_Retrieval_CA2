He asserted: "The question of the establishment of a Kurdish state is in the offing. We must be prepared." Demirel attended the dinner held by the Supreme Press Council in the Divan Hotel in Istanbul last night. He discussed the question of the establishment of a Kurdish state, which the officials of the Western countries frequently mention. Minister of Internal Affairs Nahit Mentese, Minister of National Education Nevzat Ayaz, Governor of Istanbul Hayri Kozakcioglu, and Director of Police in Istanbul Necdet Menzir also attended the dinner. Demirel was accompanied by his advisers Emre Gonensay, Cuneyt Arcayurek, and Omer Tarkan. He recalled that the British, German, and French foreign ministers opposed the establishment of a Kurdish state in the statements they made both in and outside Turkey but said that Mrs. Mitterrand in France and several members of the House of Lords and the House of Commons in Britain had mentioned that possibility. Demirel asserted: In light of the developments, Turkey must be prepared for the establishment of a Kurdish state. It must consider every possibility on that matter. Asked whether or not the Kurdish state that the Western officials are considering would include a part of Turkey, Demirel said: "Considering the statements that have been made and the maps that have been drawn, Turkey is included in their plans. In other words, they have not excluded Turkey. Large maps have been drawn up and published." Replying to a question on the massacre of 20 people, including women and children, by the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK], Demirel said that the action was an act of violence, the Turkish security forces will definitely take the necessary measures, and the PKK will definitely be rendered ineffective. Demirel disclosed that the PKK does not have toxic gas and other chemical arms at the present time. However, he stressed that the security forces do not have clear-cut information on that matter. Nevertheless, he said that the information available at the present time must be regarded as being valid.
