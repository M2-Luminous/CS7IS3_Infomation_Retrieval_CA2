Since the State Council held a telephone conference on launching national commodity price inspection, the province's commodity price inspection work has been carried out intensely and in an orderly manner. Some cases of wanton price hikes and wanton collection of fees have been discovered, and 2,803 cases of price discipline violations have been handled. These cases involved funds totalling 36 million yuan, and funds derived from economic sanctions imposed on the cases total approximately 26 million yuan. Hubei Province's present commodity price situation is still quite grim. The provincial government has taken and is taking measures to regulate and control the situation. The measures included: On behalf of the provincial government, we will promulgate the provisional regulations of Hubei on combating exorbitant profits, and establish a grain, coal, and oil reserve system, a system of risk funds, and a system of regulatory funds for major foods such as meat, eggs, poultry, vegetables, and sugar and agricultural means of production. The inspection team of the State Council will go to the rural areas, enterprises, and marketplaces of Wuhan, Jingzhou, Shashi, Yichang, and other localities to gain on-the-spot information about the prices of grain, coal, and oil, and of agricultural means of production, and to learn about the peasants' burdens, general market prices, and the prices of energy and raw and semifinished materials.
