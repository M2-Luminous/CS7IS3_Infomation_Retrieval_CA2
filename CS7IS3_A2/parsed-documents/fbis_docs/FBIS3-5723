He made the statement in response to a call of the Young Officers Union (YOU) to the new graduates of the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) to pursue their goals of initiating reforms within the military establishment. De Villa was the guest of honor at the parade and review and awarding ceremonies of PMA's Bantay Lakas [Watch Force] class. The graduation ceremonies will be held Sunday with President Ramos as guest. The 224 graduating cadets include De Villa's son Patrick. De Villa said he has brought to the attention of the government negotiating panel headed by Professor Alfredo Tadiar recent propaganda tactics of the Nationalist Revolutionary Alliance [as published] and YOU which he said sow confusion in the peace process. He said he has also asked the government panel to ascertain if statements purportedly released by the group of former Lt. Col. Gregorio Honasan were genuine and authentic. [passage omitted]
