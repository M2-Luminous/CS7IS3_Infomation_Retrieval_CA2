Together with their European Airbus partners, the Germans want to deliver planes for approximately 10 billion German marks to Saudi Arabia. However, U.S. President Bill Clinton announced that Saudi Arabia will buy the planes from the U.S. companies Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. As a result, Dasa Chief Juergen Schrempp sent a begging letter to the chancellors. "Since we know that the negotiations in Saudi Arabia have not yet been finally concluded," the letter says, Kohl should advocate the Europeans' cause. In Dasa alone, almost 1,300 jobs have to be abolished by 1997, if the order is lost. "Only a personal intervention by yourself," Schrempp wrote in clumsy German, could "bring about at least a partial turnaround." The chancellor has not yet reacted. He is angry with Schrempp and his colleagues. Over the past months, they have repeatedly criticized the Federal Government harshly for drastically reducing research subsidies for aviation and space flight.
