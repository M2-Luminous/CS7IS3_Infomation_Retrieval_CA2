Rexrodt said that "over the past few years, Mexico has prepared for the leap into an industrial society." In his opening speech, Rexrodt recalled the tradition of German industrial exhibitions in Mexico. The first large-scale industrial fair was staged in Mexico City exactly 40 years ago, in 1954. The choice of Mexico for Technogerma 1994 is a signal: As the fair only takes place every three to four years in an important partner country "with which economic and technological cooperation should be particularly enhanced," this now "opens a new chapter in German- Mexican economic relations." The German economy can build on a solid base in Mexico: For some years now, the country has been the biggest purchaser of German goods in Latin America. In 1992, the volume of bilateral trade reached 5.25 billion German marks [DM]. The Federal Republic's trade surplus amounted to DM2.5 billion. However, in 1993, the exports to Mexico and imports of Mexican goods into Germany both declined: "All possible efforts must be made to reduce the growing bilateral trade deficit (Mexico) with Germany." Rexrodt urged the Mexican export industry to use the opportunities presented by the German market with its 80 million consumers. "Display presence instead of abstinence." Germany is the second largest investor in Mexico after the United States. That stems not only from the German investment capital flowing into Mexico, but also from the fact that a high share of the profits earned in Mexico are reinvested. "NAFTA, which was formed recently," said Rexrodt, referring to the North American Free Trade Zone, which was established on 1 January 1994, "will encourage the development of much closer ties between the two North American states and Mexico, and that will result in an increase in investment." The Federal Republic hopes that a German-Mexican treaty on the protection and promotion of investment will have a positive effect. Bonn is exchanging ideas about such a treaty with the Mexican Government. The "Report of the Year 2000 Commission," which was presented in Mexico City also describes new areas for cooperation between Germany and Mexico. In his opening speech, Rexrodt also stated that there was "enormous potential for economic growth" in environmental protection. In Germany alone, the market for goods that are not harmful to the environment amounts DM40 billion a year. The market is growing at a rate of between 6 and 8 percent. NAFTA will present Mexico new challenges in this very area of environmental protection. Rexrodt praised the policies aimed at promoting stability being pursued by President Salinas de Gortari and his government: "The Mexican economy has come out of the painful and difficult adjustment process stronger." This path is "an essential condition for overcoming structural difficulties, achieving further economic growth, and thus, above all, for the political stability that is so important." This year's Technogerma has far more to offer than its predecessors, stressed Rexrodt. There will be a symposium covering such topics as the transfer of knowhow, background information on "Germany as a center of industry," and a series of side events to promote cultural exchange. "Technogerma," said the economics minister, "will enhance Mexican-German relations in the political and cultural field too."
