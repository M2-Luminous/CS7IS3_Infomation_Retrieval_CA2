Scope of Order The products covered by this order are certain paper clips, wholly of wire of base metal, whether or not galvanized, whether or not plated with nickel or other base metal ( e.g. , copper), with a wire diameter between 0.025 inches and 0.075 inches (0.64 to 1.91 millimeters), regardless of physical configuration, except as specifically excluded.

Specifically excluded from the scope of this order are plastic and vinyl covered paper clips, butterfly clips, binder clips, or other paper fasteners that are not made wholly of wire of base metal and are covered under a separate subheading of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). The products subject to this order are currently classifiable under subheading 8305.90.3010 of the HTSUS. Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this order is dispositive. Antidumping Duty Order In accordance with section 735(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (``the Act''), on September 30, 1994, the Department of Commerce (``the Department'') made its final determination that certain paper clips from the People's Republic of China (``PRC'') were being sold at less than fair value (59 FR 51168, October 7, 1994). On November 14, 1994, the International Trade Commission notified the Department of its final determination, pursuant to section 735(b)(1)(A)(i) of the Act, that an industry in the United States is materially injured by reason of imports of the subject merchandise. Therefore, all unliquidated entries of certain paper clips from the PRC entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after May 18, 1994, which is the date on which the Department published its notice of preliminary determination in the Federal Register , are liable for the assessment of antidumping duties. In accordance with section 736(a)(1) of the Act, the Department will direct Customs officers to assess, upon further advice by the administering authority, antidumping duties equal to the amount by which the foreign market value of the merchandise exceeds the United States price for all relevant entries of certain paper clips from the PRC. Customs officers must require, at the same time as importers would normally deposit estimated duties on this merchandise, a cash deposit equal to the estimated weighted-average antidumping duty margins as noted below. The ``All Others'' rate applies to all exporters of PRC paper clips not specifically listed below. The ad valorem weighted-average dumping margins are as follows: ‚ê£ 1Manufacturer/producer/exporter 1Margin percentage Shanghai Lansheng Corporation 57.64 Zhejiang Light Industrial Products Import and Export Corporation 46.01 Zhejiang Machinery and Equipment Import and Export Corporation 60.70 All Others (including Abel Industries) 126.94 This notice constitutes the antidumping duty order with respect to certain paper clips from the PRC, pursuant to section 736(a) of the Act. Interested parties may contact the Central Records Unit, room B&hyph;099 of the Main Commerce Building, for copies of an updated list of antidumping orders currently in effect. This order is published in accordance with section 736(a) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.21. Dated: November 17, 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.
