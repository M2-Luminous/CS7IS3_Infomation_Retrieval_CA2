The government plans a total of 5.85 trillion yen worth of cuts in income, residential and other taxes this year as envisaged by the latest economic stimulative package unveiled in early February. For such reductions to be implemented on schedule as originally planned, the Diet would need to pass the bills by the end of March, according to the officials. Chances are increasing, however, that some of those bills cannot become law on time due to a boycott of Diet business by the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The LDP has refused to start deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget, already two months behind schedule, over its demand that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa clear up questions surrounding a 100 million yen loan he received from scandal-ridden trucking firm Sagawa Kyubin. The LDP also maintains that the tax cuts are an important matter that cannot be discussed in haste. Some LDP members also oppose a government plan to limit the tax plan to one year. The LDP stance is causing worries at the Finance Ministry. Ministry officials said it takes at least two months before tax plans are put into practice after Diet approval because of the need to publicize them to companies and work out procedural matters. If passage of the bills is delayed to mid-April, they said, income tax returns may not come in time for employees at companies which pay summer bonuses in early June.
