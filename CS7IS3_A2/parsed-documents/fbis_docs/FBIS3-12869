Particular attention is given to checking foreign currency and electronic and electrical goods at the Iraqi crossing point into Jordan at Tirbil in the wake of a dramatic plunge in the value of the Iraqi dinar since early this year, they said. In many cases vehicles carrying diplomatic plates are also searched thoroughly before being allowed out, they said. Iraqi nationals carrying foreign currency with them into the country also face similar problems, they said. "There does not appear to be any hard and fast rule for the amount of foreign currency one could carry while he or she goes in," said an Iraqi source. "Sometimes even small amounts are seized from travellers." "On the other hand, many businessmen appear not to have any serious problems," added the source. Beyond that, however, are stricter measures aimed at preventing imported products leaving Iraq territory, the sources said. "Every piece of baggage is checked very throughly and anything that raises doubts that it could be used for commercial purposes is confiscated at the border poknt before the traveller leaves Iraq," said an Iraqi source. A traveller reported that two of three Irqi-made leather jackets he was carrying were seized at the border. "They said they could permit only one for personal use," the traveller told the JORDAN TIMES. In another case, a foreign journalist who had carried with him extra lenses and other camera accessories on an assignment in Iraq reported that he was not allowed to take them out. "I had registered my cameras when I went in, but did not bother to do so with the lenses and some other accessories," said the photographer. "On my way out, they said I could carry only the cameras and confiscated the lenses and accessories, saying I could not prove I had taken them with me when I went in. Intervention by Iraqi officials in Baghdad did not help either." According to experts on Iraqi economy and the government approaches to imports and exports, Baghdad appeared to be concerned that it would have to spend massive amounts in foreign exchange for imports to meet local demands as and when the sanctions are lifted. And, as such, It wants to retrain whatever remains in the country, they said. Border officials on the Jordanian side said they were finding fewer cases of smuggling and fewer items that are subject to Jordanian customs regulations in travellers baggage. "We used to find many travellers, both Iraqis and others, carrying foreign-made cameras, watches, perfumes, electronic equipment, etc., and most of the time levy customs on them," said an official. "These days the flow of such items seems to have dried up." According to Iraqi sources, the Baghdad government wants to check people trying to take out electronic and electric goods that the country imported prior to the imposition of the sanctions in August 1990. A massive quantity of such products also ended up in the Iraqi market from Kuwait which remained under Iraqi occupation between August 1990 and March 1991. The Iraqi source noted that Iraqi rules in force for many years prevent the outflow of goods imported into Iraq without prior government permission, but that the regulations were enforced with relative laxity until recently. "Now, the rules are enforced to the letter," said the source. "Only those with wasta (connection with influential officials) are an exception."
