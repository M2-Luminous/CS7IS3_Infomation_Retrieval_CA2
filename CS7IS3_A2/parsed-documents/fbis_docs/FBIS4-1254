He alleges that the ruling Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola [MPLA] did not win elections in those provinces. MPLA Information Secretary Joao Lourenco, who is also a deputy in the National Assembly, has just told the People's Television of Angola, TPA, that UNITA must accept that it lost the September 1992 elections. He added that those elections had been general and not regional. [Begin Lourenco recording] Jonas Savimbi is a real cheeky fellow, but we do not believe he has the right to make the demands that he just made. He must recognize that he lost the September 1992 elections. He must behave as a loser and not as a winner. The winning party formed the government. As a matter of good will, it decided to open government to several figures in opposition parties, including of course UNITA, which is led by Mr. Jonas Savimbi. It should be understood, though, that this was a government offer and not something the government was obliged to do. [end recording] Commenting on the ministerial portfolios demanded by UNITA, MPLA Information Secretary Joao Lourenco warned that the government's patience has a limit. He added that UNITA's demands are quite absurd. [Begin Lourenco recording] This is a matter that must be made quite clear. UNITA did not win the September 1992 elections. It cannot demand -- there is nothing that awards it that right -- to be given this or that ministerial portfolio, particularly when it comes to portfolios that the government believes should not be in the hands of opposition parties. We believe that the government has shown great generosity. If one looks at the number of portfolios that the government has given the opposition in general, and UNITA in particular, one surely will find that they add up to a considerable number. Such portfolios include posts such as ministers, deputy ministers, governors of certain provinces, and administrators of districts and communes, and they make up a considerable number. In view of that, the government believes that UNITA must not continue to make demands concerning central and provincial government posts. [end recording]
