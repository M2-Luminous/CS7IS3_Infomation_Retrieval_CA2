But it is hard to recall such a powerful upsurge in public interest in an event that is, generally speaking, a "formality." The editorial office has received numerous queries prompted by reports appearing in the mass media to the effect that it is planned to slash the military budget and that many articles of the Law on the Status of Servicemen could be repealed, reports which have caused concern among our readers. Last year's "budget tribulations," delays of two or three months in paying wages and servicemen's pay, disruptions to leave, and unfulfilled plans are still fresh in many people's memories. Is all this going to be repeated this year, only worse? We decided to seek first-hand answers, so to speak, to this and other questions which are currently of concern to Army and Navy personnel, workers at defense enterprises, and Armed Forces veterans. [Ivanyuk] Vasiliy Vasilyevich, the Finance Ministry's attempts to save on military spending have already been the subject of a political assessment: The proposed level of appropriations will lead to the ruin of the country's defense complex, and in particular the Russian Army, which is basically the sole island of stability on the territory of the former USSR.... [Vorobyev] I am no politician, and I would like to refrain from commentaries of that kind. As far as the military budget is concerned, I am prepared to speak about it in detail and to cite illustrations to confirm the validity and authenticity of every figure. The sums we are asking for are not plucked out of thin air. The need for defense appropriations for 1994 is defined in accordance with the requirements of the Russian Federation Law "On Defense," which envisages a reduction in the Armed Forces, taking into account the State Defense Order approved by the Russian Federation Government decree of 21 December 1993 and decisions recently adopted by the country's top leadership on questions of defense, the financial stabilization of the economy, and state social support for the population. We are aware that the Russian economy is currently going through a difficult period. Therefore the calculations sent to the Finance Ministry contain nothing superfluous. The proposed draft has, above all, a clearly expressed social thrust. The Defense Ministry pins great hopes on Russian Federation President B.N. Yeltsin's Message, his speech in the Federal Assembly on 24 February this year. He said quite specifically: "In 1994 we have to put an end to the deleterious practice of one-sided concessions. This applies, among other things, to the defense budget. It must not be forgotten that spending on defense is not at all the same thing as spending on war. These resources go to finance a significant part of our science. These resources go to build apartments for homeless officers' families. These resources go to maintain our children who are serving in the Armed Forces." [Ivanyuk] What does this mean in actual figures? [Vorobyev] I do not think there is any point in naming specific sums. These have not yet been finally confirmed, and anyway, given the present rate of inflation, they do not tell you much. If we look at relative figures, 56 percent of the total military budget consists of expenditure on servicemen's pay and wages for civilian personnel, paying for rations and pensions, building housing, maintaining military hospitals, clinics, sanatoriums, rest homes, and kindergartens, and carrying out tasks in connection with the provision of facilities for troops withdrawn from Eastern Europe and the nearby foreign countries. Furthermore, the appropriations for the purchase of arms and military equipment and on scientific research and experimental and design work also include relevant expenditure at defense complex enterprises, which accounts for at least 45 percent of the total. Thus social expenditure, or, to put it another way, the minimum expenditure necessary for people's normal existence, accounts for a total of three-fourths of all defense expenditure. [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA interpolation] Our Information: The Finance Ministry has cut by a factor of 2.4 the sum requested by the Defense Ministry. The amount allowed for maintaining the Army and Navy is set at 61 percent of the sum requested; for arms, military equipment, and property -- 21 percent; for scientific and technical output -- 41 percent; for capital construction and major repairs -- 32 percent; and for servicemen's pensions -- 76 percent. In January 1994, 1 trillion rubles [R] was paid over to the Defense Ministry. Appropriations under the quota established by the Finance Ministry for February, totaling R1.3 trillion, were transferred bit by bit, up to 10 March. There was a chronic shortage of money. And the R371 billion which it is planned to allocate in March for maintaining the Army and Navy (under section one of the military budget) is not enough even to cover the servicemen's pay. [interpolation ends] [Ivanyuk] One cannot help getting the impression that the Finance Ministry's proposals for cutting the military budget are divorced from real life and are purely theoretical and abstract in nature.... [Vorobyev] This approach could indeed be called abstract. And not only because the "human factor," as they used to call it, is not taken into account. Take the actual methodology of the calculations. The Finance Ministry, in planning defense spending, takes as a basis the proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) accounted for by military spending in 1993, and automatically carries over this indicator, namely 5.02 percent, to this year's GDP. But tell me, what is the basis for calculating that GDP will increase by only a factor of 4.5? What decline or increase in production does this incorporate? What account is taken of the dynamic of price increases? It must be said that last year the Finance Ministry failed to take account of the actual trends in prices for output purchased by the Defense Ministry. For instance, budget expenditure on the purchase of arms and military equipment in 1993 was index-linked, in the main, by a factor of 2.1, although in a number of instances the actual increase was between fivefold and 12-fold. Or take military uniform. This sustained a 10- or 11-fold increase in price over the year. At the beginning of this year a complete soldier's uniform cost R500,000. Many other objective factors were -- and are -- absolutely left out of the reckoning. At the moment, in essence, all Russia's Armed Forces are in motion: The troops' withdrawal is in progress, they are changing stations, their structure is changing, expenditure on the provision of facilities is increasing. It takes 55 trains just to move one motorized infantry division. You can imagine the other expenses that this entails. And maintaining military camps beyond the Urals, which is where a significant proportion of troop units and formations have been redeployed, is much more expensive than in the European part of the former USSR. The Finance Ministry also takes no account of the actual tasks tackled by the Russian Army and Navy in the present difficult situation. But fulfilling peacekeeping functions in the "hot spots" costs the Armed Forces far more, of course, than systematic training in stationary conditions. So we want just one thing: for Finance Ministry workers to grasp once and for all the volume and structure of the military budget, and not to try to mislead the government about it every time. [Ivanyuk] Another question that arises is: Why take as a basis this bizarre figure of 5.02 percent -- with hundredths of a percent -- of GDP? This comparison with last year would be logical if last year's finances had been optimum, or at least satisfactory. But that is not so. And defense funds were saved in a manner directly detrimental to combat readiness. Because of the fuel shortage, combat training plans were not met, planes did not fly, ships lay rusting at the quayside, equipment did not get repaired, housing was not built, food reserves were not renewed, and so forth. And moreover, on the results of the year, the Defense Ministry ended up a major debtor.... [Vorobyev] To this day we have yet to settle up with all the suppliers of military equipment and property, supplies, and services. Out of a debt which totaled R2.2 trillion at the beginning of the year, only 1 trillion has been extinguished. Overall, the Defense Ministry's minimum requirement for appropriations of R10 trillion was only 75 percent fulfilled last year, taking the repayment of debts into account. The Finance Ministry could have achieved a still more gratifying picture and a still lower proportional level of defense spending this year if, last year, it had allocated not 75 percent, but, say, 50 or 40 percent of what the Army and Navy needed. Let's think straight: How much longer can the Armed Forces be kept without money, with only insignificant sums being allocated eight or 10 times a month, as has been the case for nearly a year? For another six months? A year? And then what? Some people declare that in the developed countries of the West, military spending accounts for not more than 3-5 percent of gross national product. Those who think this fail to take account of one thing -- the actual volume of GNP in those countries and in ours is not comparable. As a result the sums allocated for defense are not comparable either. And it is not a question of "flexing military muscles"; the point is that the reform of the Russian Army and Navy should be carried out gradually, without sociopolitical upheavals. Nor can we disregard the country's geopolitical location, the role that Russia continues to play in the world community, the structure of the Armed Forces, and many other factors. [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA interpolation] Our Information: In 1994 the U.S. GNP will be in excess of $6 trillion, and total military expenditure will be $280 billion, which comes to about $1,100 for every citizen of America. In the current year, total military spending per capita will be $730 in Britain, $810 in France, $815 in Norway, and $500 in Greece and the FRG. [Vorobyev continues] It must also be taken into account that ever since 1989, even while the Soviet Union still existed, expenditure on defense has fallen every year, mainly through reducing the numerical strength of the Army and Navy and cutting purchases of arms and military equipment. It would theoretically be possible to adopt the appropriations included in the draft budget for 1994 at the levels proposed by the Russian Finance Ministry. But the real consequences of that step must be borne in mind. What does it mean, for instance, if the Defense Ministry purchases 20-25 percent of the arms and military equipment stipulated in the State Order for 1994? Not only a reduction in the troops' combat capability and an irreversible lag in defense production technology, but also the stoppage of many enterprises and a mass upsurge in unemployment. Let us look at another item of expenditure. Given the proposed level of finance for housing construction, servicemen will fail to receive 24,000 apartments planned in the State Defense Order for 1994. The number of homeless families in the Army and Navy could rise to 155,000 by the end of the year as a result. Need I continue the list? I am convinced that everyone in the Russian Armed Forces, from the defense minister to any private doing his compulsory service, would agree to a devastating budget for the Army if he knew that it would result in an economic miracle in the near future. But miracles do not happen, and the only way to produce any tangible results in terms of economic recovery is to add to the income side of the budget, not to manipulate its expenditure side. As for making economical use of the resources allocated, we are prepared to make savings and we are doing everything to that end. [Ivanyuk] As you know, the Ministry of Labor recently put a proposal to the government to increase the minimum wage by 40 percent from 1 March. The adoption of this decision will entail an increase in wages in the budget sphere. Many of our readers are worried: Could it turn out that the military will once again be left to last? After all, last year it was the rule -- and this "rule" is regarded as an outrage -- to increase servicemen's pay a month later, or to a lesser extent, than for other "budget-funded" people. [Vorobyev] I hope this will not happen. We have submitted appropriate proposals regarding the indexation of servicemen's pay and the wages of the Defense Ministry's civilian personnel, and it would be nice to think that the proposals will be taken fully into account. At the same time the concern that has arisen in military collectives is understandable: Some people are not above making savings even here, at the expense of the soldier or the officer. Thus, in similar conditions the Finance Ministry has twice tried to index-link only servicemen's pay, "forgetting" about allowances for rank. But the Finance Ministry is not the government, and the government did not permit such "innovations." We have repeatedly been aware of Prime Minister V.S. Chernomyrdin's support on these matters. After all, our proposals are not based on excessive demands. It would be possible to forget about incomplete indexation or delays in it, if the soldier's job was among those that are highly paid. But in reality the picture is different. Let us take, for comparison, a pilot in civil aviation and a military airman. They experience similar psychological and physical stresses, they bear the same high responsibility. How does the state value their labor? A captain at Sheremetyevo-2 gets up to R3 million a month. That sum is made up of the salary, with the addition of the sector coefficient and other supplementary coefficients, additional payments for qualifications, unhealthy working conditions, and length of service, bonuses, and other payments, such as payments for total flying time per month, the commander's minimum landing payment, payment for working particularly difficult routes.... In the Russian Air Force a plane's captain, a major and first-class pilot with 15 or more years of service, receives something like R400,000 a month, that is, between one-fifth and one-sixth as much. This includes everything -- supplements for length of service, qualifications, special conditions of service and material aid, and the lump sum on the results of the year, calculated per month. [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA interpolation] Our Information: In 1909-1917 a captain or company commander in the Russian Army used to receive per year: salary -- R900, mess allowance -- R360, additional pay -- R480 (total: R1,740). In addition he was paid a lodging allowance of up to R544 a year, expenses for acquiring essential kit in field conditions and for the purchase of a horse, harness, carriage, etc., batman money of R10, and ration money (campaign and field rations in wartime). For a captain, the campaign allowance was R1.57, and the field allowance R3.50 per day. According to the draft State Income and Expenditure Inventory for 1912, a worker's average wage was R244 a year. At the beginning of the 20th century in Russia a kilogram of bread cost 6-15 kopeks, meat 17-33 kopeks, sugar 37 kopeks, butter 62-70 kopeks, a liter of vodka was 48-60 kopeks, a pair of shoes R3, and a pair of boots R7. [Vorobyev continues] Throughout the world, a soldier's work is paid more highly than work requiring similar effort in civilian sectors, and everywhere there is a highly developed system of concessions. And this is easy to explain: A person who is not bound by an oath or the requirements of military regulations is free to change his job if something -- such as the pay -- does not suit him. But where is a nuclear submarine commander -- who, incidentally, receives no more than a fighter pilot -- to go, if he does decide to sever his ties with the military department, at great cost to himself? There should be compensation for servicemen, in the form of higher wages, for restrictions of this kind on civil rights. And for other drawbacks -- the nomadic way of life, the lack of opportunity for wives to find jobs, etc. It must be said that this approach is enshrined in the Law on the Status of Servicemen, but in practice, unfortunately, the law is not realized as it should be. In terms of cost, the law has only been half implemented. The reason is well known -- the relevant provisions of the law are not backed up by an implementation mechanism, and appropriations have not been allocated. In this connection we receive many complaints from the troops and from Defense Ministry pensioners, to which it is impossible to give a satisfactory reply. Civil and military courts have recently been issuing rulings practically every day in favor of servicemen and Armed Forces veterans who appeal over violations of their rights to privileges laid down in existing legislation. But even the court decisions lead nowhere. To crown it all, the mass media blame the defense minister and the services under him for not fulfilling laws signed by the president of the Russian Federation. [Ivanyuk] But as if it was not enough that after more than a year this law has not even become fully operational, there have also been -- and still are -- attempts to "torpedo" it, to revoke privileges for servicemen and their families, including some that have existed for a long time. Just the other day people in the Army were disturbed by the news that the Finance Ministry has spawned yet another proposal for cutting servicemen's privileges. The impression is that some people are deliberately "inflaming" the atmosphere in the military collectives.... [Vorobyev] First of all, I would like to stress that the Army and Navy have no fabulous, extraordinary privileges -- in the main they correspond to the system of benefits and compensations that have become established in our country. For instance, members of many professions receive free uniform, are able to supplement their wardrobes at half price, enjoy free travel to and from their vacation center or free food, or have privileges under housing or, say, land legislation. But for some reason there are proposals to repeal or suspend the operation of certain laws, edicts, and decrees in connection with social guarantees specifically for servicemen. Some of these proposals can only be described as ludicrous. For instance, it is proposed to retain the food ration, but anyone who declines to take it, instead of being compensated for its full value, would be paid compensation equivalent to one minimum wage. But everyone will simply start taking the rations, and that will considerably complicate the task of procuring, storing, and issuing food and will entail additional costs. That is why the prime minister, in his interview for a RIA correspondent, described such proposals, bluntly but, I believe, rightly, as "real blackmail." [Ivanyuk] Vasiliy Vasilyevich, I cannot but agree with what you say, so do not take the next question, which is rather awkward, as an attempt to engage in a dispute. I have often heard it said, even at high levels, that the stance of the Defense Ministry, which is demanding to be fully financed in conditions of an acute budget deficit, is unproductive and inappropriate to a market economy. How would you comment on that view? [Vorobyev] I too have heard such views expressed. On the one hand, they are rather superficial, and on the other, they do not show good will. The theory that was once current, that social problems in the Army and Navy could and should be tackled by the use of extrabudgetary funds, has yet to bear fruit. The actual return on the numerous funds set up in this context is close to zero. And how can anyone seriously talk about maintaining -- even partially maintaining -- the army of a vast country like Russia on, so to speak, a voluntary basis? This is the state's task, and the state should take care of it in full. And a rigorous financial policy should be aimed at securing the military budget as a priority, not at reducing it. The Russian Defense Ministry is today placed within very tight bounds and is virtually without the possibility of earning resources. As an example, let me cite the sale of surplus property, as a result of which 1,600 apartments were acquired for servicemen last year. Yet on many other questions a far stricter system of restrictions has been imposed than in foreign states' armies, which are incomparably better financed. Thus, for instance, in Turkey a huge entrepreneurial structure operates under the patronage of the Armed Forces, including dozens of enterprises, as well as banks, and this makes it possible to provide additional social protection for servicemen. There are dozens of other projects which could be implemented in the Russian Armed Forces to rectify their financial position. In this respect we are urgently studying possible options with the Finance Ministry and other economic departments. [Ivanyuk] It would be nice to think that everything you have spoken of is at the center of the attention of the government and parliamentarians as they set about examining the country's budget for 1994, and that the Defense Ministry's interests will all be taken into account. [Vorobyev] We are hoping for that, too. Only I would make one small reservation: The proposals we have submitted on the military budget are dictated not by departmental interests, but by concern for maintaining the country's defense capability at least at the minimum necessary level. I would like to believe that the State Duma, the Federation Council, and the government understand this and will take account of all the circumstances in making their final decision.
