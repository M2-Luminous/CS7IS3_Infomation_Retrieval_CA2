The committee session opened at 10:00 AM and was attended by all Cabinet members, including Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. This was the first full Diet deliberation following the Hata Cabinet's inauguration. The first interpellator was Takashi Fukaya, a Budget Committee director and member of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. He questioned the government's views on the relationships between "universal security" and "collective security." In response, the prime minister said: "Universal security is a bit broader in concept than collective security, as defined by the UN Charter. But since collective security constitutes an important factor of universal security, I think it is almost the same as universal security." In this way, the prime minister made clear that the concepts of collective and universal security are the same. Moreover, he said the term "international security" "could be used the same as universal security in meaning." Asked whether the Constitution overrides the UN Charter in deciding policies such as international contributions, the prime minister said: "The Constitution prevails over international agreements and thus, it overrides the UN Charter." He also said: "Japan will act within the Constitution's framework" although Chapter Seven of the UN Charter calls for military actions by member states.
