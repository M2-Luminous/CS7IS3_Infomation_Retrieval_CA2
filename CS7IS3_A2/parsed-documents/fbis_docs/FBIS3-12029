The new date was set for 22 May. Carlos Larreategui, minister secretary general of public administration, confirmed that the talks will end this week with an official call to hold a plebiscite and said that "at least there seems to be an agreement on the date." The administration of President Sixto Duran-Ballen proposed the plebiscite, made up of eight questions on the political regime, but the TSE, controlled by the opposition, refused to make the official call for legal and logistical reasons. This situation prompted a serious internal conflict. The government emphasized today that the eight questions are irrevocable, but it admitted that the plebiscite will not be held on 1 May at the same time as the elections to renew 85 percent of the National Congress, as it was originally planned. Larreategui added that "22 May seems to be the right time." The criminal actions filed against the five TSE nonvoting members who called off the plebiscite were "frozen" to embark on a dialogue, which began today hours before the return of Duran-Ballen, who just ended a 16-day visit to Japan, China, and the United States. The criminal actions included a petition for the precautionary arrest of the five TSE nonvoting members. According to the government, these arrests would not have hindered the May elections, whose campaign is fully under way. Polls reveal that the two parties that support the Liberal Duran-Ballen administration will probably suffer an overwhelming defeat in the elections and the hard rightist opposition will win by an ample margin.
