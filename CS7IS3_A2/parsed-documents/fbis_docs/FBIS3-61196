Doing things one way today and another way tomorrow, and all with equal ease. No, things do not work that way. And somewhere in my subconscious mind I knew in advance the kind of answer I would get to the question about changes in the economics of sovkhozes and kolkhozes since privatization that I posed to the Akmolinsk Oblast Agricultural Administration. "You ask what has changed?" said V. K. Ilyashchenko, head of the oblast agricultural administration's Economics and Planning Department, a slight trace of irony in his voice. "Actually nothing, or at least not so far. There are many reasons for that. Of course, on the one hand only a short time has passed since the beginning of privatization; a majority of farms came under new types of ownership at the end of last year. But that is probably not the most important factor at all, but rather the fact that becoming an owner on paper is one thing, and actually becoming one, having the sense of being an owner, is something else altogether. It is the latter that we still lack. So trends in the development of privatized and non-privatized farms by and large do not differ at all." Owner... That sounds good, but... What point is there in being an owner without freedom and independence, freedom to produce, freedom to set prices, freedom to sell one's produce, and independence from the dictates of bureaucrats? Our prices are still set by the state, and the state continues to issue state procurement quotas to farms for three years. Nor does our private owner have the right in most cases to sell what he produces without instructions from higher up. Judging by what Vladimir Kuzmich said, the idea of privatization meets with various kinds of reception from the oblast's agricultural enterprises. Relatively large and smoothly functioning farms have generally greeted the idea of ownership with enthusiasm, while it proved necessary to force most unprofitable farms in the direction of happiness, in compliance with the president's edict. Later, when amendments were made to the edict, privatization proceeded at a more restrained pace. And still no one knows when 123 out of 152 farms in the oblast will decide whether to become property owners or not. Rural residents are not prepared to make that decision, because for many people privatization is terra incognita. "The state just wants to divide us." "Why privatize, when everything is fine the way it is?" "Who needs dividends, which we don't know when we'll ever see -- wages are more dependable!" These are some of the opinions heard from members of labor collectives whenever the topic of conversation turns to changes in the form of ownership. And there has been so much trouble stemming from incompetence even after privatization: it seems that just as soon as the final documents are filed with the state property committee someone is already wanting to split off, someone else is being thrown out, and claims are being filed against someone else -- just look at the kind of owners we have become! Naturally this approach to understanding a sense of ownership troubles the staff of the oblast agricultural administration, just as they are troubled by the possible view that will be taken of certain types of agricultural production by the future owners. "Naturally any farmer is interested only in growing crops that yield a profit," muses V. K. Ilyashchenko. "But what about livestock farming, which is currently unprofitable? It is not likely that all property owners will behave in a civic-minded way, and some might, chasing after profits, stop raising livestock altogether, and then we might find ourselves with no meat." The state should start deciding now what it should do in this situation: either order farmers to keep on raising livestock (but then what kind of sense of ownership could they have?), or provide meat producers with very large subsidies. Incidentally, those who think that only the socialist world has subsidized farmers are wrong. Even such major industrial powers as the United States and Canada provide very substantial support to their farmers. All right then, we should help those who operate at a loss through no fault of their own and no matter what they do, but what about owners who simply do not want to work the way they should? During a recent visit to the virgin lands President Nazarbayev stated quite firmly that there should be no unprofitable farms in our state, and that they should be completely dissolved and sold on the auction block to thriftier farms or to industrial enterprises. The oblast agricultural administration supports this idea, but at this point does not really have a clear perception of how the process would actually work. "Well, people are going to say 'we have already had something like that' -- for example, we did dissolve one unprofitable farm. It was combined with another farm, a larger one. As a result the first farm's operations did not improve, and a once-strong farm got weaker. As for the sale of unprofitable farms to enterprises, we do not know whether there will be many industrialists interested in acquiring a burden like that: the capital investment required is huge, and no one knows when the profits will come, or whether they will come at all." Many property owners presently bear a grudge against the state, and their reasoning goes somewhat like this: When tenant farms were established, they got all kinds of breaks, like lending on favorable terms, and funding. But we run into obstacles everywhere we go, and we cannot even get loans very easily -- we have to put up collateral that is worth some dollars! Incidentally, not everything about privatization is bad, nor is it bad everywhere. Recently the oblast has seen the process of stock issuance by producers with processing enterprises occurring at quite a rapid rate. On many privatized farms people have realized that now they really must tighten their belts for a time and put their profits back into production. Various processing facilities and enterprises for the manufacture of consumer goods have sprung up on farms like mushrooms after a rain. Generally speaking, the market economy is beginning to come into its own in rural areas as well. But when will it finally take off? The answer to that question depends on many factors. Perhaps the most important of these is that when we accept privatization in our heads and not just on paper, then we can hope for success.
