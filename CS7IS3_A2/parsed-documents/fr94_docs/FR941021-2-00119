FR941021-2-00119 FR941021-2-00080 [TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,763] General Electric Company Aircraft Engine Division, Lynn, MA; Notice of Negative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration By an application dated August 30, 1994, Local # 201 of the International Union of Electrical Workers (IUE) requested administrative reconsideration of the subject petition for trade adjustment assistance, TAA. The denial notice was published in the Federal Register on August 15, 1994 (59 FR 41792). Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances: (1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous; (2) If it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously considered; or (3) If in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration of the decision. Investigation findings show that the workers produced jet aircraft engines. The union states that although imports of jet engines did not decrease absolutely they did increase relative to domestic shipments of jet engines. The union also stated that the production of parts for its jet engines are being manufactured offshore resulting in fewer jobs at Lynn's General Electric plant. The dominant cause for the downsizing at Lynn was the decrease in the Federal Government's defense budget for jet engines and fewer opportunities to break into the commercial airline business. Lynn's jet engine production was 90 percent military, 10 percent commercial. Further, less than 5 percent of the jet engine parts are outsourced overseas and this is a growing phenomenon with new orders for customers in other counties in order to sell them jet engines. The Lynn workers never produced the component parts for these new orders. Most of the outsourced component parts are not imported to the U.S. With respect to the Department's certifications for Babco Textron (TA&hyph;W&hyph;28,716) and Walbar (TA&hyph;W&hyph;28,633) both worker groups met all the statutory criteria for a worker group certification. Both worker groups produce component parts for Lynn's GE engines. A substantial portion of their component work which was produced domestically was outsourced to firms in other countries. Conclusion After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. Accordingly, the application is denied. Signed at Washington, D.C., this 11th day of October 1994. Victor J. Trunzo, Program Manager, Policy and Reemployment Services, Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;26173 Filed 10&hyph;20&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4510&hyph;30&hyph;M
