Pihl's remarks followed after his department on Wednesday [16 March] formally brought charges against Rozhok. "If a person doesn't go there (to a psychiatrist) by his own will, bringing under compulsion must be implemented. The same will be done if Rozhok won't appear before investigators. Everything will be done according to the laws and Rozhok has the possibility to take a lawyer," Pihl said. The representative of Russian radical nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's misleadingly-named Liberal Democratic Party in his speech in Narva on Jan. 25 and in an interview with the Russian-language SILLAMAESKI VESTNIK local newspaper of the northeast Estonian town of Sillamae "fanned inter-ethnic and political hostility," the indictment says.
