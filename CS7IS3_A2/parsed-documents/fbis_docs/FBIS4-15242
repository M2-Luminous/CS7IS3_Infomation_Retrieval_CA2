He commented on the desire of the upper chamber of the Russian parliament to set its resolution on the problem of the Russian prosecutor-general against the instructions of the head of state. Satarov explained why Kazannik under no condition can come back to the post of prosecutor-general: "There is no legal act under which Kazannik could claim his previous post. He was not approved by the Federation Council on that post, and the president's decree on his resignation was the latest document. If the president removed Kazannik from his post by his own free will, the Federation Council would have the right to examine reasons for the decision taken by the head of state. However, Kazannik's resignation was voluntary, and the president only accepted it. According to the Constitution the head of state is the only one who has the right to submit to the Federation Council a candidature to the post of prosecutor-general." President Yeltsin's aide stressed that the April 6 voting at the upper chamber of parliament over the acceptance or non-acceptance of Kazannik's resignation actually blocked a possibility of approving on that post of Aleksey Ilyushenko, whose candidature was suggested by the president, because the Federation Council linked the approval of the new prosecutor-general with the acceptance of the resignation of the previous one. According to Satarov, Ilyushenko may be removed from discharging the duties of the prosecutor-general only if the president officially submits his candidature to the Federation Council, and the deputies reject it. Now, however, they cannot do it, because the resignation of Kazannik has not been accepted. In his opinion, the only way out of this deadlock is to accept the resignation of Kazannik, thus paving the way for the functioning of constitutional mechanisms of the appointment of a new prosecutor- general. Until that time, "the contradiction between the old way of appointing a prosecutor-general and a principle of the new Russian Constitution, which cannot be settled by legal means, will continue to exist," Satarov said. It is not clear, however, whether or not the Federation Council will agree to hold another voting on this issue.
