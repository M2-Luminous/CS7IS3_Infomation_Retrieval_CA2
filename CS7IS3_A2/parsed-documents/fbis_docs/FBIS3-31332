Sporadic, or rather rare small arms provocations and a few mortar shells directed at the demarcation lines represent the main characteristics of the aggressor's activity in the operational zone controlled by the 4th Corps units in the past 24 hours. However, no one seriously believes in the swift and permanent return of peace to these areas. Namely, despite the cease-fire and negotiations between the two sides in Medjugorje, the Ustashas yesterday continued carrying out their policy of ethnic cleansing by expelling another 10 civilians to the left bank [of the Neretva River]. Therefore, it is obvious that the Croatian side has not given up its infernal plans and the intention of making the area Croatian. This has been Enes Ratukuzic and Faruk Hajtac reporting for Radio Television Bosnia-Herzegovina from the 4th Corps Information Service.
