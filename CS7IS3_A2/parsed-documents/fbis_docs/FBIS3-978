Nigeria's foreign affairs minister, Alhaji Babagana Kingibe, stated this in Accra after delivering a message from Nigerian head of state, General Sani Abacha, to Ghana's President Jerry Rawlings. He said the OAU conflict prevention mechanism, under the chairmanship of President Husni Mubarak, has invited Nigeria to a meeting today to discuss the conflict. Alhaji Babagana reaffirmed that Nigeria stood for a peaceful resolution of the conflict but was disgusted when France sent troops and armament to support Cameroon. The minister said the OAU had already held several meetings in Addis Ababa and the organization's ability to resolve the conflict peacefully will be a test for President Mubarak's committee.
