There is specific evidence that Branko Kostic, Borisav Jovic, Jugoslav Kontic, and Sejdo Bajramovic did not prevent the adoption of the decision on the JNA's withdrawal from Slovenia, and that they did not declare martial law or a state of emergency and adopt a decision on general mobilization on 12 September 1991. For these and other reasons, Djordje Dozet, a Belgrade military court judge, is proposing to the military prosecutor of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] army's General Staff that appropriate measures be taken against the members of the former SFRY [Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] Presidency, according to STA's Belgrade correspondent. Judge Dozet, who has the rank of captain, is actually demanding a trial of the entire former SFRY Presidency, i.e., also Stipe Mesic, Janez Drnovsek, Vasil Tupurkovski, and Bogic Bogocevic [as published], namely because in March 1991 they rejected a proposal from Federal Secretary for National Defense Veljko Kadijevic to declare a state of emergency and because in July 1991 they adopted the decision on the JNA's withdrawal from Slovenia, and thus recognized its secession. Dozet is primarily accusing Generals Veljko Kadijevic and Blagoje Adzic because they did not prevent the SFRY Presidency's decisions on the JNA's withdrawal from Slovenia and on the release of 5,000 soldiers from the September draft, and because they did not order JNA attacks against Croatia's paramilitary units. The list of the accused also includes Generals Zivota Avramovic, Andrija Raseta, and Dobrasin Parasevic, who among other things are supposed to have been responsible for turning over the equipment of the military hospitals in Zagreb and Ljubljana to the secessionist republics' authorities. Some circles in Serbia and Montenegro, especially military ones, still cannot reconcile themselves to the fact that the SFRY no longer exists. An answer to the question of why there is one trial after another in the FRY of officers for the military defeats of Greater-Serbian policy would be interesting. The answer is more than simple: obviously someone has to be blamed, especially now that the Serbian policy is facing its most real danger to date--the NATO alliance's ultimatum. It is easiest to make long-retired generals and members of the former SFRY Presidency, one of whom is already deceased and four of whom are not within reach of the judges and prosecutors in Belgrade, the scapegoats. It is actually not very likely that the military prosecutor of the Yugoslav army's General Staff will respond to Dozet's proposal. The Supreme Military Court, just a few days ago, annulled the verdict of the Belgrade military court on the basis of which five officers from the JNA's Varazdin Corps were acquitted of surrendering their units and turning over enormous amounts of weapons to the Croats. The judicial proceedings against the Varazdin Five, of whom General Vlado Trifunovic was supposedly the most responsible, have been dragging on for more than a year, and it seems that they still will not end soon. They are also interesting because the above-mentioned five people were acquitted precisely by Judge Djordje Dozet, who presided over the Belgrade military court at the trial. The Supreme Court annulled his verdict acquitting them on the basis of testimony by Generals Zivota Avramovic and Veljko Kadijevic, according to STA's Belgrade correspondent.
