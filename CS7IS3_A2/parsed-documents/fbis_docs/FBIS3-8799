In this connection, our correspondent David Stahlavsky spoke to Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus: [Begin recording] [Stahlavsky] I have asked you about your views before. At the time, you expressed the belief that it would not occur to the Russian radical nationalist to visit the Czech Republic. It appears that it has occurred to him, but, above all, it occurred to the crowds close to the Association for the Republic-Republican Party of Czechoslovakia. How will the leadership of our state react to this visit? What will our democracy have to hear before it behaves like other Western democracies--for example, in Germany and other places, where Mr. Zhirinovskiy was declared persona non grata? [Klaus] Well, Mr. Zhirinovskiy is no doubt persona non grata in our country at the moment, but I am using the expression non grata in the general civic meaning. I am not using it as a technical term of international law. We do not want him here. It is in this sense that he is not desirable in our country, and the few Mr. Sladeks [head of the Republican Party] who want him here, well, I think they are again indicating clearly where he belongs and what we all are to think about him. I am not fully convinced that we should proceed from undesirability, in the general sense of the word, to the term persona non grata, in the legal sense of the word, and formally bloc the arrival of Mr. Zhirinovskiy in our country. The government has not made any decision in principle about it, either. I do not rule out that it will become a topic of at least brief talks at the government session tomorrow morning. I really would not like to predetermine this matter. I think it is a pity, a waste of time, and stupid. On the other hand, I am fully convinced that our democracy is strong enough to survive this visit in peace without being threatened in any way. [end recording]
