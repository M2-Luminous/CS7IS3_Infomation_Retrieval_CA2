According to him, the ceasefire agreement reached on May 12 by military chiefs of the belligerents through Russia's mediation and encouragement on the part of Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe "is being observed in the main". "Only separate incidents" of small-scale fighting occured since then, he added. "Expressing our satisfaction with the fact that bloodshed has been stopped for the time being, we would like to see that the parties concerned thus showed, first and foremost, their political resolve to cease military operations and confirm their ability to fulfil their commitments," Karasin emphasized. In view of the fact that previous ceasefire agreements were repeatedly violated by this or that party, these features are of special significance. Karasin regretted the fact that "certain political forces and leaders try to create crisis situations for the sake of their self- serving interests at this decisive moment (in the fate) of the peoples involved in the conflict." "It is time we determined, who comes out for peaceful settlement of the conflict and who - for resumption of hostilities, for return into the bloody impasse," Karasin pointed out.
