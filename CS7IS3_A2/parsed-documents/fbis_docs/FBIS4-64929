In telephone interviews of 500 voters, around 60 percent said they were satisfied, while only 12 percent said they were dissatisfied. Around 20 percent had no opinion. The margin of error with such a small sampling is approximately 5 percent. By way of contrast, the paper cites a similar poll conducted in 1982 by the newspaper KALEVA, which found that Mauno Koivisto, Ahtisaari's predecessor, was much more popular after serving the same period in office. At this stage in 1982, around 85 percent of voters said they were satisfied with Koivisto.
