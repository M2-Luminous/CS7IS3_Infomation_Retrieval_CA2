FBIS4-9396 "dreeu080_y_94002" FBIS-EEU-94-080 Daily Report 23 Apr 1994 YUGOSLAVIA Federal Simic: Air Strikes Set `Dangerous Precedent' Simic: Air Strikes Set `Dangerous Precedent' LD2304032794 Belgrade TANJUG in English 0017 GMT 23 Apr 94 LD2304032794 Belgrade TANJUG English BFN ["Pool" item] [Text] Belgrade, April 22 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Vice-Premier Zeljko Simic said on Friday that the international community had set a dangerous precedent by raiding Bosnian Serb positions at the eastern Bosnian Moslem enclave of Gorazde, which might have incalculable consequences for the future of international relations and the shape of the new world order. Simic, who chairs the committee for monitoring the International Conference on Former Yugoslavia, was speaking at a meeting with a delegation of the Russian State Duma (lower house of the Russian parliament), headed by Nikolay Bezbyrodov, deputy chairman of the parliamentary defence commitee, said a statement released by the Yugoslav Information Ministry. Simic briefed the Russian delegation about the Yugoslav Government's positions in the light of the latest developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and said that Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) had been cooperative and flexible from the very outbreak of the crisis in the region, which means that accusations against its foreign policy orientation are groundless, and most often malicious. The Yugoslav Government has always aspired to an unbiased and objective view of all aspects of the crisis in former Yugoslavia, as the only way for reaching a just and lasting settlement of the two-year-old crisis, simic said and added that the government would never abandon the democratic principles of safeguarding the sovereignty of the country and the freedom of its people. Simic placed special stress on the unsuitability of sanctions and the need for banishing them permanently from international relations. The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions on Yugoslavia in May 1992 for the country's alleged military involvement in civil war in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina, and has tightened them twice since. Simic stressed that Russia's role had been and continued to be of great importance to Yugoslavia and the future of the world. Without the active, peace-making role of Russia, which justly insists on talks as the only mode of international communication likely to produce lasting peace and stable relations in the region, it is impossible to imagine a satisfactory outcome of the civil war and relaxation of tensions in the region. This is why all international factors must embrace the Russian approach, which is unbiased, heeds the political reality and strives for a comprehensive settlement of the conflict in the territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina, simic said. He added that lasting and immediate peace was a necessary precondition for all talks and political consultations, whose outcome must not be prejudged. The Russian parliamentary delegation agreed with the positions expressed by the Yugoslav deputy prime minister and said that their visit was primarily aimed at learning at first hand the true state of affairs in the former Yugoslav republics. They explained they intended to suggest to the State Duma later in April some concrete measures which should help solve the crisis in former Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav Information Ministry said in its statement.
