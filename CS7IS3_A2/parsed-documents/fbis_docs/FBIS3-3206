Several detentions took place Friday morning in front of the Japanese Embassy in Beijing, including two people who were delivering open letters to Hosokawa on the eve of his Saturday arrival. Among those taken away were Gao Xiongfei, an associate professor from Zhejiang Education College, and Gao Mingke (unrelated), 82, from Xuzhou City, Jiangsu Province, the source said. Up to 400 people from neighboring Hebei Province are planning to come to Beijing for the Hosokawa visit, the source said, while nearly 100 activists have been detained on both Thursday and Friday at either the Beijing railroad station or in front of the Japanese Embassy. Hundreds of others in Zhejiang and Jiangsu Provinces have been detained or questioned by police and warned not to come to Beijing during the prime minister's visit, the source said. Sources said Chinese Public Security bureaus in Beijing met Thursday to discuss war compensation activities and decided to crack down on any activities that might disturb the Hosokawa visit. Tong Zeng, leader of the unofficial Victims of Japanese War Crimes Reparations Committee, was believed detained by police Thursday and his whereabouts are presently unknown, the source close to the movement said. The Chinese Government has been sensitive about demanding war compensation for civilian casualties from Japan as it is afraid it could damage already good governmental relations, that include as much as 1.2 trillion yen in loans. A group of delegates to the ongoing National People's Congress, China's rubber stamp parliament, is presently preparing a motion demanding war compensation from Japan, but it is not known whether the central authorities will approve such a document. Their motion calls for an apology by Hosokawa on his visit, the use of yen loans in compensating civilian victims of Japan's war atrocities and the Chinese Government's right in organizing and approving a compensation process. The open letters, obtained by KYODO NEWS SERVICE, make similar demands. The letter from Gao Xiongfei, believed to be in his 50s, asks Hosokawa to apologize and clearly answer demands for compensation from the victims of Japanese atrocities. Gao Mingke's letter recounts an episode of Japanese brutality in Xuzhou in which a dozen of his unarmed relatives were murdered in his house. "We are asking the Japanese Government to compensate the civilian victims and their relatives. It is absolutely justified that we continue to struggle until the Japanese Government offers economic compensation," he writes. With the elder Gao, three others, all in their 70s or 80s, were questioned and taken away after a vehicle they were driving pulled up in front of the Japanese Embassy, witnesses said.
