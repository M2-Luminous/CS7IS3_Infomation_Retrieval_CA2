General Provisions 1. This statute defines the general procedure for the sale of debtor enterprises within the framework of extrajudicial procedures with a view to averting the insolvency (bankruptcy) of state enterprises and creating the conditions for meeting creditors' claims as fully as possible, and it regulates the procedure for the sale of any corporate body engaged in entrepreneurial activity in respect of which a decision has been made, in line with Russian Federation Government Decree No. 498 of 20 May 1994 "On Certain Measures to Implement Acts of Legislation on Insolvency (Bankruptcy)," to deem its balance-sheet structure unsatisfactory and the enterprise (hereinafter the debtor enterprise) insolvent. 2. The sale of debtor enterprises, their assets, and state-owned holdings (stakes, shares) of the aforesaid enterprises' capital is to be carried out on the basis of a decision on their compulsory sale. A decision on compulsory sale may be made: in respect of state-owned debtor enterprises and federally owned holdings (stakes, shares) of debtor enterprises' capital -- by the Russian Federation State Committee for the Management of State Property's Federal Administration for Insolvency (Bankruptcy) (hereinafter, the Federal Administration); in respect of debtor enterprises and holdings (stakes, shares) of the capital of such enterprises that are state-owned by a Russian Federation component -- by the corresponding executive organ in the Russian Federation component, and by the Federal Administration in the event of the relevant powers being delegated to it in respect of the holdings (stakes, shares) of the aforesaid enterprises' capital that are state-owned by the Russian Federation component. 3. The initiative to make the compulsory sale decision can come from the Federal Administration, the debtor enterprise, creditors holding deferred enterprise bonds, the prosecutor, the Russian Federation State Committee for the Management of State Property or its territorial agency (on the basis of the results of an analysis of enterprises' balance sheets in the course of the preparation of privatization documents), other Russian Federation ministries and departments, relevant executive organs in Russian Federation components, and organs of local self-government. 4. When the decision is being made to deem enterprises insolvent and their balance-sheet structure unsatisfactory, the Federal Administration or corresponding Russian Federation component executive organ makes a decision on the question of dismissing the leader of the debtor enterprise as being unsuited to the position held. The de-facto insolvency of an enterprise -- as established on the basis of the results of an analysis of the financial state of the enterprise in accordance with the system of criteria ratified by the Russian Federation Government for determining whether the balance-sheet structure is unsatisfactory, and taking account of the possible repayment of all state debts -- is the basis for establishing the leader's responsibility for an enterprise's insolvency, as defined by Russian Federation Presidential Edict No. 1114 of 2 June 1994 "On the Sale of State Debtor Enterprises." For the purposes of the aforesaid analysis the results of the possible repayment of all state debts are to be evaluated by deducting from the sum total of the amounts owed to the enterprise's creditors a sum equal to the payments in servicing the state debt calculated on the basis of the amounts and due dates of the aforesaid debt, discounted at the Central Bank of the Russian Federation interest rate applicable at the time the debt was incurred. 5. In the event of the enterprise being declared de-facto insolvent, taking account of the possible repayment of all state debts, the Federal Administration or corresponding Russian Federation component executive organ is obliged to adopt a decision on the dismissal of the leader of the debtor enterprise as being unsuited to the position held and to contract out the management of the debtor enterprise -- until it is sold to a new owner -- to a corporation (manager) determined with due consideration for the opinion of the relevant sectoral ministry (department). 6. This contract should stipulate: the compulsory coordination with the Federal Administration, or corresponding Russian Federation component executive organ, of deals concluded on the debtor enterprise's behalf that lead to the enterprise's fixed capital being alienated or burdened with liabilities; a ban on the use of the debtor enterprise's assets to provide the incorporation capital of newly established enterprises and organizations; the manager's material liability for debts incurred by the enterprise after the conclusion of the contract; remuneration for the manager in the amount of the remuneration formerly earned by the leader of the debtor enterprise, plus a share of the profits earned by the debtor enterprise during the management period. Deals done by the manager on the debtor enterprise's behalf in violation of the aforesaid coordination procedure are to be deemed null and void under the established procedure. II. The Sale of Debtor Enterprises 7. The sale of debtor enterprises while retaining their corporate status means the sale of the enterprises' property and also, in full measure, the enterprises' property and personal nonproperty rights, in accordance with the procedure laid down by this statute. The sale of a debtor enterprise is carried out on the basis of a decision of the Federal Administration or corresponding Russian Federation component executive organ which may be made in respect of any debtor enterprises, with the exception of enterprises whose privatization is banned under the State Program for the Privatization of State and Municipal Enterprises in the Russian Federation (hereinafter the State Privatization Program). 8. A debtor enterprise is sold off as a unified property complex including fixed capital, other long-term investments (including nonmaterial assets), circulating capital and financial assets (excluding enterprise property not eligible for sale), liabilities, its property rights, its rights to articles of industrial and intellectual property, tracts of land and other facilities, and its personal nonproperty rights. When a debtor enterprise is sold, it retains the status of a corporate body. 9. Debtor enterprises' property excluded from their property complex during sale include: special-purpose property not eligible for privatization under Russian Federation legislation on privatization; social and municipal facilities (housing stock, children's preschool institutions, and -- by agreement with the corresponding Russian Federation component executive organ or organs of local self-government -- certain social and municipal infrastructure facilities that are vitally important for the region in question). When a debtor enterprise is sold, unfinished construction projects may also be excluded from its property complex. Special-purpose property not eligible for privatization under Russian Federation legislation on privatization is transferred to the enterprise by a special arrangement that envisages state funding and commitments from the parties regarding the operation or mothballing of this property. This agreement is an inalienable part of the contract of sale. Failure by the state to fulfill its state commitments under the agreement ends the enterprise's commitments under the agreement, but does not constitute grounds for terminating (abrogating) the contract of sale. The decision to sell off a debtor enterprise is at the same time a decision to transfer social and municipal facilities to state ownership by a Russian Federation component or to municipal ownership. Unfinished construction projects excluded from the debtor enterprise's property complex are to be sold exclusively at auction for cash, and up to 50 percent of the funds raised from the sale of these facilities is to be remitted to the debtor enterprise and may be used exclusively to meet creditors' claims. In the event of property being excluded from the property complex in the sale of a debtor enterprise, a separate balance sheet is drawn up by the Federal Administration or corresponding Russian Federation component executive organ. 10. The sale of debtor enterprises is transacted by commercial or investment tender with no restriction on the type [sostav] of bidder. The tender may be conducted through open or sealed bids. 11. Any individuals or corporations (including foreign corporations) which are not restricted persons, have submitted documentation in good time, and have under the established procedure paid a deposit (down payment) of 100 percent of the opening price of the enterprise are entitled to participate in the tender. The responsibility for demonstrating the right to take part in the tender and acquire the debtor enterprise lies with the purchaser. Restricted persons are: corporate bodies which are not purchasers under Russian Federation legislation on privatization, or which are subject to restrictions laid down by Russian Federation legislation on the maximum size of the block of shares (stakes, holdings) in another enterprise to be acquired, owned, or administered, or which have an organizational and legal form that does not comply with the RSFSR Law "On Enterprises and Entrepreneurial Activity"; in the sale of a debtor enterprise with a dominant position in its commodity market -- enterprises operating in the same commodity market, as well as corporate bodies and individuals controlling their capital in any form or with an opportunity to exert decisive influence on their decisions, unless they have received the consent of antimonopoly organs to acquire the enterprise. In order to participate in a tender, bidders are to submit, in addition to the documents laid down by Russian Federation legislation on privatization: documents attesting that the bidder is not a restricted person (including -- in the event of the debtor enterprise having a dominant position in the relevant commodity market -- preliminary consent from antimonopoly organs to acquire the enterprise); a certificate attesting that a sum not less than 20 percent of the debtor enterprise's deferred debt to its creditors minus the debtor enterprise's total obligations to the purchaser has been deposited in the vendor's account. No requirement for other documents is permitted during the application to participate in the tender. 12. The following are binding conditions of the tender: the repayment of not less than 20 percent of the debtor enterprise's deferred debt to its creditors within no more than one month of the conclusion of the contract of sale; a commitment to reorganize the debtor enterprise within a month of the conclusion of the contract of sale. The terms of the tender may also include: the continuation of the enterprise's activity in producing certain types of goods (work, services) -- exclusively on the basis of a petition from antimonopoly organs in the event of the debtor enterprise having a dominant position in the corresponding commodity market in respect of the aforesaid goods (work, services); the preservation of the number of jobs -- exclusively on the basis of a petition from the local administration in the event of the debtor enterprise constituting a self-contained urban unit [yavlyayetsya gradoobrazuyushchim]; the amount of investment in the enterprise. This list of tender conditions is exhaustive; no other conditions may be laid down. 13. The opening price of the debtor enterprise in the sale by tender is determined from figures in the accounting documents on the basis of which the Federal Administration adopted the decision to deem the enterprise insolvent and its balance-sheet structure unsatisfactory. The setting of the opening price for the debtor enterprise and consideration of the results of the revaluation after 1 January 1992 of the enterprise's fixed capital are carried out under the procedure laid down by the State Privatization Program. In the event that the opening price set under the aforesaid procedure for the debtor enterprise is less than 100 times the minimum wage laid down by Russian Federation legislation, the opening price for the enterprise shall be set at the equivalent of 100 times the minimum wage. 14. Tenders are to be held in accordance with the procedure laid down by Russian Federation legislation on privatization. In the event of the tender commission receiving a single bid that meets the terms of the tender, the debtor enterprise is to be sold to the sole bidder at the price bid, taking account of the restrictions laid down by this paragraph. If the tender commission receives no bid that meets the terms of the tender, or if the price of the enterprise in the tender falls by more than 30 percent, the tender is declared null and void and the debtor enterprise or its property (assets) are sold off under the procedure laid down by Section III of this statute. 15. A contract of sale is concluded between the vendor and the successful bidder (purchaser) on the basis of the results of the tender under the procedure laid down by Russian Federation legislation on privatization. The vendor is obliged, within three days of the results of the tender, to conclude a contract of sale with the purchaser, to return the deposited funds to the other bidders, and to use the funds deposited by the successful bidder to repay the debtor enterprise's deferred debt to all creditors in proportion to the sums owed. The ownership title is transferred to the purchaser from the moment the contract of sale is concluded. The contract of sale is to be registered with the Russian Federal Property Fund within three days of its being submitted. In the event of the acquired enterprise having deferred debts to its purchaser, this obligation is considered duly discharged and is included in the sum total of the debtor enterprise's repaid deferred debts to its creditors. 16. Funds raised from the sale of debtor enterprises are distributed in accordance with Section V of this statute. 17. The enterprise is deemed to have been transferred to the purchaser from the time the contract of sale is concluded. The purchaser acquires all ownership rights stipulated by civil legislation in respect of the enterprise. The purchaser is obliged to effect the required legal action in reorganizing the debtor enterprise in accordance with Russian Federation legislation within a month of the conclusion of the contract of sale. 18. Decisions on the sale of state-owned debtor enterprises whose privatization is restricted are made under the procedure laid down by the State Privatization Program for the examination of questions of the privatization of facilities and enterprises covered by Sections 2.2-2.4 of the State Privatization Program. A sale can only be banned by the Russian Federation Government in the case of federal state enterprises covered by Sections 2.2 and 2.3 of the State Privatization Program, and by the corresponding Russian Federation component executive organ in the case of state enterprises covered by Section 2.4 of the said program, in the event that a decision has been made to repay the enterprise's deferred debt to its creditors in the form of cash or state short-term bonds (at par) prior to the adoption of the decision to ban the sale of the debtor enterprise. When restrictions on a sale are laid down in the shape of the retention of state ownership of blocks of shares, the debtor enterprise is transformed into an open-type joint-stock company under the procedure laid down by Russian Federation legislation. The transfer of state-owned blocks of shares to the incorporation capital of holding companies is not permitted; the entire remaining non-state-owned block of shares is to be sold off under the procedure laid down by Section IV of this statute. The measures linked with the preparation and adoption of the decisions indicated in this paragraph are implemented by the Federal Administration. III. Sale of Debtor Enterprises' Property (Assets) 19. A liquidated debtor enterprise's property (assets) shall be sold in the event that: the tender for the sale of the debtor enterprise is deemed null and void, or the results of the tender are annulled, and, by agreement with the Russian Federation component executive organs which took part in reaching the decision to sell off the debtor enterprise, no decision is made to repeat the tender; the sale of the debtor enterprise is deemed inexpedient under the procedure laid down by Section II of this statute on the basis of the results of the analysis of the enterprise's financial state carried out by the Federal Administration when adopting the decision to deem the enterprise insolvent and its balance-sheet structure unsatisfactory. The debtor enterprise's property (assets) are sold on the basis of a decision by the Federal Administration or the corresponding Russian Federation component executive organ, which may be made in respect of any debtor enterprises, with the exception of enterprises whose privatization is prohibited under the State Privatization Program. 20. The decision by the Federal Administration or the corresponding Russian Federation component executive organ to liquidate a debtor enterprise and sell off its assets is, under the established procedure, brought to the attention of the enterprise's creditors whose obligations fall due from the moment the aforesaid decision is made. If, within 30 days of the creditors being notified, not a single notification of disagreement with the decision to liquidate the debtor enterprise and sell off its assets has been received by the Federal Administration or the corresponding Russian Federation component executive organ from creditors holding enterprise bonds now due and not covered by the deposit, the aforesaid decision is deemed to have been agreed by all creditors. If, within the aforesaid period, even a single notification of disagreement with the decision to liquidate the debtor enterprise is received by the Federal Administration or the corresponding Russian Federation component executive organ from a creditor holding enterprise bonds now due and not covered by the deposit, the procedures envisaged by this section of the statute are suspended. In the event of the debtor enterprise being federally owned, the Federal Administration, in accordance with the powers vested in it, is obliged to take measures to apply to the court of arbitration to begin insolvency (bankruptcy) proceedings against the enterprise in question. 21. The Federal Administration or corresponding Russian Federation component executive organ forms a liquidation commission to implement the measures to liquidate the debtor enterprise. Specialists in anticrisis management, representatives of the relevant Russian Federation ministries and departments, financial organs, and corresponding Russian Federation component executive organs, and other specialists take part in the liquidation commission's work. Within a month of its formation the liquidation commission submits to the Federal Administration or the corresponding Russian Federation component executive organ a plan to liquidate the debtor enterprise drawn up in accordance with the standard enterprise liquidation plan ratified by the Federal Administration. In the event of the liquidation commission not submitting a plan for the liquidation of a debtor enterprise within the time laid down, the Federal Administration or corresponding Russian Federation component executive organ is entitled to draw up a liquidation plan independently. The plan to liquidate a debtor enterprise should include: the full name of the enterprise, its legal address, and its accounts; information on the size and structure of its assets; information on the financial state of the enterprise and the size and structure of its debts; a list of the measures to collect accounts receivable, to accept or reject creditors' claims, and to protest deals by the enterprise that infringe creditors' interests; a list of social, cultural, municipal, and domestic facilities to be transferred to the state ownership of a Russian Federation component or to municipal ownership; a list of other enterprise property not for sale, and the field in which it is to be used [i napravleniya yego ispolzovaniya]; requirements pertaining to dividing up the liquidated enterprise's property into lots for sale; the method (methods) of sale of the liquidated enterprise's property (property lots), and the opening price; a list of the terms for the sale of the property (property lots); a list of the measures to prevent any negative social consequences stemming from the enterprise's liquidation; the procedure for effecting transactions with creditors and distributing the cash funds remaining after creditors' claims have been met. The plan to liquidate a debtor enterprise is to be accompanied by the enterprise's balance sheet and by a list of creditors indicating the sum total of their claims at the time that the decision is made to deem it insolvent and its balance-sheet structure unsatisfactory. The dividing up of the liquidated debtor enterprise's property into lots for sale is effected in accordance with the statute ratified by the Federal Administration on the basis of priorities relating to retaining those of the enterprise's production structures that manufacture end products that are in demand or that have the potential to convert to the production of such output. 22. The sale of liquidated debtor enterprises' assets (property lots) is effected at auctions and commercial or investment tenders in accordance with the methods laid down by the liquidation plan. Any individuals or corporate bodies (including foreign corporations) that are not restricted persons under Paragraph 11 of this statute and that have submitted the requisite documentation in good time and have paid under the established procedure a deposit (down payment) of 100 percent of the opening price of the property lot are entitled to acquire the assets of a liquidated debtor enterprise. Responsibility for demonstrating the right to acquire a debtor enterprise's assets rests with the purchaser. The sale of debtor enterprise property lots is effected in accordance with the procedures laid down by Russian Federation legislation on privatization for the corresponding methods of privatization. In effecting the aforesaid sales, the lots to be sold cannot be burdened with the liabilities of the liquidated debtor enterprise. Assets of a liquidated debtor enterprise that are not sold off in accordance with the methods laid down by the liquidation plan are to be sold for cash at auction under a procedure defined by the liquidation commission, in which case there will be no restriction on the price at which the aforesaid property can be sold. 23. The contract of sale is concluded between vendor and purchaser on the basis of the results of the sale of each property lot under the procedure laid down by Russian Federation legislation on privatization. Ownership title over acquired property lots is transferred to the purchaser from the moment the contract of sale is concluded. The contract of sale is to be registered by the Russian Federal Property Fund within three days of the funds reaching the vendor's account. 24. Funds raised from the sale of a liquidated debtor enterprise's property, as well as funds raised from collecting accounts receivable and protesting deals by the debtor enterprise that infringe creditors' interests, are placed at the disposal of the liquidation commission and, after deduction of the funds needed to organize the sale of the enterprise's property, are used to implement liquidation measures as well as to meet creditors' claims under the procedure laid down by Russian Federation legislation. The funds remaining are distributed in accordance with Section V of this statute. 25. Not later than 15 days from the conclusion of the sale of the liquidated debtor enterprise's assets the liquidation commission is obliged to submit a liquidation balance sheet to the Federal Administration or corresponding Russian Federation component executive organ for ratification. The ratified liquidation balance sheet is sent to the corresponding enterprise registration organ and constitutes sufficient grounds for removing the debtor enterprise from the state register. IV. The Sale of State-Owned Holdings (Stakes, Shares) in Debtor Enterprises 26. The sale of state-owned holdings (stakes, shares) in the capital of debtor enterprises is effected on the basis of corresponding decisions by the Federal Administration or the corresponding Russian Federation component executive organ in the event that: the entire remaining non-state-owned block of shares in an open-type joint-stock company formed as a result of the transformation of the debtor enterprises in line with Paragraph 18 of this statute is made available for sale; the hitherto state-owned block of shares of an open-type joint-stock company formed in the process of privatization (on the basis of a corresponding decision by the organ adopting the decision to place the aforesaid block under state ownership) as well as unsold blocks of shares in joint-stock companies are being sold; the sale of state-owned holdings (stakes, shares) in other enteprises is being effected. The rules established by this section of the statute apply to state-owned holdings (stakes, shares) in the capital of debtor enterprises irrespective of the size of the aforesaid holdings. 27. In the event that a block of shares in a debtor enterprise was placed under state ownership by an earlier decision of the relevant organ, it will be liable to reduction as follows: when the assigned block of shares comprises over 38 percent of the shares, it is to be reduced to 25.5 percent of the shares, with all the shares thus freed being sold; when the assigned block of shares is equal to or less than 38 percent of the shares, one share out of those assigned is converted into a "Golden Share," with all the shares thus freed being sold. The decision on the sale of state-owned shares in a debtor enterprise terminates the previously established powers of any persons involved in managing the state-owned block of shares. In the event that previously state-owned blocks of shares in a debtor enterprise were placed in trust, the state representative is entitled, according to the established procedure, to demand that the trust contract be abrogated and the trustee called to account as stipulated by the law and the contract, if any one of the factors that led to the enterprise's insolvency was the result of unlawful or incompetent action on his part. Unsold blocks of shares in joint-stock companies formed in the process of privatization, as well as state-owned blocks of shares in open-type joint-stock companies, are subject to sale in their entirety. 28. Holdings (stocks, shares) in the capital of state-owned partnerships and open-type joint-stock companies are subject to sale in their entirety; in this event the tender participants are restricted to persons who have obtained, according to the established procedure, the consent of the remaining participants in the partnership (company) to acquire the aforementioned holding. In the event that a tender is deemed invalid or its results annulled, the competent body is entitled to take measures to define and apportion of state-owned holdings with their subsequent sale under the procedure established by Russian Federation legislation on privatization. 29. The sale of holdings (stocks, shares) mentioned in Section IV of this statute is carried out at an auction conducted in line with the procedure established by Russian Federation legislation on privatization with due account for the requirements of this statute. 30. On the basis of the results of the sale of holdings (stocks, shares) under the procedure established by Russian Federation legislation on privatization, a contract of sale is concluded between the seller and the purchaser. Ownership title to the acquisition of the holdings (stocks, shares) is transferred to the purchaser from the moment that the contract of sale is concluded. 31. Funds earned as a result of holding auctions are distributed in line with Section V of this statute. V. Organs Effecting the Sale of Debtor Enterprises. Use of Funds From the Sale 32. The sale of debtor enterprises, as well as that of property (assets) of debtor enterprises being liquidated, is effected by the relevant property funds or persons authorized by them. 33. The sale of holdings (stocks, shares) in debtor enterprises is effected by the relevant property funds or persons authorized by them. 34. Funds from the sale of debtor enterprises, property (assets) of debtor enterprises being liquidated, and state-owned holdings (stocks, shares) are directed: toward the targeted financing of the maintenance of sociocultural facilities of debtor enterprises being transferred to the state ownership of the relevant Russian Federation component, or into municipal ownership; toward financing measures to revive debtor enterprises and avert the negative social effects of bankruptcies, including social insurance of workers from debtor enterprises, the implementation of measures concerning the crisis management of debtor enterprises, and the training of specialists in crisis management; to organs guaranteeing and implementing the sale of debtor enterprises, their property (assets), and shares (holdings, stocks). At least 50 percent of the said funds are to be used for the express purpose of financing the maintenance of sociocultural facilities. When distributing funds from the sale of unfinished construction projects excluded from the property complex of debtor enterpries, 50 percent of the funds earned from the sale of the said facilities are subject to distribution. The norms for distributing funds earned from the sale of debtor enterprises under federal ownership are established by the Russian Federation Government. The norms for distributing funds earned form the sale of debtor enterprises under the state ownership of Russian Federation components are established autonomously by the Russian Federation components. VI. Concluding Provisions 35. If, at the time of adopting the decision on the compulsory sale of a debtor enterprise which is under federal ownership, the case of the insolvency (bankruptcy) of the said enterprise is being examined in the court of arbitration, the Federal Administraion is obliged to lodge a petition with the court of arbitration on the external management of the property of the debtor enterprise. In the event that the court of arbitration accepts the petition on external management, measures to implement the said decision are to be included in the plan for conducting the external management of the debtor enterprise's property. 36. If proceedings relating to the insolvency (bankruptcy) of an enterprise which is under federal ownership are instituted after the adoption by the Federal Administration of the decision on the compulsory sale of a debtor enterprise, the Federal Administration is obliged to lodge a petition with the court of arbitration on suspending proceedings relating to the insolvency (bankruptcy) of the said enterprise for the period necessary to implement the said decision, but no longer than six months. 37. If need be, the Russian Federation Government may adopt in addition to this statute normative acts on the procedure for the sale of debtor enterprises.
