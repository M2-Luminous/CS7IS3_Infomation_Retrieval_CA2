[Zlenko] The problem of Crimea should not be linked to these negotiations. What we discussed with the Russians was the question of the Black Sea Fleet. On this point, we made progress, but not significant progress. We are in agreement on the partition of the fleet, but there has still been no compromise on the question of bases, despite Ukraine's concessions. We have accepted that the headquarters of the Russian fleet should be in Sevastopol, and that Sevastopol should be a Russian base, but Russia is demanding other bases, which is not acceptable. We are prepared to make arrangements for the location of other port facilities but we do not want to have conditions dictated to us. This is our territory, but we say that this problem absolutely must be solved and that the status of the fleet must be decided once and for all. Second, Russia must force its military to accept the law of the foreign country in which it is based. The fleet must not interfere in Ukraine's internal affairs. [Mandeville] Is it doing so now? [Zlenko] Yes, we think that there was interference in the conflict between Kiev and Simferopol. The statements by the Black Sea Fleet press center are misinformation and increase the risks of provocation in Crimea. We have warned Moscow journalists of this danger. Some are spreading rumors about the arrival of Ukrainian troops, which I refute. The Ukrainian troops which were there are still there, but there are no new ones. [Mandeville] With regard to Crimea, [Russian Foreign Minister] Andrey Kozyrev spoke of the danger of "Yugoslavization." [Zlenko] Parallels of this kind are not appropriate. It is true that there is a risk of provocation, but we will solve this question. It is an internal Ukrainian problem. We will not tolerate any attack on our country's territorial unity, which the 1992 Crimean Constitution calls into question. Calling our territory into question would not only be a danger for the Ukrainians, but for the whole of Europe. Ultranationalist Machinations [Mandeville] There is a debate in Ukraine on the best way of facing the secessionist threats. Some think that the unitarian state should be strengthened, whereas others think that a federal state would make it possible to avoid losing everything... [Zlenko] I do not deny that there are supporters of a federal state in our country. But I think that there is no reason to move in that direction. All the opinion polls prove that this does not interest the population. In my view, this idea is being promoted by some determined circles which are inspired by Russian ultranationalist circles. Their aim is to undermine the Ukrainian state. [Mandeville] It is being said that at the forthcoming presidential election, it will be the man in favor of rapprochement with Russia who will win in Ukraine? [Zlenko] We must not make enemies of Russia and Ukraine. Some people in Moscow, but also in our country, are trying to set us against each other, but Ukraine has never turned away from Russia, it is our neighbor, our history, it is a special partner, the dominant factor in our foreign policy. We must be close while being independent and equal states. The problem is that there is an imperialist syndrome in some Russian political circles, the idea that we will all return to Russia, as before. No! There is a new situation, there is no longer any big brother or little brother. [Mandeville] Do you fear the results of the forthcoming Russian presidential election, the arrival in power of extremists like Rutskoy or Zhirinovskiy? [Zlenko] This danger has been allayed. But the social problem which was their breeding ground remains. It must be remembered that the success of the economic reforms will be decisive. [Mandeville] What conclusion do you draw from the Conference on Stability in Europe? [Zlenko] I welcome this initiative by France. This conference was welcome, because it answered the questions which are worrying our continent. It put a finger on the problem of minorities and borders. It gave a clear warning to those who still cherish the idea of maintaining a divided Europe or putting up new walls between nations. The conference showed that we must think about a strategy for the whole of Europe in order to prevent the return of history's demons.
