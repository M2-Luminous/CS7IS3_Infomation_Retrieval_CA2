Having already won the licence to run a private cellular phone network in Germany, which went commercial in June 1992, Mannesmann has just announced a strategic alliance in the company telecommunications field with number one German bank the Deutsche Bank, and RWE [Rheinisch-Westfaelisches Elektrizitaetswerk], the leading German energy producer. Having posted net losses of 467 million German marks for the first half of 1993, brought on by disastrous results in all sectors, Mannesmann has everything to gain by strengthening its activities in "a new market with growth prospects". In August, the German giant's D2 mobile phone network already boasted 300,000 users, and could pass break-even point next year if it reaches a total of 400,000 subscribers. A joint company, to be held 50% by Mannesmann, with Deutsche Bank and RWE Energie each taking a 25% stake, is likely to be set up early in January 1994 to tap the market for private company telecommunications networks. The new venture will establish a system for the German and the wider European market, comprising voice telephony, and image and date transmission, within a closed network of subscribers. This kind of service would allow, for example, figures to be automatically read off calculators, electronic mail and also financial data to be sent. Germany's deregulated market, likely to represent a turnover running into billions of German marks, is only awaiting approval from the European Commission's competition authorities before it takes off in 1994. Mannesmann has already announced its intention to apply, through subsidiary Mannesmann Eurokom GmbH, for Germany's first licence for data transmission for mobile radio-telephones. Licenses will be required until full deregulation in 1998, and the group is expected to ally itself with powerful and experienced partners to corner this particular market. The consortium will again include Deutsche Bank and the communication network experts from RWE Energie, but also energy firm Schwaben AG [Aktiengesellschaft], the Swedish data radio-telephony experts Telia International, and the French diversified utility company Generale des Eaux. Potential customers in this huge market are not only the obviously mobile transport firms, bus and taxi operators, and security and surveillance services, but also banks and commercial enterprises of all kinds.
