The event was chaired by Pedro Ross Leal, secretary general of the Cuban Workers Federation. It was reported that one of the factors affecting efficiency is the high rate, 37 percent, of foreign matter in the cane supplied by the Osvaldo Herrera facility. The cane sometimes has rocks, chaff, and sprouts in it, which interfere with a good grinding rate when the process has to be stopped to eliminate them. [Begin unidentified speaker recording] Analyzing the economic problems at our factory, as the comrades rightly said: This is a serious one -- because, aside from stable grinding, in order for a mill to be efficient and seek to economize, the other thing that must be kept in mind is the quality of the raw material. We cannot make sugar without quality raw material, cannot make it of good quality, and that (?affects) efficiency. This is the problem of the quality of the raw material that has been confronted here in Cuba for years -- more so in some years than in others. This year, at this mill, that has been significant, because the truth is that the raw material has come from that collection center in very poor condition in terms of the amount of foreign materials. It is true that the management here and the union and the party have met many times. They have held municipal meetings, provincial level meetings, and every possible meeting. Now, (?what should we do)? If we want to repair the economy and be economical and move ahead, after you discuss the same problem twice with the same comrades, you need to take measures: Hello, comrade, I am not going to discuss this with you today; that amount of foreign matter must be reduced. I will come back tomorrow to discuss it. Perhaps they may discuss it a third time, but the fourth time we have to take urgent measures: Well, buddy, I am sending the cane back. I am returning it. Clean it up and when you bring it here clean, I will grind it. Why? Because then, we begin to argue that the (?raw material) is bad but no measures are taken. Thus, those comrades believe that things will always go that way, that people will just talk, and then this is what happens. I think that in order to be efficient, aside from any discussions there may be, concrete measures must be taken with the comrades who are committing the violations; otherwise they become habitual. A time comes when they get used to the [word indistinct], to hearing us, or whatever comrades go there, say to them: That is not right. However, since they know things are not going to go any further, they know that...[rephrases] perhaps they have become accustomed to the idea that no measures are going to be taken, so they continue doing it and we continue receiving it. We reach a point where, by having accepted it from them, and by [word indistinct] we are committing the same mistake, the same sin against the economy. [end recording] At the workers assembly held at the Efrain Alfonso CAI, Pedro Ross Leal expressed interest in the situation at the complex as regards outstanding accounts from other organizations; he explained the significance of not complying with this indicator, and its significance to the national economy. The workers also advocated the expeditious arrival of cane to the mill, which at times takes over 36 hours. This reduces its quality and results in less sugar. Strong statements were made about the causes, consequences, and possible measures to be taken to solve the national financial imbalance. Debate focused on the all-out war against the black market, the lack of control, and the pilfering of resources from state organizations. Likewise, the workers supported the confiscation of goods attained illegally, and deregulating and increasing prices of nonessential products, among other issues which will help to streamline national finances.
