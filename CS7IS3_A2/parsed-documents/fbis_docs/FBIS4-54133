He said: Many developing countries including our country strongly urged that the international community should take it as their first and foremost goal to comprehensively and totally eliminate the existing nuclear weapons within a certain period through universal and non- discriminatory multilateral negotiations and treaty and that the nuclear weapon states should carry out nuclear disarmament. By contrast, the United States and other Western countries persisted in their old position that emphasis should be placed on the strengthening of the nuclear nonproliferation system in the present stage and, to this end, the role of the UN Security Council should be enhanced. The "guideline" and "recommendations" on nuclear disarmament worked out and submitted by the Western countries, focussing on the nuclear nonproliferation issue, could not be passed due to the opposition of the developing countries. The position taken by the developing countries at the meeting was a very justifiable one conforming to the aspirations of the world people to see our planet free from nuclear weapons and live in peace. The process of the meeting made it all the clearer that there is no change in the ambition of the United States and other Western countries to maintain their nuclear monopoly and turn the world round its finger. With the Cold War having come to an end, the existence of nuclear weapons cannot be justified on any account. Therefore, a significant measure for the total abolition of the existing nuclear weapons must be taken and the discriminative nature of the nonproliferation treaty be removed. The United States and other Western countries, however, resort to trite threat and pressure against the non-nuclear states including the DPRK under an unreasonable pretext while failing to do what they must do. While raising a hue and cry over the fictitious "nuclear suspicion" against the DPRK, they pretend to be ignorant of the real threat of nuclear armament such as the recently discovered concealment of 70 kg of plutonium in Japan. This can be said to be the culmination of the application of a double standard. The problem will not be solved any time, if the United States and other Western countries continue to apply the double standard in the nuclear issue, refusing to accept the just demand of the developing countries for the total abolition of nuclear weapons and the removal of the discriminative nature of the NPT at a time when the extension of the validity of the NPT is being discussed.
