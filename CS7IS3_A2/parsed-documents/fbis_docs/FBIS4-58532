FBIS4-58532 "drnes087_o_94001" FBIS-NES-94-087 Daily Report 5 May 1994 SYRIA Newspapers Voice Discontent With 'Arafat Moves Newspapers Voice Discontent With 'Arafat Moves JN0505084494 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0445 GMT 5 May 94 JN0505084494 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [From the press review] [Text] Under the headline "An Agreement That Bestows Legitimacy on Occupation," the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: Yasir 'Arafat signed a new agreement with Yitzhaq Rabin yesterday as an extension of the Oslo agreement that was secretly negotiated outside the Washington peace talks and without the participation of most Palestinian leaders in and outside of the PLO. We do not know how many subsequent agreements will be signed and presented to the people. AL-BA'TH adds: Anyone who saw the huge notebooks signed by 'Arafat and compared their size to their miserable contents will say: What revolution until victory has 'Arafat led toward a besieged Gaza Strip and a small detention camp, which is at Israel's disposal and which is called Jericho? Anyone who contemplates the role played by 'Arafat when he refrained from signing, and then signed with head held low and without the usual signal of victory, will be overwhelmed with regret and sorrow. The paper says that in view of these negative indicators, any agreement not supported by the people will lose its value, its seriousness, and its strength, and ultimately face a known fate. What has happened between the PLO and the Israeli Government is not in the interest of the Palestinian people. Practical experience shows this agreement will not push the peace process toward its objectives, represented by establishing peace, regaining rights, and safeguarding the interests of all parties. AL-BA'TH stresses that Syria seeks a just and comprehensive peace. Syria has never accepted, and will not accept, separate and incomplete solutions. The paper points out that we, in Syria, have cooperated, and will continue to cooperate, for the sake of such peace. It emphasizes that a just and comprehensive solution will achieve a durable peace, saying that any agreement that is not accepted by peoples, that does not secure peoples' national interests, and that is not in line with the resolutions of international legitimacy cannot bear the seeds of its own life. This is because the will of peoples will triumph at the end. Concluding, AL-BA'TH says: The Palestinian people, who are known for their struggle and sacrifices, will continue to express themselves and achieve their objectives regardless of dark days and hard circumstances. Under the headline "The General Mourning," the newspaper TISHRIN says: It is very clear that the Gaza-Jericho agreement and its signature are not a step on the path of peace. This agreement places new obstacles before the peace process, and removes from Israel a heavy burden as a result of the escalating and continuing intifadah. This was explained by the fact that many Israeli officials acknowledged that this agreement secured a partner for Israel and its security, and that a security alliance was established between the PLO and Israel to confront and end the intifadah. TISHRIN explains: By showing firm, broad, and angry rejection of the self-rule agreement, the Palestinian people are reiterating their insistence on toppling this agreement and are showing that they will never relinquish their objectives for which the tumultuous intifadah was unleashed in order to totally remove the occupation from the occupied Palestinian territories. The paper emphasizes that the Palestinian people are aware that any partial solutions, phased settlements, and separated deals can only be in favor of both Israel and its occupation and will not be in favor of Palestinian national rights. Concluding, TISHRIN says: All facts point out that the anger that prevailed in the occupied Arab territories when 'Arafat signed the liquidation of the Palestine question was the strongest proof that Israel has dragged the Palestinian side into a situation with grave consequences and into further concessions. These concessions began in Oslo, then continued, and recently ended in a fragile agreement not in the interest of the peace process. This agreement gives Israel many gains, and turns the Palestinian police into tools to guard both the occupation and the settlements.
