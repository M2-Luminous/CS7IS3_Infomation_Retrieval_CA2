[quotation marks as received] The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps head said, "Political wisdom asks us not to go for weapons which could cause devastation for humanity." "Of course, we are for traditional weapons and that too just for self-defense...and that's all," he said. The eight-year Iraqi imposed war is proof of the real nature of our combatants who never violated the internationally recognized norms concerning war Major Gen. Reza'i recalled. He was referring to the Iraqi forces who left no stone unturned violating the basic tradition of war using chemical bombs against both civilians and military personnel. The Iraqi forces also frequently bombed purely civilians areas during their 1980-88 imposed war. "That Iran is trying to acquire nuclear weapons...is just baseless rumor," Reza'i refuted. Western media repeatedly say Iran will or has already provided the necessary facilities to Communist North Korea for testing missiles with ranges up to 1,000 kilometers. What is Reza'i's explanation? "No, a firm no," Major Gen. Reza'i told the TEHRAN TIMES in an exclusive interview at his office. "By now the entire world should know that Iran is very sensitive as far as our soil and military facilities are concerned and we will never allow others to use it...no matter how friendly `others' are," he said referring to the friendly ties with North Korea. "As long as I'm talking about the real nature of the Islamic combatants and the officials of the Islamic Republic, it will not be out of place to mention the Russian requests which Iran turned down without a second thought," Reza'i, 41, said. "Despite our animosity and enmity against the United States we rejected repeated requests from Moscow to deliver to them the F-14 fighter plane and the wire-guided anti-tank missile, TOW," he said. He disclosed that even the U.S. through various channels tried to obtain a Soviet-made T-72 tank which we seized from the Ba'thist forces during the Iraqi-imposed war. The United States once more received 'a firm no' from the Islamic Republic despite a number of tempting offers from the Pentagon, he said. Maj. Gen. Reza'i, head the IRGC for the last 13 years, comes from Masjed Soleyman, Khuzestan Province. In answer to another question, Reza'i said the Kuridish problem in Iraq is under our observation and our forces are ready to counter any sort of terrorist activities launched from there. Referring to the agreement signed by Iran and Turkey he said, "It has eased the situation." He denounced Iraq for sending terrorists and taking undue advantage from the present situation in the region underlining the fact that that itself was a violation of the 1988 ceasefire and against the traditional practice of friendly neighbors. Reza'i is married with five children and currently studying economics at the post-graduate level. He has a glorious record of revolutionary activities against the now defunct Shah's regime. Commenting on the Persian Gulf he said, "The geographical situation of the waterway is such that the deep water is on Iran's side which enables the Islamic forces to keep alien warships under observation." Without going into details he said there was a plot engineered by Britain, Israel and the United States designed to keep regional tensions high. "I think," he said, "the plot proved to be a mouse trap for the United States. "It's my view that no country should think that they can take undue advantage from the differences between Iran and another Persian Gulf country," he warned. He pointed out that the Iraqi regime made the same mistake in 1980 and "we all know the consequences of that." "I tell my friends in the UAE to listen to my advice as Iran wants to continue friendly relations with all the shaykhdoms there," Reza'i said. The IRGC played a vital role during the Iraqi-imposed war and received compliments from the Leader of the world's deprived, the late Imam Khomeyni. Commenting on the post-war era Reza'i said the IRGC is busy with extensive construction projects in the country. He said IRGC personnel, popularly known in Iran as 'Sepahis,' are constructing a major dam, Karkheh, in Khuzestan Province. For the last two years, the Sepahis have been building the dam which is 3 kilometers long, 150 meters high with a capacity of 7 billion cubic meters of water. So far Rls. 600 billion have been spent on the project and it is estimated that Rls. 1 trillion will be spent before it is completed. The IRGC personnel are also working on the 100-kilometer Tehran- Saveh highway to provide a natural gas supply network for the nation.
