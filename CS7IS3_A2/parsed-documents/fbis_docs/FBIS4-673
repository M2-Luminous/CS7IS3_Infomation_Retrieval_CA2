W. de Klerk says he hopes for a speedy agreement on the guidelines for mediation between the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and the ANC. He was addressing a news conference on the latest crisis in Pretoria at the end of what could be the last cabinet meeting. [Begin recording] [De Klerk, in English] We can, through this mediation effort, move towards agreements which have escaped us for a very long time. We would like to see such agreements, and we instructed our delegation not to be technical, but to ensure that agreement is reached which will make successful mediation possible. [Correspondent Ronel van Zyl] He said the cabinet has discussed proposals by the working group which is examining the position of the Zulu monarchy and found them to be acceptable. President de Klerk said the government has some criticism of the proposals, but believes the solution to the problem could be contained in some of them. Referring to the postponement of the election date, President de Klerk said he saw no reason which could justify such a move at this point. [De Klerk, in English] I sincerely believe that it is in the best interests of all South Africans, also of all the people of kwaZulu-Natal, that the elections take place on the scheduled date. But nobody can prevent any leader to put the question in negotiation on the agenda, and in a true spirit of negotiation, I'm always willing to listen to arguments of anybody, and to interact on the basis of such arguments. [Van Zyl] President de Klerk said strikes are causing increasing problems, particularly in the former self-governing territories and independent states. He welcomed efforts by the Transitional Executive Council to play a role in the prevention of such strikes. [end recording]
