It is the firm's first office in China, and the 63rd overseas investment bank in Beijing. Set up in 1869, the firm is a New York-based private partnership and it is a leading, full-service international investment banking and securities firm. Goldman Sachs has 148 partners and about 8,200 employees located in offices in 30 major cities worldwide. Henry Paulson, a partner of Goldman and member of the firm's management committee, said that one of the focuses of the business is on Asia. He said that the reason why his firm invested great sums in China was its belief that China's economy and its financial market will be one of the important parts of the global economy. Peter Wheeler, the firm's Beijing chief representative, said that in 1993, Goldman Sachs acted as lead or co-lead manager in 11 bond issues for Chinese companies, totalling 2 billion U.S. dollars in Europe, the United States and Asia. Early this year, the firm was a co-lead manager for China's global bond offering of 1 billion U.S. dollars. With the improvement of the investment environment in China, more overseas banks have entered China's market. Now about 100 overseas banks from more than 20 countries have set up branches or offices in China.
