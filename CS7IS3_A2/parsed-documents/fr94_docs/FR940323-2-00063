ACTION: Addendum to control techniques guidelines (CTG) document. SUMMARY: This notice establishes adoption and implementation dates for reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules based on a CTG published on November 15, 1993, for reactor processes and distillation operations in the synthetic organic chemical manufacturing industry. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. William L. Johnson, Air Quality Management Division (MD&hyph;15), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, telephone (919) 541&hyph;5245. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 182(b)(2) of the Clean Air Act (Act) requires that States shall submit a revision to the applicable implementation plan to include provisions to require the implementation of RACT for each category of VOC sources in the area covered by a CTG document issued by the Administrator after enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. This revision shall be submitted within the period set forth by the Administrator in the relevant CTG document. This time table for States to submit RACT rules is further described in section IV of appendix E, General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (57 FR 18077). A CTG document for control of volatile organic compound (VOC) process vent emissions from synthetic organic chemical manufacturing industry reactor processes and distillation operations was made available to the public through a Federal Register notice published on November 15, 1993 (58 FR 60197). Today's notice establishes the adoption and implementation dates for RACT rules required to be developed in response to this CTG. Any State which has not adopted an approvable RACT rule for the sources covered by this CTG must submit a RACT rule for these sources before March 23, 1995. Furthermore, States must provide for sources to install and operate the required control devices or implement the required procedures under these RACT rules no later than November 15, 1996. Dated: March 17, 1994. Mary Nichols, Assistant Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;6832 Filed 3&hyph;22&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P
