During talks with the Chinese foreign minister, Qian Qichen, at his office, Prime Minister Tamirat said China, which has long years of experience in modern rural agricultural development, could certainly share its experience with Ethiopian farmers to change their backward system of agricultural production. Prime Minister Tamirat and the Chinese foreign minister extensively discussed possible ways of further cementing existing bilateral ties between Ethiopia and the Republic of China as well as on broadening new areas of economic and technical cooperation. Prime Minister Tamirat appraised the Chinese deputy premier of the objective situation in the country and Ethiopia's efforts for peace and stability in the subregion. The Chinese foreign minister told the Ethiopian premier that China, which maintains a 20-year technical cooperation agreement with Ethiopia, will do its level best to further strengthen the historical relations of the two friendly countries and particularly to develop and promote the agricultural economy of the country.
