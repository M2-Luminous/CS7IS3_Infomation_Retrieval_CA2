"The President is firmly resolved to reach this goal," a high-ranking Russian diplomat told Interfax. According to him, "there is no logic in conducting the ceremony of farewell to the Western allies in Berlin, a city conquered by Soviet troops, and saying farewell to the Russians in Weimar, a city conquered by the allied troops." As he said, "the striving to say farewell to the Russians in Weimar, where no Reichstag was stormed and no victory banner was hoisted, reflects the desire to erase from the memory of the Germans some history chapters, particularly the quadrilateral allied responsibility for Germany." The issue of Russia's Kaliningrad Region may also be discussed during President Yeltsin's visit to Germany, the diplomat said. "This may take place during his confidential conversation with Chancellor Helmut Kohl," he said. Moscow's attitude to Kaliningrad and Kaliningrad Region remains unchanged, Interfax's interviewee stressed. "This is Russian land, and we shall surrender it to no one," he pointed out. According to Interfax's interviewee, "some circles in Germany are trying to kindle the issue concerning Kaliningrad's status in the hope that in the future it will become possible to raise it officially." "There will be no such possibility," he stressed. The diplomat spoke in favor of "levelling up" ties between Kaliningrad Region and Germany. "It's clear that Germany, because of its economic might at least, will be ahead of Sweden or, say, Lithuania in trade with Kaliningrad Region. However, in terms of economic cooperation, Kaliningrad Region must not and will not be oriented solely to Germany," he noted.
