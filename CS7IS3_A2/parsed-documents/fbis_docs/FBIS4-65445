Saxony's Republikaner chief Guenter Bernard added his comments on market economy: "A system of money and crooks." Franz Schoenhuber, federal chairman of the right-wing extremist Republikaner, is sending his men to catch votes in the east with anticapitalist statements. The targets are the typical losers in the change: people over 50, whom unification deprived of their jobs and their firm view of the world. Old cadres are supposed to build the bridges for the right-wing extremists. Saxony's Republikaner chief Bernard is using familiar vocabulary in his efforts. In the time of the GDR the professor of sociology taught in the "Scientific Communism" section in Leipzig and kept his colleagues toeing the party line as party secretary of the SED [Socialist Unity Party of Germany]. Brandenburg's Wolfgang Kurzweg was also an SED official. The professor was the head of the central Animal Hygiene Institute in Eberswalde -- there party membership was compulsory. Kurzweg's career as a Republikaner was controlled by the headquarters in Bonn. "A high-ranking member of the party leadership" asked him to take over the land chairmanship. "They saw that I had experience with administration and leadership." And good connections with the clients. In the east, Schoenhuber is wooing the same potential voters as the Party of Democratic Socialism: "People who do not agree with reunification as it is," as Kurzweg describes them. Schoenhuber has been wooing party cadres and National People's Army [NVA] soldiers right from the beginning of his expansion toward the east, "where many things have remained more German than in the satiated and gluttonous west." SED Professor Kurzweg is helped by his deputy, NVA Colonel Hermann Flemming. In Saxony, Republikaner chief Bernard is proud of the former NVA officers, who now serve in the Bundeswehr. With great pleasure Berlin's Republikaner chairman Werner Mueller, a former government official of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, also points "to several former GDR officers." Schoenhuber's troop in Thuringia is headed by former SED official Goetz Rudloff. Schoenhuber's wooing of the red socks has had little result. The comrades in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania are now investigating Land Manager Juergen Zedler, who is suspected of having cooperated with the Stasi. Only 3,440 of the 24,000 Republikaner members come from the new laender. And in Leipzig the red-brown socks may not even run for local elections: They did not get the 360 signatures necessary.
