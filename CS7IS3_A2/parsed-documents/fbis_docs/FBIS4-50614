FBIS4-50614 "drchi097_w_94003" FBIS-CHI-94-097 Daily Report 19 May 1994 HONG KONG & MACAO Hong Kong Movie `Should Not Be Shown' Without Clearance Movie `Should Not Be Shown' Without Clearance HK1905074294 Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST in English 19 May 94 p 15 HK1905074294 Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST English BFN [By Agatha Ngai] [Text] The internationally-acclaimed director Zhang Yimou's banned movie Huozhuo should not be shown in Hong Kong unless local distributors obtain clearance from the Chinese authorities, a local Chinese official warned yesterday. Speaking at a function to promote next year's film festival in Shanghai, Cui Songming, the deputy head of the cultural and sports department of the Xinhua (New China News Agency) office in Hong Kong, said approval from China's Ministry of Radio, Film and Television was needed before the movie could be shown. "There was always a clear requirement in China that any movies, including those whose post-production was done in the mainland, should be censored by the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television." He said Hong Kong movie-makers should respect China's system and follow the procedures when they went to the mainland to make movies as a realisation of the "one country, two systems" principle. "If the related parties decide to film the movie (without passing the censorship in China) arbitrarily, it will no doubt cause disturbances between two places," he said. The deputy head also used the movie, Farewell, My Concubine, as an example of how local producers had taken advantage of the "confusion" in China and screened the movie in Hong Kong without Beijing's approval. When asked about director Zhang's absence from the Cannes film festival as a protest against the censorship of his film, Mr Cui said: "You may say the Government is tightening its policy on film. But, I think, it's necessary to rectify the discipline in the cultural industry. "It's usual for a country to have some internal regulations. I don't think the move will discourage film-makers from coming to China." He said artists should not feel concerned by the controls. Mr Cui said each movie's script should be censored before the actual production began, and artists would not run into any problems if directors followed the censored copy. Huozhou, a top contender at the Cannes film festival, tells the story of three generations of a family living through the China of the 1940s, 50s and 60s, including the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. Sources said although the film itself carried no political message, the authorities were not happy with its depiction of the various political campaigns in China. A local artist who has expressed an interest in the local distribution of Huozhuo said yesterday a copy of the movie would be submitted to local censors and he hoped permission to screen the movie would soon be obtained. But the artist did not want to comment on the Xinhua official's statement, saying the whole process was at a "preliminary stage". Speaking at the same promotion yesterday, mainland director Xie Jin said the recent tightening of China's art policy had had little effect on his works. The president of the Shanghai School of Performance said it was normal practice for a mainland production to apply for a censor visa from the Government. "I don't think the procedures will affect film-makers' creativity."
