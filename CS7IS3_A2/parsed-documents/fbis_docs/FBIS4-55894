"Our appearance on the Croatian political scene restores belief in democracy in Croatia," Croatian Parliament President Stjepan Mesic stated in his opening speech (VJESNIK; SLOBODNA DALMACIJA). Explaining the establishment of the new party, he added: "The HND has appeared on the Croatian stage because of a crisis that has afflicted the process of democratization of Croatian society and the system of governing by the ruling party and the Croatian state." According to SLOBODNA DALMACIJA, Mesic said that a "rift" had occurred at the Second Assembly of the HDZ in October 1993 and that advocates of a "military approach to the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina" and of "authoritarian rule," who sought to limit democracy in Croatia, had prevailed. Under conditions of war, VJESNIK cites Mesic as stating, "one could and had to tolerate authoritarian rule over state affairs from a single center," but now everyone was asking for democratization. Listed below are the goals and policies of the HND that Mesic laid out in his speech, as reported in the VJESNIK and SLOBODNA DALMACIJA accounts: - Separation of power into three branches of government; - Freedom of the media; - Protection of minorities and respect for human rights; - Majority rule and a Western-style parliamentary system; - Decentralization of power through the strengthening of local administration and self-management to "promote regional particularism"; - Integration of Croatia into European "trends"; - Promotion of peace; - Unchangeability of borders; - Decrease in the level of armaments in the area; - Support of Bosnia-Herzegovina's integrity and the Washington agreement establishing the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation; - Rejection of Serbia's right to intervene in the "so-called krajina" issue and cooperation with Serbia only after its recognition of Croatia within its internationally recognized borders; - Closer relations with Slovenia; - Taking into account "Montenegro's individuality"; - Development of relations with Islamic, nonaligned, and Mediterranean countries; - Denationalization; - Rapid privatization; - Decreased state influence on the economy and free enterprise; - Restoration of the dignity of peasants; - Social welfare and care for refugees and war invalids; and - A modern educational system. SLOBODNA DALMACIJA reported that Mesic was elected HND president, receiving 191 of a possible 197 votes, and that Josip Manolic, Tomislav Duka, Slavko Degoricija, Perica Juric, and Dragutin Hlad were elected vice presidents. Darko Hrastovec was elected the party's secretary. The following persons were elected to the HND Presidency: Stanislav Pavic, Pero Kriste, Romano Bolkovic, Leticija Drndic-Antolic, Andjelko Sikiric, Dalibor Kovacevic, Emanuel Justament, Ante Sare, and Josip Zebic. A 15-member Executive Council and a 5-member Supervisory Council were also elected. After the founding meeting, SLOBODNA DALMACIJA reported, the HND leaders held a news conference. Stipe Mesic refused to answer a question about how many members the new party had, explaining that "the people are going through the wringer, and great pressure is being exerted on them." When journalists pressed for information on what kinds of pressures were involved and on whom they were being exerted, Josip Manolic responded that "people were summoned during the night for talks with the president, during which there were offers and a few threats." Manolic stated that the HND was already the second-largest opposition party in the Assembly, adding that "differentiation" with the HDZ had just begun and will last until the disintegration of the HDZ, the abolition of the "one-man monopoly," and the establishment of a political monitoring of the government by the opposition. In reply to numerous questions about the HND's support for increased regionalization, Mesic said that the new party advocates such plans when they are responsive to regional individuality and needs. Slavko Degoricija maintained that the territorial division of Croatia into 22 counties was artificial and that, historically, it would be more justified to set up eight to nine regions and to develop regionalism that would contribute to the integrity of Croatia. The VJESNIK account of the news conference reported that Croatian Assembly deputies who had joined the HND said they did not intend to give up their Assembly seats. VJESNIK also noted that Mesic stressed that the balance of power in the Assembly with regard to Croatia's Bosnia-Herzegovina policy had been altered by the establishment of the HND. In contrast to what he claimed was Tudjman's policy of partitioning Bosnia between Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Mesic supported an integral Bosnia-Herzegovina.
