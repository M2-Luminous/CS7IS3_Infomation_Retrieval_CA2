According to this report, for the first time in many years, there has been no increase in per capita income in Pakistan. The export situation is also the same. Foreign exchange reserves have been reduced dramatically and prices have increased rapidly. The report further added that no increase was seen in collection of taxes as indicated by the GDP. The public sector established a record in borrowing. The State Bank also declared the present rate of inflation to be wrong. The report issued by the State Bank presents to us a very serious picture of our country's economy. There are two major reasons for it. First is natural catastrophes and the second is political uncertainty and confrontations. There is no doubt that heavy rains and floods seriously damaged standing crops and harmed the basic structure and personal property in most areas. Cotton, rice, and sugar cane crops were ruined as the result of it. After continuous increase in our agriculture, this year we faced reduction for the first time. Thirty percent of our cotton production was destroyed by floods. Since exports depend on cotton and cotton products, there has been no increase in exports which Pakistan needs badly. Another major reason for decline in exports is the unsuitable situation abroad. Market slump around the world, change in trade rules, and the negative affects of stiff competition in the international market have all influenced the exports. It is important to pay immediate attention to these problems. Heavy rains and floods have affected our basic economic structure in addition to damaging crops, which in turn directly affect industrial production. Improved basic economic structure is important for establishing new industries. Unfortunately, the basic structure did not improve, instead, it hurt the present services. This also needs immediate attention. One major reason for our economic woes is said to be political uncertainty. The truth is that there was irreparable damage to our country because of the confrontation between the president and the prime minister. Not only were the plans already being implemented affected adversely, but foreign investors were also discouraged. Our politicians should learn from the bitter experiences of the past and give up the politics of confrontation. They should find solutions to all controversial issues through negotiation and understanding. As for the increase in inflation and prices, it appears the independent economic experts do not find it easy to agree with the figures released by the government. Repeatedly, we have also expressed concern about inflation and increasing prices in these columns. The main reasons for this are the wrong economic policies. The basic reasons for inflation and price increases are the unchecked spread of currency notes, decrease in cuts in government spending, budget deficit, unchecked increase in unproductive expenses, and the public sector's borrowing money from banks just to meet routine expenses. This is not only harming our economic system, but also affecting the rate of savings and investments. The State Bank has also proposed an action program to improve the economy in its report to the government. It asks to reduce inflation, federal budget deficit, and proliferation of currency. International economic organizations have been putting pressure on Pakistan in this area. It is a relief to know that the newly elected government is giving priority to it. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has more than once declared her plans to reduce inflation, budget deficit, and unproductive expenses. She had also made some progress in this respect during her first government. Let us hope that concrete steps will be taken to rectify the problems identified in the State Bank report and the suggested plans are implemented to speed up our economic development.
