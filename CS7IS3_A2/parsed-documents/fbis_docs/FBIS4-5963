FBIS4-5963 "dreas074_h_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-074 Daily Report 16 Apr 1994 Brunei, Malaysia & Singapore Malaysia Iraqi Foreign Minister on Three-day Visit Iraqi Foreign Minister on Three-day Visit Holds News Conference JN1704065994 Baghdad INA in Arabic 2045 GMT 16 Apr 94 JN1704065994 Baghdad INA Arabic BFN [Text] Kuala Lumpur, 16 Apr (INA)--Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf has stressed the need to implement Paragraph 22 of UN Security Council Resolution 687 providing for allowing Iraqi exports to the world after Iraq has honored its obligations in accordance with relevant UN resolutions. Al-Sahhaf, currently on an official visit to Malaysia, explained, in a news conference at the Iraqi Embassy in Kuala Lumpur yesterday, that the aim of his visit is to brief Malaysian officials on the latest developments in the relations between Iraq and the UN Security Council, the effects of the continued unjust blockade imposed on Iraq since 6 August 1990, and Iraq's implementation of UN Security Council resolutions. Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf said that Iraq's compliance with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions has obviously confused the UN Security Council. Evidence of this is that a majority of the permanent members states--such as China, France, and Russia--as well as nonpermanent member states are demanding that the economic blockade be lifted as soon as possible and that an appropriate timetable be set. Asked about the extent of damage caused by the 30-state aggression, the minister explained that during the U.S.-led aggression, approximately 107,000 tonnes of explosives were dropped on Iraq, equal to six nuclear bombs similar to the type used by the U.S. forces to bomb Hiroshima at the end of World War II. The minister said that all these explosives were dropped on Iraq's cities and on its civilian and services facilities, thus causing interruptions in civilian services, especially in the health, sanitary, and agricultural fields. As a result, he said, there has been a big increase in the mortality rate among children and the elderly.
