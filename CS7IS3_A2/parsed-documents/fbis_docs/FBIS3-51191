Presidential candidates for the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), National Action Party (PAN), and the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) viewed the announcement of an Armed Forces unilateral truce with satisfaction. Luis Donaldo Colosio, PRI presidential candidate in the upcoming August elections, stressed that what is important at this moment is that the Indians' human rights and lives be respected. In an allusion to Chiapas, he also hoped "that this cease-fire will be permanent so that we can find peaceful solutions to the problems that afflict this area that is so dear to Mexicans." PRD presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas said that the cease-fire is only the first step that should be taken to reestablish peace and recommended that both sides "confine to quarters" their troops to achieve conditions for dialogue. "What should be done now is to declare amnesty for everyone, release prisoners, guarantee medical attention for the wounded, and appoint a governor who has the backing and consensus of the people of Chiapas," added Cardenas. The unilateral truce announcement was, according to Cardenas, the result of pressure exerted by various sectors of society that had demanded a rapid political solution to the conflict. PAN (the country's second electoral force) presidential candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos believes that Salinas de Gortari has made a "sensible decision," a decision that all political groups agreed with from the beginning. Likewise, he wants conditions rapidly established that will solve the root cause of the insurrection, such as attention to the historical problems of the area and many others "where bullets have not talked." Fernandez de Cevallos called on his electoral rivals to "abstain from actions and behavior that in some way could imply opportunism or be offensive to the people of Chiapas and society in general." The Permanent Agrarian Congress, which groups together 11 peasant organizations, gave its support to the president's decision and defined it as "a firm step to attain peace." Saul Gonzalez, chairman of the Grand Commission of the Senate, believes that the dialogue between the insurgent Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) and the government will have to take place under conditions of equality and flexibility. In addition, he said, the bases should be laid so that the rebels can reenter national political life with the political party that best responds to their beliefs. Political expert Pablo Gonzalez Casanova said that it is a mistake to think that the Chiapas conflict can be resolved in the short term, although he believes that the government decreed cease- fire is a positive event in the search of peace. Gonzalez, who is in Ocosingo, one of the villages most affected by the clashes, said that the recent cabinet changes show that at last there have been deeds rather than words in Mexico. Monday's government changes included the dismissal of Government Secretary Patrocinio Gonzalez Blanco and the appointment of Manuel Camacho Solis, up to now foreign secretary, to the post of peace and reconciliation commissioner to Chiapas. According to various analysts, President Salinas de Gortari's decision to decree a cease-fire is the first concrete step to act politically in the Chiapas armed conflict, abandoning the military option after proving its uselessness in resolving the crisis.
