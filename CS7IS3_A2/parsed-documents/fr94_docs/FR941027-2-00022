FR941027-2-00022 FR941027-2-00013 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) To Clean Out and Deactivate the Hanford, Washington Plutonium Finishing Plant (PFP) Complex (Except for Storage Areas), To Stabilize PFP Plutonium-Bearing Materials and To Store the Stabilized Material AGENCY: Department of Energy (DOE). ACTION: Notice of Intent (NOI). SUMMARY: DOE announces its intent to prepare an EIS pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq. ) in accordance with the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508) and the DOE implementing procedures (10 CFR part 1021). DOE invites public comment and will conduct a series of public scoping meetings to provide an opportunity for the public and interested agencies to comment on the alternatives and the scope of issues to be addressed in the EIS. The proposed action would clean out inactive PFP complex facilities (except for storage areas), stabilize reactive residual plutonium-bearing materials to a form suitable for long term storage, and store the stabilized material until DOE makes final storage and disposition decisions. The proposed action would minimize safety concerns, reduce the exposure of site workers to radiation, and reduce the risk to the public. Upon completion of the action, the PFP-complex would be deactivated to a state ready for potential decontamination and dismantlement (D&D) and/or potential future uses. Additional NEPA documentation will be prepared by DOE before any decision is made to D&D the PFP and/or to use it for other purposes. At this time, no future missions beyond continued vault storage have been identified for the PFP-complex. Future production of plutonium for defense purposes is not being proposed and is not part of Hanford's current mission. Existing vault storage of nuclear materials would continue pending future NEPA documentation and a DOE decision on the ultimate storage or disposition of the materials; on June 21, 1994, DOE issued a NOI to prepare a programmatic EIS on the storage and disposition of weapons-usable fissile materials. DATES: DOE invites all interested parties, including affected Federal, State and local agencies, Indian Nations, and the general public to submit comments or suggestions concerning the scope of the issues to be addressed, alternatives to be analyzed, and the environmental impacts to be assessed in the Plutonium Finishing Plant Cleanout EIS by December 12, 1994. To ensure that all relevant environmental issues are considered, the public, agencies, and organizations are also invited to attend public scoping workshops in which oral and written comments will be welcomed on the proposed PFP EIS. Oral and written comments will be given equal weight in the scoping process. Written comments must be postmarked by December 12, 1994 to ensure their consideration. Comments postmarked after that date will be considered to the extent practicable. Public scoping workshops to provide information and discuss and receive comments on the scope of the EIS will be held on the dates and at the locations given below: ␣ 1␣ 1␣ 1␣ Hood River, Oregon Date: Thursday, November 10, 1994 Hood River Inn, Best Western, 1108 E. Marina Way, Hood River, OR 97031, (503) 386&hyph;2200. Portland, Oregon Date: Friday, November 11, 1994 Red Lion/Lloyd's Center, 1000 Multnomah, Portland, OR 97204, (503) 281&hyph;6111. Richland, Washington Date: Tuesday, November 15, 1994 O'Callahan's at the Shilo, 50 Comstock, Richland, WA 99352, (509) 946&hyph;4661. Seattle, Washington Date: Thursday, November 17, 1994 Bellevue Hilton Hotel, 100 112th Avenue, Bellevue, WA 98004, (206) 455&hyph;3330. Spokane, Washington Date: Monday, November 28, 1994 Cavanaugh's Inn at the Park, W. 303 North River Drive, Spokane, WA 99352, (509) 326&hyph;8000. Each public scoping workshop will begin with a welcome and brief overview of the proposed EIS and will include sub-workshops on specific items of interest in which the public can ask questions and provide comments to DOE officials. Notes will be taken in the sub-workshops to record public concerns for the official workshop record. Each workshop will conclude with a session that will be recorded by a public stenographer and will become part of the official workshop record. This portion of the workshop will be chaired by a presiding officer, but will not be conducted as an evidentiary hearing; speakers will not be cross-examined although the presiding officer and DOE representatives may ask clarifying questions. Individuals requesting to speak on behalf of an organization must identify the organization. In the interest of ensuring that all who wish to speak have an opportunity to do so, each individual speaker will be given a 5-minute limit except that a speaker representing an organization (one per organization) will be given a 10-minute limit. The agenda will be repeated twice a day at each location, in afternoon and evening sessions. The hours for the sessions will be: 12:30 PM&hyph;1:30 PM (workshop session), 1:30 PM&hyph;4:30 PM (formal scoping meeting), 5:30 PM&hyph;6:30 PM (workshop session), and 6:30 PM&hyph;9:30 PM (formal scoping meeting). Requests to speak at these workshops may be made by calling the toll-free telephone number, 1&hyph;800&hyph;516&hyph;3740 by 3:00 PM the day before the meeting or by writing to the DOE (see ADDRESSES below). Persons who have not submitted a request to speak in advance may register to do so at the workshops and will be called on to speak on a first-come, first-served basis as time permits. Written comments will also be accepted at the meetings, and speakers are encouraged to provide written versions of their oral comments for the record. DOE will review scoping comments to determine their applicability to the proposed PFP cleanout EIS. An Implementation Plan (IP) for the PFP EIS will provide guidance for preparation of the PFP EIS and establish its scope and content (10 CFR 1021.312). The IP will briefly summarize the scoping comments received and their disposition. The IP will be issued prior to the release of the draft EIS and copies will be made available for inspection.
