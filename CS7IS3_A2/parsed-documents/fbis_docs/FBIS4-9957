Currently, an agreement is being read which states that on orders from the candidate, Zedillo Ponce de Leon, himself, the mourning for the death of Luis Donaldo Colosio, who was cowardly assassinated, will be perpetuated within the party. His political ideology will be respected and fulfilled so as to strengthen the new presidential candidate.
