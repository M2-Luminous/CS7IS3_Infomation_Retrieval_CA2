A document released by the chief of the SANDF, Gen Georg Meiring, said the defence budget would have to increase in future years. The defence allocation had declined by 44 percent in real terms during the past five years and was now equivalent to the defence budget of the mid-1970s. Capital spending on armaments and equipment had dropped from 44 percent of the overall defence budget in 1989 to 28 percent last year and the SANDF could no longer maintain even minimum strategic technological levels. "The annual reductions in the defence budget not only necessesitated a reduction in the diversity of capabilities available within the SANDF, but also caused a drastic reduction in the quality and depth of combat capability." Gen Meiring said the costs of integrating non-statutory forces such Umkhonto We Sizwe [Spear of the Nation, ANC armed wing] into the SANDF would increase defence spending in the short term, as would the costs of retrenchments resulting from such rationalisation. Although defence laid claim to a large proportion of state revenue, it also contributed to the national economy through production, employment and foreign exchange earnings. He said the export of armaments and related equipment had earned South Africa R750 million [rands] in foreign exchange between April 1993 and January 1994. While the conventional threat at present was low, South Africa had to maintain all its existing combat capabilities. Moderate, expandable force levels were needed to enable the SANDF to gear up to war force levels if and when needed.
