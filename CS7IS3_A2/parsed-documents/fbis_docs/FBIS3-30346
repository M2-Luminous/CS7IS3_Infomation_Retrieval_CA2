On the eve of Solana's visit [2 February], our correspondent Pedro Fernandez Cespedes is in Medjugorje. [Cespedes] Good evening. The Spanish Blue Helmets stationed in Bosnia-Herzegovina would find themselves in a tight corner if the air strikes decided upon by the United Nations were to go ahead. The head of the Madrid Group [Spanish UN contingent], Colonel Luis Carvajal, makes no secret of his doubts about how effective these air strikes would be in opening Tuzla Airport or in allowing the replacement of Canadian Blue Helmets in Srebrenica. [Begin Carvajal recording] We have a defense capacity, that is true. We have arms and we have the means, but they are limited of course. We do not have air cover, other than that provided by the planes themselves, we do not have antiaircraft defenses. [end recording] [Cespedes] This afternoon Col. Carvajal visited the city of Mostar with General Cot, head of UNPROFOR in former Yugoslavia. Both of them met the mayor of Mostar and there was not a single reference made to the charges made 28 January against the Spanish Blue Helmets. The problem is over.
