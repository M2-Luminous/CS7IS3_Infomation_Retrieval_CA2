FR940930-0-00080 FR940930-0-00016 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William Larson (Conditions for Coverage), (410) 966&hyph;4639. William Morse (Payment Limits), (410) 966&hyph;4520. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background On December 31, 1990, we published interim final regulations concerning Medicare coverage of screening mammography in the Federal Register (55 FR 53510). These regulations implemented section 4163 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA '90) (Public Law 101&hyph;508), which was enacted on November 5, 1990. Section 4163 amended sections 1833, 1834, 1861, 1862, 1863, 1864, 1865, 1902, and 1915 of the Social Security Act (the Act) to provide coverage of screening mammography (including a physician's interpretation of the images or films produced by the radiologic procedure) effective January 1, 1991, subject to frequency limitations, quality standards, and special payment rules. Before we could follow up on the interim final rule and publish a final rule on Medicare coverage of screening mammography, the Mammography Quality Standards Act of 1992 (MQSA) (Public Law 101&hyph;539) was enacted on October 27, 1992, establishing new national quality standards for all mammography services. The MQSA amended part F of title III of the Public Health Service Act (the PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 263b) to establish a comprehensive statutory mechanism for certification and inspection of all mammography facilities in the United States, except facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The authority to implement the provisions of the MQSA was delegated by the Secretary to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which published interim final regulations in this regard in the Federal Register (58 FR 67558 and 58 FR 67565) on December 21, 1993, with an effective date of February 22, 1994. The MQSA did not explicitly repeal section 1834(c) of the Act, which contains the provisions governing Medicare standards for screening mammography. Furthermore, conforming provisions that would tie Medicare coverage for both screening and diagnostic mammography to MQSA standards were initially included in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 by the House of Representatives, but subsequently had to be dropped along with other nonbudget provisions in response to Senate procedural rules. These provisions were included again in a technical corrections bill that the Congress attempted to pass late in 1993, but did not pass for reasons unrelated to the substance of the bill. The MQSA, however, as it was enacted, specifically provides that the standards under the PHS Act apply to all facilities in the country furnishing mammography, except VA facilities. Thus section 354(b) of the PHS Act, added by the MQSA, states that ``No facility may conduct an examination or procedure *␣*␣* involving mammography *␣*␣* unless the facility obtains *␣*␣* a certificate issued *␣*␣* by the Secretary.'' Similarly, the MQSA defines a facility in the broadest terms: It includes ``a hospital, outpatient department, clinic, radiology practice, or mobile unit, an office of a physician, or other facility *␣*␣* that conducts breast cancer screening or diagnosis through mammography activities.'' The plain language of the PHS Act requires that facilities furnishing mammography to Medicare beneficiaries meet the standards promulgated under the MQSA. Moreover, we believe that the language of the law indicates that the Congress intended that all facilities furnishing mammography meet a consistent set of national standards. When the Congress wished to exclude facilities from these standards, it did so explicitly; thus, VA facilities are specifically not subject to the Federal standards under the MQSA. Finally, we have compared the requirements contained in the MQSA and quality standards in section 1834(c) of the Act and believe that the Medicare requirements are substantially subsumed in the PHS Act. For the reasons stated above, we believe that it was the Congress' intent that facilities have to meet only one set of Federal mammography standards and that the MQSA standards supersede the previous Medicare standards. II. Provisions of the Interim Final Rule The interim final rule, published in the Federal Register on December 31, 1990 (55 FR 53510), implemented section 4163 of OBRA '90 by setting forth Medicare payment limitations and establishing conditions for coverage of screening mammography to ensure the safety and accuracy of the screening process.
