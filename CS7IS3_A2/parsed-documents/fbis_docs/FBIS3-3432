For Wan Guoquan, who has maintained close cooperation with the CPC for nearly half a century, this is an event worthy of celebration. Wan Guoquan frankly revealed his feeling to XINHUA correspondents after he was elected a CPPCC vice chairman: "As an honest friend of the CPC, I would like to thank the CPPCC members for trusting in me. I will devote the rest of my life to doing my job well." Wan Guoquan has been a friend who cooperated closely and shared weal and woe with the CPC. He is also an honest friend who handles matters impartially. In the early days following the liberation of China when Wan Guoquan was manager of an enterprise in Tianjin, he responded to the call of the party and took the lead in introducing public-private joint management to the enterprise under his management. Since then, he has been serving under the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce [ACFIC] and the CDNCA. Comrades who know him have lauded him as "a democratic person devoted to his work who handles party work very well and dares to speak frankly." "I came from a warlord family in northeast China, and it was natural I was not spared misfortune during the `Cultural Revolution.' I was made to work in a cow shed; I was subjected to criticism and struggle; I was made to work as a construction worker, a carpenter, and a cook. But this has not shaken my confidence in the CPC." With deep feeling, Wan Guoquan recalled events of the past: "After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, I resumed my work in the Tianjin branch of the ACFIC and CDNCA. Later, I was transferred to the post of specialized vice chairman of the CDNCA Central Committee. My contacts with high- ranking leaders of the CPC have further convinced me that the CPC is truly concerned about and cherishes us, treating the democratic parties as its partner of cooperation." Wan Guoquan recalled an event which involved him personally. When Deng Yingchao inspected work in Tianjin in a certain year, she learned that Wang Guoquan's father had done something for our party. She intentionally chose "1 July" as the date for inviting Wan Guoquan and his wife to be her guests. While holding Wan Guoquan's hands, Deng Yingchao told him: "You are a good friend of our party." Wan Guoquan was moved to tears after hearing the remark. After that, Deng Yingchao used to inquire about his living conditions. "The democratic parties want to become honest friends of the CPC precisely because it regards us as friends," said Wan Guoquan. He added: "Treating each other with full sincerity and sharing weal and woe, political consultation, and democratic supervision-- this is a function of the parties participating in the administration of state affairs and the CPPCC. Personally, I dare not forget this even for an instant." It has been learned that Wan Guoquan conducts investigations and studies at basic-level units every year, and writes motions and proposals on economic construction. Last year, together with some experts and scholars of the CDNCA, Wan Guoquan visited five provinces and autonomous regions in northwest China to conduct investigations. On behalf of the CDNCA Central Committee, he submitted to the party Central Committee and the leadership of the five provinces and autonomous regions a report on some issues regarding economic development in the five provinces and autonomous regions. During the three years since he assumed the post of executive vice chairman of the CDNCA Central Committee, many of the motions submitted by the CDNCA have been adopted by the party Central Committee and other relevant departments. Last year, the central leadership attached great importance to CDNCA-submitted motions and proposals on constitutional amendments, to strengthening rural and agricultural work, to reform of existing banquet systems to promote the transformation of customs and habits, and to invigoration of large and medium state-owned enterprises. As these remarks were being made, Wan Guoquan waved his hand in a modest gesture, saying: "These tasks were completed by everyone under the leadership of Chairman Sun Qimeng. I only served as a link in reporting conditions at grass-roots levels to the top leadership." After awhile, Wan Guoquan said what he would do after becoming a CPPCC vice chairman: "First, with the change of status, one must not change the style of being hardworking, honest, and self- disciplined. As the people have given me the right, I must change the purpose of serving them. Second, knowing that I have a heavy responsibility to bear, I must set stricter demands on myself. I will strengthen political and professional studies, knowing that knowledge is never sufficient. Third, I will do my best to fulfill my responsibility of reflecting the opinions and proposals of 60,000 CDNCA members and other members of the democratic parties. "Through actual deeds, I will forever be an honest friend of the CPC." Wan Guoquan said these concluding remarks resolutely.
