FR941012-0-00146 FR941012-0-00011 Many commenters raised the issue of whether experienced and/or previously trained employees would be required to be retrained (Ex. 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;28, 5&hyph;29, 5&hyph;33, 5&hyph;35, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;43, 5&hyph;49, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92, 9&hyph;1; Tr. W1 63, OR 85). Some commenters favored training of all workers, regardless of their previous employment experience (Ex. 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;28, 5&hyph;29, 5&hyph;35). Other commenters said that previously trained or experienced workers should be excepted from training requirements (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;43, 5&hyph;49, 5&hyph;52, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). As discussed above in the Major Issues section, OSHA believes that employees who have never received training must be trained, regardless of their level of experience. The need to provide training for experienced loggers who have not previously received such training is supported by the WIR survey, that indicates that over one third of those injured had never received training and 56 percent of those injured had worked in the logging industry for 5 years or more. By contrast, only 22 percent of those injured had worked in the logging industry for one year or less. In addition, the WIR survey indicates that the employees who were injured performed the activity in which they were injured on almost a daily basis. (OSHA is allowing an exception to initial training for previously trained employees. See discussion of paragraph (i)(5)). OSHA also received several comments on annual retraining of employees. Some commenters said annual retraining is necessary (Ex. 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;43, 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;9, 9&hyph;13, 9&hyph;20). One commenter said that machine operators should be retrained at least annually (Ex. 5&hyph;34). However, other commenters questioned the need for annual retraining of loggers and suggested that retraining could be handled in regular safety and health meetings (Ex. 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;29, 5&hyph;43). One commenter also said retraining should be limited to an ``as needed basis'' (Ex. 5&hyph;19). OSHA has addressed these concerns in the final rule. Instead of an annual retraining provision, the final rule contains provisions requiring employers to hold safety and health meetings at least once a month (paragraph (i)(11)), and to retrain any employee who demonstrates unsafe job performance. OSHA agrees with the commenters that these new provisions are more responsive to addressing new hazards and unsafe job performance than is an annual retraining requirement. These provisions also require the employer to address unsafe job performance immediately. These provisions require the employer to address new hazards as they appear in the workplace in monthly safety and health meetings. In addition to being more responsive to hazards as they appear in the workplace, OSHA believes these provisions will be less burdensome on employers, especially small employers with limited resources. OSHA anticipates that only a portion of employees will need to be retrained due to unsafe job performance. Also OSHA believes that for many employers ongoing monthly safety and health meetings will be incorporated into job planning meetings that are well-established in the logging industry. (Safety and health meetings are addressed further in discussion of paragraph (i)(11)). OSHA received comments supporting the need for training of new inexperienced employees and training employees assigned to new job tasks, tools, equipment, machines or vehicles (Ex. 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;28). There were no comments opposing these provisions, therefore, OSHA has retained these requirements in the final rule.
