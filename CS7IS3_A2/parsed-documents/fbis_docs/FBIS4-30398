Answering the question, the foreign minister said: "Japan has not made it a condition for resuming the stalled Japan-North Korea normalization talks to clear up suspicions about North Korea's past nuclear development. It is, however, important to clear up suspicions about that country's nuclear development during the bilateral normalization talks before Japan and North Korea normalize their relations." In this way, he showed a positive position on resuming the stalled Japan-North Korea normalization talks. During the session, Kosugi also proposed that Makoto Tanabe, former chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Japan, and former prime ministers be sent to North Korea for behind-the-scenes negotiations with North Korean officials. In response, Foreign Minister Kakizawa implicitly welcomed Kosugo's proposal, saying, "If they want to take the trouble to visit North Korea, we hope they will do so."
