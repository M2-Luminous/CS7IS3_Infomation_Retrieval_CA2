Banking and law enforcement authorities last week conceded that dirty money did enter the banks' washing machine. Officials, however, attributed blame to what they say are gaping loopholes in existing regulations--mainly the failure of banks to share information, the failure to freeze accounts pending an enquiry to determine the source of income and the introduction by some banks of "exemption lists of preferred clients." Preferred customers are not required to sign the necessary declaration forms for deposits exceeding TT$10,000 per individual and TT$40,000 per company. Bankers, moving independently of government, last November signed a money laundering agreement making it mandatory for employees to report suspicious deposits, sale of travellers cheques and wire transfers. These reports must be made to the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), headed by Lance Selman. Several bankers, requesting anonymity, said they have not only reported suspicious transactions to the authorities but have turned down accounts, some well over TT$10 million. Victor Mouttet, a commercial and retail manager at Republic Bank, who monitors banking records on a daily basis, said Republic lost two substantial accounts this year because it demanded transparency records from the depositors in question. One individual account was in the vicinity of $200,000 to $300,000 and the other, he said, was by a company in the sum of TT$10 million. Mouttet said reports were made to the authorities but Republic has had no feedback on where the investigation, if any had been undertaken, has led to. "We just go as far as putting them (police) on notice," he said in an interview last week. Nearly all of the six commercial banks said they have reported suspicious transactions to the police but checks with the authorities revealed that there has been not a single arrest related to money laundering or questionable deposits. Deputy Commissioner of Crime Selwyn confirmed that there have been no drug laundering arrests. He said if there is an investigation underway, he is unaware of it. The November 1992 agreement, which is self-regulatory, depends entirely on bankers' discretion to report the movement of large deposits or transactions to law enforcement authorities. Bankers themselves said the agreement is difficult to police. Some said they don't know when they should make a report. They said it was difficult, if not, "indelicate" to subject everyone including known and trusted customers to transparency requirements, particularly "eminent" and "respected" business people. Big name business clients, they said, often make large deposits of varying sums of money and are annoyed by attempts to establish transparency. Bankers and law enforcement authorities were reluctant to give even a rough estimate as to how much dirty money they suspect were laundered following liberalisation of foreign exchange controls. Finance Minister Wendell Mottley, in a post-floating of the TT currency address to a PNM party meeting in May, said that "millions and millions of U.S. dollars which had been stored in jars, pitchoil tins, safety deposit mattresses and in pillows" found its way into the commercial banking system. Bankers, however, say the majority of this money--about TT$80 million--included the return of capital flight. Suresh Maharaj, managing director of Citibank, said his bank has lost accounts because of requests for information on the source of deposits. He, however, noted that Citibank, in addition to local banking regulations, is subject to stringent US controls and checks by US Federal Reserve Inspectors. Some bankers said less ill-gotten gains are entering the banking system and are in fact being traded on the open market for the purpose of luxury items such as cars, real estate, jewelry and pleasure boats. Asked whether the illegal money would not enter the banking system at some point in time--either by the car dealer or real estate agent, assuming they are paid in cash--one banker said: "Yes," but noted that "it may be that the bank is in the habit of handling large cash deposits from a particular car dealer so, no, a large cash deposit may not necessarily arouse suspicion or be reported to anyone." Frank Mouttet, President of the Chamber of Commerce said he was not at all satisfied with the present drug money laundering regulations. Attorney Douglas Mendes says it is not enough to just ask the banks to divulge information on the movement of currency, transfers and deposits over a certain sum. He said law enforcers should be given the authority to freeze accounts until they are able to determine the source of income and whether taxes have been paid on it. Tom Cash, special agent of the US Drug Enforcement Administration Miami Office with responsibility for the Caribbean, said last month that attempts by the DEA to follow the trail of laundered drug money have been frustrated by the failure of banking officials to volunteer information. The DEA office last year captured US$279 million from drug raids and busted money laundering activities in the Miami district alone. Cash said this figure could have been significantly higher had there been more co-operation from banking officials. He said it was the DEA experience that assurances made by bankers to volunteer information was a myth and warned that governments should watch closely bankers who declare that they don't need regulatory laws. Cash named bankers and lawyers as the people who profit most from drug money laundering. Bankers countercharged that if blame is to be apportioned it should be laid at the door of law enforcement authorities. Bankers argued that the authorities know who the dealers are but for their own private reasons prefer to shake down "the small fellas on the block."
