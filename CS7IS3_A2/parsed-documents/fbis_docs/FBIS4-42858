The "saga" of the PS, which has already "sacrificed" two secretaries general--Vitor Constancio and Jorge Sampaio--is permanently marked by a lack of faith in the leader, Raimundo continued, fomented by a president [Mario Soares] who "insists that everything be done his way." Besides his own--mostly young--allies, PS leader Antonio Guterres seems to have only poll results on his side. Were Guterres to lose the 12 June European Parliament elections, hostilities would immediately begin, centering on how to bring about Prime Minister Cavaco Silva's downfall, the socialists' "great obsession" in recent years, Raimundo contended. However, if the PS wins, victory would be "devalued" and Guterres would only get, once again, "the benefit of the doubt." Meanwhile, Raimundo continued, various party officials are waiting in the background to decide about reentering the scene. According to Raimundo, the PS's "hard core" is formed by Guterres partisans who throw themselves wholeheartedly in the struggle to prove the validity of their strategy, which aims at removing the PS's leftist stigma and waiting for disillusioned "Cavacoists" to join them. Their rallying point is the clash with President Soares. The group includes Antonio Vitorino, who heads the PS list for the Euroelections, Jorge Coelho, Jose Lamego, Arons de Carvalho, and Jorge Lacao. The group around former Minister of Defense Jaime Gama includes Eduardo Pereira, Jose Lello, and Miranda Calha. Absent in recent years from the political debate because of their leader's "desertion," they are attempting a comeback by supporting Gama as an alternative to Guterres. While Gama seems to be a "born loser," he still wields a measure of influence, according to Raimundo. The Sampaio group--Joao Cravinho, Alberto Martins, Antonio Costa, Lopes Cardoso, and Ferro Rodrigues--aims at ensuring Sampaio's candidacy for the presidency and reunifying the Left. Like President Soares, they want internal diversity and a plurality of opinions. Betting on the values of humanism and of the Left, the Soares group, formed by Almeida Santos, Manuel Alegre, and Antonio Campos "cannot reconcile itself with the `tragedy' of a country governed by the Right," but lacks a strategy and an alternative to Guterres. Porto Mayor Fernando Gomes "runs on his own track," keeps intact his presidential ambitions, and is best placed to succeed Guterres, according to Raimundo, despite his trumpeted solidarity with the PS leader. The "free" group, which includes PS official Joao Soares, former General Workers Union (UGT) leader Torres Couto, and PS luminary Vitor Constancio, is awaiting electoral results to decide its future course.
