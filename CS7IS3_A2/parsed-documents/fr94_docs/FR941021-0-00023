FR941021-0-00023 FR941021-0-00001 (v) Firearms resistance. All housings shall be tested for resistance to penetration by direct impact from a 12 gauge shotgun equipped with a modified choke and the use of a 33/4 dram equivalent powder charge and 35 grams # 6 lead shot fired from a distance of 15 m (50 ft). The 12 gauge shotgun shall be fired from a normal standing position at the front side of the housing. Penetration through the housing wall by the lead shot shall constitute failure. (vi) Lifting hardware requirements. The lifting hardware on housings and their contents that weigh more than 91 kg (200 lb) shall be tested. The housing shall be fastened to a restraining device such as a concrete slab and subjected to loading through the lifting attachments to simulate the lifting load. For the first test a lifting line equipped with a dyna mometer shall be attached to the housing lifting hardware and a load applied equal to three times the weight of a fully equipped housing. Deformation or damage to the housing or lifting hardware constitutes failure. A second test shall be conducted with the same arrangements as for the first except that a load shall be applied equal to six times the weight of a fully equipped housing. There shall be no catastrophic failure of the lifting hardware or housing. (vii) Stub cable strain relief tests. Housings equipped with cable stubs and cable shipping retainer shall be tested by lifting a test housing, with the maximum length and weight of cable orderable, in a manner causing the full weight of the cable to be supported by the cabinet. Examination of the cable sheath after lifting shall reveal no tearing, rupturing, or other damage. The cable conductors and shield shall be tested for shorts and opens. Electrical defects to the stub cable or damage to the housing constitutes failure. (viii) Door restrainer evaluation. (A) The housing shall be positioned with the door held in the open position by the door restraining device. A load, determined in accordance with the following table, shall be applied to the center of the door, perpendicular to the door and in each of the opening and closing directions. ␣ 1Maximum area of door surface cm 2 (in. 2 ) 1Load kg ␣(lb) 5,200 (800) or less 72 (160) 5,201 to 9,100 (801 to 1,400) 127 (280) 9,101 to 13,000 (1,401 to 2,000) 181 (400) Note: Test procedures for housings with larger doors will be evaluated by REA on a case-by-case basis. (B) There shall be no functional failure of the restraining device nor mechanical damage to the housing. (ix) Security evaluation. The security locking device shall be capable of withstanding a maximum torque of 2.8 N-m (25 lb-in.) without incurring physical damage to the closure, thereby resulting in a condition where the closure cannot be either accessed or locked. (5) Electrical requirements for housings. Each bonding stud and nut location shall be evaluated by attaching one lead from a dc or alternating current (ac) power source to a bonding stud with the nut torqued as specified by its manufacturer and the other power source lead connected to the closure grounding conductor connector. The current path thus established must be capable of sustaining a current of 1,000 amperes root-mean-square for at least 20 seconds without fusing or causing any damage to the closure or its contents. (6) Finish requirements _(i) Impact resistance. The finish on painted metal surfaces shall not exhibit radial cracking on the impact surface (intrusion) when indented at 18 N-m (160 lb-in.) with a 1.6 cm (0.6 in.) diameter spherical indentor. This test shall be performed in accordance with ASTM D 2794&hyph;92 with the exception that the test panel shall be of the same material, thickness, and finish as the pedestal housing being evaluated. (ii) Finish adhesion. Painted finishes shall be tested for adhesion of finish in accordance with ASTM D 2197&hyph;86 (Reapproved 1991), Method A. There shall be no gouging in the top coat when tested with an 8 kg (17.7 lb) load. Gouging is defined as removal or separation of paint particles or breaking of the finish by the scraping loop to the extent of exposing base metal. (iii) Color evaluation. The color of the housing finish should be compared against the Munsell system of color notation, as described in ASTM D 1535&hyph;89 to determine color consistency with that desired. (iv) Gloss evaluation. The finish on painted housings shall be tested on two approximately 20 cm × 20 cm (8 in. × 8 in.) samples for each color used in accordance with the procedures of ASTM D 523&hyph;89. The finish shall have a minimum gloss of 60 (60 ○ Specular). (v) Secondary finish evaluation. Evidence of secondary protection shall be required for REA acceptance. Typical secondary protection is galvanizing per ASTM A 526/A 526M&hyph;90 for steel surfaces.
