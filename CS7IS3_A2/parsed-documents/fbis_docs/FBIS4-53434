The meeting came amid fresh government data that showed the U.S. trade deficit with Japan jumped 25.4 percent in March to 5.80 billion dollars. The U.S. posted a record 59 billion dollar deficit with Japan last year. Both Japanese and U.S. officials were cautious in predicting the outcome of the day's trade meeting at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. "We will not know anything until we meet," said Sozaburo Okamatsu, Japan's vice trade minister for international affairs. Okamatsu made the brief remark to reporters as he and Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy foreign minister for economic affairs, entered the office. The Americans sounded equally cautious. "We will have to wait and see what the Japanese officials bring," a senior U.S. official told reporters on condition of anonymity Wednesday. At stake is the fate of the accord the two countries concluded in July last year to set up a new framework for bilateral trade designed to widen the access of foreign goods to Japan and reduce Japan's global trade surplus. Negotiations on how to implement the terms of the framework agreement broke down in February when Japan refused to accept the U.S. definition on "objective criteria" for measuring Japanese imports. The rupture of the trade negotiations, which came at the Feb. 11 summit in Washington between President Bill Clinton and then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, shook financial markets and at one point sent the U.S. dollar close to a record low against the yen. Clinton and other senior U.S. officials have since made what appeared to be conciliatory remarks on bilateral trade ties, but officials in Tokyo say they are uncertain about Washington's intentions. U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor told reporters during a visit to Congress on Wednesday that the U.S. has not budged. "Our position is exactly as it was in February. It has not changed at all," Kantor said. Treasury Undersecretary for International Affairs Lawrence Summers, a member of the U.S. team involved in the trade talks with Japan, also insisted that the U.S. has not changed its position. "I think (our) position has been consistent," Summers said in a separate meeting with reporters. But Summers conceded that Washington will keep an eye on the shaky political situation in Tokyo when U.S. officials sit at the negotiating table with Japanese officials. "Clearly, as we go forward in the negotiations, we have to recognize the political situation in Japan, and that obviously is one of the factors that goes into the strategy," he said. While both Tokyo and Washington seem eager to get the framework talks back on track by the time Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata meets Clinton at the Group of Seven (G-7) summit of industrialized nations in Italy in early July, U.S. officials say there is no deadline for a deal. "We are not putting any artificial deadline on them. We think that would be a mistake," a senior U.S. trade official said.
