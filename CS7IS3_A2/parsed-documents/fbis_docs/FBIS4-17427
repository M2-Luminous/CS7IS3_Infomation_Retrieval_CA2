Tikk thought the dismantling of the reactors and removal of nuclear fuel from Estonia might start early in May. He said the Russian side has run into some difficulties with the technical side of the operation, which prevents it from setting things in motion. The Russian customs officials at Kingissepp have detained a container without which the dismantling cannot begin, Tikk claimed. The government representative said that a Russian landing ship stands ready in Paldiski's South Port to receive the parts of the dismantled reactors. Russia wants to conclude a joint agreement on the removal of fuel and on the dismantling of the reactors. Estonia stands firm that both operations must be regulated by separate treaties. "We still don't know how (Russia plans) to handle the dismantling of the reactors and their removal from Paldiski," Tikk said. But, he said, the removal of nuclear fuel has been finalized down to the last detail. BNS has information nuclear fuel will be removed from Paldiski by rail. Tikk declined to conform or deny the report. "Whichever kind of transport is used, safety will be guaranteed in any case," he stated. Tikk claimed the most hazardous stage of the operation is opening of the reactor lid. "Yet, even if radioactive vapor should escape, it won't pose a very great danger since the cloud will disperse soon," he maintained. Jan Christer Lindhe, a researcher from the Swedish National Radioactivity Protection Institute, also voiced the opinion that the reactors don't constitute a big threat to the environment. "It's more of a political problem," he claimed. "Should an accident occur, we shan't keep it secret," Tikk declared. Estonia monitors continuously the radiation level around the reactors and if something occurs there that the Russian side would like to hush up, Estonia will spread the news through all mass media channels. The Estonian Government decided on April 12 to enforce a special regime on the Pakri peninsula where Paldiski is situated to ensure the safety of the dismantling operation and the population.
