The parliament decision can be described as highly controversial and leaving many questions open. Actually, the two deputies sort of fell a victim to the imperfect election law which, in particular, stipulates that elections should be held on an alternative basis. In case in question, Grinev's and Kudyukin's rivals, who polled less votes in the first round of parliamentary elections, withdrew three days before the second round. Nevertheless, the Central Election Committee authorized the second round, which brought both deputies into Ukraine's parliament. But the Credentials Committee qualified the case as an irregularity, and the parliamentary session voted to deny deputy's mandates to the two candidates. On the face of it, the parliament decision cannot be questioned. However, two more deputies found themselves in a similar situation. These are Ivan Vasyura, head of the collective agricultural enterprise in the Cherkasy region, and Oleg Panasovskiy, director of the Uglegorsk thermal plant. Describing them as "good lads," the session approved their deputy's mandates. Such a different approach can be accounted for by Grinev's and Kudyukin's "naughtiness." Grinev is known to be a prominent reformer. Earlier, he stepped down as deputy parliament speaker because he could not agree with the line pursued by the parliament. As a co-chairman of the inter-regional reform bloc, he criticized the government and parliament, accusing them of being incapable of pulling the country out of crisis. Certainly, far from everybody liked this, including many current lawmakers. Black-sea trouble-maker Pavel Kudyukin is notorious for the much- spoken-about "Blasco" scandal. Lawmakers remember numerous inspections of the activities of the shipping lines management, which was accused of wasting the fleet's assets and embezzling large sums in hard currency. However, the case was not brought to court. Thus, Ukrainian lawmakers were guided today by personal considerations rather than by law. But what should voters do in this situation?
