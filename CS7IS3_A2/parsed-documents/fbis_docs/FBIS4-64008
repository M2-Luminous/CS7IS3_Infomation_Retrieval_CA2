This was reported Tuesday [24 May] by Russian Government Vice Premier A. Shokhin. Let me remind you that at the beginning of April last year we concluded the first agreement with the Paris Club on restructuring the former USSR's debts, which gave the country an important financial breathing space. But that agreement applied only to payments due in 1993 and it has already formally expired. However, Moscow agreed with its creditors that it would remain in force until there is a new agreement. Originally $4.7 billion was allocated to service the debt this year, which represents only a fraction of the total sum due for payment in 1994. In cutting all state expenditure, the State Duma has reduced this figure to $4.1 billion. But even this may not be final -- the Italians' position could cause adjustments to be made. The point is that in the last years of the USSR's existence Moscow clearly accumulated an excessive amount of loans, a fair number of them from Italy. Hard bargaining over this has been going on with the Italians for many months now: We say that these debts are Soviet but they insist that they are Russian. Accordingly, if we get our way, the matter in dispute -- the round sum in foreign currency -- will be subject to restructuring along with the rest of the Union's debts, or to put it simply -- we will pay later. But if Rome comes out on top we will have to pay now. Here everyone realizes that Moscow is trying to maintain Russia's creditworthy image by not accumulating purely Russian debts. The Italians have enlisted the support of Paris Club members in its claims. But our resources are limited in any case. Hoping that our creditors are sufficiently well aware of this, we are saying that we are prepared to pay Italy but in that case there is unlikely to be anything left to pay other creditors.
