It quoted an unidentified "high-ranking Russian official" as saying that "given the wish, it is possible to spotlight American diplomats working for the CIA and Russians collaborating with the secret service." The U.S. Government has instituted judicial proceedings against Aldrich Hazen Ames, the former chief of the CIA's Soviet Counter-Intelligence Branch, and his wife Maria, charging them with spying for the former Soviet Union and Russia. Ames, 52, a CIA employee for more than 31 years, and his wife, Maria Del Rosario Casa Ames, 41, a Colombian-born naturalized U.S. citizen, were arrested on Monday by CIA and FBI agents. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the Ames couple have been spying against the U.S. since 1985 and received more than 1.5 million U.S. dollars in payoff money and deposited the money on accounts in U.S. and foreign banks. The investigation of the case started 10 months ago. U.S. President Bill Clinton described it as "a very serious case" and ordered the State Department to lodge an official protest to the Russian Government. Yuri Kobaladze, spokesman for the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, said on Wednesday that the spy scandal over the Ames couple might has been revealed to discredit the success of the Russian foreign policy in resolving the Sarajevo crisis. Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Grigoriy Karashin stated, meanwhile, that "much has to be cleared up." In a statement delivered earlier Wednesday, Russian Presidential Spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov said, "a return to the psychology of the Cold War, mounting mistrust, and a new wave of spy mania would contradict the ideas of international partnership for peace."
