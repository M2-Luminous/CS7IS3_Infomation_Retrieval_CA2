In Mikhalchenko's words, Kravchuk's corresponding decree just fixes Gorbatov's appointment. While explaining the functions of the Ukrainian president's envoy in the Crimea at the request of Interfax-Ukraine agency, leader of the presidential juridical service Ivan Timchenko said that "he (the envoy) will primarily fulfill control functions providing for the observance of the Ukrainian legislature and Ukraine's Constitution by the Crimean president." Timchenko added that the presidential envoy would maintain constant contacts between the central power bodies in Kiev and Simferopol. Mikhalchenko explained that the question concerns the control over the decree On Division of Authorities between Ukraine and the Crimea both on the part of the Crimea and Ukraine. "This decree should be fulfilled both by the autonomy and the central government," underlined Mikhalchenko. In his words, the presidential envoy in the Crimea will not be in charge for the Black Sea Fleet problem because this issue is to be considered at an inter-state level. "The leadership of the Crimean autonomy has only consultative functions in this sphere," emphasized Mikhalchenko.
