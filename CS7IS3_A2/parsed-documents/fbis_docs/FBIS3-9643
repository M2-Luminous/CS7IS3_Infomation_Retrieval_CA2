Keko report: "Prosecution Calls for 14 Years Imprisonment for Fatos Nano"] [Text] Including interruptions, the Nano trial has now lasted for three weeks since its start on 5 March. Tirana District Court, surrounded by police for every session, has called a record number of witnesses and has attracted the interest of the entire press. It must be said that the trial was held for practical reasons in two buildings, in the old courtroom on Kavaje Street and in the former building of the Energy Directorate. Despite the changes in both the location and the accusations, Prosecutors Qeleshi and Gjokutaj did not deviate from the goal for which they had joined forces: the conviction of Socialist leader Fatos Nano. The Nano trial is inevitably the trial of the year. Neither the protests of the European Parliament nor the noise of the Socialist Party and its electorate have influenced the trial. Rumors of a rebellion of the electorate on the eve of the trial were successfully quashed by the people's police, and the Democratic Party's propaganda did the same for the Socialist Party's propaganda. The Democratic side will no doubt consider the end of the trial a new victory over the old communist nomenklatura, because this is the language that has been used against Nano. In itself, the Nano trial is an episode in a prolonged series of trials of the former nomenklatura, to continue with the trials of Ramiz Alia, Hekuran Isai, and others. Thus, the prosecution at the Nano trial finally summed up its case at yesterday's session of Tirana District Court before the bench presided over by Agim Bendo. Prosecutor Qeleshi read out the 27-page file and in conclusion presented his demands. The prosecution demanded: "A verdict of guilty against the defendant Fatos Nano for the crime of appropriating state property and abusing his office for the benefit of other persons to the amount of 73,780,000 leks, and his sentencing on the basis of Article 62 of the Penal Code to 13 years imprisonment; also a verdict of guilty against the defendant Fatos Nano for the crime of falsifying official documents and his sentencing on the basis of Article 110 of the Penal Code to three years imprisonment. "A verdict of guilty against the defendant Sokrat Plaka for the crime of abuse of office leading to damages incurred by the state amounting to 73,780,000 leks and his sentencing on the basis of Article 106 of the Penal Code to five years imprisonment. "A verdict of guilty against the defendent Robert Gjini for the crime of abuse of office leading to damages incurred by the state amounting to 399,390 leks and his sentencing on the basis of Article 106 of the Penal Code to four years imprisonment. "A verdict of guilty against the defendant Hasan Hallko for the crime of abuse of office leading to damages incurred by the state amounting to 144,821 leks and his sentencing on the basis of Article 106 of the Penal Code to two years imprisonment. "The prosecution also demands that the defendants be held liable to pay to the Albanian State Bank the sums over which they have been accused, under Article 155 of the Code of Penal Procedure." After the prosecutors' summing up, the lawyers of Nano, Plaka, Gjini, and Hallko asked for time for their clients' defense. Lawyer Perparim Sanxhaku asked for 20 days to defend Fatos Nano; Lawyer Ali Meta asked for nine days to defend Sokrat Plaka; lawyer Fatmir Braka left the time necessary to defend Hasan Hallko to the court's discretion, but asked for a sufficient period; and lawyer Roland Permeti requested nine days to defend Robert Gjini. In conclusion, the court decided to invite the defense counsel to make their presentations in their clients' favor on 30 March 1994. Thus ended the session, which began at 1210 and ended at 1305. After it ended, we turned to Prosecutor Genc Gjokutaj, who said that the prosecution's summing up was a synthesis of the evidence obtained throughout the judicial investigation and during the trial, which proved the charges. The severity of the punishment is in total proportion to the importance of the accused and the seriousness of their activities. The very serious consequences arising from the defendants' criminal activities must be taken into consideration. Asked whether the prosecution would triumph over the defense, Gjokutaj said: "We do not envy the defense. We are men of the law and are convinced of the justice of what we have argued. What the court decides is the court's business." Mr. Nano's lawyer, Perparim Sanxhaku, made no press statement after Prosecutor Qeleshi's summing up. He said that he reserved the right to speak after the defense summing up, which Bendo has decided will take place at 0900 on 30 March. It is not known what Mr. Sanxhaku hopes for from this session or whether the bench will reduce or increase the sentence requested for Nano. The latter is highly probable, if one remembers the precedent of the journalists' trial. In connection with the defense summing up on 30 March, it has been learned that Fatos Nano has finally stated that he will defend himself, but will he bring evidence to show his innocence? From what has been seen in the trial so far, Nano has not wished to enter into the details of the accusation, and this leads one to think that his speech will deal more with the trial's political ramifications than with its legal details.
