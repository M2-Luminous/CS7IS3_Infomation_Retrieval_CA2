In the case of CHDO TA, these sub-grants (also called ``pass-through'' funds) may be made for eligible activities and to eligible entities as identified in 24 CFR 92.302(c) (1), (2), (6), and (7). When CHDO TA sub-grants are made to CHDOs, two statutory provisions apply: (1) the sub-grant amount, when combined with other capacity building and operating support available through the HOME program, cannot exceed the greater of 50 percent of the CHDO's operating budget for the year in which it receives the funds, or $50,000 annually; (2) an amount not exceeding 10 percent of the total funds awarded for the ``Women in the Homebuilding Professions'' eligible activity may be used to provide materials and tools for training such women. IV. Factors for Award (A) Ranking Factors Applications will be evaluated competitively and ranked against all other applicants that have applied for the same TA program (CDBG, HOME, CHDO and Supportive Housing). There will be separate rankings for each TA program, and applicants will be ranked only against others that have applied for the same TA program. The factors and maximum points for each factor are provided below. The maximum number of points for each TA program is 100. Rating of the ``applicant'' or the ``applicant's organization and staff'', unless otherwise specified, will include any sub-contractors, consultants, sub-recipients, and members of consortia which are firmly committed to the project. (1) Potential effectiveness of the application in meeting needs of target groups/localities and accomplishing project objectives for each TA program for which funds are requested (40 points). In rating this factor, HUD will consider the extent to which the proposal: (a) identifies high priority needs and issues to be addressed for each TA program for which funding is requested; (b) outlines a clear & effective plan for addressing those needs and aiding a broad diversity of eligible client/beneficiary groups, including those which traditionally have been under-served; (c) identifies creative and promising ways of carrying out eligible activities which will result in better or less costly service to TA clients; (d) identifies creative activities to assist eligible clients in participating in the development of, and improving, local consolidated plans and comprehensive strategies; (e) identifies creative ways to assist clients in achieving the economic development and continuum of care objectives of local consolidated plans & comprehensive strategies OR of creating linkages between activities they are assisting and activities to achieve these objectives; (f) identifies specific numbers of quantifiable end products and program improvements the TA provider aims to deliver by the end of the cooperative agreement period, (e.g., number of prospective CHDOs to be certified by PJs as a result of TA; number of CHDOs which will submit fundable applications to PJs for the first time as a result of TA; etc. (2) Soundness of approach (20 points). In rating this factor, HUD will consider the extent to which the proposal: (a) Provides a technically and cost effective plan for designing, organizing, and carrying out the proposed technical assistance within the framework of the Demand/Response System; (b) Demonstrates an effective and creative plan for working in partnership with all other CPD TA providers in each Field Office jurisdiction in which it will operate, coordinating and conducting joint activities under the direction of the Field Office or its designee; (c) Provides for full geographic coverage, including urban and rural areas, (directly or through a consortium of providers) of a single state or Field Office jurisdiction or is targeted to address the needs of rural areas, minority groups or other under-served client groups.
