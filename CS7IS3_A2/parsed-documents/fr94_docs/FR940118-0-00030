SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: These regulations implement the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;325, enacted July 23, 1992). The Educational Opportunity Centers program provides grants to institutions of higher education; public and private agencies and organizations; combinations of institutions, agencies, and organizations; and secondary schools under special circumstances. The purposes of the program are to (1) provide information regarding financial and academic assistance available for individuals who desire to pursue a program of postsecondary education; and (2) assist individuals in applying for admission to institutions that offer programs of postsecondary education, including preparing necessary applications for use by admissions and financial aid officers. On October 26, 1993, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for this program in the Federal Register (58 FR 57704). The NPRM included a summary of regulations proposed to implement statutory changes and other regulations proposed to clarify and simplify requirements governing the program. Analysis of Comments and Changes In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, 45 persons submitted comments on the proposed regulations. An analysis of the comments and the changes that have been made in the regulations since publication of the NPRM is published as an appendix to these final regulations. Major Changes in the Regulations The major differences between the NPRM and these final regulations are as follows: 1. Section 644.21 (Selection Criteria_Plan of Operation) The criterion listed under §644.21(c)(5) has been modified to encourage applicants to include information about their plan to coordinate with other projects for disadvantaged students. 2. Section 644.30 (Allowable Costs) Section 644.30 has been revised to include, as allowable costs, transportation, lodging, and meals for project participants and staff during visits to postsecondary institutions or for participation in ``College Day'' and career awareness activities. Also, fees for college admissions applications and college entrance examination fees are now permissible under certain circumstances. 3. Section 644.31 (Unallowable Costs) This section has been revised to conform to the changes made in the allowable costs section.
