Difficult Situation Developing With Medical Supplies for Pacific Fleet Servicemen"] [Text] Vladivostok -- Quite recently it used to be far safer going to military doctors for help than their civilian counterparts. Now when the health of the draft contingent is deteriorating every year the job of military medical staff is becoming more and more difficult. And not just because last year for instance the number of instances of scabies, tuberculosis, and diphtheria in the Pacific Fleet alone almost trebled. In some garrison hospitals patients are already being placed in two-tier bunks. There is a catastrophic shortage of medical staff, who even in the past did not have the luxury of high wages. The supply of ambulances is just over half the required level and those that are still in operation are well and truly worn out. According to Colonel (Medical Service) Nikolay Popov, chief of the Pacific Fleet main hospital, a sick servicemen today no longer has guarantees that he will be able to receive the full course of treatment he requires. At present for instance there are no broad-spectrum antibiotics, medicines to treat cerebral circulation disorders, and effective antiulcerative preparations. The medical equipment with which the fleet's medical establishments are equipped is by no means perfect. Above all there is a shortage of apparatus to study small vessels and the gastrointestinal tract, computerized tomographs, which enable early diagnosis, and much else besides. At the same time, Colonel (Medical Service) Gennadiy Shokin, acting head of the Pacific Fleet Medical Service, said that the health of the young men turning up for service in the fleet is getting worse with every year. Thus, one in five new draftees is not fit for service among the seagoing personnel, one in six has circulation problems, one in seven has a gastric ulcer, and one in 10 has abused drugs before being drafted. Some 30 percent of future seamen are underweight and almost 20 percent are suffering from psychiatric disorders. In 1993 around 400 young men who turned up for service in the Pacific Fleet were sent home before swearing the oath and almost as many seamen again were discharged on health grounds in the first three months of service. If the prevailing situation is not put right, there will soon be simply no one to serve in the fleet.
