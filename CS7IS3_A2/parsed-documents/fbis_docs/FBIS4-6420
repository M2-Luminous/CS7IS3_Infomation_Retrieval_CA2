The 12-story center, with a total floor space of 335,000 square meters, was completed by business groups and enterprises at a cost of about 150 billion yen. Center officials said they plan to develop the facility into a major distribution center in Asia, which will contribute to reducing Japan's huge trade surplus. A total of 108 companies from Asian countries have rented space for business outlets at the center, which can accommodate as many as 400 stores, the officials said. Foreign firms will be offered sales outlets at a discount rate and have access to various services to facilitate their entry into the Japanese market, they said. The officials said only 58 Japanese companies will maintain offices at the center because more than 200 firms have canceled contracts to rent office space because of the protracted recession.
