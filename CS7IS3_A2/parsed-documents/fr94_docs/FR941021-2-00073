FR941021-2-00073 FR941021-2-00046 2. Reconsideration (Reviews Under Part B) and Hearing We will allocate funding based on the amount of dollars spent (line 2 of Forms HCFA&hyph;1523/1524) in the prior years, adjusted for inflation and changes in volume. Specifically, we will adjust the previous year's costs for reconsiderations and hearings by the estimated percentage change in workload. The individual fiscal intermediary and carrier budget allocations for reconsiderations, reviews, and hearings are estimated by multiplying forecast workloads by the adjusted unit costs. The ROs will negotiate with the fiscal intermediaries and carriers to resolve any differences between HCFA's allocations and the contractors' requests within the limits of the funding available to HCFA. 3. Beneficiary and Provider Inquiries (Part B Only) To establish a budgeted amount for beneficiary and provider inquiries, the prior year's cost is increased by the projected workload change. We also consider special conditions unique to specific carriers in negotiating the budget. We will use the data to develop a budgeted cost for beneficiary and provider inquiries by multiplying forecasted processed volume times unit cost. The ROs will negotiate with the carriers to resolve any differences between HCFA's allocations and the carriers' requests within the limits of the funding available to HCFA. 4. Provider Reimbursement (Part A Only) In determining individual fiscal intermediary budgets for reimbursement activities, we first calculated a FY 1993 unit cost by using the funding included on the latest FY 1993 NOBA (Form HCFA 1523) and dividing that amount by the workload reported on the Schedule of Providers Serviced (SPS) for the same period. The SPS is a listing of all the facilities serviced by the fiscal intermediary. The SPS is submitted with each initial budget request so that a part of the analysis is the comparison of the composition of the provider community serviced by the fiscal intermediary and any change reported between fiscal years. The ROs will negotiate with the fiscal intermediaries to resolve any differences between HCFA's allocations and the fiscal intermediaries' requests within the limits of the funding available to HCFA. 5. Provider Audit (Part A Only) For FY 1995, the provider audit function is divided into three major activities: field audits, desk reviews, and settlements. The Contractor Auditing and Settlement Report (CASR) (Form HCFA&hyph;1525A) provides a breakout of audit activities and costs by type of provider, and documents the savings incurred as a result of audit activity. Using this as a base, the desk review costs are developed by projecting the number of providers serviced by the unit cost per desk review (developed for the latest CASR for FY 1993) to determine the cost of handling the FY 1995 workload at the FY 1993 unit cost. Settlement costs are based on the workload projected in the fiscal intermediary's budget request, multiplied by the unit cost for settlements found in the most recent CASR for FY 1993. The first priority of all audit efforts is the completion of any special activities required by legislation. The second priority is that all cost reports be reviewed and, to the extent possible, settled. The ROs will negotiate with the fiscal intermediaries to resolve any differences between HCFA's allocations and the fiscal intermediaries' requests within the limits of the funding available to HCFA. 6. Medicare Secondary Payer We will review the estimated workload data, reported backlog data, and any other items, for example, proposed MSP systems enhancements, to determine MSP funding allocations. Each contractor's case mix is analyzed to adjust for specialized workloads such as home health claims or durable medical equipment (DME). In FY 1995, the budget will be allocated based on the above considerations, adjustments created by shifts in the DME workload from all carriers to the four specialty carriers, and other shifts in workload that may require adjustments. The ROs will negotiate with the fiscal intermediaries and carriers to resolve any differences between HCFA's allocations and their requests within the limits of the funding available to HCFA. 7. Medical Review/Utilization Review (MR/UR) The individual fiscal intermediary and carrier MR/UR budgets for FY 1995 will be calculated in three segments: (1) Prepayment medical review, (2) postpayment medical review activities, and (3) data analysis and screen development. The BPR describes the activities and workload requirements that the fiscal intermediaries and carriers are expected to meet. As part of the BPRs, we will ask the fiscal intermediaries and carriers to estimate the required funding to meet their requirements. We will allocate prepayment and postpayment medical review funding to contractors based upon the workload that a fiscal intermediary or carrier projects for FY 1995.
