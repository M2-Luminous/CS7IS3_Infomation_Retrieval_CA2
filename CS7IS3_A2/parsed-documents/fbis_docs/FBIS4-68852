The Ukrainian Republican Party Is Analyzing the Situation... The Leftists Are Making a Push To Compete in the Presidential Election!"] [Text] A number of political events took place in the capital of Ukraine on the 16th and 17th April of this year. Unquestionably, the event that attracted the most attention was the second phase of the Fifth All-Ukrainian Rukh-Party Congress. Of the 1,200 delegates, 826 took part in the work of the congress. The main topic at the congress was a discussion of the results of the parliamentary elections. In his programmatic speech on the results and lessons of the parliamentary elections, the leader of Rukh stressed that Rukh won the elections despite the fact that only some seven percent of its candidates won seats. He admitted that this number was lower than anticipated, but blamed the conservative nature of the law, the actions of governing structures, irregularities in the counting of votes, and the ambitions of Rukh's partners in the democratic camp for the outcome. Levko Lukyanenko and the democratic Ukraine bloc he heads were the targets of especially harsh criticism in V. Chornovil's speech and in the speeches of many of his supporters. There were the customary harsh attacks on the Ukrainian Republican Party [URP]. The second target of criticism was the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists [KUN]. This criticism often went beyond the bounds of propriety. People's Deputy of Ukraine Bohdan Boyko, the Ternopil Oblast chairman of Rukh, is particularly adept at this kind of attack. The language of his speech was more reminiscent of the old meeting bully than that of a civilized parliamentarian. These days, fewer people by far are impressed by the antilogical bullying that was customary at our meetings. In contrast to earlier years, populism no longer elicits ovations. The accents are slowly changing. Much more likely to be applauded are attempts to assess what has been accomplished and one's place in the scheme of things. Serhiy Odarych, a member of the Rukh Leadership, and People's Deputy of Ukraine Yevhen Zhovtyak from Kiev Oblast tried to do just that. Zhovtyak, in particular, underscored the need to rise above party egotism because the good of Ukraine must come before the party. He said that for Rukh, which aspires to be the leader of the people, winning seven percent of the seats in parliament is not a victory but a crushing defeat. The blame for this does not lie with the government, the URP, or the KUN, but with the party's style and system of work. In the opinion of the speaker, the party apparatus needs to be revitalized. The personal ambitions of Rukh's leaders at the rayon level were another reason for the party's defeat. Instead of searching out exceptional individuals from the democratic camp as a whole, automatic support was given to the rayon leaders. Serhiy Odarych is also inclined to regard the elections as a defeat. Only five of the 21 oblast chairmen won seats. For our part, we should add that most of Rukh's elected deputies are people who came into parliament in 1990. Serhiy Odarych pointed out a number of things that the party leadership had failed to do, and he urged Rukh to take the initiative in forming an alliance of national-democratic forces to create a single democratic organization. Following these two fundamentally divergent speeches, V. Chornovil ordered that a special, closed meeting of the Small Council of Rukh be convened. Meanwhile, the congress returned to its normal course of analyzing the election results and denying the notion of a defeat. A statement was adopted in which the reasons for the results of the election were analyzed. The results were deemed satisfactory. Criticism was levelled against the Ukraine Alliance. Rukh's regional organizations were instructed to begin preparations for elections to the local councils and the leadership of Rukh to begin preparing for the additional parliamentary elections, to initiate the creation of a bloc of democratic forces within the democratic corps of deputies, and to hold a meeting of the representatives of the national-democratic forces. But why not rely on already existing structures -- the Congress of National-Democratic Forces [KNDS] and the Ukraine Democratic Alliance? Apparently the stereotype of support for the mythical "party of power" poses an obstacle. There is also another reason, which I will discuss later. A meeting of parties and organizations that comprise the Ukraine Democratic Alliance was held on 14 April. This meeting was also attended by Leonid (Les) Tanyuk, a member of the Central Leadership of Rukh. The meeting resolved to extend its participants' best wishes to the Rukh congress and to take the initiative in calling for expanded cooperation. This mission was assigned to Levko Lukyanenko. To everybody's astonishment, the chairman of the Ukraine Democratic Alliance was not among the guests who spoke at the [Rukh] congress. In answer to my question, V. Chornovil replied that he did not know why Lukyanenko had not appeared. Invitations had supposedly been sent to everybody. It turns out that some were "forgotten." Lukyanenko's was one of these. This way the idea concerning the need to unify the [country's] democratic forces can be represented as coming from one side only. However, one can see with the naked eye that all of this is merely a subtle ploy in the struggle for absolute leadership. How then is this unity to be achieved? This question arises at all the crossroads of the political process. What we are seeing today is a very complex phenomenon -- the further along we move in the process of establishing a multiparty system, the more Bolshevism we encounter. Vyacheslav Chornovil no longer denies that Rukh is a party. It was precisely for the purpose of establishing this status and strengthening organizational discipline that a number of changes were made in Rukh's charter. In the Rukh leader's view, the election results would have been much more modest had they not decided in March of 1992 to rebuild Rukh structurally and conceptually into a party. The second day of the Rukh congress was devoted to issues pertaining to changing the charter and forming the leadership. The election of the new leadership of Rukh provoked a great deal of emotion. V. Chornovil, whose powers as chairman were extended by the congress back in December 1993, proposed electing the leadership by voting for a full slate of nominees. He nominated Oles Lavrynovych for the office of deputy chairman of Rukh. Mykhaylo Boychyshyn was proposed for another of the deputy chairman slots and for head of the secretariat. As his other two deputies, V. Chornovil chose Olena Bondarenko, a journalist from Luhansk, and Professor Robert Kartashov, a Russian. The congress participants demanded that the party leaders be voted for individually and not as a full slate. For some reason, this greatly angered the leader of Rukh, who argued that he had to work with these people. The quarrel about the way in which the vote should be held lasted much longer than the voting for individual candidates. It is difficult to explain this resentment of a dissenting position in light of the fact that at the stage of the formation of the national-democratic forces, V. Chornovil constantly used the tactic of taking an opposite and separate stand. Moreover, as the congress participants elected the nominated individuals without any problems. Passions really flared in the process of forming the Central Leadership. Once again, a list of candidates was proposed. Those present expressed their surprise that it did not include Professor Chernyak and the lawyer Holovatyy. The chairman of Rukh explained that S. Holovatyy had not taken part in the work of the Central Leadership since last year and that Professor Chernyak had chosen to run in the elections in a district that had not been approved by the leadership. Holovatyy, a member of the Central Leadership of Rukh for whom V. Chornovil had fought a bitter battle at the Fourth All-Ukrainian Congress, took part in the Fifth Congress as a guest. He expressed his resentment on this account in his speech. He rejected all accusations that he had failed to do his job in the Central Leadership and, instead, called the work of the Rukh leadership immoral. Inasmuch as all this results from internal animosities, I have no desire to enter into the real gist of this conflict, but it was precisely of immorality that the congress delegates accused S. Holovatyy. V. Chervoniy, the chairman of the Rivne organization of Rukh, added oil to the fire in the debate surrounding the president of the Ukrainian Legal Foundation by bringing up S. Holovatyy's writings against the Kiev Patriarchate. This ultimately tipped the scales. With 273 votes cast against him, S. Holovatyy did not make it into the Central Leadership. An experienced strategist, V. Chornovil immediately announced that he was prepared to forgive Holovatyy's apostasy if the latter promised to submission inside the Rukh faction. But submissiveness and S. Holovatyy are two incompatible concepts. Also missing from the list of individuals elected to the Central Leadership was S. Holovatyy's colleague, Valeriy Ivasyuk, on whose behalf V. Chornovil also waged a passionate battle in 1992. Under pressure from the delegates, Professor Chernyak was included in the list of members of the Central Leadership of Rukh, but he was elected only conditionally. As I followed the progress of the congress, it struck me that the much publicized leader of the opposition is skillfully ridding himself of opposition in his own party. Can it be that the opposition fears opposition? That is how I posed the issue at the press conference. V. Chornovil stated that this was my own subjective understanding of the situation. The incident involving Holovatyy was not grounds for such a conclusion. Perhaps, but I see this as a much broader problem that goes beyond a simple party incident. After analyzing all the nuances of Holovatyy's ouster and taking into consideration his personality, I believe that this step will have a negative effect on the process of establishing the Ukrainian multiparty system. Holovatyy will set about ruthlessly discrediting V. Chornovil as a politician at all levels, and this will lead to a conflict of generations that will not be confined to the bosom of the Rukh party. The beginnings of such a conflict were evident at the Rukh forum. As a result, I fully agree with the warnings expressed by Yuriy Badzyo in his thoughts against the current, "Let Us Not Commit Suicide in Vain!" Just as at the Rukh congress, passions ran high at the meeting of the URP leadership held on 16 April. However, these passions were aimed in a different direction. Levko Lukyanenko, the chairman of the Ukraine Democratic Alliance and honorary head of the URP, argued in favor of opposing the party of power. Other URP politicians and activists tried to analyze the situation. Questions were posed: where did they fail and why, with whom did they fail to agree and why? They primarily blamed themselves. The chairman of the URP stressed that the party cannot be a serious entity if it follows the tide rather than forming the political climate. Owing to objective and subjective circumstances, the URP was unable to create the climate needed to win, and therefore only seven percent of the candidates it fielded won seats in parliament. The leadership of the URP approached with restraint the idea of unifying political forces that had been expressed at the Rukh forum. Mykhaylo Horyn believes that the times are such that there is a real need for an alliance of ideologically close political structures. However, if there is a continued attempt to substitute Bolshevik-style annexation for unification, this issue will remain deadlocked. He also rejected the thesis posed by V. Chornovil at the Rukh congress that there can be no room for many kindred political forces in the same political niche. In M. Horyn's opinion, the niche is so large and there is so much work to be done that it is wrong to take this stand. The URP came up with the initiative to create a coalition of democratically oriented parties whose factions are represented in parliament. In addition to political parties, the coalition can include public organizations that are also represented in parliament. The goal of the coalition is to unite the patriotic forces in parliament so that they can coordinate their activities in lawmaking, statebuilding, forming the government, and passing the most important decisions affecting the state. The head of the coalition will be put forward for the post of prime minister. This initiative largely corresponds to that put forward by UKRAYINSKE SLOVO and the Olzhych Fund to create an anti-Kuchma front. It is onsonant with many of the voices heard at the Fifth All-Ukrainian Congress of Rukh. Apparently the leadership of Rukh views this issue differently. V. Chornovil is convinced that all the democratic forces, with the exception of Rukh, lost the elections and therefore the individual deputies will be forced to place themselves under his wing. Apart from the factor of pure ambition -- the monopoly on patriotism --which causes serious concern among nationally conscious journalists, this serves as dynamite for confrontation. Serhiy Holovatyy has already announced that he will form a faction parallel to Chornovil's. One of today's key issues is the presidential election set for 26 June. This matter was widely discussed both at the Rukh congress and among the leaders of the URP. Participants in both events urged that their parties not take part in this undertaking. As a last resort, they will support an acceptable candidate for the office of president. At the same time, they stressed that the greatest threat to Ukraine is the Kuchma-Hrynyov Interregional Reform Bloc, which speculates on pro-Russian sentiments and proclaims slogans that do not serve the national interests of Ukraine. It is therefore essential to concentrate all efforts on neutralizing this bloc. This struggle will prove less effective, because the corps of directors are more flexible than the orthodox Reds. It is no secret that Kuchma is the leading claimant to the presidential chair. As he announced at his press conference, he will try to win over even the rightist radicals (Khmara and the Ukrainian National Self-Defense Force [UNSO]) if their economic concepts coincide. In addition to Kuchma, O. Moroz, the leader of the Socialists, is also a candidate for the office. As the Central Election Commission has reported, the intention to put forward candidates has been announced by the Communists, the Civic Congress of Ukraine [GKU], the Labor Congress, the Christian-Democratic Party of Ukraine [KhDPU], and the DSU [State Independence of Ukraine]. Thus, only the vociferous radical structures are announcing their intention to join in the presidential race. However, in view of the fact that 6 May is the deadline for collecting signatures, it is difficult to imagine that many candidates will manage to collect the necessary number of signatures in time. It is quite possible that the presidential epic may end with the collection of signatures. Then the date of the election will automatically be postponed. For some reason, Ivan Plyushch, the speaker of the old parliament, takes an overly calm and optimistic approach to this. Ukraine could be considered to have gained if only two candidates remain on the ballot, because this would mean a contest to the end. But this would be a very costly game. It may well be that the leftists want to exhaust Ukraine with this game and thus produce tension and increase regional polarization. After all, none of them has a chance to win the presidential chair at this time. Yet each of them can serve as Ukraine's "Trojan horse." Given the situation, the desire of the radicals from the DSU to play at the presidency in the select company of the leftist radicals and the chauvinists from the GKU is a complete puzzle!
