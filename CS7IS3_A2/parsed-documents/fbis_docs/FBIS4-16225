In 61 regions, they are recognized as having taken place, and in 19 regions local parliaments have already been fully formed. Elections in another 11 regions and "by-elections" for 50 organs of power in the regions are to take place before the year is out. According to Central Electoral Commission information, 31.7 percent of the seats won belong to representatives of the executive power, 21 percent to directors of industrial enterprises, and more than 10 percent to "people prominent in agriculture." Nearly 10 percent of the seats have been won by white collar workers, journalists, etc. Lawyers have won as little as 2.5 percent of all seats. According to Nikolay Ryabov, the "Russia's Choice" bloc is in the lead for those elected from party lists (22 percent), trailed by the Communist Party (14 percent of the votes) and the Agrarian Party (7 percent). In the overwhelming majority of Federation components, however, deputies were elected in accordance with the majority system. According to officials of the Central Electoral Commission, "as little as 14 percent of candidates were nominated by electoral blocs, even fewer were registered, and still fewer were elected." Nikolay Ryabov did not deny media information that Communists posing as "independent candidates" were in the lead among the remaining 80 to 85 percent of the candidates. "In fact, when they describe themselves as independent, it is often hard for the voters to see who they really are," the Electoral Commission chairman complained in an interview for your SEGODNYA correspondent. He advised that the draft law "On the Fundamental Guarantees of Voting Rights of Russian Federation Citizens" contains a provision making it mandatory for all candidates to indicate their party affiliation "so as the voters will have no doubt." The draft law, constituting "framework" norms for regional election statutes, will soon be submitted to Boris Yeltsin and forwarded to the Public Chamber under the president. Next, Mr. Ryabov hopes, the president will introduce a corresponding "legislative initiative" to the State Duma, and the lower chamber would look at it before its summer recess.
