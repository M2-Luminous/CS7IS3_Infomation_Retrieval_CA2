The subsidy will by no means be like a dinner for Manu [a banquet for President Mauno (Manu) Koivisto]: Finland will have to contribute more than the same amount out of its own pocket. Nor will the money be given as a lump sum, but for carefully examined projects. If Finns' own funds and ideas run out, the flow of money from Brussels will also come to an end. The EU's latest offer of a new subsidy for sparsely settled areas came like a cold shower to the province governors. If the EU sticks to its offer, Finland will not get EU supersubsidy areas either. Only last November the regional subsidy offer was outlined during the negotiations with the EU as a way of making reparations for farm sector losses. Finland was promised altogether five of the most important EU areas, that is, category one areas. In many of the provinces they were already jumping for joy. At that time doubters had already raised the question as to what the subsidy funds could be used for. The EU grants category one aid for the development of infrastructure, that is, the construction of roads, communications networks, hospitals, and schools, among others. In Finland most of these have already been built. Eric Hayes, EU ambassador to Finland, recently also wondered at the emphasis placed on category one subsidies with reference to Finland's goals. According to him, [these subsidies] are not a "gold mine" for a country like Finland, which is already built up, especially since this aid also requires investments on one's own part. In Hayes' opinion, subsidies for rural areas could be more useful for Finland. Only One Fly in the Ointment What counts chiefly for regional aid per se in Finland are subsidies disbursed to businesses, funds granted to the provinces, and funds to promote jobs. These funds for regional development account for a total of over 3 billion markkas in the budget. Calculated in another way, over 20 billion can be found in the national budget. The money is in part transferred to the provincial governments on the basis of regional policy principles as aid for jobs, road-building funds, and supplementary aid for agriculture. EU regional policy would to a certain extent limit the subsidies Finland disburses to businesses, but it will not put a stop to them. Domestic regional policy will be preserved, but it will be transformed. Actually, the administration has for years now been shaping a system that conforms to the way EU funds are distributed. "Regional policy reform has really been effected precisely with EU funding in mind. And we are noticeably farther advanced in this than Sweden and Norway," regional development adviser Risto Tienari of the Interior Ministry boasted. In the national budget there are already in practice ready-made regional development subsidies, the national share of which required for EU projects can easily be separated from the rest. The EU share generally accounts for 50 percent at most. The EU grants only a small percentage of this for business ventures. Tienari does not believe that Finns will run out of ideas or money. He relies on the conviction that there will be enough meaningful infrastructure, education, and business projects over the next few years. Pohjois-Savo in the Vanguard There is optimism elsewhere than in the Interior Ministry as well. Several provincial associations are already groping for EU subsidies and mapping support bases. The Pohjois-Savo Association, among others, is in the vanguard of these efforts. Province manager Antti Mykkanen is counting on his province's getting the Varkaus area included in the aid for industrial areas in decline program. The EU would release 9.6 million markkas a year for it over a three-year period. The money could be used for, among other things, improvement of Varkaus-Joroinen Airport, repairing the Number 5 Highway, and investments in paper-making machines for the Ahlstrom Company. Mykkanen is also counting on getting 34 million markkas a year in rural area subsidies. This aid could be used for a joint Stromsdal Company and Koillis-Savo communities cardboard and lumber venture and the construction of an Iisalmi bypass road, among other things. If Finland gets its version of the new category six aid accepted, there would also be aid for the regional communities of Koillis-Savo and Yla-Savo, altogether about 70 million markkas, Mykkanen estimates. On the west coast the Satakunta Association has been so interested in the new subsidies that it has even tested out its calculations on the EU Commission. The association expects to get the Pori-Rauma area classified as an EU industrial area in decline. They could get 180 million markkas from the EU for various development projects, but Finland -- businesses, local communities, and the national government -- would also have to invest 900 million markkas. Will the State Cut Its Aid for Rural Areas? Mykkanen and his colleagues' enthusiasm over or realism with regard to the EU has given rise to terror in the Agricultural Producers Association (MTK), among others. There they estimate that the subsidies received from the EU would only cover a small part of the provinces' potential losses. The MTK's rural area man, Jukka Pekka Kataja, estimates that the regional aid provided by the EU would come to about a billion while, on the other hand, membership in the EU would reduce the state's revenue from taxes on manufactured goods and value-added tax by over 15 billion markkas. Kataja estimates that, as a result, the state will have to reduce its own investments in the regions corresponding to EU aid. "The EU's category one subsidy funds will account for maybe one-tenth of what the state itself uses for similar purposes, that is, for roads, education, unemployment relief, and environmental protection," Kataja compared the two. A report made in Sweden a couple of years ago estimates that EU membership will reduce the state's contributions to the provinces and that the number of public sector jobs will be considerably reduced. Because of the report, opposition to the EU increased among the Social Democrats, among others, and in the provinces. According to MTK estimates, farm sector gross income would drop by at least 500 million markkas in Pojhois-Savo. In that organization they believe that the drop in gross income will be reflected more extensively in rural sector activities. Province manager Mykkanen estimates that membership in the EU will cost Pohjois-Savo 400 million markkas. Of this, 300 million would be the province's share of Finland's EU membership fee. The drop in tax revenue from farmers would deprive the province of 100 million. Problems May Pile Up in Outlying Areas According to Mykkanen, EU membership would cause a "small dip" in the 1995-96 regional economy. After that, industry and tourism would begin to reduce the deficit. "We'll pull through any situation here, that's for sure," Mykkanen said optimistically. "But we won't accept the EU's offer regarding agriculture and regional policy." The Interior Ministry's Tienari feels that what is important in the negotiations with the EU is a solution to the agriculture problem that preserves production in at least eastern and northern Finland. "It is very important that there be as little change as possible in agriculture precisely there since it is in those areas that there are now already other major regional problems." Tienari noted that in some provinces primary production and the public sector provide employment for as much as from 50 to 60 percent of the work force. "If the number of public and farm sector jobs decreases at the same time, these problems may very quickly come to a head."
