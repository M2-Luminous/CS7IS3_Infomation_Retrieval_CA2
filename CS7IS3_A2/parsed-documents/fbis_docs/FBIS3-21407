That is how it always is with events so loathsome that people simply cannot absorb them. If we were to make a concerted effort to grasp this outrage in its true dimensions, we might well fall prey to the blackest bitterness for days on end. To gain some appreciation of this atrocity, which cannot be comprehended in full, let us suppose that such a thing had happened to Jews. I am attempting here to conjure up from our historical memory some anti-Semite driven by ideological hatred who breaks into a synagogue and indiscriminately shoots hundreds of Jewish worshippers at prayer on Yom Kippur, killing them for no reason other than that they are Jews. I recall a great many instances when Jews, by the hundreds and thousands, have been killed while praying, but not a single time when Jews killed others as they prayed. This demented murderer deliberately chose the hour of prayer as the hour of his murder. As a religious man, he completely understood what it means for a man to commune with his God, and precisely at that moment of the soul's purification, decided to unleash his welling hatred, that deadly hatred of his that had been burning within him all his life. Now we are trying to assess the effect of this murder on the peace process, which is the most pressing and fateful issue in the short term. Even so, beyond the consequences for the peace process, which shall be of short duration one way or another, we will be compelled to deal with the effect of this murder on our collective psyche, and in that respect the effect will be felt for a long, long time, even for generations. This is a subject that will be with us from now on because the murderer gave vent to dreadful impulses that continue to spread within a large part of our public. And this is a public much larger than we are ready to admit. Let us not delude ourselves. Goldstein is not an anathema as he ought to be for the entire nation of Israel. He is a hero for many, and not just in the Jewish community of Hebron. Many others are prepared to understand his motivations, rather than be shaken by what he did, and to find a thousand excuses for redeeming this maggot. We often speak of "the corrupting occupation," but we really do not mean a serious deterioration in norms or a steep decline in morality, but only petty backsliding bordering on breaking the rules of orderly administration. Accordingly, we must finally realize the tragic truth, that a large part of our citizenry has already been corrupted by the occupation to the depth of their souls. Anyone who does not believe that should ask the teachers who have discussed this issue with their students in Tel Aviv, Hertziliya, Haifa, Be'er Sheva, Jerusalem, and everywhere else in the country. The Goldstein virus has succeeded in infecting the bloodstream of too many Israelis for us to continue to feel at ease with the current state of affairs. Carriers of the virus do not exhibit any special outward signs as they meet us in daily life, but on the appointed day, a day of peace or of war, they are liable to inflict further calamities on us; and the disgrace will be ours then, too.
