This sums up the verdict issued by the International Court of Justice [ICJ] of the Hague. There were 16 votes for and only one -- obviously that of the temporary Libyan judge -- against. The ICJ's ruling is of course satisfactory to Chadian President Idriss Deby: [Begin recording] [Deby] The most important thing for us, under the circumstances, is that the law has been applied and also that this problem, which lasted too long and cost so many human lives, has been resolved peacefully. I am therefore happy with the outcome.... [Mohamed Youssoufou Saliou, interrupting] Mr. President, do you think that Libya will comply with this verdict, this important decision by the ICJ? [Deby] I believe so. Yes, I certainly believe, and, I would even say, I am convinced that Libya will keep its promises before the ICJ. From the moment when we jointly agreed to submit ourselves to the arbitration of the ICJ, we made a promise. Therefore, based on this promise, I am convinced that Libya will keep its promises to the ICJ. [end recording]
