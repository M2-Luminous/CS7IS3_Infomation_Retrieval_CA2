For example, some airplanes (STOL, T-4, etc.) and helicopters (BK117, etc.) were developed by using these useful technologies. This report presents the current status of these technologies in Kawasaki Gifu and the future roles respectively. 1. Introduction Serious wind tunnel testing and CFD work related to aerospace got underway at Kawasaki Heavy Industries Gifu at about the same time, namely in the late 1960's. Currently this work has progressed to a three-dimensional transonic wind tunnel and three-dimensional Navier-Stokes CFD analysis. During this time, we have made wind tunnel tests and CFD the two pillars of aerodynamic design, and have employed the two methods in various kinds of R&D and aircraft development (modification and new designs), particularly with experimental STOL aircraft, the T-4 jet trainer, and the BK117 helicopter. We obtained the initially targeted performance, and confirmed that the technology is effective. In this article we discuss the wind tunnel and CFD activities at Kawasaki Gifu and look at prospects for the future. 2. Kawasaki Wind Tunnel Tests The history of wind tunnel activities at the Gifu facility are diagrammed in Figure 1. Figure 1. Kawasaki Gifu Wind Tunnel Development Serious wind tunnel testing got underway in 1968 with the rebuilding and remodeling of the low-speed wind tunnel originally built in 1938. This wind tunnel facilitates both open and closed tests, with the closed configuration being usually employed in helicopter tests for rotor blow-down effect tests and the like. Subsequently, the two-dimensional smoke wind tunnel was brought on line in 1969 and the two-dimensional transonic wind tunnel in 1976. The smoke wind tunnel can readily capture flow phenomena, including separation flows, and can now handle force measurements also with the incorporation of a three-component balance scale. The two-dimensional transonic wind tunnel is used primarily in studies of airfoil aerodynamic characteristics, and was put to good use in designing the T-4 airfoils. The three-dimensional transonic wind tunnel was built in 1988 and can be used in a wide range of wind tunnel tests from low speed to transonic speed. This wind tunnel has a 1 m x 1 m measurement section, and was designed to share in common the models, stings, and measurement equipment with the supersonic wind tunnel of the same size at NAL. By using this wind tunnel in conjunction with the NAL supersonic wind tunnel, tests can be conducted continuously over a broad velocity spread, from low to high Mach speeds. The manifold pressure can be raised to 5 kg/cm[.sup]2[/], so, for a three-dimensional wind tunnel, this provides the highest Re numbers obtainable in Japan. The wind-tunnel features are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Kawasaki Gifu Wind Tunnels -- Low-Speed Wind Tunnel: Built 1938, rebuilt and remodeled 1968 (Open type); Measurement section: 2.5 m x 2.5 m; Maximum velocity: 60 m/s (Closed type); Measurement section: 3.5 m x 3.5 m; Maximum velocity: 30 m/s -- 2D Smoke Wind Tunnel: Built 1969; Measurement section: 0.1 m x 1.0 m; Maximum velocity: 30 m/s -- 2D Transonic Wind Tunnel: Built 1976; Measurement Section: 0.1 m x 0.4 m; Mach number: 0.5 x [sic] 1.2 -- 2D [sic] Transonic Wind Tunnel: Built 1988; Measurement section: 1.0 m x 1.0 m; Mach number: 0.2 to 1.4; Max. confluence pressure: 5 atmospheres; Re number: 2 x 10[.sup]7[/]; (H = 0.8, C = 0.3M) During this period, when broader-region wind tunnel tests needed to be conducted, we used the various NAL wind tunnels and foreign wind tunnels (RAE, NAE, CALAC, etc.), and worked hard to raise the level of our wind tunnel testing technology. 3. CFD at Kawasaki Gifu Kawasaki develops its basic aerospace software at the Gifu factory, and from that base also develops application software (for thermal flow analysis and blade/wing lattice/cascade analysis, etc.) in various fields for other divisions. When CFD is used in computer-based aerodynamic analysis and design, we can divide it into the sequential problem analysis in which flows around a shape are analyzed, and inverse problem analysis in which a design condition such as a pressure distribution is given and the shape is then derived. We will discuss these two approaches while focusing on developments and applications in the aerospace field. 3.1 Sequential Problem Analysis Sequential problem analysis came through lift line theory analysis and began with the two-dimensional panel analysis in 1970, about the same time that we at Kawasaki rebuilt the low-speed wind tunnel. It subsequently passed through the development of total-craft panel analysis, three-dimensional full potential flow analysis, total-craft Eulerian analysis, and full-total-craft Navier-Stokes analysis to the present stage of obtaining equilibrium flow analysis for ultrasonic flows (cf. Figure 2). Figure 2. Development of Sequential Problem Analysis As to the individual analyses, precision verification checks are performed, depending on the correspondences and so forth with the theoretical values and wind-tunnel test results, even after development, and improvements are still being made in expanding analysis software features, enhancing precision, and I/O data processing. We now noted some representative analysis results. We omit here any treatment of equilibrium flows because this is given detailed treatment in Reference 9. The panel method is based on non-viscous theory, but viscous effects can be considered too with the addition of a boundary layer. It is also possible to simulate separation flows by releasing eddies that satisfy the kutta conditions for each time step as diagrammed in Figure 3. In Figure 4 we have the development to jet flap analysis with the addition of aft jet flows, which is employed in the aerodynamic analysis of STOL aircraft. The panel method, while based on non-viscous theory, exhibits good correspondences with wind tunnel tests in regions where there is little separation. Accordingly, although the precision is less than with the differential method, the panel method requires less time for computation and input data preparation, and we believe it is still an effective design tool in parametric studies.[.sup]1[/] Figure 3. Example of Eddy Release Analysis Figure 4. Example of Jet Flap Lift Area Theory Analysis In Figures 5 through 7 we give typical examples of comparisons between wind tunnel test results and the results of Navier-Stokes (NS) analysis based on the differential and limited volume methods. With these methods, it is possible to conduct analyses over a wide range, from low to high Mach numbers, including viscosity. In Figure 5 we compare the calculations and tests on the ONERA M6 wing for the purpose of verifying the precision of three-dimensional NS analysis. Good agreement is exhibited, including the position of the shock wave. Figure 5. ONERA M6 NS Analysis Figure 6. Supersonic Intake NS Analysis Examples Figure 7. Vehicle Ground Effect NS Analysis Example In Figure 6 we show an example of the vent effect of a ramp and throat in a supersonic intake. An example of ground effect analysis is depicted in Figure 7 for a vehicle that incorporates a guideway. There is correspondence with the wind tunnel tests in the upper part of the diagram (with the guideway and ground moving together with the vehicle), while the lower part of the diagram corresponds with an actual vehicle (with the guideway and ground fixed, and only the vehicle moving). We see differences in separation and force between these two, and thus find that care must be exercised in handling the wind tunnel test data when inferring actual vehicle characteristics from the wind tunnel test results. We recently have been conducting studies on STOL craft, the HOPE, and the SST, as well as elemental analytical studies on flap gap effects.[.sup]2-7[/] Thus we see that, thanks to the development of software for the total-craft Euler method and total-craft NS method, the analytical capabilities have advanced far beyond those of the panel method. For this reason, we are now able to conduct fine flow studies and do simulations in modes that are not practicable with wind tunnels, although there is still the problem of precision when large separation is involved. Even with the advances in computers, much time is required from input data preparation to the finished analysis (so-called TAT time) (although we believe that two-dimensional analysis has now reached that level), and these problems need to be resolved before this method can be used in the design stage. 3.2 Inverse Problem Analysis In design work in which wind tunnel tests and CFD sequential problem solving is used, shape modifications and aerodynamic analyses are often repeated. With this approach, however, there is no guarantee that the design goals will be reached, and a great deal of time is required to obtain convergent solutions. For this reason, an indispensable tool for us designers is inverse problem analysis in which shapes are sought for given design target values. In the area of inverse problem analysis for airfoils, the methods of Sumiya and Wever have been around for some time. We at Kawasaki, however, were interested in inverse problem analysis for more general cases of high-lift devices, and so first developed a two-dimensional multiple-object inverse problem analysis technique based on the panel method, as diagrammed in Figure 8, and then brought in viscous effects by adding the boundary layer. Subsequently, based on this, we developed three-dimensional airfoil inverse problem analysis techniques which we use in designing main wings, inclusive of fuselage effects, and flaps (cf. Figure 9). For the SST wing design we developed inverse problem analysis techniques based on lift area supersonic theory. We also have improved design precision by employing Navier-Stokes inverse problem analysis in which the method of Takanashi is used. The example shown in Figure 10 is that of the design of a main wing which includes the USB engine.[.sup]8[/] Figure 8. Development of Inverse Problem Analysis Figure 9. Three-Dimensional Multiple-Body Inverse Problem Analysis Example Figure 10. Three-Dimensional NS Inverse Problem Analysis Example 4. Wind-Tunnel Tests and CFD In Table 2 we compare wind-tunnel tests and CFD in terms of various problematic categories. Table 2. Wind-Tunnel Tests (WTT) and CFD -- Reynolds number, Mach number: WTT: Limited (especially Reynolds number); CFD: Precision is problematic, but yields solutions that correspond to Re numbers, Mach numbers of actual craft -- Flow Simulation (separation flows): WTT: Can obtain actual flows (yields solutions that include stall); CFD: Limited with respect to physical model (analysis comprehending large separation is very difficult) -- Interference Problems (air flow turbulence): WTT: Wind-tunnel tests are very difficult; CFD: Can obtain ideal solutions -- Preprocessing: WTT: Model design and fabrication is costly and requires many days to do; CFD: Low cost, but grid generation, etc., is time-consuming -- Productivity: WTT: High productivity; CFD: High productivity if panel method; low productivity if differential method or limited volume method -- Reproducibility: WTT: Depends on model precision, configuration set[tings], and wind tunnel wall correction method, etc.; CFD: Depends on physical model, grid(s), etc. -- Effects on Design: WTT: Requires trial and error repetitions; CFD: Can improve design program and shorten times using design code (inverse problem analysis) With wind tunnel tests one cannot obtain real craft Re numbers, but one can obtain real flows that include separation, and productivity is high compared to CFD. With CFD, on the other hand, there are still problems with analyzing large separation flows and with data productivity, but there are no restrictions which wind tunnels have (support/wall interference, ground effect, etc.), and one can obtain solutions in a form close to actual flight conditions. But with wind tunnel testing one can easily ascertain fine flow details, such as is necessary with sophisticated design technology and instruments. We believe that the trend toward CFD is very pronounced, and that an increasingly large role will be played by CFD in more and more areas, including aerodynamic design. In the near future, however, wind tunnel and CFD precision will continue to be cross-checked, CFD will be used in analyzing phenomena which arise in wind tunnels, and the two approaches will continue to coexist. It is therefore desirable that there be close communication between technicians employing these two methods, in complementary ways, in the future. Designers need to be cognizant, at every design phase, of the relative merits of the two technologies in terms of such things as productivity, applicability, precision, and cost, so as to be able to make the most effective use of both. In particular, in the interest of making designs with good precision, we must thoroughly understand the degrees of approximation and simulation which CFD provides, so as to appreciate the scope of applicability. 5. Concluding Remarks The biggest problem with wind tunnel tests is the failure to achieve actual aircraft Re numbers with wind tunnel Re numbers. For this reason, in order to grasp actual craft characteristics, one must rely on Re number extrapolations, with which accurate estimates are very difficult. This being so, as can be seen in Boeing's keen interest in building a high-Re number wind tunnel, we believe that the demand for wind tunnels providing Re numbers near those of actual aircraft will continue. On the other hand, there are still problems with CFD sequential problem analysis, such as the ability to analyze flows which include large separation, the long TAT times, and solution reproducibility. We now need to re-evaluate turbulence models, shorten preprocessing times using non-structural grid techniques, and study dependencies using grids. We are working in the area of non-structural grid techniques, having perfected software for two-dimensional NS analysis and working on the application of this to three-dimensional NS analysis. Furthermore, by improving CFD inverse problem analysis techniques, it has become possible to make design work more effective and more highly precise. In order to make possible dramatic design breakthroughs, however, we also think that the design goals and pressure distributions, etc., determined on the basis of conventional designer experience and know-how, need to be theoretically studied, as is seen in the optimized pressure distribution.[.sup]10[/] References 1.
