The AWB's finance committee said in a statement it was not surprised by the collapse of the financial and commercial rand as the AWB had predicted this in a statement several weeks ago. "It is significant that the sale of Kruger Rands has increased by 1,000 per cent over the past few months. This has been caused by the liberals of big business, despite their apparent communist sympathies, suddenly taking fright at the policies which they have been propagating all along," the statement said. "They simply preach one thing and practise another. The flight of capital out of this country is horrendous. We now predict a further fall in the Rand [R], both financial and commercial, as we slip deeper into the financial abyss." The AWB said that with debts of R209 billion, South Africa was on the verge of becoming "another third world (if not a `no world') tin pot banana republic, ignored and laughed at by the civilised world". The Boer people had to "get rid of this government and once again make our fatherland a home for our children. If this does not happen, our children will suffer a fate too ghastly to contemplate".
