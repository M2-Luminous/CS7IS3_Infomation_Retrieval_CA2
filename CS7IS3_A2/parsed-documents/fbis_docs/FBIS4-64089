We must not save or make money on the defenders of our homeland," Air Major-General Nikolay Bezborodov, vice-chairman of the Duma Defence Committee, told ITAR-TASS today. He noted that trips of MPs to garrisons of the Far Eastern Military Area and to the Northern Fleet have confirmed that minimum funds, sufficient only for every-day needs, are being allocated to the military establishment. This calls in question the proper organisation of military training and the protection of Russia's interests and security. The materials of the investigation, Bezborodov said, have been submitted to the Defence Council of the State Duma, to the government, and to the president of the Russian Federation. The committee is sure that it is necessary to radically revise the financing of the Armed Forces. The situation when servicemen and the civilian personnel are not paid their salaries for 2-3 months running can by no means be regarded as normal. This creates a tense situation in some garrisons, where the families of servicemen live only on Army cash allowances. Bezborodov said that the president's stand on the military budget was clear. He wants minimum funds to be allocated, which would keep the combat readiness of the Armed Forces at the needed level, would ensure the survival of the military science and purchases of the needed armaments. The president is sure that this is the duty of the state. "The privileges accorded to servicemen should neither be expanded nor curtailed," the vice-chairman of the Duma Defence Committee stressed. Reports have appeared that the Russian Government was allegedly proposing to pay minimum compensation for the present food rations. Defence Ministry experts have made corresponding calculations, which showed that in this case all the servicemen would prefer to get food rations instead of money. This will be much more expensive to the state. "The committee will approach these problems most seriously," the general stated.
