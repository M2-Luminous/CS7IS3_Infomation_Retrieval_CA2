In his words, "these ships are being build at the Ukrainian shipyards and have nothing in common with the Black Sea Fleet." In his interview with INTERFAX on Wednesday Vice Admiral Baltin declared that a total of 35 percent of the Fleet had been already transferred to Ukraine and "the remained 65 percent are to be divided." The official in the presidential administration declared that "in accordance with the agreements reached in Yalta, Zavidovo, Massandra, and Moscow, the Black Sea Fleet ships and crafts will be divided on a 50-50 basis." About 20 percent of ships and crafts needed for Ukraine's defense will be assigned to it, he said. "The remaining 30 percent can be sold to any other country, including Russia," he pointed out.
