The source said circulation of such unfounded news is in line with sinister plots aimed at distorting the image of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the world. A former commander of the U.S-led multinational forces in Somalia had claimed last Saturday that Aidid supporters receive arms from Iran, Sudan and Iraq. The source also denied claimes by an Arabic weekly that Iran held clandestine talks with the Czech Republic for the purchase of Russian weapons.
