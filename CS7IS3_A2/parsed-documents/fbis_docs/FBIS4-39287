Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, head of the Maritime Territory administration, held a ceremonial reception on the occasion. "Of all the regions of Russia, the Far East has one very important advantage: Geographically, it is part of the Asian Pacific region," the governor stressed in his speech at the ceremonial reception. "The enormous natural wealth of the territory, combined with the lengthy experience of development in market economy conditions accumulated by South Korea, create a favorable medium for the implementation of mutually beneficial projects." In a reply speech, the Korean president noted that, "on the threshold of `the Pacific era', the Maritime Territory is becoming a genuine center of Korean-Russian cooperation. Effective joint activity is already under way--first and foremost in the field of fishing. Cooperation is being developed in other spheres as well. In particular, the Nakhodka industrial and technical park is being set up for Korean enterprises. A sea route linking Pusan and the Maritime Territory has been opened. Regular flights will start between Vladivostok and Seoul this year." "Thus," Kim Yong-sam also noted, "it will be possible to fly from the Republic of Korea to Russia in just two hours, and this means that we will become closer neighbors." In the afternoon, the president of South Korea and the officials accompanying him will visit the headquarters and one of the ships of the Pacific Fleet.
