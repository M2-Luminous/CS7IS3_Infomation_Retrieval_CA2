The absence of any results so far after several months of talks by the Commission for Government and Local Self-Government Affairs gave another cause for concern. The assembled delegates representing local self-government bodies decided to take advantage of President Lech Walesa's offer and voted to transform the loose representation of local self-government structures (comprising 36 delegates) into the President's Council for Local Self-Government Affairs. In compliance with the president's suggestion, communicated to the meeting by Prof. Lech Falandysz, the Council elected Professor Maria Gintowt-Jankowicz, director of the National School of State Administration, to the office of chairman. We asked Krakow President Jozef Lassota, member of the new council and local self-government activist, for a general assessment of the current situation arising from the government's attitude to local self-government structures, a situation that was described during the meeting as "a dialogue of the deaf." [Lewandowski] How would you comment on the difficulties, reported here by delegates, in achieving a measure of agreement between local self-government structures and central government? [Lassota] I believe that the government's attitude to local self-government structures can be defined today as a trend following logically from the government's overall philosophy of the methods of state administration. The present government has already demonstrated quite clearly that it is opposed to decentralization. Instead, it favors centralization of state structures. Both Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak and Minister Michal Strak, head of the Council of Ministers' Office, state officially that they are in favor of decentralization of power. However, we note that, in practice, they pursue a completely different policy. In other words, they say one thing and do another. Attempts by self-government bodies to conduct a dialogue with the central government are not even like a dialogue of the deaf. I would say, quite simply, that we are being cheated. I believe that the government does not even try to play fair with either local self-government bodies or with the public. It is dishonest of the government not to declare openly what it really wants to do. I have arrived at this opinion of the state of affairs, among other things, on the basis of the talks between representatives of central government and local self-government structures in which I have been taking part. We have not been able to come to an understanding for long months now. As far as I am concerned, it is quite obvious. We can see from this that we will never come to an agreement on any vital issues. [Lewandowski] But surely the Office of the Government Plenipotentiary for the Reform of Public Administration is still in existence and in operation, is it not? [Lassota] The fact that the function of plenipotentiary for the reform of public administration is still extant serves only as a smokescreen for the government, designed to suggest that something is being done. In truth, the role of the government plenipotentiary has been reduced to that of a minor official who does not have even the power to bring about the realization of the decisions that had already been prepared for implementation by the previous government. As far as local self-government structures are concerned, this is just another fact attesting to the central government's hostility to all reforms concerning local self-government. [Lewandowski] How would you evaluate the realization of the so-called "pilot program"? [Lassota] All decisions the present government made in connection with this program are drastically curtailed in relation to the original version and were only made under pressure from local self-government bodies and public opinion. We began to put the pilot program together in the middle of 1993. It officially came into effect on 1 January 1994. For the past two months, we have encountered nothing but a string of official difficulties. Let me give you just one example concerning both the financial and legal angles of our operations: First of all, we encounter continuous "piling up" of difficulties hampering the transfer of funds to projects envisaged in the program; in addition, the sources supplying finance for the program are regularly blocked. Moreover, to date, voivodas have not received appropriate instructions concerning the pilot program, and, as a result, they are unsure whether they are really supposed to support the pilot program or to reject it. Those who have the courage to assist us on their own initiative have been doing it regardless of the difficulties. Others, though, do not do anything to help us in our operations, and, consequently the whole scheme has so far reached a deadlock. The above examples demonstrate clearly that the government does not intend to accept responsibility for the realization of the pilot program. It is possible that this is a deliberate "preelection action" designed to undermine the forthcoming local self-government election campaign. It may be that, after the election, the situation will change, but, knowing the central government's general attitude toward these matters, I doubt it very much.
