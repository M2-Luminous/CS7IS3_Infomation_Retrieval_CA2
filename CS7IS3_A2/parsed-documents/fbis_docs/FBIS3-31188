Dlouhy said he would ask for the Customs Union Council to be called. Slovakia was attempting to protect the balance of payments by misusing technical obstacles to trade in a situation where such steps were indefensible, he said. The Czech Republic was informed of the measure only 24 hours before it came into effect, he said. Slovakia had merely carried out its formal obligations, but usually in similar cases the supplier is given more time to adapt to the new conditions, Dlouhy said. The Customs Union Agreement allows either country to take such a measure if it is essential for "the protection of life or health of people, animals or plants," he pointed out, but in his view this was not the case. The measure is directed against all countries not just the Czech Republic, he added.
