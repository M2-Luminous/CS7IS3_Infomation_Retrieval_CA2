Kolosova, and others] [Text] If in terms of politics the Group of Seven has grown into a Group of Eight, in economy this is going to happen only when Russia actually becomes an inseparable part of the international economic system. This was stated in a Wednesday interview with Interfax by Sergey Chestnoy who is in charge of economic cooperation with G7 at the Russian Foreign Ministry. He said an economic G8 is out of the question now because Russia is not a full member of the GATT or the OECD. Neither should it be forgotten that Russian economic reforms have still a long way to go, Chestnoy said. The diplomat believes the economic G7 can expand to G8 in the foreseeable future. "If everything goes O.K., such a transformation is possible already in three years", he said. The official told Interfax that on July 9 the Naples summit is going to discuss economic matters. On the following day it will be joined by President Boris Yeltsin and focus on political problems, in particular the situation in Bosnia, Iraq, the Korean peninsula and Southern Africa. Chestnoy also said that after the political debate the leaders of eight countries will focuss on the situation in Russia and the progress of reforms. At the end of the meeting the Italian representative chairing the meeting is going to make a political statement on behalf of the rest stating the main points of the debate, the diplomat reported.
