The meeting addressed developments on the local scene in light of the final endorsement of the accord document on 10 Ramadan [20 February] in Amman, capital of fraternal Jordan. The General Committee praised the role played by His Majesty King Husayn Bin-Talal in bolstering Yemeni unity and ending the political crisis suffered by our people over the past months. The General Committee asserted that all efforts should be made to immediately begin practical implementation of the accord document. The Political Forces Dialogue Committee said that once the document is finally endorsed, it becomes binding and ends the crisis. The GPC General Committee further stressed the need for the state's legislative and executive agencies to reassume their duties. This step is a must to begin the implementation of the accord document. Any attempt to prevent Constitutional bodies from reassuming their duties means circumventing the document and weaseling out of its implementation, despite signatures witnessed by local and foreign public opinion. Reviewing developments in the local arena, the General Committee took note of the military escalation that started on the eve of the signing of the document and the subsequent actions in the Abyan Governorate in particular. The citizens of the Abyan Governorate are facing unwarranted attacks and provocations by the military units that were moved from the Hadhramaut and Aden governorates in the direction of Abyan. This was done in violation of the accord document, which stipulates freezing any military moves, and in violation of the responsibilities of national duty, which require creating a suitable climate to immediately move to the practical implementation of the accord document. The GPC General Committee asserted that all efforts should be made to avoid any new escalation in this regard and work to return all military units to their previous positions and take to task all those who are behind the military escalation. The purpose of this is to protect citizens and maintain the noble national missions of our Armed Forces, which we deem a bulwark that protects the homeland and its sovereignty and ensures the citizens' safety and security. The General Committee urged the people, their valiant Armed Forces, all political parties and organizations, mass and other organizations, and ulema and social figures to stand united against those who advocate disunity and those who sow sedition and against all attempts to return to the situation that prevailed before 22 May 1990. All should stand united in defense of unity and democracy and in defense of social peace and the homeland's national interests and to prevent bloodshed and safeguard citizens' rights, security, and stability. Reviewing the general situation in light of the aftereffects of the crisis, the General Committee also urged all state bodies and central and local institutions to exert more efforts in order to alleviate the citizens' living hardships. It also urged these bodies and institutions to make their first priority the lifting of all forms of suffering and putting an end to all manifestations of corruption and security violations. This is meant to ensure a strict enforcement of the law, without any hesitation or going easy on violators. Concluding its meeting, the General Committee urged all members of the GPC and all its leadership and base cadres to promote their relations with the masses, adhere to the accord document, and promote awareness of the content of this document between the citizens. The document is a national program for the coming stage. It bolsters the unity of the people and the homeland and protects their democratic march that is based on political and party pluralism, peaceful transfer of power, and respect for the bodies of constitutional legitimacy that expresses the people's free will. The General Committee highly appreciated the efforts of the GPC representatives in the Political Forces Dialogue Committee, stressing the need to support the committee's efforts in the present stage. Now that the document is signed, the committee will follow up on the implementation of the document. During the meeting, the General Committee made several organizational decisions. It also issued a press statement.
