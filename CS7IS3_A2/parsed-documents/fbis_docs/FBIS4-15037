Omelchuk first asks about relations between Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and Plyushch, which lately seem to have become "somewhat strained." He says: "Mr. Kravchuk recently said: Ivan Stepanovych and I do not disagree in principle. Do you share this opinion of the president?" Plyushch replies: "First of all, I would sincerely like to say that I completely share this opinion and believe that not only do we not disagree in principle, but Leonid Makarovych and I have virtually never had any strategic differences about who we are and where we are going. Leonid Makarovych and I have had tactical differences." Answering a question on forecasts of the run-off parliamentary election outcome, Plyushch says: "I would like to say, you know that this is no longer a forecast but almost reality. It was a forecast when I met European and world representatives who came to observe our elections. I then said I was convinced that elections would take place in the majority of constituencies. I am happy -- I did not expect it and I am also pleasantly surprised -- that elections took place in all 450 constituencies." He goes on: "It is now my deep conviction -- which was also demonstrated by the experience of the 34 constituencies where the elections were held on 2-3 April, when 29 out of 34 constituencies did elect their people's deputies -- this is why I have every ground to believe that a viable Supreme Council of Ukraine will have been elected (?some time) by 10 April." Having praised the political wisdom of the people of Ukraine, Plyushch reiterates that the election will produce a capable team coming to the newly-elected legislature. Asked how soon he thinks that the new parliament will be convened, Plyushch replies that, after the final run-offs on 10 April, he expects the results to be known on 12-13 April. He continues: "According to the law, the Central Electoral Commission has 10 days to verify the validity and legitimacy of elections. Thus, ideally, we will have the final results by 20 April. Then someone, probably the Supreme Council Presidium, which will meet on 12 April, has to make a decision on the convocation of a new session, the first session of the newly-elected Supreme Council. The law says it should take place within two months of the election. Imagine, two months from 10 April is 10 June. I think it would be proper to act in accordance with the situation in society. This situation, I believe, requires the soonest possible convocation of the first session of the new parliament, and I think a decision will be made to convene it within a fortnight." Considering the number of public holidays in early May, May Day, Orthodox Easter,and Victory Day, he suggests that the new parliament session should start around 12-15 May. Omelchuk then asks what the parliament speaker believes the future status of the Ukrainian Republic will be -- presidential, parliamentary, or a mixed one -- and where he feels the parliament's preference lies. Plyushch replies: "As a citizen and a deputy of the new parliament, but not more than that, I believe our Republic so far has been neither presidential, parliamentary, nor a mixed one. It has been too jumbled up. I don't want you to think I am blaming the Supreme Council, the president, the presidium or anyone else. This is the way that society has been. I think we did the right thing to introduce the presidency, and the fact that Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk was elected the first popular president was the best option, but then the president had to take over executive power and establish order. The law on local self-government that was adopted made it difficult because it did not allow him to directly control the regions. That's why the president wanted to set up vertical structures to implement legislation, and we passed the law on presidential representatives. Some would say it was redundant, but I don't think so." Discussing further the problems of the power structure, Plyushch points out that, although necessary at the time, presidential representatives ran into conflict with the law on regional self-government and interfered with the powers of local councils. "We need a clear-cut system of executive and representative power in the regions, from the village to the oblast, before we deal with the Republic." To that effect, he says, the Supreme Council has passed three laws, on the formation of local bodies of power and self- government, on the status of local council deputies, and on local council elections. "What is taking place is a political reform through which the people, from the village to Kiev, will receive full power. The Republic's legislature plus local executive bodies will provide the people with full power. As for the president, he is already popularly elected." Omelchuk then asks: "Some politicians believe that it is expedient to hold the election of the president of Ukraine after the new constitution of Ukraine is adopted. What is your opinion?" Plyushch replies: "Well, first, there is nothing new about this view, you know. There is a variety of opinions, you know. Some believe that the fundamental law -- the Constitution -- should be adopted first and then other laws should be adopted. This is the (?lawyers') opinion. There is another one affirming that it cannot be done. "I say that it is good that there are opinions. We, however, have worked on all these opinions jointly with the president. You known that we have been working as cochairmen of the constitutional commission for two years. For the last two years now, we have been working as cochairmen and have been trying to do everything to bring about the Constitution as soon as possible. We submitted it for consideration in its first reading, however, and received 70,000 comments and proposals. How could we not discuss them? By the time we had systemized them, the Constitution looked entirely different. We published it for consideration in its second reading. Already we have received over 10,000 comments and proposals on the latest version that was published. "That is why one cannot be in a hurry with the constitution and I believe that this Supreme Council's deputies did the right thing in that they initiated and worked up the draft and passed it to the next (?Supreme Council). That is, our constitution will already have been worked on by the Supreme Councils of two convocations. Otherwise, had it been adopted by that Supreme Council, people would have said it was adopted by the procommunist Supreme Council. Now, this will be a Supreme Council elected in the independent, democratic Ukraine and this Supreme Council will see whether it is expedient to present separate provisions in the constitution to a referendum. This will be decided by the Supreme Council. "In other words, I am not a supporter of those linking the presidential election with the new Constitution." The focus of the interview then switches to the economy. On the devaluation of the population's savings, Plyushch states: "Once we are delimiting functions, one should clearly realize that this devaluation was caused by the situation, rather than by the Supreme Council. I could not even say this was done by the government. Regardless of who did this, however, this is sheer robbery of the population of Ukraine by the power structures and by the existing situation." He continues: "The government must exclude from privatization and estimate that part of state property and means of production which are subject to privatization, so as to sell them and pay some money into people's savings accounts and index-link their deposits so that they will correspond with the purchasing power of the value of the money that was in their savings accounts on 1 January 1992 when we became a state." Asked to say when the people's living standards are likely to improve tangibly, Plyushch responds: "I believe that the people will see an improvement in their economic well-being as the national economy rises, while the national economy is impossible to run without introducing national currency and regulating the financial and credit system." He adds: "I believe the new Supreme Council will need a maximum of one month to form a new government and it will take the new government until the second half of this year to look round and present its stabilization program and a program which would provide for the introduction of our own currency. It is then that stabilization will be perceptible." Omelchuk's next questions concern the situation in Ukraine's southern and eastern regions, following plebiscites in Crimea, Donetsk, and Lugansk on their status in Ukraine. Asked to comment on the legislative confrontation between Kiev and Crimea, Plyushch says: "Nobody can blame the Russian-speaking population in Crimea who came to live there and who now say that economic integration with Russia is the only way, and nobody can blame the 30 percent of Ukrainian speakers in Northern Crimea. President Boris Yeltsin and a Supreme Council delegation signed an interstate agreement on 16 November 1992, and a trilateral statement has been signed by presidents Kravchuk, Yeltsin, and Clinton recognizing the states' existing borders without any territorial claims. At the interstate level, Crimea is not an issue. It is an issue in Crimea itself, and among certain political forces in Russia. I believe that this issue will be resolved in Ukraine's favor only when Ukraine's national economy will be more helpful to Crimea's economy." Efforts have already been made to assist Crimea with the spring sowing campaign. Plyushch continues: "The Crimean population can see it for themselves: If they do join Russia tomorrow, then what? Russia has its own problems. Even the famous ZIL, the Likhachev automobile plants, closed down yesterday. Will it come and open a plant in Crimea? Only Meshkov can think so, because he is promised financial aid from certain chauvinist forces if he rules the right way. We'll see in a year what kind of aid he gets. I would be only pleased if some kind of aid comes to Crimea from Russia, at least in the way of oil. "How can we make Crimea comply with the law? Well, if someone does not comply with the law, than legal measures have to be taken. If the president of Ukraine has issued a decree and this decree is not obeyed, then the president's next step should contain measures against the one who did not obey." Commenting on the issue of dual citizenship and two state languages, debated in east Ukraine, Plyushch says that a state cannot have two emblems, two citizenships and two languages. "This would only contribute to confrontation between our regions. If we continue with these referendums, then we will end up with one emblem in west Ukraine, another emblem in Lugansk, and what will the state emblem be in Kiev? Something else? "People need a good life. If we had a good life, I am deeply convinced, there would be no questions about the language, the emblems, and the citizenship. We have failed to provide this kind of life, and people feel uncertain." Asked about the prospect of Ukraine joining the ruble zone in the CIS, Plyushch replies: "There will be no ruble zone ever again. Forget it. There are not enough rubles to go around in Russia. They promised to cook up a ruble zone for Belarus, six months have passed, and nothing has happening. If Belarus is part of the Russian banking system, Belarus will be a branch of the Russian Central Bank, but I don't think Belarus will agree to this. Maybe only certain forces in Belarus, but not the country on the whole, because that would be the end of a nation. "But if you mean the single economic space, we never left it. Ukraine, thank God, already has a surplus of butter, meat, and other products. Why not sell them to Russia or Uzbekistan? They have to be paid for, but neither Ukraine nor Russia has the means to pay. And that's a different matter altogether." In conclusion, Ivan Plyushch thanks Ukrainians for voting in the first round of elections and urges them to come to the polls to elect the rest of the parliament on 10 April for the sake of reform and stabilization.
