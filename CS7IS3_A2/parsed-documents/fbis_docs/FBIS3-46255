Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod said he was "disappointed" by Beijing's threat the day before not to honor debts or contracts linked with Chek Lap Kok airport which straddle 1997, when Hong Kong reverts to China. "We are quite sure that the best way to make progress on the airport financing issue is to talk about it in the airport committee," Macleod told reporters. "That's the best way of finding a solution." Government sources, requesting anonymity, spoke more forcefully. "The statement doesn't change anything at all," one of them said. "We're single-minded about talking with them before the next crisis occurs... The longer the delay, the greater the cost for all concerned -- especially for Hong Kong." China has failed to respond to a formal British request on January 17 to reconvene the airport committee of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, charged with overseeing the 20.3 billion U.S. dollar project. Instead it put out a statement Tuesday damning Governor Chris Patten's administration for securing 1.67 billion Hong Kong dollars (216 million U.S.) in stop-gap financing from legislators to keep the vast project going. China, it warned, "will not be liable for any expenditure and debt incurred by building the new airport," nor would it honor airport-related contracts or laws straddling 1997 -- which is also the year Chek Lap Kok is due to open. Britain agreed in a September 1991 pact to consult China on airport financing, but talks soon fell victim to Patten's effort to make Hong Kong's political insitutions more democratic ahead of the 1997 return to Beijing. Macleod said he drew "some encouragement" from the statement's final paragraph, which stressed that Beijing "has always supported the construction of a new airport in Hong Kong." But he and other government officials were bewildered by its allegation that the project so far would leave the post-1997 Hong Kong Chinese administration with debts in excess of 45 billion dollars (5.82 billion U.S.). In fact, no money has been borrowed for Chek Lap Kok, one of the world's biggest public works projects, comprising not only the airport, but also a high-speed railway and new highways and bridges. "They haven't borrowed a single cent yet," the government source said. Besides, the 1991 Sino-British understanding on which the allegation was based referred to debt raised by the Hong Kong government -- not by government-owned corporations that will run the airport and railway. While the war of words rages on, work continues 24 hours a day -- and, officials say, well on schedule -- at Chek Lap Kok, an outlying island one hour by boat from central Hong Kong that is shrouded by a fog of dust whipped up by giant yellow bulldozers and dump trucks. Site reclamation director Frans Uiterwijk told foreign reporters that nearly 40 percent of the site preparation work has so far been completed by a multinational consortium of six companies -- including one owned by China. "For the bulk (of the site work), I don't see any problem," he said, confident that the task will be completed in February 1996 -- clearing the way for the first of two runways to be laid. A deep hole the size of several football fields marks where the futuristic terminal building will be, pending foundation work to begin after contracts are awarded in March.
