This is the European Commission president's response, as recorded by Michel Barthelemy: [Begin Delors recording] Given the point reached in the conflict, I would like to take my responsibility and say yes, hoping that this pressure would allow the peace process -- which is close to fruition -- to resume. This involves a 2 percent readjustment of the Serbian territory in order to allow the Muslims to have a viable state. The Bosnian Serbs and Croats have obtained satisfaction. Therefore, this pressure is part of the peace process. I regret that a solemn warning had not been given before to those who have introduced the ideology of death that is ethnic cleansing. Today, things are what they are. Let us not return to the past. There is no point in doing so. I hope that this pressure will make everyone think and realize that they have more to lose than gain in pursuing the conflict. [end recording]
