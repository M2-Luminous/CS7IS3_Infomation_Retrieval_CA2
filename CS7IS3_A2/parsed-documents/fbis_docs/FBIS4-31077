[Kacin] Our job is to reduce the possibility of military conflicts on the territory of Slovenia to a minimum. This is only possible if we can also deter an opponent that is superior in strength. We would have to invest in the early detection of the enemy and in reconnaissance, that is, to buy radar facilities and develop our air defense. We will not get this equipment unless the embargo is lifted. The embargo is a political problem because, as a UN member, we have a duty to defend ourselves, but this organization deprives us of the opportunity. We are suffering from the embargo against rump Yugoslavia, although we are participating in it. Moreover, we cannot choose our neighbors. We do not only have borders with states like Austria, but also with such as are involved in military conflicts. The lifting of the arms embargo is a must for our road to Europe, all the more so since Slovenia cannot threaten anyone by its size, but will only ensure its security. [Kobenter] What would be the strength of a Slovene Army that is fit for military service? [Kacin] It is very limited, we draft about 12,000 recruits every year. This number cannot threaten anybody, although our army would be stronger in the case of mobilization. (In the war of 1991 the territorial defense forces had about 60,000 men -- the editors) [Kobenter] Could you imagine a neighbor like Croatia trying to solve its differences with Slovene by force of arms? [Kacin] It depends on the parties involved. In 1991 we showed that we are very good at our defense tasks and we would do it again. However, something completely different is at stake for Slovenia: integration with Europe. Any conflict would be a step backward. In the next eight years we want to invest 1 billion German marks in securing our airspace. [Kobenter] Also in aircraft? [Kacin] Yes. Twelve aircraft should be enough for us. But radar facilities and defensive systems should also be procured. [Kobenter] ...which could also be bought on the black market. [Kacin] No, by no means. First of all, we are only interested in the legal way of procurement because we consider ourselves a member of the international community of states. Second, you cannot buy aircraft on the black market. And, in view of the small amounts and our defense needs, the objections that our arms might turn up on the theater of war are an illusion. [Kobenter] As a conclusion, you would also have to oppose the lifting of the embargo against Bosnia and Croatia. [Kacin] As defense minister, I can only speak for Slovenia. I would welcome it if one of the states that developed from Yugoslavia's disintegration and whose name I do not want to mention were to sign the "Partnership for Peace" agreement. This would be a security guarantee. [Kobenter] Are you also planning accession to the military alliance of the European Union [EU] in the long run? [Kacin] It depends on the future restructuring of NATO and the Western European Union. If you look at Slovenia from Europe, you get a completely different view from the one you get if you look at it from the United States through the prism of Moscow. We have not set out on the road to Europe to persist in self-restraint like Albania. We want to develop more quickly and live better. [Kobenter] What could future cooperation with Austria be like, also in view of Austria's efforts for entry into the EU? [Kacin] We signed a cooperation treaty a year ago. Our soldiers participate in joint military competitions and we benefit from the exchange of experience. Later, we will also be able to talk about joint maneuvers.
