FR941020-2-00008 FR941020-2-00006 Preliminary Results of the Review As a result of our review, we preliminarily determine that a margin of 60 percent exists for Rhone Poulenc for the period January 1, 1993 through December 31, 1993. Parties to the proceeding may request disclosure within five days of the date of publication of this notice. Any interested party may request a hearing within 10 days of publication. Case briefs and/or written comments from interested parties may be submitted not later than 30 days after the date of publication. Rebuttal brief sand rebuttals to written comments, limited to issues raised in the case briefs and comments, may be filed not later than 37 days after the date of publication. Any hearing, if requested, will be held 44 days after the date of publication, or the first workday thereafter. The Department will publish the final results of the administrative review, including the results of its analysis of issues raised in any such written comments or at a hearing. Upon completion of this administrative review, the Department will issue appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service. Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective upon publication of the final results of administrative review for all shipments of ASM from France, entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: (1) The cash deposit rate for the reviewed company will be that established in the final results of this administrative review; (2) for exporters not covered in this review, but covered in previous reviews or the original less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published for the most recent period; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review, previous reviews, or the original LTFV investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be that established for the most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise; and (4) the cash deposit rate for all other manufactures or exporters will be 60 percent. On May 25, 1993, the Court of International trade in Floral Trade Council v. United States, 822 F. Supp 766 (1993), and Federal-Mogul Corporation and Terrington Company v. United States, 822 F. Supp. 822 (1993), determined that once an ``all others'' rate is established for a company, it can only be changed through an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions it is appropriate to maintain the original ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation or that rate as amended for correction of clerical errors or as a result of litigation in proceedings governed by antidumping duty orders for the purposes of establishing cash deposits in all current and future administrative reviews. Because this proceeding is governed by an antidumping duty order, the ``all others'' rate for the purposes of this review will be 60 percent, the ``all others'' rate established in the final notice of the LTFV investigation (46 FR 1667, January 7, 1981). These requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review. This notice serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 353.22. Dated: October 5, 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;26055 Filed 10&hyph;19&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;M
