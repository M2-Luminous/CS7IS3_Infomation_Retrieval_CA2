Nearly 95,000 direct call lines now connect the city with over 700 domestic cities and 185 countries across the world. Meanwhile, the city's telecommunications network has become more diversified.

The sources disclosed that the city will invest a record one billion yuan this year to add another 210,000 lines to its telephone network.
