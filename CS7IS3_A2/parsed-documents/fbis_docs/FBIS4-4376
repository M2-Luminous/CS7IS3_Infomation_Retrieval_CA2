[KCNA] The United States is now justifying its campaign for pressure on the DPRK with the allegation that the DPRK did not allow a full inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. Please tell me about the truth in detail. [Spokesman] The United States is contending that the DPRK must accept a full IAEA inspection, alleging that the recent inspection of the DPRK's nuclear facilities by the IAEA was not satisfactory. But this is quite contrary to the fact. We are in a unique status after a temporary suspension of the effectuation of our declared withdrawal from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) [haengmugi chonpabangji choyak taltoe hyorok palsaengul imsi chongjihan tuksuhan chiwie innun urinun]. So we are not obliged to accept a full inspection by the IAEA pursuant to the safeguards agreement. Moreover, we have never agreed with the United States and the IAEA on it. We agreed with the United States and the IAEA only to an inspection for maintaining the continuity of safeguards. When the scope of the IAEA inspection was agreed upon at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York in late December last year, the sides promised that it should be a strictly limited inspection [chehan sachal] for the maintenance of the continuity of safeguards, not a routine and ad hoc inspection [chonggi mit pijonggi sachal] pursuant to the safeguards agreement. At that time, the U.S. side asked the DPRK not to announce to the world that it would be a limited inspection to save its face. At the New York contact in February, the U.S. side clarified its position that if an IAEA inspection was made, it would come out to the third round of talks with the DPRK, irrespective of the results of the inspection. The United States which had promised a limited inspection and asked the DPRK not to open it to the public and stated it would have talks with the DPRK, irrespective of the results of the inspection, is now urging the DPRK to accept an additional inspection, charging that it refused to accept a full inspection by the IAEA pursuant to the safeguards agreement. This is a self-contradictory act. This fully shows how faithless the United States is. [KCNA] What does the United States really seek in reversing the DPRK-U.S. agreed conclusions and kicking up a row of pressure on the DPRK? [Spokesman] I think it was motivated by the U.S. trite hostile policy toward the DPRK [kutaeuiyonhan taejoson choktaesi chongchaek]. Admittedly, we have honestly discharged our obligation according to the agreed conclusions reached between the DPRK and the United States at the New York contact. The United States, however, had made false promises and it took no action in actuality. Nevertheless, the United States is resorting to pressure on the DPRK and war provocation moves, alleging that the DPRK has failed to implement the agreement. How can it be construed otherwise? As we have declared more than once, if the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks had been held and the nuclear issue resolved in a package deal [haengmunjeui ilgwal tagyorani songsa toeoddoramyon], the IAEA's routine and ad hoc inspections of the DPRK would have been resumed and the exchange of special envoys between the North and the South would have been possible. But the United States intentionally foiled the third round of the talks, which would be the key to the solution of the nuclear issue, setting unjustifiable preconditions. This clearly proves that the United States has no intention to resolve the nuclear issue through negotiation and it is only using the talks to stifle the DPRK and, further, promote its strategic interests in the Asia-Pacific region. [KCNA] Now that we have undergone an inspection enough for the continuity of safeguards as we had agreed with the IAEA, the UN Security Council has no reason or justification to discuss our issue, does it? [Spokesman] Of course not. The continued discussions of our issue at the UN Security Council under this situation only give the impression that the international organisation is courting the favor of a country. And this may be a living example that even international organisations are used for the attainment of the U.S. egoistic aim. The IAEA Secretariat made haste with the adoption of a "resolution" distorting the results of the inspection after carrying out the inspection of enough scope for the continuity of safeguards, and now the UN Security Council is discussing our issue. All this is manipulated behind the scene by the U.S.-led forces to stifle [apsal] the DPRK. If the UN Security Council follows the United States, it will seriously harm its authority as an international organistion whose lifeblood is impartiality. If the UN Security Council truly wants to discharge its mission, it must not argue about the DPRK, the victim, but argue about the acts of the United States, the assaulter, and put pressure on it. If the UN Security Council, departing from the principle of impartiality, defends the United States, the assaulter, for the reason that it is a big power and puts unwarrantable pressure upon the victim for the reason that it is a small country, the small countries will no more trust the United Nations. The UN Security Council must not be used as a rostrum for putting unreasonable pressure upon the DPRK over the nuclear issue. [KCNA] What measures are needed in your opinion for paving the way for a solution to the nuclear issue? [Spokesman] The United States must no more pursue a hostile policy toward Korea, first of all. Since the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula was caused by the U.S. policy to stifle our system, as mentioned above, if it is to be solved, the United States must take measures first for removing the nuclear threat to us and giving up the hostile policy. Still today when the nature of its anti-DPRK moves has been brought to light, the United States is resorting to the row of pressure against us, calling for UN "resolution" and the like. This cannot be justified with anything. The South Korean authorities must ponder over the lot in which they would find themselves while running about reckless, not knowing their position as now. The United States must sincerely implement the agreed conclusions reached at the contact with us. It is a violation of the DPRK-U.S. agreed conclusions and a mockery of our sovereignty for the United States to demand a full inspection of the DPRK by the IAEA and the exchange of special envoys between the North and the South, not implementing its own obligations at all. Pressure can never be a way of the solution of the problem but it only makes the situation complicated. It is nonsensical to urge us to accept an additional inspection since we have already accepted, fairly and squarely [chongjong tangdanghage], an inspection of a scope enough for the continuity of safeguards according to our agreement with the United States and the IAEA. If the United States continues to misuse [agyong] our sincere efforts to resolve the nuclear issue, we would no longer pin hope on the DPRK-U.S. talks and will counter [massonagal gosida] any pressure to the end. But if the United States put a stop to the international pressure campaign against the DPRK and proceed with the reestablishment of the foundation of the DPRK-U.S. talks we would not oppose a negotiated solution to the issue through negotiations. Consistent is our position to resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue. The future developments and a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue entirely depend on the attitude of the United States.
