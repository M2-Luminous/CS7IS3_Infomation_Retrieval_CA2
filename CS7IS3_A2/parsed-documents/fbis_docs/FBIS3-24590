This aircraft differs from an L-410 in its increased payload capacity, increased flight duration, and increased altitude ceiling. Five-blade propellers make it more efficient and quieter. It can fly at low altitudes (70-300 m) and up to 5000 m at a relatively low flight speed (210-350 km/hr). Additional fuel tanks enable five hours of flight without refueling. This aircraft costs a factor of 4-5 less to operate than an An-30. It is equipped with instruments for gamma ray studies (using scintillation detectors), thermal sensing, and spectral analysis (to study chemical pollution). In-flight processing is possible with the use of personal computers. The aircraft has been used to compile computer maps of the gamma ray background of a 30 km zone around the Chernobyl and Zaporozh atomic energy plants. Thermal radiation studies have been done using real-time infrared surveying. Figures 2
