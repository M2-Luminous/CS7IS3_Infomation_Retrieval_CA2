SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Animal Damage Control (ADC) of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in cooperation with the Bureau of Land Management of the U.S. Department of the Interior, and the Forest Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, has prepared a final environmental impact statement (EIS) for the ADC program. Copies of this document were filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on April 26, 1994, pursuant to section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(c)), and the EPA Notice of Availability appeared in the Federal Register on May 6, 1994. On January 14, 1993 (58 FR 4404&hyph;4405, Docket No. 92&hyph;190&hyph;1), we published a notice of intent to make available a supplement to the draft EIS for the ADC program. The draft EIS, made available on June 18, 1990 (55 FR 24597&hyph;24598, Docket No. 90&hyph;099), evaluated environmental impacts associated with wildlife damage control activities. On February 12, 1993, we published in the Federal Register (58 FR 8252, Docket No. 92&hyph;190&hyph;2) a notice advising the public that the supplement to the draft EIS for the ADC program was available for public review and comment. Comments were due on or before March 29, 1993. Because of the size and complexity of the supplement to the draft EIS, and in response to a number of requests, on March 29, 1993, we published in the Federal Register (58 FR 16520, Docket No. 92&hyph;190&hyph;3) a notice advising the public that we were extending the comment period until April 28, 1993. By close of business April 28, 1993, we had received 1,493 comments on the draft EIS and its supplement. Based on suggestions and information offered in the comments, we have revised the draft EIS and its supplement, and have produced a final EIS. This notice is issued in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq. ), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500&hyph;1508), (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR Part 1b), and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing NEPA (44 FR 50381&hyph;50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272&hyph;51274, August 31, 1979).
