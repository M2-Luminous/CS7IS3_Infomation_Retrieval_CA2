FBIS TRENDS-3JUN94-CHINA Beijing Sends Mixed Signals on Planning Commission Reform Beijing Sends Mixed Signals on Planning Commission Reform SUMMARY Apparently reflecting mounting pressure on China's reformers to moderate the pace of the ambitious new market reforms endorsed by the Third Plenum of the 14th Central Committee last fall, recent regulations charting a new role for the State Planning Commission (SPC) include only modest steps toward limiting the commission to broad oversight of the economy and fall far short of the reformers' goal of strictly curbing its direct administrative authority. Despite this setback, reformers show no sign of having modified their goals and will likely continue to press for market-based changes in the planning system. END SUMMARY Although the new State Council regulations, entitled the "Program Governing the Disposition of Functions, Establishment of Internal Organs, and Size of Staff in the State Planning Commission," do not mandate a sharp reduction in SPC administrative powers as suggested in the Third Plenum "decision" and leadership statements last year, they do indicate the reformers' progress in changing the overall role of the commission. Announced by Xinhua on 9 May, the regulations reduce SPC personnel by a third and embrace the reformist goal of transforming the commission into a mechanism for strategic planning and setting general industrial policy. They call for the SPC to "propose strategic targets and major . . . policies" for economic development and to "formulate state industrial policies and coordinate and supervise their implementation." The regulations also direct the SPC to provide more forecasting, monitoring, and analysis of economic conditions and to generate "economic information." Underscoring the reform aspect of the regulations, SPC Vice Minister Gui Shiyong was quoted in the English-language China Daily on 30 May as claiming that "planning groups have shifted their function to broad oversight of the economy" and that the reform "aims to replace most administrative controls with economic regulations." Retention of Major Administrative Power However, despite the inclusion of these reforms, the new regulations do not appear to significantly limit the SPC's power over financial policy, development planning, and capital investment decisions as called for by the plenum and an SPC- sponsored national planning conference held last December. In particular, they are not consistent with the plenum's goal of shifting responsibility for finance policy and state investment decisions from the SPC and other planning agencies to state enterprises and to a reformed banking system. In addition, the regulations appear to endorse a continued role for the SPC in short-term planning. -- Finance Policy. With the issuance of the new regulations Beijing has backed away from previous plans to create institutional checks on the SPC's role in financial policy. Under the new regulations, the SPC appears to have overall authority for financial policy. According to Xinhua, the commission will "coordinate" finances, credit, interest rates, prices, tax rates, exchange rates, and other economic "levers" (Xinhua, 9 May). The regulations also called for the SPC to retain its strong role in price regulation, directing it to "supervise" and "check" prices and keep the general price level "under control." By contrast, the plenum had implicitly endorsed important limits on the SPC's monopolistic control over finance, calling for a system in which "planning, banking, and public finance" are "coordinated" and "mutually check" each other. (16 November 1993). -- Development Planning. The regulations also appear to give the SPC a larger role in the specifics of development planning than did the planning conference. According to the 9 May Xinhua account of the regulations, the SPC is responsible for "long- term, intermediate, and annual" plans covering a broad range of economic issues. By contrast, a Xinhua report on last year's planning conference stated that the new planning system would focus on "medium- and long-term planning as the mainstay" (8 December 1993). -- Investment Decisionmaking. Finally, the regulations fall short of the sweeping "investment reform" called for by the plenum and last year's planning conference, giving the SPC the authority to determine the "sources" of capital and where that capital should be invested and to include not just large "key" state projects in the annual plan but also a variety of other projects. By contrast, the plenum had assigned enterprises and new commercial banks a major role in making investment decisions in areas not included in large state-funded projects. In addition, while the planning conference had said that the state would continue to "indirectly" determine the total volume of investment, it had also declared that the market must be given "full scope" in regulating investment and that enterprises should enjoy "full authority" in making investment decisions (Xinhua, 8 December 1993). Moreover, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua, in a speech at the conference, had also promoted the "risk-based" investment system that had been endorsed at the plenum, which would allow market principles to play the primary role in investment and credit allocation (Xinhua, 8 December 1993). Reformer Resolve on Investment In an apparent effort to portray the regulations as a temporary setback in the investment reform timetable rather than an abandonment of the reformers' goals, SPC Vice Minister Gui Shiyong, as cited in the 30 May China Daily article, stated that the government would "gradually withdraw investments" in local projects. He also insisted that the new investment system "will strengthen the responsibility of enterprises as well as banks" in both "decisionmaking power and risk responsibility." Leadership Differences Inconsistent media portrayals of the planning reforms suggest that the new regulations represent a compromise between backers of senior leader Deng Xiaoping's sweeping market-based reform agenda and more cautious central leaders and SPC bureaucrats who fear destabilizing economic dislocations and loss of power if the SPC's control is radically altered. For example, a 9 May report in Zhongguo Xinwen She, Beijing's press agency for overseas Chinese, appeared to take a conservative tack, stressing the S?C's continuing power in the central government. Noting the SPC's traditional role as the State Council's "general staff headquarters," it stated that the SPC "will remain the highest- ranking department for the comprehensive management of the national economy." By contrast, Vice Minister Gui, in his remarks carried by the 30 May China Daily, appeared intent on putting a reformist spin on the SPC's new role. Although he acknowledged that "the existing planning and investment system still fails to meet market requirements," he claimed that the new regulations "redefine the robe of planning and investment" and that "the connotation of the word 'planning' is changing." Gui went on to assert that under the planning reforms "all that the market can manage should be . . . managed by the market" and that "planning departments should restrict their activities to those that the market cannot do or has failed to do well." Implications Faced with continuing inflationary pressures as a result of Deng's fast-growth policies, general leadership concern over the potential for social unrest, and pressure from conservative leaders and planning bureaucrats to moderate the pace of market reform, the reformers appear to have backed away from their ambitious goals to strictly curb the power of the SPC. This bow to economic and political realities parallels the apparent slowdown in the pace of banking, enterprise, and other reforms mandated by the plenum last year. Despite these formidable obstacles, Deng's backers show no sign of having modified their reform agenda in principle and will likely continue to press for market-based changes when conditions are more in their favor.
