"I felt a great responsibility for having advocated a political reform government," Tanaka told reporters at the headquarters of Sakigake (Harbinger), a small component of Hosokawa's seven-party coalition government and a party to which he belongs. "I could not have quit if the political reform bills had not gone through," he said. "But I can step down with a stirring feeling because they were enacted." Tanaka, 53, the No. 2 man of Sakigake, said his resignation is in line with an accord with Hosokawa that he would step down once Diet debate on political reform ends. The government's political reform package cleared the Diet on Saturday after Hosokawa and Yohei Kono, president of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, reached a compromise on its amendments in the next regular Diet session. Hosokawa had staked his political fate on enactment by the Saturday close of the extraordinary Diet session. The measures are designed to clean up Japan's money driven political system and clamp curbs on political donations. Saying it is now time to fulfill his duty as a Sakigake member to meet public expectations for the party, Tanaka expressed hope he can continue supporting Hosokawa from outside the government. No one will take up the post of special adviser to the premier after Tanaka quits, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a Monday morning news conference. The Hosokawa administration's next main task should be administrative reform, Tanaka said, noting it is politicians, not bureaucrats, who should be responsible for the way policies are carried out. "I got the impression that the Diet has not played its role sufficiently in closely monitoring administrative authorities," he noted. Tanaka has been elected to the House of Representatives three times from the No. 1 constituency of Nagano Prefecture.
