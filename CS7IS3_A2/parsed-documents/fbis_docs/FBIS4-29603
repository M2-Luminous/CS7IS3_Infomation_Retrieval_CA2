"I don't think it is good for the political community to continue shaking," Takemura said in a lecture hosted by KYODO NEWS SERVICE. "I want to find a specific course for political realignment at an early date." Takemura, who heads new party Sakigake [Harbinger], also voiced his hope that the primary opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) will split, in response to its internal differences over key policies and political beliefs, and merge with other political parties. Saying the once-dominant LDP's historical role is over, Takemura predicted the anticipated political realignment will engulf the LDP and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ]), the second largest opposition force. The leader of the 15-member new party Sakigake described the rule by the current minority coalition government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata as an "abnormal situation" and spoke of the need to form a stable majority administration in one way or another. The SDP, the largest contingent of the government of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, quit the ruling coalition in April, leaving Hata overseeing Japan's first minority government since 1955. New party Sakigake, an LDP breakaway and also a member of the previous administration, fled the governing alliance because of differences with its coalition partners over political strategies.
