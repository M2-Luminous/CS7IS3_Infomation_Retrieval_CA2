CSW and CSW Energy seek to invest in a qualifying cogeneration facility and form related project entities, in connection with their program to develop sources of energy and capacity from qualifying cogeneration facilities, qualifying small power production facilities, and independent power facilities, including exempt wholesale generators. By orders dated September 28, 1990 (HCAR No. 25162), November 22, 1991 (HCAR No. 25414), and December 31, 1992 (HCAR No. 25728) (``Orders''), CSW and CSW Energy obtained authorization to spend $150 million to conduct preliminary studies of, to investigate, to research, to develop, to consult with respect to, and to agree to construct qualifying cogeneration facilities, qualifying small power production facilities, and independent power facilities, and to finance such activities through capital contributions, open account advances, and loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed $150 million. CSW and CSW Energy, in accordance with the Orders, seek authorization to invest in and develop, construct, own, and operate a qualifying cogeneration facility_the Sweeny Cogeneration Project (``Project''), which consists of an approximately 320 megawatt (net) gas-fired cogeneration facility to be located in or near Sweeny, Texas. The requested time limit of the authorization is one year from the date of receipt of the order. CSW and CSW Energy presently anticipate closing this transaction on or before December 31, 1996. It is proposed that CSW Energy invest in and develop the Project through a special purpose limited partnership, the Sweeny Cogeneration Limited Partnership (``Partnership''). CSW Energy proposes to organize and invest in a special-purpose, wholly owned corporation, CSW Sweeny GP, Inc. (``Energy GP''), which will hold, either directly or through a special-purpose, wholly owned corporation, CSW Sweeny GP II, Inc. (``Sweeney GP''), a general partnership interest in the Partnership, as well as a special-purpose, wholly owned corporation, CSW Sweeny LP, Inc. (``Energy LP''), which will hold, either directly or through a special-purpose, wholly owned corporation, CSW Sweeny LP II, Inc. (``Sweeny LP''), a limited partnership interest in the Partnership. Energy GP and Energy LP, and Sweeny GP and Sweeny LP, each will be incorporated with authorized capital of up to 1,000 shares of common stock (no par value). CSW Energy will subscribe to all of the common stock of Energy GP and Energy LP, Energy GP will subscribe to all of the common stock of Sweeny GP, and Energy LP will subscribe to all of the common stock of Sweeny LP, each for $1.00 per share. Energy GP will be a wholly owned subsidiary of CSW Energy, and Sweeny GP will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Energy GP. Energy GP will hold, directly or through Sweeny GP, a 20% general partnership interest in the Partnership. Energy GP, or Sweeny GP, will be initially the sole general partner of the Partnership. Energy LP will be a wholly owned subsidiary of CSW Energy, and Sweeny LP will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Energy LP. Energy LP will initially hold, directly or through Sweeny LP, an 80% limited-partnership interest in the Partnership. Energy LP, or Sweeny LP, will be initially the sole limited partner of the Partnership. After formation of the Partnership but before operation of the Project, between 50% and 75% of the interest in the Partnership will be acquired by nonaffiliated nonutility entities (``Equity Partner''). After the acquisition of an interest in the Partnership by the Equity Partner, Energy GP, directly or through Sweeny GP, will hold a 1% to 10% general partnership interest in the Partnership, Energy LP, directly or through Sweeny LP, will hold the remainder of the aggregate indirect 25% to 50% interest of CSW Energy in the Partnership as a limited partner, and the Equity Partner will hold between 50% and 75% interest in the Partnership as a general partner, limited partner, or combination thereof.
