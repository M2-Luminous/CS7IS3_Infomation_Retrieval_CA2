The coal production grew 1.4 times during the period of the third seven-year plan (1987-1993). The state has systematically increased investment in the coal industrial sector, attaching primary importance to its development. Big coal mines have been rebuilt on an expansion basis in Anju, Sunchon, northern and other coal-rich districts and many new promising ones built. Scores of coal mines including the large-scale Soho and December 16 coal mines went into operation over the past 10 years. The Yipsok, Yongrim, Taehyang and other coal mines were built at the Anju district coal mining complex whose annual coal production capacity has now reached 15 million tons. Projects for replacing mining equipment with large-sized, modern and high-speed ones have been completed at coal mines to increase the coal production capacity. Coal production was 1.5 million tons in 1946, the year following the liberation of the country, and it increased to 27.5 million tons in 1970 and 85 million tons at the end of the 1980s. The coal industrial domain now is concentrating big efforts on arranging new coal fields by giving precedence to prospecting while increasing the ongoing production. According to survey data, the nation's coal deposits amount to tens of billions of tons. Several billion tons of coal deposits have been discovered in Saeppyol county of North Hamgyong Province, Paekam county of Yanggang Province and other places in recent years.
