Pressure from the imperialist powers such as "sanctions" against the DPRK is a blasting fuse which may cause a war on the Korean peninsula and spread its flames worldwide, said the resolution, denouncing the United States and other imperialist powers for monopolizing nuclear weapons and using them as a means of threat and blackmail against other countries.
