In particular the draft envisages that there should be no fewer than 25 deputies in the composition of each faction. At the same time a deputy can only belong to one faction. If factions are formed on party principles, then the name of the party or parties making up the faction should appear in its name, without fail. The Supreme Council chairman and his deputies will not have the right to be in any of the factions. The Supreme Council secretariat will unite those deputies, who do not express a wish to be in the composition of any of the recorded factions, into one mixed deputies' group. The draft envisages the right of representatives from recorded factions to proportional representation in all of the leading Supreme Council bodies (according to a separate draft resolution, proposed and adopted by a sub-group preparing the parliament regulations, the leaders of factions should be included in the composition of the Supreme Council presidium). It has been determined that every deputies' faction will have a guaranteed right for its representative to speak on all issues of the agenda at all sittings of the Supreme Council and its bodies. According to the draft, the parliament Speaker will be obliged to provide those deputies' factions, which number no fewer than 50-70 deputies (the first session is to determine the final figures), with premises, the required equipment, and also assistance from administrative and technical staff. All materials from officially registered factions will be disseminated to members of parliament through the secretariat. In the opinion of one of the Supreme Council officials involved in preparing the draft, who wished to remain anonymous, the new regulation on deputies' groups and factions, if adopted by the first session, will grant considerably more rights to deputies' associations and give factions the opportunity to influence parliament's most fundamental decisions, even without serious amendments to the number of parliamentarians in one or other faction. The UNIAN correspondent also learned of the lists of proposals by working groups regarding the formation of the credentials and counting commissions at the first session of the Supreme Council of the 13th convocation. Twenty-five names of newly elected deputies have been submitted to the list of persons proposed for the composition of the credentials commission, and 23 names for the composition of the counting commission. In accordance with the proposals of the working groups, these commissions are to be elected at the first plenary sitting, after Ivan Yemets, chairman of the Central Electoral Commission, has spoken, and after information on the work of the preparatory groups has been given.
