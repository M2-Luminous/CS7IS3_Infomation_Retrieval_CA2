ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Department of the Navy is amending its certifications and exemptions under the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS), to reflect that the Judge Advocate General of the Navy has determined that USS MERRILL (DD 976) is a vessel of the Navy which, due to its special construction and purpose, cannot comply fully with certain provisions of the 72 COLREGS without interfering with its special functions as a naval destroyer. The intended effect of this rule is to warn mariners in waters where 72 COLREGS apply. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 9, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Captain R.R. Rossi, JAGC, U.S. Navy Admiralty Counsel, Office of the Judge Advocate General, Navy Department, 200 Stovall Street, Alexandria, VA 22332&hyph;2400, telephone number: (703) 325&hyph;9744. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to the authority granted in 33 U.S.C. 1605, the Department of the Navy amends 32 CFR part 706. This amendment provides notice that the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, under authority delegated by the Secretary of the Navy, has certified that USS MERRILL (DD 976) is a vessel of the Navy which, due to its special construction and purpose, cannot comply fully with the following specific rule of 72 COLREGS: In that portion of Annex I, Section 3(a) pertaining to the placement of the after masthead light and the horizontal distance between the forward and after masthead lights, without interfering with its special functions as a naval vessel. The Judge Advocate General of the Navy has also certified that the aforementioned lights are located in closest possible compliance with the applicable 72 COLREGS requirements. Moreover, it has been determined, in accordance with 32 CFR parts 296 and 701, that publication of this amendment for public comment prior to adoption is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to public interest since it is based on technical findings that the placement of lights on this vessel in a manner differently from that prescribed herein will adversely affect the vessel's ability to perform its military functions.
