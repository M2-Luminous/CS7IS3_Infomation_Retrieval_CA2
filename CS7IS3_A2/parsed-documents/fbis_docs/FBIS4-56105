[Begin recording] According to Czech presidential spokesman Ladislav Spacek, President Havel stressed that the foreign policy orientation of both countries is very similar, and in some respects identical. Unresolved issues between the two countries have, in the eyes of both sides, ceased to be political and have become the subject of negotiations between experts. Of 12 agreements expected to be signed, eight have been signed already. President Kovac expressed the hope that the process of concluding the agreements might be completed by the end of the year. The Czech Republic praised the fact that the Slovak Republic had agreed to a standard form of border controls, and the formal signing of a treaty to that effect is equally in sight. The presidents stated that the fall in trade between the two countries constituted a certain weakening of mutual relations. According to President Kovac, administrative standardization in both countries and the process of transformation, whereby the state has fewer possibilities of intervention, are throwing up barriers in the culture and education spheres. The decline in cultural and educational exchange activity could be compensated for by nongovernment-sponsored arrangements. President Havel proposed in this context the setting up of an Institute of Czecho-Slovak Studies. [end recording]
