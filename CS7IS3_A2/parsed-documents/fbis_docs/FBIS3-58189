In a letter to the alliance's Secretary General Manfred Woerner, Mikhailidhis points out that implementing the proposal would remove tension and the danger of conflagration and create the appropriate climate for effective negotiations on the Cyprus issue. The letter also points out the negative Turkish position on the confidence-building measures and stresses that the Greek Cypriot side's goal remains finding a lasting Cyprus solution through negotiation. Mikhailidhis sent his letter on the occasion of the NATO summit. He also says that the demilitarization proposal is accompanied by the Cypriot Government's willingness to pay for an increased UN peacekeeping force, since the main obstacle to a lasting and viable solution is the presence of the Turkish occupation troops in Cyprus. Mikhailidhis also recalls that the UN secretary general, in his latest report to the Security Council, stressed that the status quo in Cyprus was imposed through the use of force and is being maintained with military force. Mikhailidhis asks that his letter be communicated to all the NATO member states.
