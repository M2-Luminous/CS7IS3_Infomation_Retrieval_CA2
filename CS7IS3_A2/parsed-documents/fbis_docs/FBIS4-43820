FBIS4-43820 "drweu120_i_94006" FBIS-WEU-94-120 Daily Report 21 Jun 1994 FRANCE Committee Formed To Oppose Rwanda Intervention Committee Formed To Oppose Rwanda Intervention AU2206073794 Paris AFP in English 1525 GMT 21 Jun 94 AU2206073794 Paris AFP English BFN [Text] Paris, June 21 (AFP) -- More than 20 French charities and development assistance groups have formed a committee to oppose French plans for military intervention in Rwanda, they announced on Tuesday [21 June]. "The French government cannot intervene directly in Rwanda, its past in that country is already too weighty and its activities have been too pronounced," the chairman of the Medicins du Monde (MDM; Doctors of the World) Bernard Granjon told a press conference held to launch the committee. He called instead for armed deployment and "humanitarian intervention by the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda". The mainly Tutsi rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) has warned it will resist French military deployment, accusing Paris of backing the Hutu majority, training the army and being indirectly responsible for the ethnic massacres of hundreds of thousands of Tutsis and opposition Hutus by extremist militias. Other member associations of the France-Rwanda National Solidarity Committee include Pharmaciens sans Frontieres (PSF; Pharmacists without Borders), Handicap International and SOS-Racisme. In the Rwandan capital Kigali, two PSF personnel complained Tuesday that they had been ordered to leave because of the French plans for military intervention. "We have the impression of betraying everybody," one of them, Michel Sounalet, said before they joined a UN convoy heading for neighbouring Tanzania. Another member of PSF, which has been working with orphans, distributing food and medicines to people hiding from death squads and helping in the evacuation of endangered children from the bloodied Rwandan capital, will remain in Kigali. Speaking at the Paris press conference, another PSF representative, Claude Simonot, said there should be no military intervention at the expense of humanitarian relief. The UN Security Council was Tuesday to debate a French draft resolution proposing to send in up to 2,000 French troops and head military intervention until the United Nations can beef up its mission in Rwanda.
