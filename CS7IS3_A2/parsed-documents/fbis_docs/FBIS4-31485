FBIS4-31485 "dreeu112__a94025" FBIS-EEU-94-112-A Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 ANNEX Romania `Deep Crisis' Seen Within Opposition `Deep Crisis' Seen Within Opposition AU0806150094 Bucharest ROMPRES in English 1211 GMT 8 Jun 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0806150094 Bucharest ROMPRES English BFN [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 8/6/1994 -- "A deep crisis erupted in the main political force of the opposition," said politician Silviu Brucan in an interview with the LIBERTATEA daily newspaper speaking about the events of the past week related to the Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR]. He declared that the two points of view expressed by Dinu Patriciu, the leader of the Liberal Party '93 [PL-93] and by Corneliu Coposu, the leader of the PNTCD [National Peasant Christian-Democratic Party] can be considered as a "dynamite fuse" inside the CDR. At the end of May Dinu Patriciu assessed that the only chance for the CDR to be successful in the next elections was to turn itself from a coalition having its own right-wing ideology into a party, but his proposal was fully rejected by all members of the CDR. "It was a reaction easily to foresee, as the CDR was the umbrella for many parties that avoided to disclose their ideology and state their extraction," said Silviu Brucan. He said that the CDR has made its option so far for a quick political reckoning by saying that they will receive the population's ballots as a result of their discontent with the decline of living standard and consequently the CDR could exist more as an election forum rather than an option for a government. The statement made a few days ago in Paris by Corneliu Coposu, the leader of the PNTCD, namely that in the event his party will take the power they will amend the Constitution and bring back the monarchy, proves, said Brucan, "lack of political thinking and strategy." As long as there are powerful forces within the CDR which do not agree to the idea of monarchy, it is unlikely, so said Brucan, for them to draw up joint tickets and program platforms for the elections. As the majority of the voting people are republican supporters, Corneliu Coposu's assertion "severely" diminishes the votes to be possibly granted to the CDR. The crisis generated within the CDR by the declarations of the two politicians has affected "negatively the whole Romanian political life, as a strong opposition is badly needed for a democratic system to work."
