Schoenhuber's "unscrupulousness" in choosing his words -- who called Ignatz Bubis, chairman of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, an "instigator of people," and after the attack on the synagogue in Luebeck -- is "extremely alarming," Hoyer said in Bonn on Monday [28 March]. What Schoenhuber says is the "intellectual breeding ground for those who throw Molotov cocktails into synagogues and tacitly accept the death of people as a result." Hoyer and FRG Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger (FDP) called on the democratic forces in the FRG to categorically defend themselves against Schoenhuber's words and deeds. Hoyer admonished that words such as "instigator of people" addressed to "such an upright and prudent man" as Bubis must "arouse all parties before they cause irreparable damage." "It has always been a speciality of the German rightists to be the perpetrators and to support murders and then present themselves as victims," Herta Daeubler-Gmelin, deputy chairwoman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, said in an interview on Suedwestfunk radio in Baden-Baden. However, she hopes that there will be a judge in Germany who will finally put "this instigator" behind bars.
