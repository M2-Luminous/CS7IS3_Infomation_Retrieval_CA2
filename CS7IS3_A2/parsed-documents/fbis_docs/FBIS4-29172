In response, relevant ministries and agencies will begin studying concrete ways to put the sanctions into effect. There is a possibility the UN Security Council will amend the draft resolution, and the task prior to making a final decision on the draft resolution is how to persuade China, which is still cautious about imposing any sanctions against North Korea, to change its stance. Former U.S. President Carter entered North Korea on 15 June and the Japanese Government plans to closely watch how North Korean leaders respond to the draft resolution during their talks with the former U.S. President, after concluding that their response to the draft resolution will affect future developments in connection with the North Korean nuclear issue. On 15 June, Prime Minister Hata held an emergency meeting with government officials at his official residence in the evening to discuss how to deal with the draft resolution. The Japanese Government has decided to notify the U.S. Government of its basic agreement with the draft resolution, but government officials are tight-lipped about the draft resolution, saying, "We cannot reveal the substance of the draft resolution." A government source said, "The draft resolution, as a whole, is close to what Japan has asserted." The government source stressed that in formulating the draft resolution, the United States has accepted, to some extent, what the Japanese Government has asserted since Japan, the United States, and South Korea held the trilateral talks in Washington on 4 June. After the meeting with the prime minister, Chief Cabinet Secretary Kumagai said: "Japan has been extremely cautious about the sanctions against North Korea. Japan has maintained that the sanctions should not simply be a punishment for North Korea, but should have the effect of making North Korea return to the starting point. I do now know for sure how the draft resolution will be handled in the future, but Japan intends to politely convey what it thinks to other relevant nations." In this way, the government spokesman indicated that Japan would work to reflect its assertions in the sanctions through the United States and the rest of the permanent members of the UN Security Council when the UN Security Council votes on imposing sanctions. The issue of halting remittances by ethnic Koreans residing in Japan to North Korea has been a focal point in the sanctions against North Korea, but it remains unclear how the issue will be dealt with in the future. The issue is believed not to be included in the sanctions that will be imposed in accordance with the draft resolution, but there is the possibility of the issue being incorporated in the sanctions one way or another. With regard to the remittances by ethnic Koreans residing in Japan to North Korea, they may be excluded from the sanctions. A Foreign Ministry source said, "Once the UN Security Council votes to adopt a resolution imposing the sanctions against North Korea, all nations involved are obliged to comply with the sanctions." Thus, he indicated that Japan will not be held solely responsible for the remittances. A government source on 15 June said the Finance Ministry's interpretation is that "it is difficult for the government to halt the remittances under the current Foreign Exchange Management Law without a UN resolution." If the UN Security Council votes to adopt a resolution slapping sanctions on North Korea, the government would have no trouble halting the remittances. However, if the UN Security Council fails to adopt a resolution slapping sanctions on North Korea in the face of China's opposition, and multinational sanctions are imposed instead, the government would face difficulty dealing with the remittances. According to the same government source, the draft resolution strongly calls on North Korea to return completely to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and demands the imposition of several sanctions against North Korea. Specifically, the draft resolution is believed to call for suspension of international assistance to the Tumen development project, and cultural exchanges. The sanctions envisioned by the draft resolution will have no great impact on Japan, but they are likely to adversely affect developing countries. The government source said "it would not be simple" to win support from China and developing countries which are members of the UN Security Council. Japan is poised to do everything it can do to persuade them in the United Nations.
