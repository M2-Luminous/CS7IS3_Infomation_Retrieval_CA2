UN special envoy Ahmedou Ould Abdallah said the Army must pull out within the day. "But they are dragging their heels and the High Command is not exerting strict discipline," he said. He noted that the Army, dominated by the country's Tutsi minority, had a "terrible reputation" among the majority Hutu population in northern parts of Bujumbura where gun battles broke out at the weekend. Abdallah estimated that at least 100 people were killed, adding that the death toll might be higher "because lots of people in this country do not weep and do not display their dead." Diplomatic sources said there were "misunderstandings" between the military and the government, "which are considerably complicating the situation." The UN special representative repeated his complaint of the previous day that some Hutu politicians with vested interests were claiming "vastly exaggerated" casualty figures. Interior Minister Leonard Nyangoma told government radio in neighbouring Rwanda earlier in the week that almost 1,000 people had been killed. The latest official figure was given on Thursday by Communications Minister Cyriaque Simbizi at about 400. Abdallah also rapped false reports spread in the last few days that the Army was mounting another coup and that government ministers had fled the country. "It is dangerous for the Hutu, who may well lose their credibility abroad," he said. Abdallah said he was worried about the estimated thousands of residents who fled their homes during the fighting into other parts of town, thereby causing overcrowding which could lead to fresh tensions. Although there were no shooting overnight and things were relatively calm in northern districts of the capital, people were still seen quitting their homes for neighbouring Zaire, other parts of the city or outlying banana groves. Part of the Army mounted a short-lived coup last October, killing Melchior Ndadaye, Burundi's first Hutu president. Since then, tribal fighting has left tens of thousands dead and driven 700,000 into refuge in surrounding countries.
