Gultekin, at his post since August 26, said the atmosphere of confidence was fading and there was a need for a medium-term economic programme. Bankers had been calling for the governor to resign after what they said was monetary mismanagement which led to the devaluation last Wednesday night. Gultekin was quoted as saying the Central Bank had used all the necessary tools to soothe the markets, thrown into disarray by currency chaos. He said the bank `was left unaided' since two international credit agencies cut Turkey's rating on January 14. `My resignation will not lead to a new crisis,' Gultekin told reporters at a news conference. `I hope my resignation will bring the seriousness of economic problems onto the agenda', he said.
