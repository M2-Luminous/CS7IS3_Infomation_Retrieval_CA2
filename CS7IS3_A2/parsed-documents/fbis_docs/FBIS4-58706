[Abu-Rahmah] No, it is a practical question, and we think they will be here by next week. [Rochot] You aren't worried because a lot of extremists want to attack the peace process? [Abu-Rahmah] No, we aren't afraid, we aren't worried. The extremists have their opinions, and the others have theirs. That is democracy. [Rochot] How do you see your relations with the Israelis after this agreement? [Abu-Rahmah] They will be cordial relations, and we hope this peaceful coexistence will develop. [Rochot] There are a lot of people without work here. There are no jobs. How do you see the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip? [Abu-Rahmah] Yes, the unemployment problem is extremely serious. We hope the Israelis will help to employ a certain percentage of the population. Others will be a burden for the Palestinian administration. [Rochot] You are also expecting help from the European Community, but you haven't received anything? [Abu-Rahmah] Yes, we are expecting their help. We hope it will be generous, because the Gaza Strip is a very poor place, without resources. Its only resources are its people. We hope its men and women will be able to be productive in one way or another, and we hope that one day Gaza will become the Hong Kong of the Middle East.
