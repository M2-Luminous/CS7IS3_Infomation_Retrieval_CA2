The administration has faltered with tax system reform. The budget issue has been postponed, and deregulation plans have been impeded. As a result, Japan's economic relations with the United States remains strained. The administration was not headed in the wrong direction. It felt fresh to the people's ears when the administration called out for "economic reform." Its calls began to sound empty because the administration lacked political leadership and policy principles. Leadership in tackling impending issues to help bring about true economic reform is sought in the next administration, which is yet to be seen. The Issue of Tax System Reform Was the Underlying Cause of the Crisis Initially, the world's financial capital markets reacted calmly to the news of "Hosokawa's resignation." However, U.S.-initiated adjustments are currently going on in these markets. Due to a tightening of U.S. monetary policy, long-term interest rates have risen in various countries, and stocks have fallen. For unstable markets which are sensitive to new information, political disturbances can become decisive factors. The market in Tokyo is most affected by tension in the Korean peninsula. Although there are strong concerns in Japan about yen appreciation, what is really frightening is the fall in the values of yen, stocks, and securities when this is combined with mounting international tension and bogging down of the political situation. The economy finally seems to be moving toward recovery. There should be no concern that this trend might be drastically affected by the recent change in the political situation. Should the turmoil be prolonged, however, psychological effects cannot be ignored. In the end, what has the Hosokawa administration accomplished regarding economic affairs? What is ironic is that Hosokawa's "final task" was his getting advice on tax system reform from the government Tax Commission. What could have gone through the prime minister's mind when he read the Tax Commission's report? What troubled him the most must have been the tax system. This, then, was the underlying cause of the collapse of the administration. Prime Minister Hosokawa found himself in a predicament as the ruling coalition parties remained divided over the issue of a consumption tax hike, while Finance Ministry bureaucrats insisted on balancing revenue shortfalls with tax hikes. Since priority was placed on political reform, budget compilation, which normally is routine work, has been postponed. As a result, the administration came to an abrupt halt, failing to even see the beginning of Diet deliberations on the draft budget bill. The public lost its confidence in the prime minister when he was forced to take back to the drawing board his proposal for a national welfare tax, which was based only on "rough estimates." What replaced this was a plan to "cut taxes for one year only"--a major factor that caused the breakdown in Japan-U.S. summit talks. The Hosokawa administration gained wide acclaim from the world's economists by saying "no" to the setting of numerical targets during trade negotiations. However, it failed to come up with counterproposals, causing the U.S. administration to be further dissatisfied. Hosokawa used the laudable phrase "mature relations" to ease the impact of the breakdown in the framework trade talks. Since Japan-U.S. relations have relied heavily on the personal relationship between Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton, the prime minister's resignation, all the more, could lead to a delay in the restoration of bilateral ties. An Inclination to Introversion What is more serious is that under the Hosokawa administration, Japan unknowingly became introverted. Even though Japan is the greatest benefactor under GATT, it played the role of a victim in the Uruguay Round talks. It is said that it will be unlikely for Japanese ministers to attend a GATT ministerial meeting to be held in Morocco this week. What does it signify for Japan to be absent at a time when the world seeks to set up new frameworks of negotiations regarding employment and trade, environment and trade, and other issues under the new World Trade Organization (WTO)? An immeasurable negative impact can be expected if the nation with the largest current account surplus in the world remains silent. Regardless of who takes over the reins of the government, it is clear which direction the Japanese economy should move. Needless to say, priority must be placed on enacting the draft budget bill. Only then can the new administration tackle unfinished tasks regarding "economic reform." Concerning tax system reform, tax cuts should be continued in such a manner that the progressive structure of income taxes may be relaxed. The consumption tax should be raised in the future after improving the consumption tax system by abolishing taxes on profits and through other means. Regarding deregulation, policy principles should be made clear as to "what purpose deregulation is intended for." Nothing would have been accomplished should deregulation be implemented equally among all government ministries and agencies, just as in the manner the budget is allocated among them. That would be tantamount to playing into the hands of bureaucrats. Rather, what would be more effective is to concentrate on deregulating those sectors which would help boost domestic demand. Economic reform in Japan should serve as a model case for post-cold war market economies. Only after it has implemented economic reform can Japan finally qualify as a proponent for an international economic system in the next era. A Necessary Responsibility Although the Japanese economy should move in such a direction regardless of who takes over the reins of the government, this cannot necessarily be accomplished by just any administration. Economic reform can only be implemented by an administration which does not let bureaucrats take over policies and can exercise political leadership and comprehensive coordinating capabilities. The problem with the current political structure is that there are only a few politicians who have better knowledge of economics than the bureaucrats, even though they may be very interested in power struggles. When Tanzan Ishibashi was finance minister, he stayed up all night to write a financial policy speech regarding the fiscal year 1946 national budget, all by himself. Since the final draft of his speech, which included a well-known passage, "man lives for hope in the future rather than the present," was not ready for a cabinet meeting, Ishibashi made verbal explanations and managed to answer to Diet interpellations. Japan made a miraculous recovery because here was a politician with a sense of responsibility in times of great tension. Such politicians are rare nowadays. This is what is causing a waste of time in Japanese politics. Only by adjusting the political structure gradually can economic reform be brought about. However, should the Japanese economy fail to emerge from the turmoil because too much time has been spent on adjusting the political structure, it will be mercilessly exposed to heavy selling in the world's markets. Japanese politics is being put to a test in a time of historic upheaval in the world economy.
