He has been able to turn himself into a media star without any effort. The formula is clear: Remain what you are. Bidza has no need to make himself better and more intelligent. He is perfectly recognizable, and in the meantime he has become generally accepted whether in a favorable or unfavorable context. Dobrivoje Budimirovic, like it or not, has grown to be the standard-bearer of rural philosophy and psychology. In Serbia, such a person is respected and esteemed, hated and supported. He received 87 percent of the vote, and in the election to opstina president there were only three votes against. This nevertheless did not prevent the local people from trying to set fire to his house last year. He says of Slobodan Milosevic that he is the first Yugoslav opposition to come to power without killing those who did not agree with him. He has proved that they are all politically alive and well, but he does not want to talk about their mental condition, because that is a personal matter. Budimirovic's mental condition is perhaps best portrayed by this story: "When we were university students in Belgrade, my future wife and I, we loved to visit furniture showrooms just to look. Once, we were in a showroom with furniture in the style of Louis XIII. We sat down, and I told my future wife: `If I just had this, I could die a happy man.' Not long ago, I bought furniture like that, my wife reminded me of my promise, but I still do not want to go until I finish this job with the opposition." When Bidza is involved, there is no room for tolerance. His arrogance is astounding. In the meantime, "bidzizam" has become our reality. [Milosavljevic] Whatever else it might be, the opposition here is resilient. Vuk and Seselj will in future defend their interests together. [Budimirovic] Well, you know, that is typical of us Serbs: You kill your best friend's wife, and then you and your best friend make up. [Milosavljevic] Do not tell me that you were not surprised. [Budimirovic] I was not surprised. They are Serbs. They come from the karst in Herzegovina. They are interested in this region here only because of power, so it is not hard for them to constantly disgrace themselves with the public. And, on this occasion, by making up. [Milosavljevic] It is not just a question of them. The entire parliamentary opposition has been showing a similar tendency. [Budimirovic] If you consider Vuk, Seselj, and those few souls a coalition that threatens us, you are mistaken. With an opposition like that, we will stay in power 100 years. [Milosavljevic] What does the opposition need to have for you to take it seriously? [Budimirovic] Name for me just one of their leaders who has the good of this people at heart, who has done something for it even if not anything permanent. Just one who at least has tried to help. I personally do not know of a single one. They have been spitting on their people all over the world and informing on us at every step for a handful of dollars. They have been selling out Serbia at third-rate suppers. Which one of them has made a contribution for this people to have a better life? [Milosavljevic] Is there at least one man in the ranks of the opposition whom you hold in estimation? [Budimirovic] I just told you about the leaders. However, there are quite a few good and proper people in the membership. Even creative people. [Milosavljevic] You, then, are not upset at all, you think that there is no reason for the opposition to be taken seriously this time? [Budimirovic] If you are afraid of sparrows, you should not plant wheat. I am enough of an agronomist to know that. The opposition is smaller than even those sparrows. [Milosavljevic] What exactly do you hold against Vuk Draskovic and Vojislav Seselj? [Budimirovic] Nothing. I feel sorry for them. [Milosavljevic] Why? [Budimirovic] Because they do not want to be with their people. We all know that their people is not here. They should go across the Drina and stretch out their hand to their real people. I would never leave my native Svilajnac and go to Bosnia and Herzegovina to sell my intelligence, because I figure that my place is not with them. The Serbian people has a good feeling who it is and with whom it is dealing. The saddest thing is that the people who like them are in error. I guarantee that those two are not happy even with their wives. They do not love even them. Those two hate the entire world by noontime, and in the afternoon they hate even themselves. [Milosavljevic] What do you see as the difference between Serbs from Serbia and Serbs from elsewhere? [Budimirovic] Until three years, it never occurred to any of them to declare themselves to be Serbs. I drove the refugees out of Svilajnac. [Milosavljevic] How did you manage to do that, and are you referring here to all refugees? [Budimirovic] Refugees are women, children, and those unable to work. I did not touch them. I concluded that the place for the rest of them was with their people. I am against our people from Serbia going to defend Bosnia while they are here engaging in smuggling, prostitution, drugs, and other occupations from which they get a fine living. [Milosavljevic] This is odd for the heroic fighting people such as the Serbs like to represent themselves. Even we by and large are reluctant to respond to the mobilization. [Budimirovic] Not a single man from my native Svilajnac has gone off to wage war, nor is there a single black flag flying in my town. The people from the Resava region would go if they really needed help, but now that they have crawled here to make money, mainly in illegal ways, I think that there is nothing we can expect from them. Only if all of us together were fighting for the common interest of all Serbs, only then should all Serbs come together. [Milosavljevic] Is this also our war? [Budimirovic] Serbia is not at war. Nevertheless, many volunteers have gone from here to help their brothers in trouble. Among them, there are honorable people, but also fortune hunters. [Milosavljevic] Are we on the threshold of new federal elections? To some people it seems that Milosevic has already begun the election campaign. [Budimirovic] There is no need for it. That is not why Milosevic has been talking to the farmers, if that is what you are referring to. He knows what life is and what the provinces are. The opposition has no chance of winning an election. They will not win even if they organize a new election every year. [Milosavljevic] What do you think about the incident in the Federal Assembly, and has Bozovic been doing his job as he should? [Budimirovic] I do not see why this topic is brought up. The deputies have voted confidence in Bozovic three times. That says enough about how he is doing his job. As far as the incident is concerned, sick people display that kind of primitivism. I would respect Seselj's demands if he fought for them with words. He did not invest the work and sweat to get the Assembly in operating condition. I know why the microphones bother him. If a doctor of science and the leader of a party comes to the parliament to pull out the wires, then it would have been better for him not to go to school and not to begin to engage in politics. He might better have become an electrician. Then presumably he would have a higher opinion of technology. I am sorry for him, because his party was at one time the one I held most dear after my own. I know his people quite well, and I know that 80 percent of its members would renounce such acts in themselves. Serbia has had enough wreckers, those who have not invested anything in it. This country needs creators and investors. Workers and creators whose fruits the people can enjoy. [Milosavljevic] Nevertheless, none of that bothered you while Seselj was supporting Milosevic's policy and working against the opposition? [Budimirovic] No. We agreed while he was in favor of the interests of Serbia. While he wanted to help the Serbian people. Now we would be happier if he no longer defended us that way. It is clear that he is thinking only about how to take power. Before that, even I liked him. [Milosavljevic] Many charges are being laid against Bozovic. From malfeasance to embezzlement. Seselj said there is evidence of that? [Budimirovic] Lightning flashes, thunder rumbles, but it does not rain. The human thing would be to publish that evidence. For three years, we have been listening to hearsay without any kind of arguments or documentation. If I had the evidence, I would publish it even though Bozovic is a member of my party. Unless that happens, it is all nonsense. [Milosavljevic] You are saying, then, that Bozovic is a honorable man? [Budimirovic] I do not know. For the present, it seems so to me. I will change my opinion if it is proven to me otherwise. [Milosavljevic] Many people have said that the former closeness between the SPS [Socialist Party of Serbia] and SRS [Serbian Radical Party] had the substance of a coalition. [Budimirovic] Seselj drew us in in order to derive advantage, and we supported him, but we were never in a coalition. I say this with full responsibility. I was sitting next to him at that time, because at that time I also liked him. When we figured him out and found that our interests were not the same, then we turned our back on him. In his ranks, he has good and honest people, I emphasize once again. [Milosavljevic] Does that also apply to Tomislav Nikolic? [Budimirovic] The two of us come from the same place, and we have known each other for a long time. I would say that even of him, but it is a pity that he is no longer thinking with his own head. [Milosavljevic] As a successful businessman, do you believe in the survival of the Avramovic program? [Budimirovic] I do and I do not. My opstina is in good shape, and there are few others in Serbia that can compete with it from the economic standpoint. The program will not succeed unless everyone goes back to work. Everyone has to live from his work. Nothing comes from empty applause while everyone on the other side is going on in the same old way. We all need to be Avramovic. Everyone must help him in carrying out the economic program. In my native Svilajnac, no one is on mandatory leave. I found a job for everyone. [Milosavljevic] How did you manage that? [Budimirovic] I do not sell democracy. I know how to manage and command. [Milosavljevic] What do you think about the Dafiment affair and publication of the lists of savings depositors who withdrew their money? [Budimirovic] I like Dafina Milanovic, because I like big heavy women. But that is all I know about it. Only fools give their wife and money to someone else for safekeeping. [Milosavljevic] What if the depositors get angry now? [Budimirovic] I am joking, of course. I am sorry for the poor person who was deceived. However, I do not stay awake with other people's worries, I prefer to get along on my own. The important thing is that I am not on her list, as you have seen for yourself. And if it is nevertheless true that people in my party took out their money, I am ashamed for them. [Milosavljevic] Aside from Bozovic's removal, the opposition also wants equal treatment on Radio-Television Serbia [RTS]. [Budimirovic] What do they need with RTS, when they have Studio B? [Milosavljevic] That television station, however, has a limited range. [Budimirovic] But why should they have more when they do not deserve anything more? By what right would the opposition get that, when it is just a peck of trouble? They have not donated anything, nor contributed anything for Serbia to be a better and happier country. Why, then, should the people look in their direction? I would never talk to such people. We need a creative, industrious, and able opposition. The present opposition is not like that. To help us when we make a mistake, and not just to spit on us like this one. [Milosavljevic] Many of them are above all calling attention to the fact that it has never been worse for us than under this government and this kind of government, and they are offering their solution to get out of the crisis. [Budimirovic] You just give them my greetings and tell them that the Serbian people has never lived better than today. Here, look (he points to his plate full of roast suckling pig and smiles with satisfaction), who has it bad today? If all those who fled from the country to the large cities went back there, it would be better for us at once. This way, they are putting pressure on your dumpsters and social welfare institutions. They left their farms in search of the promised land. Until yesterday, their wives were tending sheep and wearing sandals from Pirot, and now they want to wear spiked heels and be Belgrade ladies. That does not cost us in the provinces as much as it does you in Belgrade. [Milosavljevic] I have heard that in delivering a speech in Svilajnac you publicly referred to yourself as God. [Budimirovic] What I said was: "God, that's me." Because I effectively have everything under my control. You know, for me God is man. I have a right to say that, because everything I do, I do in the interest of my people. [Milosavljevic] Did you like Tito? It is said that you personally changed the name of the main street in Svilajnac from Marshal Tito Street to Saint Sava Street. Malicious tongues have it that you did that because of your father, whose name was Sava. [Budimirovic] Well, for me my father was a saint, and as for Tito, there is a place in all of us that would like to have him back. I trusted him. Not as a Croat, but as a man who organized that entire community spirit. If only Tito were alive instead of Mesic. [Milosavljevic] You say that you did not trust him as a Croat, but do not tell me that you did not believe in brotherhood and unity. [Budimirovic] I did. At one time, I could have slept in the park near Tivoli, in Zagreb, in Dugo Selo, in Split, in Benkovac.... That is why I trusted him. Before the war, my people were day laborers, and I owe everything I have achieved in life to that period of time. I obtained everything under that communism, and I am grateful that I have been successful and got a degree as a son of a peasant from Lukovica. Now those who profited the most thanks only to that time and that political climate are spitting on him. [Milosavljevic] But you also became a Socialist. [Budimirovic] That is because all the Communists from Svilajnac who in 1984 wanted to expel me from the League of Communists became the opposition. I did not want to be with them. I remained faithful to Serbia, to work, to order, and to peace. All those things that the SPS now represents. [Milosavljevic] If the opposition, because of a boycott of parliament by the Socialists, nevertheless leaves parliament, as Vuk has threatened? [Budimirovic] Pay no attention to him! In our parts, they say: "When a wolf [Vuk] barks, it is just like a dog barking!"
