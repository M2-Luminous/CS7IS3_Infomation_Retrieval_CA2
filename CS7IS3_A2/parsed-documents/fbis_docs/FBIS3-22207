Behind the unwieldy name lies an environmental experiment that has been conducted in Tula Oblast. It was approved by the Russian government, which decided to back it up with the participation of various ministries and committees. The council is supposed to unite their efforts. Rarely has such a broad-scale program of change come from a region, rather than from the central government. That is why Sergey Vasyutin, deputy head of the Tula Oblast administration, has been made head of the interdepartmental council. An OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent got in touch with him by phone. Filimonov: Why was it in your oblast that it was decided to conduct the experiment? Vasyutin: Tula Oblast has the most highly stressed environmental situation in Russia. The level of pollution by industrial waste is high. Seventeen percent of the drinking water does not meet health standards. The consequences of the Chernobyl accident are having a strong impact. Just 14 percent of the children lack health abnormalities. But there is a powerful research base in the oblast for studying the impact of environmental pollution on human health. A unique set of methods for monitoring the human environment and a system for the early diagnosis of diseases have been developed by Oleg Martynov, a professor at Tula University. Moreover, our administration was stubbornly persistent and got approval at the highest level for a program for improvement of condition of the environment. More than 3,000 proposals have already been received from scientists and entire research institutes. The interdepartmental council (and it includes the Russian Academy of Sciences Vice-President Frolov; Academy of Medical Sciences President Pokrovskiy; Danilov-Danilyan, the minister of the environment; and Sokolov, chief physician of the Sanitation and Epidemiological Inspectorate) will develop a normative and legal basis for carrying out environmental reforms in Russia. Filimonov: I know that not everything went smoothly with the program, especially with its financing. Do you think that such powerful support will help break down any fortresses? Vasyutin: We spent 18 months trying to get approval for the program in the ministries. But even when there are directives by Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin ordering the money to be appropriated, lower-level bureaucrats easily rescind them. At the last moment, thanks to Danilov-Danilyan, I managed to return the program to the list of federal financing. The Ministry of Finance had written it off as lacking promise. References to the country's leaders have not helped. The clerks simply brush them aside: ``We have a lot of such instructions. We've gotten used to them.'' Filimonov: Environmental protection is often associated with emergencies, but for some reason there is no representative on the council of the Ministry for Emergency Situations. Why is this? Vasyutin: We have relations that have already been set up. The methods proposed by Martynov not only presuppose an automatic tracking of any increase in the level of pollution, but make it possible to predict emergency situations. An automated monitoring system has already been put into operation at Yasnaya Polyana. The only instructional-methods center in the country for training environmental-protection specialists has been established on the basis of the civil defense system. We are planning to create a special curriculum for schoolchildren called ``Island of Survival'' in which we will prepare students for action under emergency conditions. Filimonov: The council, by bringing together the representatives of several ministries and committees, is seemingly going planning to break down departmental barriers and attract scientist-practitioners from all branches of science. Vasyutin: That is our dream, We will enlist scientists only on a contractual basis and will reject the use of huge institutes that require immense amounts of money to support their administrators. A doctor of sciences working for us will receive not 50,000 rubles, as one does at the present time, but several times that amount. Money from the sale to the West of our technological developments for the processing of waste will also belong to the developers. Filimonov: Sale to the West? But we have already gotten used to the idea that our technologies are the most unadvanced. Vasyutin: It is simply that no one has heard about a lot of them. In Germany our specialists demonstrated calculations pertaining to the development of a unit for extracting gasoline and diesel fuel from waste rubber. Western scientists were convinced that such a thing was not even theoretically possible. But the Platonov pilot unit is operating in Tula. If we are able to implement the environmental program, Russia will be able to get the opportunity to assume an equal footing with the other countries of Europe and America.
