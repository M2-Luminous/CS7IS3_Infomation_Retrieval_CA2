The first is the planning ring, which is Israel. The information indicates that two Israeli officers visited Lebanon for this purpose. 2. The second is the implementation one. Several employees of the Lebanese Forces' [LF] security apparatus were involved, including some who lived in Lebanon and some who were travelling and were persuaded to return. Several meetings took place between those who planned and those who supervised the implementation. Some of these meetings took place in Israel, some in Cyprus, and a few in Lebanon. Some of those who lived abroad returned to Lebanon by sea from Cyprus with Israeli help involving the Israeli Navy, rubber dinghies, and frogmen. 3. The third is the protection and concealment one. This ring was asked to carry out a number of distraction operations to conceal the effects of the first crime and preoccupy the people with other imaginary or genuine operations. The rings operated independently of each other. They only knew the Israeli liaison officers. After the operation, most members of the implementation team were withdrawn by sea or infiltrated to the border strip with forged identity cards or foreign passports issued for this purpose. The members of the protection ring were also scheduled to be withdrawn. How was the network uncovered? There is no sufficient information on this subject. But what is certain is that the security services went back to its rich archives about explosive experts (these people have records and are identified by bombs, shells, timers, and the way the bombs are connected). The security services also benefited from the treasure they confiscated in the Lebanese Forces' war council when they seized the building and evicted Dr. Samir Ja'ja' to where he now lives in Ghidras. In this treasure there was abundant information about the people, networks, liaison officers, and explosive experts who received excellent training in Israel. [passage omitted] Why Fu'ad Malik Was Arrested According to the information, retired Major Fu'ad Malik, who is the second in command of the Lebanese Forces after Ja'ja', had attended some of the preparatory meetings to plan the church bombing. He was cited as saying to the young men in one of these meetings, "May God give you health." By virtue of his responsibility and military position, he must have been involved, even if he did not give the order. According to the information, during his interrogation he said: "I am not bloody like Samir Ja'ja', and in all my time in the Lebanese Forces I have not killed anyone..." [passage omitted] His arrest, according to this information, might have been for the purpose of exposing Ja'ja's role. It also might have been the result of a political settlement involving intensive U.S. efforts to save the head of the Lebanese Forces' commander and satisfy some sectarian sensitivities. It is also said that U.S. Embassy officials in Beirut were briefed about the investigation and were stunned by the accurate information (and perhaps also the confessions). Consequently, no protest or "question" about what has happened to the leadership of the Lebanese Forces were issued either in Beirut or in Washington. [passage omitted]
