Robaina arrived in the Malaysian capital yesterday from India. In an exchange, his counterpart reiterated that it is the Cubans who alone must determine their fate -- an allusion to the U.S. policy against Cuba. The Malaysian foreign minister also expressed his satisfaction with the Cuban Foreign Ministry's new policy of rapprochement with the region, and stressed that he is willing to form a businessmen's delegation to visit Havana over the next few months to increase trade between the two nations. Robaina agreed with the Malaysian foreign minister on the need to take practical steps toward progress in the world of communication. Robaina said: We are here to learn about and assess the experiences of countries that, like this one, have enjoyed sustained development.
