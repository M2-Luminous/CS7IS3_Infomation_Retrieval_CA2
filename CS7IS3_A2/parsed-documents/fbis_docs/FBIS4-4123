It is reported that the main reasons for the rice shortage in the city are first, most of the grain shops there have been leased out and they are being used for selling other commodities while those with grain storage are refusing to sell grain to urban dwellers. Second, the fair markets there are either short of a rice supply or the prices of rice in such markets are too high or their quality is too low. In addition, some rice shops are running at a loss because the rice they sell is shipped from their original places of production resulting in the rice retail price being much higher than the price limitation set by the state with the highest price set at RMB 1.7 [renminbi] per kilogram. The municipal grain bureau has allocated 10 million kilograms of rice to the state-run grain shops with the highest price set at RMB 1.6 per kilogram.
