FR940725-0-00131 FR940725-0-00019 * * * * * The alternative to the expansion of the scope of this subpart appears to be the institution of a different program for [shore-side] confined spaces. To introduce a new type of confined space entry program into a shipyard facility which already has a workable program seems ludicrous. Two programs would only confuse the employee. By extending the current program, employees will be protected and will immediately recognize the program. OSHA has concluded that the requirements contained in revised Subpart B are necessary for the protection of employees exposed to hazardous atmospheres in shipyards, regardless of the type of work being performed. Hazardous atmospheres can be found in shipbuilding, as well as in shipbreaking and ship repair. The work practices implemented by employees working in vessels and vessel sections should be the same from one job to the next. The atmospheric hazards will basically be the same and the employees move from job to job within the entire shipyard, so the work practices should be consistent. Using one set of work procedures for atmospheric hazards in a shipbuilding job and another for the same hazards for a ship repair job would serve to confuse the employee and could easily lead to accidents. Therefore, revised Subpart B applies to shipbuilding, shipbreaking, and ship repair. A short time after the November 1988 publication of the proposed rule on Explosive and Other Dangerous Atmospheres in Vessel and Vessel Sections, the Shipyard Employment Standards Advisory Committee (SESAC) was established. SESAC was chartered to provide OSHA with guidance in revising, consolidating, and modernizing the varying sets of regulations that were being applied in the shipyard industry into what is ultimately intended to be a truly vertical standard for all shipyard employment. Shipyard employers would be required to comply with a single set of occupational safety and health standards as opposed to a mixture of shipyard and general industry standards. Consequently, the newly developed shipyard employment standards would apply to all shipyard employment regardless of the type of work being performed (for example, vessel repair or fabrication of railroad cars) or location (for example, in the traditional shipyard or ``up river'' or on sea trials). As a step towards this goal, SESAC recommended that the scope of the proposed Subpart B be expanded beyond vessels and vessel sections, to cover all land-side confined space and hazardous atmosphere situations (Tr. 101, 4/25/90). In order for OSHA to include SESAC's recommendations into the rulemaking record and to consider fully comments submitted to the docket concerning the general industry confined spaces proposal, OSHA reopened the record on Subpart B (57 FR 28152, June 24, 1992). The Agency raised a number of questions in the notice reopening the record. The most significant issue that underlines a number of the specific questions is rooted in the unique concept of confined space entry that has been the accepted practice in the shipyard industry for over 25 years (36 FR 10466, May 29, 1971). The fundamental basis of OSHA's shipyard standard has been a reliance on preventing employees from ever being exposed to confined space atmospheric hazards. This has been accomplished by the built-in system of testing and ventilating that has become industry practice and has been very successful at preventing confine and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres accidents. The concept of a single standard, Subpart B, for all shipyard employment was unanimously endorsed by SESAC as well as supported by all of the commenters who addressed this issue in the June 1992, notice (Ex. 11&hyph;3, 11&hyph;4, 11&hyph;5, 11&hyph;6, 11&hyph;8, 11&hyph;10, 11&hyph;13, 11&hyph;14, 11&hyph;15, 11&hyph;16, 11&hyph;18, 11&hyph;19, 11&hyph;20, 11&hyph;21, 11&hyph;24, 11&hyph;26, 11&hyph;29, 11&hyph;31, 11&hyph;33, 11&hyph;34, 11&hyph;35, 11&hyph;39, 11&hyph;41, 11&hyph;48, 11&hyph;50). For example, the National Fire Protection Association (Ex. 11&hyph;19), a voluntary membership organization dedicated to the protection of people and property from fire and related hazards, set out this position as follows: NFPA favors the development of a single standard which provides for safety during entry and work in confined spaces within the shipyard. * * * * * In general, application of two distinctly different standards for vessels and [land-side] operations would be a burden on the industry and would be confusing to employees. Specific points are as follows: First, *␣*␣* employees in the shipyard are familiar with the dangers of all confined spaces, not just those confined spaces associated with tanks aboard ships. This has occurred due to the absence of prior safety requirements for general industry. The shipyards have already adapted the practices and procedures derived from the vessel requirements and applied them to the [land-side], as appropriate.
