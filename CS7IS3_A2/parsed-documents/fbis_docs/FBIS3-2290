Exports to Mainland China totaled U.S.$12.728 billion while imports from the mainland totaled U.S.$1.103 billion, the statistics showed. Hong Kong customs tallies, however, showed cross-strait trade last year totaled only U.S.$8.689 billion, up 17.31 percent from a year earlier. They showed Taiwan exports to the mainland growing 20.63 percent to U.S.$7.585 billion, and its imports from the mainland growing 1.38 percent to U.S.$1.104 billion. Whichever statistics are used, they indicate that the mainland fever of a few years ago has slowed, a BOFT official said, noting that the annual growth rate of exports to the mainland a few years ago was above 40 percent. The BOFT and Hong Kong customs figures are different, the official said, because Hong Kong only counts Taiwan exports that pass through customs checks, and not the ones that are simply in transit to the mainland.
