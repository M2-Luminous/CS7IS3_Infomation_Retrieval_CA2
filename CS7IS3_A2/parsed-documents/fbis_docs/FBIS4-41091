In the president's opinion, the Russian leadership has long ago adopted a political decision in this question. "It would be incorrect on my part to consider President Clinton's visit to Riga as putting pressure on the world power called the Russian Federation," Meri emphasized. Clinton is going to pay July 6 a six-hour visit to the Latvian capital, Riga, during which he is scheduled to meet with Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis and his Estonian and Lithuanian counterparts, Meri and Algirdas Brazauskas. Estonian Ambassador to the United States Toomas Hendrik Ilves told BNS Clinton had first mentioned his wish to visit the Baltic states last September when he met with the three Baltic presidents in New York. White House officials unfortunately dropped Estonia from Clinton's schedule after familiarizing themselves with the blueprints of the Tallinn Airport: the airfield didn't have a runway long enough to receive Air Force One.
