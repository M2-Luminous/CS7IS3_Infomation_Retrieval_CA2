This caused tension within the Senate. Senator Bernard Sansaricq, president of the unofficial [Senate] office, promises to return to the attack via the law, with a view to taking back control of the Senate Office. The following is a report by Daly Valet: [Begin recording, in Creole] [Valet] Firmin Jean-Louis, president of the normalized Senate-- who was in Washington -- has returned to Haiti. However, he did not return to the country just to stand by and and watch Bernard Sansaricq's unofficial Senate Office do it all. Jean-Louis and Sen. Julio Larosiliere went into action very early on 7 March. They took back their offices, which were occupied by Bernard Sansaricq's team. President Jean-Louis and Quaestor Larosiliere said, however, that they are not there to engage in confrontations; rather, they are there for reconciliation. This is why Sen. Larosiliere has proferred the olive branch to Sen. Sansaricq. Larosiliere also asked the parliamentarians elected in the 18 January elections to respect the New York pact, which they signed and which provided for them to refrain from attending Senate sessions while waiting for a solution to be found by the arbitration committee provided for in the Constitution. [passage omitted] Jean-Louis and Larosiliere were not content with taking back control of the Senate. They have already announced that the Senate will meet in normal session on 8 March to work on the parliamentary plan for resolving the crisis. This plan has already passed the Chamber of Deputies. [passage omitted] Meanwhile, in the unofficial Senate Office, everybody is very angry. Sen. Sansaricq stated he would take back the presidency of the Senate using any and all means. For his part, Osny Eugene, quaestor of the unofficial office, has affirmed that Firmin Jean-Louis will be unable to hold sessions at the Senate. [Unidentified journalist] Senator Sansaricq, since we see that Firmin Jean-Louis is there, will you go to your office this morning [7 March]? [Sansaricq] I will take it back by any and all means. I have no further comments to make. Whether I take it back in 24 or in 48 hours, we will restore the order we had established. You can write that down. [Journalist] What strategy will you use: confrontation, force? [Sansaricq] [Response indistinct] [Journalist] Senator, are you ready to talk with the members of the other Office? Are you ready to engage in dialog or will you use force? [Sansaricq] No comment. [Journalist] So, you are ready for dialogue? [Sansaricq] No comment. [Journalist] [Words indistinct] compromise, Mr. President [of the Senate]? [Sansaricq] No, no. No comment. [Journalist] But, will you be in your office on 8 March? [Sansaricq] No comment. I will be in my office. No comment. [Journalist] Will you be conducting the session on 8 March? [Sansaricq] We will use any means we must, but we will be in the office. [Journalist] [Words indistinct] legal force, Senator? [Sansaricq] Exactly. [passage omitted] [Valet] Firmin Jean-Louis and Julio Larosiliere have taken back their offices at the Senate. Bernard Sansaricq and Osny Eugene are angry. Senators Serge Joseph and Romel Manigat, for their part, have gun and rifle in hand. The Senate of the Republic has become a stage.
