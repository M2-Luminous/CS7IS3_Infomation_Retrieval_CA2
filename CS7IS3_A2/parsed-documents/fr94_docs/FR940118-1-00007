FR940118-1-00007 FR940118-1-00005 DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION Office of Elementary and Secondary Education 34 CFR Part 75 Drug Free Schools and Communities Act Regional Centers Grant Program AGENCY: Department of Education. ACTION: Waiver of a rule. SUMMARY: The Department proposes to waive the rule at 34 CFR 75.261 in order to extend the project period under the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act (DFSCA) Regional Centers Program from 48 months to 60 months. This action will allow services under this program to continue uninterrupted, and will result in the awarding of 12-month continuation awards to each of the five existing grantees, using fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds. DATES: Comments must be received by February 17, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be sent to the Division of Drug-Free Schools and Communities, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW., room 2123, Washington, DC, 20202&hyph;6439. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kimberly C. Light, Division of Drug-Free Schools and Communities. Telephone: (202) 401&hyph;1599. Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) at 1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;8339 between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Regional Centers Program is authorized by sections 5111(a)(1) and 5135 of the DFSCA, which is part of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). Appropriations for the Regional Centers Program were authorized through September 30, 1993 by the DFSCA. Section 414 of the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA) authorizes an automatic extension of the DFSCA through FY 1994 (September 30, 1994). The Congress is considering reauthorization of the DFSCA, but final action on the reauthorization is not expected until late in FY 1994. In FY 1990, the Department awarded cooperative agreements for five Regional Centers to provide training and technical assistance services in drug education and prevention to State educational agencies, local educational agencies, and institutions of higher education. The centers were each given a project period of 48 months, based on the project period announced in the Friday, September 15, 1989, Federal Register . Since FY 1990, these centers have been maintained through continuation awards in three subsequent fiscal years (FY 1991, FY 1992, and FY 1993). Each center has received approximately $3 million per year. Based on the automatic extension authorized under section 414 of GEPA, projects authorized under sections 5111(a)(1) and 5135 of the DFSCA can be funded in FY 1994 as well. Any funding after FY 1994 would be dependent on future Congressional action with no guarantee that projects funded under the current authorization could be supported. If a new competition under the existing legislation were held in FY 1994, the projects could only be funded for a limited project period of 12 months. In the past, it has taken new centers up to a year to ``start up,'' given the scope and complexity of the services they provide and the time it takes to hire qualified staff and develop plans and relationships that are responsive to clients in their regions. The Assistant Secretary believes that starting new centers in FY 1994 for only 12 months would severely disrupt the quality and level of center services. Holding a competition in FY 1994 would impose considerable costs at the Federal level without a guarantee that the new centers would be able to provide the technical assistance necessary to school districts as the Department moves to implement Goals 2000 and the new ESEA.
