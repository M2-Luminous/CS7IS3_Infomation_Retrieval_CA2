"Mr. Reporter, we disapprove of President Bedie's behavior, which violates freedom of movement. You may write what you wish. We are forced to obey orders but things cannot continue this way. Ouattara is free to receive anybody he wants. Anyway, we support him this time." This statement was made to us in Cocody on 22 January by a group of soldiers who were about to spray tear gas on Ouattara's close relatives and unwavering supporters near his residence. These soldiers, who were forced to carry out their dirty job on 22 January, looked glum. Bedie's action has only increased Ouattara's popularity. It has especially given us an insight into the dangers of division within the Army, because judging from our observations that day, the soldiers are not all on Bedie's side. One should therefore beware of committing any political blunders that could be detrimental to us all.
