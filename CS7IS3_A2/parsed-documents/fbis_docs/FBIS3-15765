During U.S. Visit Shevardnadze Persuades Clinton of Need for International Military Presence in Georgia"] [Text] Washington, 8 Mar -- U.S. observers believe the main result of the Georgian Supreme Council chairman's current talks in the U.S. capital is the accord between Eduard Shevardnadze and Bill Clinton regarding the advisability of sending UN international forces to Georgia. Admittedly, the U.S. President hinted at the same time that Tbilisi must not count on U.S. troops being sent under the UN flag. Other countries must provide men and officers for "peacekeeping" in Georgia. While Washington will only be ready to provide moral and material support for this action, the White House promised. Having won the support of the U.S. Administration the day before [7 March], Shevardnadze left Washington for New York Tuesday in order to persuade the United Nations to send troops to Georgia. The main purpose of this action, Georgia's representatives say, is to ensure the return home of around 300,000 refugees from Abkhazia. THE WASHINGTON POST cited Shevardnadze as saying that international armed forces will have to be brought into Abkhazia "to ensure the refugees' peaceful return." "It will be very hard to envisage a settlement to the conflict...without the crucial participation of the United States," he said during a conversation with the editors of THE WASHINGTON POST. In the newspaper's opinion, the Clinton administration is "trying to limit Russian involvement in all the former Soviet republics." "What we want to do is to ensure Georgia's territorial integrity," a White House spokesman said. Meanwhile news of Clinton's support for this action has elicited conflicting comment and reactions in the U.S. capital itself. On the one hand, both the administration and Congress are not now averse to showing Russia that Moscow's doctrine of "nearby foreign countries" and Russia's peacekeeping role in the former Soviet republics by no means suit everyone here. On the other, the United States is afraid of the adverse consequences of, albeit indirect, involvement in the intricate conflicts amid the ruins of the USSR. Until recently people here were categorically opposed to sending UN troops (never mind U.S. soldiers) to the "new independent states" in the grip of conflict or to conferring the status of UN peacekeeping forces on Russian units and subunits performing peacekeeping missions there. Even now the U.S. Congress is not united on this problem. Congressmen are particularly worried by the fact that Russian troops will inevitably form a considerable proportion of the UN contingent in Georgia. The United States and the United Nations would thus, as it were, be giving their blessing to Russian peacekeeping efforts in "neighboring foreign countries." And there are too many opponents of that prospect here now. But people are also unhappy that Russian troops are already in Georgia. And they want to "balance" their presence by sending the UN troops for which Shevardnadze is now asking. An anonymous "ranking administration representative" said that UN forces would not under any circumstances be "Russian troops wearing blue helmets." In order to give greater weight to his appeals, the Georgian leader took every opportunity to scare the Americans with the idea of the revival of Russian nationalism. With his customary enthusiasm Shevardnadze described the increase in ultranationalist forces in Russia as a "great threat not only to Russia but also to the whole world" during a press conference in Washington. Speaking about events in Russia, he also declared that "every honest citizen of the world" fears the revival of the "cold war." Shevardnadze did not confine himself to appeals for UN troops to be sent to Georgia and laid the foundations for the development of military cooperation with the United States. He signed a joint statement on this with U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry at the Pentagon Tuesday. This envisages the two countries' opening military missions and carrying out a "military cooperation program" which includes U.S. aid and financial assistance for the reorganization of the Georgian Armed Forces. I would remind you that, according to U.S. press reports, the CIA has been involved in training and arming Shevardnadze's personal guard.
