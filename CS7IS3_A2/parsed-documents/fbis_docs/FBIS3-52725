These issues, Khaddam said, are part of the negotiations, and it is too early to decide on the format of relations. Political sources in Jerusalem told our political correspondent Shlomo Raz that this is the first time that a senior Syrian statesman has spoken about normalization. The sources noted that prior to the meeting between Presidents Clinton and al-Asad, there has been an increase in positive statements coming from Damascus with regard to the peace process.
