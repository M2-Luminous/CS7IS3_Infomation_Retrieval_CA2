With more than 20 percent of ballots counted from Monday's [28 March] votes for a new assembly, government ministers had good backing and Museveni supporters fared particularly well in south and southwest. President Museveni did not stand for any of the 214 seats in a new Constituent Assembly. The commissioner of elections, Mr. Stephen Akabwai, said voting was continuing yesterday in Iganga and Kabarole Districts, the only ones which failed to complete polling on Monday out of 39 across the country. He said there were no major problems in the other areas and voting went on safely, adding that he expected results for more than half of the country to be compiled by yesterday evening and a complete list by today. Nominators said President Museveni's supporters did unexpectedly well in the east, traditionally a stronghold of the opposition.
