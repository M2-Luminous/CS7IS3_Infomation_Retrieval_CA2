Both Houses of Parliament approved the statutory resolutions through a voice vote. Replying to the brief debate, in the Lok Sabha, the Union Home Minister, Mr S.B. Chavan, made it clear that secessionist activities in the northeastern region would not be tolerated, but at the same time, the government would leave no stone unturned to remove the feeling of neglect and alienation among the people. The Minister of State for Home, Mr P.M. Sayeed, who replied to the debate in the Rajya Sabha informed the members that integrated approach to tackle the problem of insurgency in the region was the need of the hour. The Home Minister, Mr S.B. Chavan assured the Lok Sabha that every effort would be made to remove the feeling of neglect and alienation in the North-East, but at the same time any secessionist activities would not be tolerated. "The government is prepared to give any amount of money for the socio-economic development of the northeastern region, provided they utilise the money properly," Mr Chavan said while replying to the debate on the approval of the proclamation of President's rule. The recent meeting of the North-Eastern Council had promised all assistance to the growth and development of the region, although non-plan expenditure was required. Mr Chavan said he had separate meetings with Chief Ministers and Governors of all northeastern States. Several projects which had been taken up during the fifth and sixth plans were still not completed. The government had now decided not to recover any loan sanctioned for any projects in the N-E States, he said. "We have made just a beginning," Mr Chavan said and told the House that several sectoral meetings were being planned to monitor the development. Referring to secessionism, Mr Chavan said the government's priority was to win over the hearts of the local people. The government would not hesitate to take action against those indulging in secessionism, the Home Minister asserted. He said complaints of corruption would be looked into and severe action taken against those involved. Participating in a debate, Mr Jaswant Singh (BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party]) said if the government had intervened in time in Manipur, the killing of a number of people could have been avoided. The substantial funds provided for the economic development of the North-East was not properly utilised. Corruption was one of the major factors for the alienation of the people, he added. Mr Mohan Singh (JD [Janata Dal]) urged the government to curb the activities of Pakistan which through Bangladesh was providing assistance to extremist forces in the North-East. Prof M Kampson (Cong-I [Congress (I)]) urged the government to take an initiative for promoting a dialogue to solve the problem of insurgency in the North-East. Mr Uddhab Barman (CPI-M [Communist Party of India-Marxist]) demanded that the State Assembly should be dissolved and the political process initiated so that a popular government could be installed at the earliest. Extortions, drug trafficking, smuggling and killings were rampant in Manipur. AIDS was also spreading in a big way, he added. Mr Kabindra Purkayastha (BJP) said the State government had no control over the hill district which was under the sway of insurgents and extremists. The insurgency in the North-East was a major threat to national integration. The insurgents had camps and training facilities in Bangladesh, he said. Mr Sriballav Panigrahi (Cong-I) said there was nothing wrong in keeping the Assembly in suspended animation. According to him, there was improvement in the law and order situation in the State. Political parties should help strengthen law and order so that normalcy could be restored in Manipur. Mr Viswanath Shastri (CPI [Communist Party of India]) said the police forces in Manipur should be reorganised to restore the peoples confidence. He stressed the need for fulfilling the aspirations of different groups of people there. Mr George Fernandes (JD) said unemployment, drug addiction and AIDS were serious problems facing the northeastern region and the government would have to adopt suitable measures to overcome them. Mr Kirip Chaliha (Cong-I) said unlike other parts of the country, the northeast people had no caste barrier. They were very much alive to the practical problems and would remain in the mainstream. Mr Chitta Basu (FB [Forward Bloc]) said N-E should get special attention of the government and reminded that forces of secessionism was growing in the region.
