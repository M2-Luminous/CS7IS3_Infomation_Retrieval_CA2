Chief Magistrate Arturo Hoyos believes that keeping him in jail is the right decision. [Begin Hoyos recording] The habeas corpus we reviewed refers to crimes (Mr. Lerner Zimmerman) is accused of committing in the Republic of Panama. Regarding said accusations, the Supreme Court finds that there is sufficient evidence to hold this person in connection with these drug related crimes against the public. [end recording] It is noteworthy that (Jacobo Lerner Zimmerman), a Colombian citizen involved in drug trafficking activities, is wanted by the United States for the same crime. The Supreme Court, however, has already denied an extradition request. [Begin Hoyos recording] There is a ruling by the Criminal Court that denies the extradition request, and that ruling must be executed. [end recording] In view of this Supreme Court decision, (Jacobo Lerner Zimmerman) will have to spend a long time in jail unless he escapes, which is not uncommon in the country's jails among people connected with drug trafficking.
