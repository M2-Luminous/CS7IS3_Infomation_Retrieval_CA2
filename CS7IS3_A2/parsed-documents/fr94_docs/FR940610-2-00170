FR940610-2-00170 FR940610-2-00086 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federall Aviation Administration Notice of Proposed Modification of Airport Improvement Program Grant Assurances AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), (DOT). SUMMARY: The FAA proposes to modify the standard grant assurances required of a sponsor receiving a grant under the Airport Improvement Program (AIP). This modification is due to changes in existing legislation. The Secretary of Transportation is required to provide notice in the Federal Register and an opportunity for the public to comment upon proposals to modify assurances or to require any additional assurances under AIP pursuant to subsection 511(f) of the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982, as amended. DATES: These proposed modifications to the Grant Assurances will be effective July 11, 1994. Comments must be submitted on or before June 27, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments may be delivered or mailed to the FAA, Airports Financial Assistance Division, APP&hyph;500, room 615, 800 Independence Ave, SW., Washington, DC 20591. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Leslie S. Haener (Management and Program Analyst) Telephone (202) 267&hyph;5879. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Secretary must receive certain assurances from a sponsor (applicant) under the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982, as amended. These assurances are submitted as part of a sponsor's application for Federal Assistance and are incorporated in all grant agreements. The current assurances were published on February 3, 1988, at 53 FR 3104 and amended on September 6, 1988, at 53 FR 34361, and on August 29, 1989, at 54 FR 35748. As need dictates, these assurances are modified from time to time to reflect new Federal requirements. Notice of such proposed modifications are published in the Federal Register and an opportunity provided for comment by the public. FAA is planning to modify the assurances currently in use to reflect some changes in the general requirements. FAA uses three separate sets of standard assurances: Airport Sponsors (owners/operators); Planning Agency Sponsors; and Nonairport Sponsors Undertaking Noise Compatibility Program Projects (herein after referred to as Nonairport Sponsor Assurances). Assurance 1, General Federal Requirements, of the Airport Sponsor Assurances and Nonairport Sponsor Assurances is modified to add Executive Order 12699_Seismic Safety of Federal and Federally Assisted New Building Construction, to the Executive Orders section of both sets of assurances. Further, Assurance 1 is modified to add 49 CFR part 41, Seismic safety of Federal and federally assisted or regulated new building construction, to the Federal Regulations section of both sets of assurances. Assurance 1 is also modified to add 49 CFR Part 20, New restrictions on lobbying, to the Federal Regulations section of all three sets of assurances. The addition of this regulation will alleviate the need for project sponsors to file with the FAA, a separate certification stating that they have not made, and will not make, any payment prohibited by paragraph (a), ยง20.100 of 49 CFR part 20. A disclosure of lobbying activities form, however, must still be filed with the FAA if required by paragraph (c), ยง20.100 of 49 CFR part 20. Assurance 1 of all three sets of assurances is also modified to correct the titles of certain Federal Regulations.
