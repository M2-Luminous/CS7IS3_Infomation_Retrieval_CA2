Breaking last year's high of 874.1, recorded on Dec. 17, the two- hour session caught fire on investment in large capitalization issues. The actual gain from last year's close is 22.21 points when the ex-dividend index of 857.11 is considered. Securities experts attribute the bull mood to high expectations for the economy and inter-Korean relations in 1994. January is generally bullish and hopes for an improved economy helped to pump up stock prices, the experts said. There remain fears over sale of stock stabilization fund holdings worth 4 trillion won, but they did not show in Monday's session, he said. Most banking and securities issues leaped to the daily ceiling and shares in construction and trade industries made a strong showing while high-cost low (per) price/earnings ratio and large manufacturing issues were bearish. Gainers totaled 610, including 358 that hit the daily ceiling, outnumbering 146 losers while 55 remained unchanged. Some 22 million shares changed hands on turnover of 436.1 billion won (540 million U.S. dollars) during the two-hour session.
