[Correspondent] Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen said today at the news conference of the Nordic foreign ministers' meeting in snow-covered Haga Castle that the EU is now seriously discussing its relations with Croatia. The reason is the alliance Croatia has formed with Serbia. There are UN sanctions against Serbia, while Croatia has so far been treated more or less uncritically in the international community. [passage omitted] Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas repeated the threat which exists against the Croatian Government. [Begin af Ugglas recording] There is permanently a latent threat against Croatia, much depends on Croatia's conduct, to tell the truth, to what extent the Croatian regular units are active in Bosnia, to what extent new massacres can be discovered; and I am of the opinion that it was useful that the Danish foreign minister pointed out that the European Union itself has possibilities because Croatia is very dependent on trade opportunities and so on. And that shows that what we in Sweden hope for, a stronger European cooperation, also gives direct forcible means against aggressive warlords. [end recording] [Correspondent] With closer links with the EU, Sweden would have better possibilities to act against Croatia, that seemed to be Margaretha af Ugglas' conclusion. The good relations Germany has with the Croatian government work against any talk about a harder attitude toward Croatia.
