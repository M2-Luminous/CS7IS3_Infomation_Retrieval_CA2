Despite the vagueness of the resolution, the USA abstained from voting for the resolution. Moreover the American representative declared that her government opposed any reference to the Arab lands occupied by Israel as occupied lands including the city of Jerusalem. The Security Council resorted, on the behest of the USA, to a strange way in voting on the resolution. Accordingly, voting was taken on each paragraph separately. The resolution did not refer to any responsibility of the Israelis in this crime nor to any condemnation of Israel's state terrorism. The condemnation was worded, in each paragraph, in a manner that did not refer directly to those responsible for the massacre or charging anyone for this act. JANA's editor for international affairs described what took place in the so called Security Council as a new absurdity showing once again that the Security Council is a lie. This showed clearly that the Security Council is the Western Christian countries, if not America, which dominate it and that the alliance between Christians and Jews against Muslims lies behind this American stance towards the massacre of al-Haram al-Ibrahimi. It has become clear to the whole world that the resolutions passed in the name of the Security Council especially in relation to Arab matters are wholly Western-American resolutions. The resolution was adopted without any effective condemnation of Israel for terrorism for America did not want this condemnation or sanctions imposed on Israel whereas when it comes to issues which may serve her political objectives, America pass, on mere suspicion, resolutions of condemnation for terrorism imposing sanctions and embargo and applying Chapter Seven of the U.N Charter against whomever she wishes. This stance exposes America and deprives her even of the fig leaf revealing her before the whole world as a terrorist state sponsoring and supporting official terrorism and protecting its perpetrators. JANA's editor for international affairs concluded his commentary by stressing that "the act of the Security Council today shows clearly what the leader of the revolution meant in statement immediately in the wake of the massacre of al-Haram al-Ibrahimi when he declared `although the massacre represents the most hideous act of terrorism ever seen in the world.' It is clear and express act of terrorism but we challenge the West to announce this fact and admit that the act of the Israelis is a premeditated official terrorism. It is part of a long chain of Israeli terrorist acts and condemn the Israelis for terrorism."
