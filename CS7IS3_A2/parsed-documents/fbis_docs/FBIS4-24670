According to the statistics, China's export value of agricultural products was U.S.$10.11 billion last year, 2.5 percent up over the year before and making up 11.1 percent of the total export value in the country, indicating that such export was basically in a wandering state. Though the country saw a great growth in quantity of most agricultural products for export since there had been three years of good harvests in the country, resulting in a big increase of agricultural products and animal livestock, the country's export value of general trade, which is the main way for agricultural exports, was U.S.$7.61 billion last year, dropping by 12.4 percent. Experts said that the decline in China's agricultural product competitiveness in the international market mainly resulted from the low quality and low prices of such products and the growth of such exports in the country mainly depended on the increase in amount of exports.
