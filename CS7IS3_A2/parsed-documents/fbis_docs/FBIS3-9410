He spoke of illegal structures, quasi-intelligence services, disqualifications, and physical liquidations in Nova Gorica -- and now the government's leadership publicly tells him that, on the basis of the verified information, there is no proof for his claims. Therefore, the president is speaking without any basis, which in a normal democracy would already be enough to make one think. The political coordinating group is a term from the past, but one cannot deny the competence of the team that met on Monday. In addition to the main ministers, the chiefs of both (legal) intelligence services were also present there, and who could judge about the state and its security matters more authoritatively! If this "security leadership" therefore agreed on all the most important issues, it would be difficult to object, and even more difficult to say that president's opinion is more "authoritative." Kucan thus remained isolated with his claims. This cannot be eased even by the fact that his main opponent, the defense minister [Janez Jansa], attended the Monday meeting. It was almost certainly the prime minister [Janez Drnovsek] who decided about "the outcome" of the meeting and who approved the final version of the statement. Knowing Drnovsek well, along with his skill and tact when it comes to current dilemmas, last Monday could not qualify as one of Jansa's triumphant days. The prime minister could not "establish" that illegal secret services are rummaging around Slovenia and that the country is facing its disintegration; that is why the wording in the statement appears to be to the liking of Janez Jansa, but it was not necessarily put on the paper in this form because of him and his interests. The fact that the defense minister cannot celebrate victory does not mean, however, that Kucan did not suffer (at least) a temporary defeat. In a way this was also confirmed by a letter that he addressed to the prime minister on the very same day and in which he allegedly again warned him of some of his meetings with senior police officers and the SOVA [the Slovene Information-Security Agency]. It was supposedly precisely these people who told him about the organized groups that engage unlawfully in intelligence activities and exceed their authority, all to the possible detriment of security. Kucan's letter in itself reflects the highly unfavorable position in which he has found himself: Not only that he has been saying things in Nova Gorica that "the security leadership" subsequently coolly denied, but the senior state officials misinform him! Perhaps they are even doing this deliberately. How could one otherwise interpret the fact that they subsequently attended a meeting with the prime minister at which they concluded that the activity of which the president spoke did not take place! Or have they changed sides in the meantime?! If Kucan wishes to retain authority, it probably will not be very good for him to tackle such and similar issues in front of the public tribunal -- although he will, on the other hand, be forced to explain to this tribunal what he meant by everything he said in Nova Gorica. In other words, the Monday "ruling" of the political coordinating group literally stripped the president naked before the public; he will now find it hard to explain what sort of clothes he actually has. The people can merely observe this mysterious political supergame -- which appears increasingly less likely to have a happy ending, even if only a tiny one -- with their jaws agape. The fact is that even after the "qualified ruling" put forward by Drnovsek's political coordinating group, very few people believe that nothing worth mentioning is happening in the country. The prime minister's sense of tact inspires hope that he will gradually neutralize all those antagonisms that are escalating matters dangerously through skillful maneuvering; despite this, the Slovene state has absolutely no guarantees for the future. If everything regarding Kucan and Jansa is merely a metaphor for some deeper ongoing thing, for example, the conquest of strategic economic and political positions in the future Slovene society, then any possible "disciplining" of the participating factors can only be short-lived. Either way, the processes will have to run their course deep down. The question is, of course, whether the Slovene organism will survive these efforts. Are there sufficient economic, international, psychological, and other resources for this supergame, which chooses one metaphor today and an entirely different one tomorrow, to finally run to its end? Nobody any longer expects a happy ending, but we cannot leave the cinema either.
