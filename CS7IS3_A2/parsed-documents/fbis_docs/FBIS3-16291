Nikolay Yegorov told an ITAR-TASS correspondent that the president showed that he is very well informed about business and political life in the Kuban. He enquired about the course of spring field work, and the provision of Russia's breadbasket with fuel, mineral fertilizers, and other material and technical resources on the eve of the new sowing campaign. Nikolay Yegorov said that the president paid particular attention to discussing the problems of Krasnodar Kray as a territory on Russia's southern border. Issues of the migration of the population from CIS "trouble spots" were discussed. The president agreed with the proposal by the kray's leadership temporarily to introduce a visa regime on the territory of Krasnodar Kray while the acute situations in the Transcaucasus region continue. Nikolay Yegorov said that the Russian leadership will apparently adopt an appropriate document on this matter very soon. The conversation lasted about five hours. [passage omitted]
