However, the two sides termed the dialogue as "productive" and agreed to continue the talks at various levels through "quiet diplomacy." Speaking at a press conference here Saturday, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott said he had a "more productive" dialogue on important issues including nuclear non-proliferation with Pakistani leadership. "This dialogue will continue as we search for ways to make more substantial and bilateral progress to advance our goals in the region as a whole, " he said. Talbott, who flew into Islamabad from New Delhi on Friday as part of the U.S.' effort to "rid South Asia of nuclear weapons," brought two proposals regarding the verifiable capping of Pakistan's nuclear program in exchange for F-16s and the convention of a multilateral conference on nuclear non-proliferation and regional security in South Asia. He spent a busy day Saturday, meeting President Farooq Leghari, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, officials of Foreign Office as well as some opposition leaders. "Pakistan reiterated its position of not accepting unilateral capping of its nuclear program and called for an equitable and balanced approach towards non-proliferation in South Asia," said a Foreign Office spokesman Saturday while briefing newsmen about the wide-ranging talks with Talbott. "Unilateral capping of nuclear program is not acceptable and that remains our position," he reaffirmed. Pakistan has been insisting that it would not unilaterally open its nuclear facilities for inspection unless the same is done by India, a neighboring country with which it had fought three wars since 1947. Talbott, on his part, stressed at the press conference that F-16s is a part and parcel of the U.S. initiative to secure a verifiable cap of Pakistan's nuclear program. "The status of F-16s and our proposal about capping of Pakistan's nuclear program are obviously tied up together and they will be considered together," he claimed. Washington suspended all its military and economic aid to Pakistan in October 1990 under Pressler Amendment on suspicion that Pakistan has developed a nuclear device which Pakistan denied. Pakistan's nuclear program also triggered U.S. refusal to deliver those F-16s which Pakistan had already paid for. Meanwhile, in a statement issued Saturday, Nawaz Sharif, the country's main opposition leader, also rejected any inspection and verification of Pakistan's nuclear program, saying these will be tantamount to a rollback.
