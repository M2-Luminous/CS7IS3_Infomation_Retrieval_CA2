FR940106-2-00020 FR940106-2-00007 CBCC contends that it would be improper for the Department to allocate all of CBCC's depreciation expenses on all furnaces to FeSi production. Although theoretically, any one furnace could be used to produce any of the products that CBCC sells, this does not make the furnaces fungible. The Department's determination should not be based on what could theoretically be produced in a furnace, but rather what was actually produced in each furnace. Regardless, if the Department considers the furnaces fungible, this would result in a lowering of CBCC's depreciation expense as furnaces one through six are fully depreciated. DOC Position: We agree with CBCC. Its methodology of matching furnace depreciation with the product actually produced in each furnace is an acceptable methodology. Accordingly, no adjustment has been made for the final determination. Comment 9: Petitioners claim that at verification CBCC's reported consumption and cost of electricity attributed to FeSi were understated for October 1992. Therefore, petitioners believe that the Department should increase these costs for each month of the POI. CBCC maintains that the Department verified that only the month of October contained an error of 5.7 percent with respect to the electricity consumption and cost; such error was incurred in transferring expenses from one cost report to another. Thus, CBCC concedes only that the Department should adjust its October, 1992, electricity consumption and cost by 5.7 percent, rather than making monthly adjustments. DOC Position: We agree with CBCC. At verification we established that this was an isolated error and not a methodological problem. Accordingly, we have corrected the reported electrical consumption and cost for October 1992, only. Comment 10: Petitioners state that CBCC failed to properly calculate inventory holding gains/losses. Petitioners argue that CBCC reported its input and finished product inventories on a first in first out (FIFO) basis, which is contrary to Department practice. Furthermore, petitioners claim that CBCC provided no inventory holding gain/loss calculations for iron ore. Accordingly, petitioners believe that the reported values cannot be relied on for purposes of the final determination and the Department should apply BIA. CBCC maintains that it provided inventory gain/loss information according to the Department's methodology used in the Final Determination Of Sales At Less Than Fair Value, Silicon Metal from Brazil , 56 FR 26977, June 12, 1991, where the Department rejected CBCC's cost accounting method used in the normal course of business, stating that it did not properly reflect the effects of inflation and used a FIFO basis to make the calculation. With respect to the inventory holding gain/loss calculation for iron ore, the Department verified that CBCC maintains no more than its immediate requirements in inventory. Thus, CBCC submitted no inventory holding gain/loss information on this raw material because there is none. CBCC's monthly purchase of iron ore is consumed during that month. DOC Position: We agree with respondent. In reporting on a FIFO basis, CBCC followed prescribed Department practice. The Department verified that CBCC had no gain or loss on the iron ore because it completely consumed its purchases in the same month as production. Comment 11: Petitioners argue that Minasligas' U.S. sales of slag during the POI are within the scope of this investigation. Petitioners base their argument on the petition's scope language, which they claim does not specifically exclude slag of the chemical composition that Minasligas sold to the United States during the POI. Petitioners further argue that even if the slag were not covered by the product description in the petition, it is within the scope under the criteria outlined in Diversified Products Corporation v. U.S. , 572 F. Supp. 883 (CIT 1983) (`` Diversified Products '') criteria. Conversely, Minasligas states that its U.S. sales of slag are not covered by the scope of this investigation. Minasligas bases its argument on chemical analysis certificates provided at verification, which list chemical compositions which Minasligas claims are sufficient to exclude the slag sales from the scope of the investigation. Specifically, Minasligas argues that, according to the petition, the high levels of oxygen and calcium oxide present in these slag sales places them outside the scope of the investigation. DOC Position: We agree that ferrosilicon in the form of slag can be included within the scope of investigation if it generally meets the chemical content definition contained in the scope of this investigation and if it is capable of being used as FeSi. (See Scope of Investigation .) With regard to the two U.S. sales of FeSi slag made by Minasligas, we determine that these sales are within the scope of the investigation based on information on the record indicating that the slag in question can be used as FeSi. Since we do not have actual price or cost data for these two sales, we will assign an average of all margins calculated for Minasligas' sales for which we have price and cost data. Comment 12: Petitioners argue that Minasligas failed to provide complete cost information requested by the Department in conjunction with a previously unreported sale. Thus, petitioners argue that the Department should assign a ``noncooperative'' BIA margin for that U.S. sale. Minasligas maintains that it provided all necessary information relating to this sale. DOC Position: Since we used a price-to-price comparison for this sale, petitioners' points are moot.
