All the resolutions the government made today were unanimous. Minister Yosi Sarid is here with us. [Sarid] All the resolutions were unanimous. The first decision is to create a state commission of inquiry. Another decision passed was to issue restrictive orders against the extreme settlers, the men who instigate fighting and strife, those who constitute a real danger. Another decision speaks of administrative detentions; yet another speaks of the need to disarm extremist settlers, mainly in Qiryat Arba' and Hebron. Also, the attorney general was ordered to examine the possibility of outlawing extremist organizations. It is my understanding that he will present his decision in a few days. These are the cabinet resolutions. They are important and set a precedent. I believe their gravity matches the grave view the government holds of the terrible incident that took place at the Cave of Patriarchs on 25 February. [Hecht] When you speak about restrictive orders, we even heard of exile orders.... [Sarid, interrupting] Not exile [haglaya] orders; I speak of restrictive [hagbala] orders. Exile orders were also examined but, for legal reasons, we reached the conclusion that they will not be effective enough. [Hecht] What do restrictive orders mean, and to how many people will they apply? [Sarid] I do not want to discuss figures because they do not matter. What matters is the resolution, the precedent that was set. In the initial stage, the figures may be low but, should the need arise, they will grow. A restriction means that people within the Green Line boundaries will not be able to cross it if it is feared that they may constitute a threat. People residing beyond the Green Line will not be able to enter sensitive places that might turn into centers of riots when such people who act madly -- and they are not mad, they only act that way -- arrive there. [Hecht] Does this mean that the hard-core Kakh activists and supporters will be removed from Hebron and Qiryat Arba'? [Sarid] I cannot speak in generalizations because the reference is to specific, individual people. There is no doubt, however, that the government today decided to deal with the hard-core extremist elements with a very firm hand. [Hecht] What will be the terms of reference for the state commission of inquiry that you decided to set up? [Sarid] The precise mandate of the commission will be drafted and determined today by three persons: the foreign minister, the justice minister, and the education minister. [Hecht] Who will head it? [Sarid] By law, the president of the High Court of Justice, and he will determine the composition of the commission, not the government. This is one of the advantages of a state commission over other investigating teams. [Hecht] You and the other Meretz ministers came here today well prepared, with a precise list of measures that should be taken against the mad extremists in the Hebron area. Are you satisfied that the government accepted your recommendations? [Sarid] We are very pleased. The government did not accept our recommendations. I said before the session, and I say now, there is nothing special about the Meretz ministers. I am happy to say that the vast majority of the ministers share the same views. I believe all of them do -- after all, the decisions were unanimous. Therefore, I do not believe that Meretz should keep itself separate from the other ministers. [Hecht] Did the prime minister brief you about the upcoming resumption of the peace talks? Do you, as a senior member of the negotiating team, know of it? Did you get any message from the PLO? [Sarid] Regrettably, we cannot say that talks are resuming at this point. There is no doubt, however, and we believe that the resolutions we made today will make it significantly easier to resume the negotiations in the coming days.
