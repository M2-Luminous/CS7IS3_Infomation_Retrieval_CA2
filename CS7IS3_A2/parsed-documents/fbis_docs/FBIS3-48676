The editorial reads in part: We still have to overcome many weaknesses and shortcomings. Nonetheless, those important achievements have created new opportunities and premises for us to gradually lead the country to a new development stage and accelerate the national industrialization and modernization program a step further. Our country is facing great challenges, namely, the danger of left farther behind economically compared with many countries in the region and other parts of the world, the danger of deviating from the socialist path in case we fail to overcome irregularities in direction for implementation, the very serious development of corruption and bureaucracy, and the hostile forces' peaceful evolution strategy and maneuvers. We have great opportunities but also face great challenges. In reflecting the will of the entire party, the conference maintained that we have the possibility and determination to grasp opportunities and overcome challenges. It maintained that we are resolved to motivate the entire party, people, and army to display single-mindedness, make outstanding efforts, heighten the spirit of independence and self-sufficiency and self-help, broaden international cooperation, practice frugality, instill honesty, uphold righteousness, make every effort to exploit advantages, eliminate dangers, overcome challenges, and successfully materialize the general goals set by the Seventh Party Congress. The conference is also resolved to accelerate the implementation of the objectives of the socioeconomic stablization and development strategy for the period till the year 2000, and to strive to turn into reality the goals of making the people rich and the country powerful and to bring about justice and civilization in society. The conference stressed the need to effect economic restructuring to serve the industrialization and modernization goals. From now until the end of the decade, let us pay special attention to the industrialization and modernization program to benefit agriculture and the rural economy. As the conference put it, this program is part of the key tasks for the days ahead. This is the way for our country to overcome the danger of being left farther behind compared with the neighboring countries, to maintain political stability and social order, safeguard national independence and sovereignty, and persist in the socialist path. To this end, we must adopt uniform measures to carry out the multisectorial economic development policy and create even more favorable conditions for the different economic sectors and business establishments to develop quickly and achieve high results. It is necessary to form a uniform market mechanism under state management that is in accordance with socialist orientations. It is important to pay due attention to social and cultural issues as well as consolidate national defense and security capabilities. Continued efforts must be made to broaden diplomatic relations and build a law-governed Vietnamese state which belongs to, comes from, and works for the people so as to make the country advance quickly and firmly under all circumstances. Speaking at the Midterm National Party Conference, Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi said: Lying ahead of us is a new era full of bright prospects, great challenges that we must be resolved to overcome, and favorable opportunities that we must exploit to the full extent. To seize opportunities and overcome ordeals, our party must upgrade itself in proportion to its tasks. It must be renovated and rectified. Ties between the party and the people must be consolidated. We must ensure political and ideological unity within the party, that party cadres and members are thoroughly aware of party concepts and policy lines, that they improve their knowledge and persist on their path toward socialism, and that all party organizations and every party cadre and member can creatively apply and develop Marxism-Leninism, Ho Chi Minh thought, and the best contemporary ideas, and sensitively acquire new things and correctly deal with issues that arise. We must strengthen the unity bloc within the party, apply various organizational principles to party activities, especially the principle of democratic centralism, build the party into a steadfast bloc, and be more mindful of consolidating and strengthening grass-roots party organizations and consolidating the close relations between the party and the people. We must strive to study to improve our knowledge and build our revolutionary ethics and a wholesome lifestyle. These are the most important things in party building. Party cadres and members must constantly improve their knowledge and their actual organizational abilities, associate themselves closely with the people, scrupulously comply with party resolutions and directives and state laws, exemplarily carry out the motto of industry, thrift, integrity, and righteousness, and resolve to fight wasteful spending, corruption, and illegal dealings. As an immediate task, they must successfully carry out the resolution of the midterm national party conference and must take the lead in guiding the entire society in achieving the general goals set forth by the seventh party congress for the period until 1995. This means overcoming difficulties and ordeals, stabilizing and developing socioeconomic activities, enhancing political stability, dispelling negativism and social injustices, and basically tiding the country over the crisis in the advance toward building a prosperous people, a powerful country, and an equal and civilized society.
