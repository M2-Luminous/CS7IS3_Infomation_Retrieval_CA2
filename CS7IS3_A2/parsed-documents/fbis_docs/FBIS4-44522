The output values of the two accounted for 13.1 percent of the total output value. It means that 86.9 percent of the products have been produced by enterprises in accordance with the market situation. The machine-building industry will continue to develop itself towards this direction in 1994. China will register another high rate of growth in its national economy in 1994. The GNP is expected to rise by 9 percent. There will be more investments in fixed assets under the state plan; and more loopholes will be plugged so that more funds will be available for major construction projects as compared with 1993. With the improvement of the people's living standards, more machinery will be needed in general. The world machinery market is also quite vast. Therefore, we reasonably believe that there will be a higher rate of growth in the machine-building industry in 1994. Naturally demands vary for different types of machinery. We must pay attention to the major developments in our national economy and the international market, and continuously readjust our product mix in order to make our products more competitive and export-oriented. As long as we go with the tide of the situation, we will be able to triumph. Whether or not our machine-building industry will score even greater achievements in 1994 lies in how we deepen our reform and carry out our production and business activities in accordance with the market economic system. 1. Work Hard To Strengthen Market Investigation and Survey, and Business Policy-Making. Enterprises must pay full attention to the markets. They must fully understand the actual requirements of the international market as well as the domestic market. They must also study the potential requirements, and gather all kinds of information. They must fully understand consumer needs, market capacity and the current situation in promoting scientific research and development. They must know their competitors' product features, means of production, production costs, prices as well as their supporting factories' properties of products, production capacity, delivery schedule. The enterprise must also take advantage of their own advantages. They should know their competitors and themselves. Only then, will it be possible for them to win victories. Although work in this respect has been strengthened since machine-building industry has changed its trend from one of product economy to one of commodity economy, it is far not enough. We must mobilize workers in all sectors, and carry out the work of investigation and analysis from all angles. Enterprises must periodically hold meetings for business policy-making; solicit all kinds of proposals; carefully analyze them and form policy decisions; and send them back to various departments to have them implemented. If the enterprises keep on making policy decisions in such a way, they will definitely be able to play up their strengths and avoid weaknesses, become more competitive and certainly win victories. 2. Work Harder to Strengthen Scientific Research Work The machine-building industry not only supplies facilities for the development of the four modernization programs, but also provides machinery to help people improve their living standards. With the rapid development of science and technology, we must fully realize that machinery reflects modern science and technology. It is for this reason that we must work hard to strengthen scientific research work. Whoever produces fine and durable machinery will win consumers' confidence. Modern science and technology demand that we train a group of professionals of multiple disciplines. The Art of War by Sun Zi mentioned: "There are only five colors, but it is hard to perceive the changes of the five colors. There are only five flavors, but it is hard to fathom the changes of the five flavors." It means that there are only the red, yellow, blue, white and black colors, but it is hard to estimate the number of changes in mixing all the colors. There are only five flavors -- sweet, sour, bitter, pungent and salty --, but it is difficult to fathom the changes when all flavors are mixed in cooking. We might as well regard the modern machinery as a combination of devices using technologies in machine-building, electricity, hydraulics, gas and light. The changes are unlimited. As long as we combine them in different way and in a flexible manner, our opportunities know no bounds as pointed out by the Art of War by Sun Zi. We must mainly rely on ourselves to improve our products. Enterprises must strengthen their forces in conducting scientific research and development. Meanwhile, they must also solicit outside help by importing foreign technologies and cooperating with scientific research organizations and colleges and institutions of higher learning. 3. Work Harder to Readjust Enterprises' Product Mix Only when products are readily marketable, can enterprises that manufacture such products flourish. Enterprises must follow the market when they turn out their products. However, the supply and demand on a market are constantly changing. Actually all machinery products will go through the stage of development, stage of growth, stage of maturity and stage of obsolescence. The current situation is that such cyclic changes are becoming faster and faster. Therefore, enterprises must constantly adjust their product mix. Those enterprises which manufacture a single product must start working on the next generation when their product of the previous generation has entered the stage of maturity and the sale of such product is still good so that the new product will be able to replace the old when the time comes. Enterprises that manufacture many varieties of products must upgrade their products on a rotation basis. Thus, their production and management should be developed in a balanced manner. Efforts must be made to prevent any adjustment of the product mix from adversely affecting the operation of the enterprises. The adjustment of the product mix may also create a series of problems to production engineering. Right now, foreign machine-building factories often make full use of numerical control machine tools and institute the soft manufacturing system. This is aimed at increasing the capability of the enterprises in coping with changes. Although the initial investment will be greater, it can shorten the period and reduce the cost in adjusting the product mix. Basically speaking, it is worthwhile to do so. (h3} 4. Work harder to Push Sales If it is said that to strengthen market surveys, make correct policy decisions and develop products that are readily marketable is a process of cognition and practice from the market to the product, then how to make consumers know the product and help such product become more marketable is also an important process which is definitely not less important than the first one. We often talk about helping the product "work its way" into the market. This phrase "work its way" means that we must strengthen our efforts in pushing the sales of the product. A good salesperson must carefully brief the customer about the performance, quality, delivery schedule, price, after-service and other good points of his own product, and make the customer feel at ease and pleased to buy such product. A salesperson with good business ethics must never try to defame other people's products. He should know how to give prominence to his own products. As far as each enterprise is concerned, to push the sales of products is not merely selling the merchandise alone. The enterprise must introduce to the customer the capability of the factory in developing and manufacturing the products. It should supply the appropriate machinery equipment in accordance with the customer's requirements. In order to adapt ourselves to market mechanism and sell more machinery products, we must pay attention to public bidding and carry out our work well in submitting tenders. To succeed in public bidding, we must, first of all, satisfy the needs of the consumer, be more competitive among the fellow bidders, and make money for one's own enterprise. In order to make correct and timely responses, the enterprises must compile all kinds of reference material and build various types of data bases. Enterprises must strive to build and cherish their own reputation. They should realize that only with a good reputation, can their products enjoy a greater share of the market. 5. Work Harder to Strengthen Enterprise Management In Order to Become More Competitive It is necessary to become more competitive in terms of performance, quality, delivery date, price and services. All of them are based upon an enterprise's scientific management in quality and cost control and its energy and material-saving measures and its production technology. All these are important aspects. The Ministry of Machine-Building Industry must regularly call for efforts to strengthen enterprise management and raise their standards. All this is aimed at making themselves more competitive. What merits attention is the fact that some time ago when the sales of machinery products were picking up, some enterprises once again attached importance to speed and price only instead of management efficiency. It is necessary to rectify this situation. 6. Work Harder to Strengthen Motivational Mechanism Heaven makes the final decision as to how things shall end up. How to fully arouse man's enthusiasm is an extremely important issue. The leadership of the various enterprises must adopt measures to help workers strengthen unity and become more creative and encourage them to make suggestions and work harder than ever before for the enterprises. Efforts must be made to improve personnel management, the wage system and the incentive mechanism, and to encourage the professionally qualified people to work harder and offer more to the enterprises
