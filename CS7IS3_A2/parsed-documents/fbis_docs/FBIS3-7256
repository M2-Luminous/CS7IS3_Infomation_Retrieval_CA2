The defense volunteers are deployed at Ban Sap Tali and nearby villages, and at Ban Phakkat in Tambon Khlong Yai, Pong Nam Ron District, the point where refugees were sent back. The deployment of defense volunteers was aimed at preventing a new influx of refugees as well as to stand by in readiness for any trouble that might happen where there is a large crowd of people. According to the latest report, exchanges of artillery fire were heard sporadically from inside Cambodia. Correspondents from Chanthaburi Province reported renewed exchanges of gunfire between the Cambodian Government and Khmer Rouge forces. There was an intense exchange of about a hundred artillery rounds between 2300 and midnight yesterday opposite Tambon Khlong Yai, Pong Nam Ron District. Three rounds landed inside Thailand. There was a report that at 1000 today Cambodian Government troops clashed with the Khmer Rouge forces opposite Ban Khlong Yai in Tambon Khlong Yai. About 400 Cambodian people crossed the border into Thailand at Ban Nong Kok, about 10 km from Ban Phakkat in Pong Nam Ron District. A Thai marine, however, explained that those refugees are the people living along the border. They would cross into Thailand whenever there was a fighting and return to Cambodia when the fighting died down.
