Confrontation with Kiev, be it explicit or implicit, and gravitation towards Russia are now typical not only of the Crimea but of other fairly large parts of the Ukraine as well. Representatives of totalitarian trends are bound to appear in the new parliament, as are their opponents. This is unlikely to help reduce tension in the top echelons of power or increase the capability of the supreme bodies of state authority. Meanwhile, presidential representatives have been outspokenly critical of incitement towards separatism, of which they accuse the leaders of the Crimea. For example, the head of the Ukrainian president's internal policy service, Mykola Mykhalchenko, told journalists recently that Kiev is likely to have to apply the same measures towards the Crimea as India in the Punjab or Great Britain in Northern Ireland.
