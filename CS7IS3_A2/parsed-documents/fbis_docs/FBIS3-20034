The government is with its Baltic policy and its talk of the need for shock therapy for Russia, replied Pierre Schori (Social Democratic Party [SDP]). Pierre Schori is, with his talk of missile attacks on Belgrade and his quotes from confidential telegrams from Moscow, said Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas (Moderate Party). Wednesday's [23 February] foreign policy debate in the Riksdag turned into a tense showdown between af Ugglas and her challenger for the foreign minister's position after this fall's elections. Schori called for an active Swedish policy in the former Yugoslavia but more thought regarding the Baltic and Russia. Margaretha af Ugglas emphasized consultation with other countries on the war in the Balkans but advocated an active policy in the Baltic. Political Burden Schori quoted from a report from Orjan Berner, the Swedish ambassador in Moscow, who warned the government about economic and foreign policy advice to the Russians. Given the current uncertain situation, each comment could become a political burden for Sweden. "Where is the gentleness and the care when Schori quotes from confidential documents?" the foreign minister wondered. This year's foreign policy review was dominated by the European Union [EU], the war in Bosnia, and developments in Russia and the Baltic. The government made a clear distinction between its policies and a former foreign policy line: "What we want to achieve is an arrangement that has freedom and democracy as its foundation. The many attempts during the Cold War to create detente and cooperation across blocs were all based on conceptions of coexistence between systems with freedom and lack of freedom." However, developments in Russia, especially talk of "the country next door," are cause for uneasiness: "We can now understand tendencies toward a return to a more traditional model of tensions," the foreign minister said as she spoke in some detail about the Baltic countries. The alleged abuses of human rights there are baseless, she said: "Protestations to the contrary serve no constructive purpose but rather risk being seen as pieces in a power policy." Seeks Generosity At the same time, she counseled those countries to be generous towards their minorities. And, as Carl Bildt before her, the foreign policy review pointed to an active policy towards the East: "We can never sit by indifferently when there are developments that carry threats against either Russia's democracy or the independence of the Baltic states." Schori accused the government of "diplomatic conformity and political passivity" in foreign policy. Gone are the creativity and the determination, he said, taking the former Yugoslavia as his first example: "That must be the area closest to our hearts and the main goal of our actions." But, on the other hand, with respect to Russia and the Baltic, Schori would like to see more thought and consultation: "It is more urgent than ever before to put simplified notions about shock therapy behind us. The government cannot privatize policy towards the East." Schori went on to criticize the government for lacking the determination to put effort into a Swedish seat on the Security Council and for providing support to the East that was squandered and uncoordinated. On the whole he saw foreign policy as an extension of domestic policy, even on the issue of the European Union: "It is hard to expect that a government that is trying to disarm Sweden socially will work on behalf of social rearmament in Brussels." "Schori's tone is pathetic," Margaretha af Ugglas replied. "Where are the alternatives?" Schori referred to Liberal Party criticism of "impotence" in Bosnia and "distance from the slaughter in Bosnia." Broad Consensus Instead Daniel Tarschys (Liberal Party), the chairman of the standing committee on foreign policy, emphasized the large measure of partisan political consensus on the issue of Yugoslavia. And Par Granstedt (Center Party), who took part in his last foreign policy debate, wondered why the Social Democrats want to have a confrontation over foreign policy. Schori replied saying that the center parties, unlike the Moderates, stand for traditional Swedish foreign policy. Invite Zhirinovskiy here and tell him that we will not stand by passively and see Russia threaten the Baltic, Christer Winden (New Democracy) suggested. "Trying, through EU membership, to create a European security arrangement is the worst way to respond to a Russian threat," said Bertil Mabrink (Left Party). "That just makes Russia more uncertain." Quotations of an Unusual Sort Pierre Schori will probably go down in history as the first person to have read from a letter to the foreign minister from a Swedish ambassador in an important neighboring country in the Riksdag's chambers. What Schori quoted to the chamber and foreign ambassadors from the speaker's lectern was a handwritten letter to Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas dated 5 January of this year from the Swedish ambassador to Moscow, Orjan Berner. In a longer report, Berner summarized his assessment of the current situation in Russia and gave the foreign minister seven pieces of advice, sources at the Cabinet Office and Ministries told TIDNINGARNAS TELEGRAMBYRA. Piece of advice number seven, the last one in the letter, alluded to Prime Minister Carl Bildt's statement about the need for more shock and less therapy in Russia. Schori quoted Ambassador Berner's assessment. "Exercise caution about talking about any economic policy advice. No matter how right and legal the shock therapy warnings may be, they are a political burden." [passage omitted]
