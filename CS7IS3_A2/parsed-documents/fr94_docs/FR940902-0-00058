FR940902-0-00058 FR940902-0-00010 Section 627.465 specifically provides that the new rules apply only to property acquired after July 1, 1993. Several commenters inquired about the rules applicable to property acquired prior to July 1, 1993. It was the Department's intent in the interim final rule that such property would continue to be governed by the rules in effect at the time the property was acquired. To ensure that this intent is explicit, the previous JTPA regulations on property are added as a new paragraph (e) in the final rule. The only change is the citation for records retention requirements. The JTPA regulations in effect prior to July 1, 1993, provided that the Governor was to maintain accountability for property in accordance with State procedures, but applied three specific Federal requirements: (1) A reservation of the Secretary's rights to such property; (2) record retention requirements; and (3) either reimbursement to the JTPA program of the fair-market value for any unneeded JTPA acquired property retained for use in a non-JTPA program or the use of proceeds from the sale of such property used for JTPA purposes. It is recognized that the Department has no rights in property acquired with title II or III funds awarded to States from the inception of JTPA in 1983 through July 1, 1993, but that the Department does have rights in property transferred to JTPA from CETA. Therefore, as long as the proceeds from the sale of JTPA acquired property or the fair-market value of such property transferred to other uses are expended for JTPA purposes and records maintained accordingly, the Department views any further requirements governing such property to be the responsibility of the Governor. For CETA-acquired property transferred to JTPA, the Department's rights in such property are specified in the current Department regulations implementing the applicable OMB Circulars. Recipients and subrecipients are expected to follow those regulations in disposing of CETA-acquired property. Performance Standards In addition to adult and youth programs under title II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C and dislocated workers under title III, ยง627.470 provides for the establishment of performance standards for older worker programs under section 204(d) of the Act. The standards for both adults and youth may include standards for employment competencies which are to be based on such factors as entry-level skills and other hiring requirements. The purpose of the performance standards guidance set forth in these regulations is to establish the general requirements for implementing title II&hyph;A, title II&hyph;C, and title III performance standards. Specific policy requirements will be developed in consultation with the JTPA system and will be subject to a formal public comment process. Several commenters asked when the new performance standards requirements would take effect. Current performance standards measures and implementing provisions, as specified in TEGL's 10&hyph;89, 7&hyph;91, and 11&hyph;92, will remain in effect through Program Year (PY) 1993. In accordance with the transition provision of section 701(b) of the JTPA Amendments, revised performance standards were published July 11, 1994 (59 FR 35381 (July 11, 1994); standards pertaining to 6-month retention in unsubsidized employment shall not take effect before July 1, 1995. In regard to setting 6-month retention standards, several commenters advised the Department to conduct a study to identify and address technical issues related to using Unemployment Insurance (UI) wage records to document placement and retention of participants. In preparation for developing and implementing policy in this regard, the Department of Labor has already undertaken a study to examine the technical and operational issues associated with the use of UI wage records for the purpose of implementing performance standards related to employment retention. The study was conducted in 16 States and focused on such issues as quality of data, timing for incentives, and out-of-State and uncovered employment. The results of the study will be available in the fall of 1994 and will provide important input into the decisionmaking process and guidelines for implementing the 6-month retention standard. The Department recognizes that there will be a variety of issues to be addressed in developing and implementing a retention standard. When the results of the study are available, the Department will work with State and local staff to introduce, wherever feasible, alternative post-program measures. In addition, it is important to note that interim credit, which a few commenters believed should be incorporated in the performance standards, will be considered in the development process. The Department emphasizes, however, that there is no maximum participation limit and no Department-imposed requirement that everyone be terminated at the end of a given program year. Performance standards are based only on those individuals who do, in fact, terminate. A number of commenters provided advice on implementing the performance standards required under section 204(d) of the Act, which implies that these standards are to parallel those developed for title II programs. While the specifics of older worker performance standards will not be addressed in the regulations, the process for developing these standards began in the summer of 1993. Program experts and advocate groups for older workers were consulted in developing performance standards for older workers programs. In addition, in response to other comments recommending adoption of performance standards for adults based on competency attainment, it is important to note that skill acquisition for adults is included among several possible performance standards factors identified in section 106(b)(3)(E) of the Act. In order to insure that any standards established for skill acquisition are fair and practical, the Department has begun to collect relevant administrative data and also to examine experience with youth employment competencies and initiatives, such as the Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS) and apprenticeship programs. In addition, beginning in 1994 the Department will consult with academics and program practitioners to determine practical approaches to defining adult competencies. Performance standards for adult skill acquisition will be issued in PY 1996, at the earliest. With the exception of the older worker program, the Governor is responsible for establishing an incentive policy that rewards performance in title II programs and for: (1) Establishing a process for adjusting performance standards to account for local conditions, and (2) providing technical assistance to SDA's which fail to meet performance standards for a given program year.
