According to preliminary statistics, in the first 10 months of 1993 a total investment of 1.0018 billion yuan was spent on 11 key transport construction projects, up 115.54 percent over the same period in 1992. In keeping with the aim of quickly and effectively building an integrated transport network, Anhui stresses construction of national railroad trunk lines and road hub network projects. At the same time it is strengthening north-south road connection capabilities and expanding roads towards the coast. The scale of projects is increasingly large and grades are ever more improved, an initial indication that a modernized transport network with a backbone of high quality roads is taking shape. -- Regarding railroad construction: By the end of October, 54.4 percent of the entire multiple track line roadbed in cubic meters of earth and stone within Anhui Province of the Beijing-Jiujiang railroad was completed; more than 80 percent of the bored pile design for five particularly large bridges on the Fuyang-Jiujiang line was finished; and 41 percent of the Fuyang hub in earth and stone cubic meters was done. Construction began on two particularly large bridges and 26 medium-sized bridges. Forty-four kilometers of principal track on the Fuyang-Huainan multiple track line were laid; the entire line can be running, within one year, attaining the goal of linking three areas. One hundred kilometers of the Hefei to Anqing section of the Hefei-Jiujiang were laid, reaching the town of Gaohebu. On the Hefei railroad hub, 560,000 earth and stone cubic meters have been worked. Work has begun on building 21 bridges and culverts and 28 medium-sized bridges. -- Regarding highway construction: The first stage of the Hefei-Wuhu highway, a 52-km roadbed from Xiage to Shenjiaxiang, has been lain. The entire roadbed for the Hefei-Tongling first-grade highway restricted to vehicle use, linking Hefei, the coastal economic zone, and the Huang Shan and Jiuhua Shan tourist areas is done. All-out efforts are being invested in road surfacing. Recently the groundbreaking was held for the Dalong section of national highway 312. Seven of the eight main river piers for the Tongling-Chang Jiang highway bridge have emerged from the water and work is beginning on the superstructure. -- Regarding airport construction: Anqing airport expansion has been examined and approved by the state. The Wuhu-Beijing airline officially began flying. The construction curtain was raised on the Fuyang airport. -- Regarding harbor channel construction: With the Wuhu port as the "faucet" of Anhui's river coastal area, construction is intensifying on modernized harbors with Maanshan, Tongling, Shazhou and Anqing as the two wings. The Xin'anjiang region unified airline was arranged to build a new group of passenger and cargo wharves using French Government loans for the Xin'anjiang airline overall utilization development project. After it is built it will provide the conditions for developing Huang Shan tourism and coastal economic development.
