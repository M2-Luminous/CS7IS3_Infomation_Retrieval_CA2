FBIS3-48685 "dreas018__a94006" FBIS-EAS-94-018-A Document Type:Daily Report 27 January 1994 ANNEX Japan Banks Expanding Loans to U.S. Corporations 94P30023A FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94P30023A FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Article Type:CSO [Editorial Report] The 4 November Tokyo NIKKEI KINYU SHIMBUN in Japanese, page 1, carries an article by reporter Sadaharu Shimizu noting that the large Japanese banks operating in the United States have begun to expand financing activities to U.S. companies. The article notes that last year, in the United States as well as in Japan, Japanese banks "gave priority to the disposal of nonperforming assets," and thus were generally cautious about increasing their loan assets, But as of the end of September 1993, the capital adequacy ratios of the top-tier banks rose above 9.5 percent "across the board," so that the "specter" presented by the 8-percent capital adequacy ratio set by the Bank for International Settlements [BIS] has "faded away." This, coupled with the fact that the demand for capital in Japan is sluggish due to the prolonged recession, that "the amount of financing per deal in the rapidly growing Asian market is small," and because the banks seek to "maintain their earnings in the international sector," has led the Japanese banks to shift toward the U.S. corporate market for new lending opportunities. According to the article, Sanwa Bank has set its goal for the second half of FY93 to increase financing in the U.S. "by just over 6 percent compared to the first half of FY93." The Industrial Bank of Japan [IBJ] is also proceeding with plans to expand American corporate lending by about 6 percent in FY93, while the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan [LTCB] plans an increase of "5-plus percent" in FY93. Major Japanese commercial and long-term credit banks are participating in corporate financing deals led by banking groups. Two banks, Sanwa and Mitsubishi, are participating as "co-lead managers" in the bank financing of Viacom in its attempted buyout of Paramount Communications. IBJ and the Bank of Tokyo, which are usually "aggressive" in financing corporate takeovers, are also backing Viacom. Financing for QVC, Viacom's opponent in the struggle to take over Paramount, is being led by the LTCB. Several banks, including Sanwa and Sumitomo, are anticipating loans to Eastman Kodak's chemical subsidiary. And six banks, including Fuji and LTCB, are expected to join "core banks" in extending the "enormous sums" IBM will require for its corporate restructuring.
