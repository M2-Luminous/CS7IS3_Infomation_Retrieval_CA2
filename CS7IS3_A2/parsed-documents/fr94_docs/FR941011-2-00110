SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION/Permit No. 95WM1&hyph;NSFA/ASA: On July 19, 1994, the National Science Foundation published a notice in the Federal Register of permit applications received. An environmental assessment addressing the decision to issue the permit entitled, Master Permit Application for Materials and Waste Management and Waste Disposal, was prepared prior to the issuance of the permit and is available for public review. A waste management permit for the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP) was issued to the following applicants: Co-Applicants U.S. Naval Support Force Antarctica, Building 836, Construction Battalion Center, 651 Lyon Street, Port Hueneme, California 93043&hyph;4345 Antarctic Support Associates, 61 Inverness Drive East, Suite 300, Englewood, Colorado 80112; The permit applies to USAP activities at all of its facilities in Antarctica. The effective date of the permit is October 1, 1994. The expiration date of the permit is September 30, 1999. Conditions of the Permit The permit conditions are as follows: 1. Definition of ``permit''. The ``permit'' consists of volumes I and II of the ``Final Master Permit Application'' dated 27 June, 1994; and Attachment 1, Master Permit Application, signed by the permittees as amended or supplemented by the permit and associated conditions (this six-page document) signed by the Director, NSF, Office of Polar Programs. 2. Negligence. Attachment 1, Master Permit Application is amended as follows: Delete It is understood that NSFA and its personnel, and ASA and its personnel, will not be held responsible for accidental discharges or releases of designated pollutants or wastes, unless such discharges are the result of gross negligence. Add NSFA and its personnel and ASA and its personnel, will not be held responsible for accidental discharges or releases of designated pollutants or wastes, which are cleaned up in accordance with the permit unless there is a finding of negligence. Accidental releases such as those listed in the permit are inevitable in the harsh operating conditions of Antarctica. Discharges may result, in whole or in part, from safety considerations; equipment, facility, or pipeline failure; weather conditions such as high winds, limited visibility, icy conditions or extreme cold. Absent unusual circumstances, such discharges would not be considered negligent and would not be actionable under the permit.
