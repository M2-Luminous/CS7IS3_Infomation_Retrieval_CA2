The charges made to EL ESPECTADOR reporters in Narino Department, where Tumaco is located, state that soldiers, wearing uniforms with the acronym "USA" on them, have even been asking residents of the area for their identification papers. According to several residents of that port town, the soldiers, who "are tall, well-built, and blond-haired" have conducted "sudden patrols" of the town, supposedly while conducting antidrug trafficking operations. The alleged actions of the foreign soldiers adds yet another ingredient to the problem Colombia is facing because of the presence of some 150 U.S. soldiers in Juanchaco, a small town located along the Pacific coast but quite removed from Tumaco, where, according to official reports, they are building a school and health center. The soldiers arrived in Colombia in early January and their arrival unleashed a heated debate that included the State Council asking congress to investigate President Cesar Gaviria for violating the country's sovereignty.
