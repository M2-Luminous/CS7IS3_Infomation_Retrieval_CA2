Muradov and his delegation arrived in Beijing on 20 February for a six-day visit to China at the invitation of the NPC Standing Committee. This is the first Turkmen parliamentary delegation to visit China since Turkmenistan became independent. Qiao Shi extended his warm welcome to the delegation. He said: China and Turkmenistan are near neighbors. China hopes to establish good-neighborly and friendly relations with Turkmenistan on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence, and to increase friendly relations and cooperation in various fields -- political, economic, scientific and technological, cultural, and educational. He expressed his belief that the delegation's visit would enhance friendship and understanding between the two peoples. Qiao Shi said: China has undergone tremendous changes during the past 15 years of reform and opening up. Its cooperation with other countries also has increased significantly, achieving world-renowned results in introducing foreign funds and technology. In briefing the guests on China's people's congress system, he said: China's NPC has played an important role in promoting the country's democracy and legal system. Qiao Shi said: China has to draw on foreign experience, whether in developing democratic politics or the economy. It cannot, however, indiscriminately copy foreign models and must proceed according to its own national conditions. Muradov said: Turkmenistan attaches importance to developing relations with China and is closely following China's economic development. This is because China's experience can serve as a reference for Turkmenistan's economic development. During the meeting, the two sides expressed hopes for further strengthening exchanges between the two parliaments in the future. Other than Beijing, the delegation also will tour Tianjin and other areas. Tomur Dawamat, vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, and others were present at the meeting.
