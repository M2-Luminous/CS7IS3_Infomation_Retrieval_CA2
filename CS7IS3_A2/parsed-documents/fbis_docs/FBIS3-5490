The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is dispatching a trade mission jointly with petrochemical concerns and trading houses to China to sell the idea, a ministry official said. The mission is to meet Chinese Government officials during a visit from next Thursday through March 13, the official said. Japan is ready to provide Chinese firms with low-interest loans from the Export-Import Bank of Japan if the two sides reach agreement on the deal, the official added. Japan has an ethylene-manufacturing capacity of some seven million tons a year, way above the five million tons needed domestically every year. Ethylene is a key petrochemical material used in a wide range of industrial resin products. China now faces a shortage of petrochemical products such as resins as it industrializes, according to the official.
