The question naturally arises of why S. Dubinin has been appointed in an acting capacity rather than as finance minister straightaway. Will a new candidate for this important post "emerge" in a few days' time? But, according to confidential information obtained from the presidential entourage, S. Dubinin will in due course be confirmed as finance minister. And the "acting" formula creates, as it were, a diplomatic pause, during which the public reaction to the new appointment can be assessed. After all, this key government post is now coming in for heightened attention from the media. I think that the reaction to S. Dubinin's appointment as finance minister will be positive or, at any rate, calm. After all, he was recommended by Boris Fedorov. Moreover, it was under B. Fedorov that S. Dubinin came to the Finance Ministry as first deputy, and he has always been seen as a man close to the former minister, which guarantees at least in general terms the maintenance of a tough financial policy. Admittedly, reacting positively to his successor, B. Fedorov nonetheless voiced doubt that he would be able to withstand the pressure from top government officials who, following the obvious change in economic policy, will start demanding more and more loans from the Finance Ministry. But it should be stressed at this point that whenever B. Fedorov went anywhere on a trip, he always left S. Dubinin "in charge." And it was during these periods that the latter earned the moniker "Mr. No!" -- a clear reference to his uncompromising attitude as regards various financial demands. Incidentally, it is always easier to refuse when you are a deputy -- even a first deputy -- than when you are a minister. But I think that we will very soon learn whether the new minister's nickname is accurate or not. Unfortunately, we do not yet know the view of S. Dubinin himself on how financial policy will turn out in the coming year. After all, the acting finance minister's first day in his new job was spent in interminable conferences and consultations with his immediate entourage. At any rate, that was what his office told us. We can also report that S. Dubinin is 43 and a doctor of economic sciences. He was at one time a senior lecturer at the Moscow State University Economics Faculty, worked in the president's apparatus in 1991-1992, and later worked as deputy chairman of the Russian Federation State Committee for Economic Cooperation with the Commonwealth Member States before finally moving to the Finance Ministry in March 1993.
