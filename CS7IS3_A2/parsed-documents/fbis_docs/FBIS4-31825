Autonomy has been almost forgotten. That is why at the beginning of the interview with Mijo Matanovic, chairman of the Provisional Zupanija Committee of the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Union] of Bosanska Posavina, we asked whether establishment of the federation and the borders of the Posavina Canton proposed by the Vienna agreement are the reason why the talk about autonomy died out? "Posavina has always been different from Herceg-Bosna. Because it is also physically distant, and communications are complicated, there was a desire for some autonomy, but it was not an endeavor to separate Posavina from other Croatian regions, but of autonomy within that space. Establishment of the canton brings about a kind of realization of that aspiration. The only essential thing for us is for Bosanska Posavina to be preserved intact as a Croatian space, and it makes absolutely no difference whether that is a province, canton, or something else." Why Are Brcko and Gradacac in the Muslim Canton? [Sabic] Are you satisfied with the agreed borders of the canton? That is, they do not coincide with the borders of the Vance-Owen province which the Posavina people considered the optimum solution. [Matanovic] There has been a departure, and this occurred in the area of Brcko and Gradacac. Under the Vienna agreement, those two opstinas belong almost entirely to the Muslim canton, but the proposed map nevertheless has great importance, because most of the Croatian space occupied by the Serbs has nevertheless been included in the Croatian canton. However, it is not clear to me why the territory of Brcko and Gradacac has been included in the Muslim canton. When the map of Bosanska Posavina was being worked out, we in the zupanija committee tried to embrace the area in which Croats are in the majority, and we had information that the Muslim leadership had nothing against the opstinas of Brcko and Gradacac going mostly to Posavina. No one explained to us what happened afterward. [Sabic] Nevertheless, the occupation is the biggest problem? [Matanovic] Of course. Especially because it is not very likely that the Serbs will make any essential concession in the area of Posavina in the negotiations. [Sabic] That means that the military option for resolving the problem of Posavina is fairly likely? [Matanovic] In that respect, the Posavina people have always felt that we should show our teeth. After all, if we have lost Posavina militarily, we never renounced it. I hope that today we are ready to do that job. [Sabic] A protest of Posavina refugees in Zagreb was recently announced, but very few assembled. It was later explained that the meeting could not be held for certain technical and certain political reasons, but the fact is that very few people came and that fewer and fewer people are coming to meetings like that. What is your interpretation? [Matanovic] I do not know what actually happened in the case which you mention, but it seems to me that there have been too many of these rallies and meetings about Bosanska Posavina, and that might be the reason. We who are operating on the territory on the other side of the Sava believe the essential thing is for all ideas and all proposals to come right from the free portion of Posavina. In that area, all the occupied opstinas have their own brigades, the opstina HVO's [Croatian defense councils], and opstina committees of the HDZ, so that all conditions exist for initiatives to come from there to solve the problems essential to the future of Posavina. It seems that the Posavina people have grown cool to all the ideas raised from outside that region. [Sabic] Are you maintaining any relations with the refugees? [Matanovic] There is an agency in every opstina which is concerned with the refugees. In the cantonal government system, there will also be an office for displaced persons in Bosanska Posavina, which will provide us far greater opportunities for contact with refugees from Posavina. [Sabic] For several weeks, battles have been announced for the space through which the Serbian corridor passes; it is said that those battles might be decisive for the outcome of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. What is the situation in Posavina, do you take the position that it is ready for that development of events? The Corridor Is Important to Us and to Them [Matanovic] It is clear that the corridor is the biggest problem of Posavina, but also of Croats and Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina in general. Serbian propaganda has done its job concerning that problem, it has created the idea that the corridor is a necessity if there is to be an end to the war. However important it is to them for the corridor to survive, it is important to us that it not exist, and it is certain that we will try to realize our desire. [Sabic] Nevertheless, there will have to be some transportation connection of the Serbian regions in western Bosnia with Serbia in the final demarcation, at least in some transitional period to full normalization of relations in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Do you have any proposal for solving that problem? [Matanovic] There will have to be some compromise. If the Muslims are able to pass into western Bosnia, and the Croats from Posavina to southern parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, then the Serbs will have to pass to Banja Luka. In that sense, it probably will be possible to achieve some agreement. But the corridor in the sense it has today will not exist. There possibly could be a highway under international supervision. [Sabic] A portion of the Croatian population from Brcko Opstina is on the other side of the corridor; the 108th (Brcko) Infantry Brigade of the HVO is also there. Are you maintaining any contacts? Is there coordination? [Matanovic] A system of communications with Brcko Opstina exists at the level of the military commander, that is, at the level of the corps district, so that some contacts are made, but I cannot talk about details. [Sabic] The question of the fall of Posavina is often raised, and in this connection there is always talk about the fall of Odzak, Derventa, Modrica, and Bosanski Brod, but no mention is made of the fall of Bosanski Samac, which came under Serbian occupation almost without a fight. What is the reason for that? [Matanovic] In my judgment, the fall of Samac signified the beginning of the fall of Posavina. I do not know why this is not being paid the attention it deserves, but the fact is that no steps whatsoever have been noticeable since that opstina fell under Serbian authority. [Sabic] The soldiers in Posavina are announcing that unless there is an appropriate political decision and organized liberation of Posavina they may undertake independent action. One action has in fact been carried out, rather unsuccessfully it seems. Do you expect that there really could be others? [Matanovic] You are probably thinking of the Svilaj action. However, I would not say that this was an unsuccessful action; if nothing else, it showed the fighting determination of the Posavina fighting man. I think that such actions are possible in the future as well. It will be difficult to control them if nothing is done to solve the question of Bosanska Posavina, if not by peaceful means, then by taking coordinated military action.
