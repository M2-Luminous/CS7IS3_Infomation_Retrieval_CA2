Speaking in Bonn yesterday, he said that the objective behind the visit was to better express the Islamic Republic's stance on important world issues and to follow up on relations between the two countries. Commenting on the topics discussed with the German officials, the vice chairman of the Majles Foreign Policy Commission stressed: We held detailed discussions on matters concerning Central Asian countries and ways for Tehran-Bonn cooperation in that region, as well as the Islamic Republic's policy on Middle Eastern problems and especially on the PLO-Israel accord. Larijani said that another topic discussed during his talks with the German officials was the issue of Salman Rushdie. He said: We pointed out to Bonn officials that the support by Western statesmen, and especially by Germany, for Rushdie is not only an insult to millions of Muslims in the world but is also a tension-creating element among the various faiths and harms international peace, security, and understanding.
