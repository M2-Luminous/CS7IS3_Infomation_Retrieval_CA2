While inspecting a steel-tube company, Zou stressed that in addition to appropriate external conditions, enterprises should take it as an essential point to expand the market share of their products on the basis of fine quality, scheduled delivery and good post-sales services. At Tianjin port yesterday, Zou boarded the vessel "Zhenhe," China's first fourth-generation container ship, which was heading for Europe. He remarked that the vessel's virgin sail indicated that China had become one of the countries leading the world in container transport, and the port was to become one of the best starting points in the "Eurasian bridge." Port officials said that the vessel, equipped with state-of-the-art satellite navigation, telecommunications, and alarm and unmanned operation systems, is the most up-to-date container vessel in the world.
