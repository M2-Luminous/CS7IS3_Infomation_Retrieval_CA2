Ahtisaari himself gave prominence to his working group as his most important message at the press conference he arranged yesterday at Tamminiemi. Remarkably enough in his introductory remarks he made no mention of the historic decision made an hour earlier to grant the authority to sign the EU [European Union] agreement. Ahtisaari dismissed the suggestion that the appointment of his working group can in any way be seen as a vote of no confidence in the government. In a somewhat irritated tone he rejected suggestions that this means that he is dissatisfied with the government. He said that he wanted to arrange a clear link with the government by appointing the Labor Ministry's administrative director as the group's general secretary. The president did not allow himself to be drawn into any discussion of the constitutional aspects of the matter -- something on which criticism has concentrated. Asked his view of the criticism he simply replied: "I have not heard anyone who is unemployed saying this." He justified his move by saying that the reduction of unemployment down to a tolerable level is a major national issue which not even the president can disregard. "It is as important as the relocation of the evacuated population and the payment of war compensation were in their day. Perhaps we were successful then because there was national unity," he said. The group includes Matti Pekkanen, the retired director of the Central Association of the Forestry Industry, Nokia managing director Jorma Ollila, director Jukka Pekkarinen of the Employees' Research Institute, Maj-Len Remahl, the chairman of the retail workers' trade union, Labor Ministry administrative director Pertti Sorsa, and Professor Antti Tanskanen. Pekkanen acts as the group's chairman and Sorsa as its general secretary. According to Ahtisaari, the goal should be that before the end of the century unemployment should fall to 200,000. "I have assumed that temporarily at least we should dare to also adopt exceptional, even radical measures," the president said. The working group will present a report to Ahtisaari before the end of September. He is unwilling to anticipate at the present time what will happen then. President Ahtisaari admitted that the Center Party congress did have some effect on the fact that the authority to sign the EU agreement was granted yesterday. "For me it did not matter whether is happened on Friday or on Monday -- as long as it happened in good time before the meeting (on Corfu next weekend)," he said. Social Democratic Party chairman Paavo Lipponen has criticized the government for not reaching a decision on the authority to sign the agreement last week and instead putting the decision off until after the Center Party congress. Ahtisaari will also travel to Corfu along with the government's representatives, and he himself will deliver Finland's five-minute address to the meeting. He gave no firm answer when asked whether the legislation covering the national support package should be completed by the Eduskunta before the EU referendum -- a condition laid down by the Center Party. "This depends entirely on whether people manage to give full consideration to the laws in time. But I do not think that anyone wants to slow them down," he said. According to Ahtisaari, the question of whether the support package is a precondition for joining the EU should be decided by each party individually. However, he is also hoping for broad national consensus on the support package. "I have not met a single Finnish politician who would have said that there is no need for a support package. There may be differing views about the details -- for what length of time the package's measures should remain in force, for example," he said. Asked about the EU Commission's position on the support package Ahtisaari said that the Commission's consideration of the package has not even begun yet, but that he had not heard that anyone had said that the package is absolutely unacceptable. Ahtisaari said that this fall he himself will make a number of public appearances in the context of the EU question, at a UKK seminar on 3 September, for example. But in the field of foreign and security policy he does not intend to express any new ideas during the course of the fall. "We have made our position known and it has been accepted by the EU. If the Finnish people decides that we should join, we will have a lot of time next year to discuss and prepare ourselves for the intergovernmental conference in 1996. Then we will also be able to see more clearly how thinking on these issues is developing in Europe as a whole. There is no need to have this discussion this fall," he said. Ahtisaari also revealed that last week he ate lunch with his predecessor, Mauno Koivisto. He hopes to be able to meet Koivisto again later this summer, perhaps on the volleyball court at [presidential summer residence] Kultaranta. Ahtisaari traveled out to Kultaranta yesterday afternoon.
