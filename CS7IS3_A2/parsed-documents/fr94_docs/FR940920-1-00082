To calculate mid-1990 dollars, multiply 1987 dollars by a factor of 1.111. Total cost values may not add due to rounding. b GCP = good combustion practices. c CI = activated carbon injection. d APCD = air pollution control device. e MB/WW = mass burn waterwall combustor. f SNCR = selective noncatalytic reduction. g SD/ESP = spray dryer and electrostatic precipitator. h The costs presented are based on the assumption that an existing ESP was upgraded and retrofitted with a spray dryer system. i NA = not available. Because the capital cost of the existing combustor was not available, the total costs could not be calculated. Refer to the baseline combustor cost in table 3B for new facilities, which is similar to the cost for existing facilities. j MOD/SA = modular starved-air combustor. k DSI/ESP = dry sorbent injection and electrostatic precipitator. l The costs presented are based on the assumption that an existing ESP was upgraded and retrofitted with a dry sorbent injection system.
