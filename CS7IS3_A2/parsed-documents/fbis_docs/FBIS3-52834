In a communique released last night, Saharawi leaders made no secret of the fact that they were surprised. Jerome Bastion reports: [Bastion] Twenty-four hours after Charles Pasqua's brief visit to Layoune, the Polisario Front in Algiers expressed the surprise and the total dismay of the Saharawi people regarding this most serious gesture. According to the communique, this first visit by a leading foreign official to Western Sahara is in blatant contradiction with the responsibility of France, a member of the UN Security Council. France recently offered its good offices to set up a direct meeting in Paris between Moroccans and Saharawis, after Polisario leaders had criticized France's wait-and-see policy in connection with the settlement of the conflict in Western Sahara. The visit by the French interior minister, although unofficial, has thus caused frustration and disappointment, I quote, among the Saharawis, all the more so because it was to be followed by that of his Saudi counterpart. At the same time, the UN representative for Western Sahara, Yaqub Ali Kahn, is touring the region. He is visiting the refugee camps of Tindouf today. He said yesterday in Nouakchott, in Mauritania: The issue of the Sahara is in a critical state. The referendum on self-determination was to take place at the end of 1993 under the aegis of the UN. The UN secretary general has just announced that it could be organized next June. The issue is still in deadlock. It was to be at the core of the talks which took place yesterday between the Algerian foreign minister and Saharawi President Mohamed Abdelaziz together with his minister of defense and of foreign affairs.
