Haji Badru Wegulo, chairman of the Uganda People's Congress (UPC) of exiled former President Milton Obote, and another official, Patrick Rubaihayo, were freed conditionally after appearing in court Monday, they said. They have been charged in connection with a document released by the party setting out its controversial manifesto for forthcoming elections to the constituent assembly. The polls, scheduled for March 28 have been opposed for a number of issues. The UPC has in particular alleged that President Yoweri Museveni's National Resistance Army (NRA) was dominated by foreigners, mainly of Rwandan origin. Museveni has strongly denied the allegations, saying they were intended to insult him and to question his integrity.
