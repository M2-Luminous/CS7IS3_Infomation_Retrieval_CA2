FBIS4-37211 "drnes118dd_94008" FBIS-NES-94-118 Daily Report 19 Jun 1994 Palestinian Affairs Sha'th: Meeting Only `Reception' Sha'th: Meeting Only `Reception' TA1906101794 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew 0900 GMT 19 Jun 94 TA1906101794 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Hebrew BFN [Text] Nabil Sha'th has explained that his meeting with members of the Palestinian Authority [PA] scheduled for tomorrow at Orient House in East Jerusalem will be a reception and not a working session or an official meeting. He told our correspondent Moti Amir that he will confer with the PA members in Jericho this afternoon to brief them about his meeting with Major General Amnon Shahaq, during which he will discuss the continuation of the negotiations on the implementation of the autonomy agreements. Dr. Sha'th said that a reception, and not an official meeting, will be held for him at Orient House. He added that he will pray at al-Aqsa Mosque and visit churches in East Jerusalem tomorrow. Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert has called on the prime minister to take immediate action to thwart Sha'th's plans to visit Jerusalem. He told our correspondent Aviv Bushinsky that such a visit would constitute a violation of the autonomy agreements. The National Religious Party [NRP] and Moledet have joined the call to prevent the PA from holding a meeting in East Jerusalem. Our correspondent Hayim Hecht quotes NRP leader Zvulun Hammer as saying: Giving the PA a foothold in Jerusalem is tantamount to letting it trample on the State of Israel's honor. Moledet leader Rehav'am Ze'evi said the Palestinians are making a mockery of the State of Israel, and that is why Rabin must prevent the meeting in Jerusalem.
