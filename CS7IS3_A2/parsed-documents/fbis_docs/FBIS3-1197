"I have decided to take the initiative, to assume my responsibilities," he tells us. "The peace accord must be applied. There has been too much delay. This time, everybody has his back to the wall...." After reading his statement, the president of the principal opposition party, the Rwandan Democratic Movement, promptly returned home. Like all the country's politicians, he fears assassination. This weekend Rwanda was torn between hope and fear: Hope of finally seeing the country break the political deadlock and acquire a responsible government and fear of renewed violence that would once again block the transition. This time the countdown will be short: The prime minister-designate has requested the president of the Republic to set, by 21 March, the date on which he will swear in the new government, which will consist of five ministers from the Patriotic Front. If he does not receive a positive reply by this deadline, Twagiramungu will act to strictly apply the Arusha accords, by the terms of which, if the head of state fails to fulfill his obligations, the prime minister can himself swear in the government with the assistance of the president of the Constitutional Court and the agreement of the outgoing prime minister. Despite the danger of open and violent confrontation with those who are trying to delay the transition indefinitely, a number of reasons have encouraged Twagiramungu to assume his responsibilities: "I cannot relinquish my rights to found a government in favor of a president of the Republic who interferes in the internal affairs of the parties and seeks to impose those parties which are favorable to him. Also, I have reached an agreement with the parties which were preventing the new government from taking office, the Rwandan Democratic Movement and the Liberal Party." Twagiramungu has in fact made room for an opposition leader within his own party, namely the former Prime Minister Dismas Nsengiyarenye, and has also acted to settle divisions which were tearing apart the Liberal Party, entrusting the Justice Ministry to a "third man." Aloys Nyuhita belongs neither to the "Hutu" faction, which has close links with the president's party, nor to the "Tutsi" faction, which is accused of being an "objective ally" of the Rwandan Patriotic Front. The question of whether or not the Justice Ministry should be entrusted to a representative of the radical opposition or a member of the Liberal Party linked to the president's party is a crucial one: It is the justice minister who must decide who is responsible for the wave of violence, attacks, and assassinations that have shaken Rwanda over recent years. After lengthy negotiations, the prime minister-designate thus believes that, for his part, "everything is ready: I have reached an agreement with the different parties, allocated posts in accordance with the representativeness of all the parties, and none of them may claim to have been excluded. The ball is no longer in my court." Repeated Pressure Mr. Twagiramungu has spoken out after a week of intense negotiations conducted with all the political parties, including the Patriotic Front, by the Tanzanian foreign minister, who returned home without result but who did exert pressure on the prime minister-designate to move away from entrenchment. "I have the support of the whole international community," Twagiramungu said, "of the Tanzanian facilitator, of the UN representative, who has constantly repeated that by 5 April the Security Council will reconsider the mandate of the blue helmets, and of Western observers. If my list is not accepted by the head of state, it will be clear for all to see who is really responsible for the deadlock." Will President Habyarimana finally agree to swear in a transitional government in which he has no blocking minority, or will renewed violence, orchestrated by the political militia, once again break out during the next few days? Rwanda has genuinely reached a crossroads: It will either disintegrate into self- destructive violence, as has neighboring Burundi, or it will adhere to the Arusha accords and commit itself to power-sharing between the Hutu majority and the Patriotic Front. "This democratic process, which is facing incredible resistance, is, for Rwanda, a revolution more important than in 1959, because at the end of the road, what we ultimately envisage is national reconciliation, and the creation of a state founded on the rule of law," concluded Twagiramungu, before crossing a capital where, as soon as night falls, the only vehicles on the roads are the jeeps of the Belgian blue helmets.
