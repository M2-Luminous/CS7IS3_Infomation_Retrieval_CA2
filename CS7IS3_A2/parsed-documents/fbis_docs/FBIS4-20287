Cetin issued statements at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport after returning from New York, where he had gone to attend the meeting of the Islamic Conference Organization's [ICO] Bosnia-Herzegovina Contact Group. Cetin said that the urgent measures necessary to stop the tragedy in Bosnia-Herzegovina were discussed at the meeting and stated that the issues agreed upon were compiled into a 22-item statement. Cetin indicated that this statement was announced to the world and also submitted to the UN Security Council. Cetin noted that the statement issued by the ICO Contact Group stresses once more the international failure regarding the attacks on Gorazde, which is declared a safe haven by the United Nations. Noting that the Belgrade administration and its extensions are wholly responsible for the genocide in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the statement requests the International Court -- established to judge war crimes -- to start work at once. The statement further notes that the ICO supports all international efforts aimed at stopping the cruelty in Bosnia and points to the necessity of having international protection for the people of Sandzak and Kosovo. Cetin explained that he delivered a speech at the UN Security Council pointing out the necessity of having more determined and urgent actions taken by the United Nations. Indicating that 700 lives were lost in Gorazde because of the lack of this determination, Cetin said that he had expressed this view at the UN Security Council. Cetin said: [Begin Cetin recording] I have once more expressed that Turkey expects more determination from the United Nations. I also clearly stated that it is necessary to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia-Herzegovina if NATO decisions are ineffective and the Bosnians given the right to self-defense. [end recording] Cetin also stated that, while in New York, he held a meeting with the U.S. representative to the United Nations on the Turkey-Iraq oil pipeline. Cetin said that he explained to the U.S. representative that Turkey is not after an implementation which ignores the UN embargo. Pointing out that Turkey's direct and indirect losses from this issue amounted to $20 billion, Cetin said that, notwithstanding, Turkey abides by the UN resolutions. Explaining that new and greater losses may incur from the inactive pipeline, Cetin said Turkey's aim is an initiative to use the pipeline within the framework of UN resolutions. Stating his views on the Cyprus issue, Cetin said that Turkey is not under pressure from any country and added that Turkey more than anybody wants a solution to the Cyprus issue. Stating that this solution should be a realistic and a just solution which will not take Cyprus back to pre-1974 conditions, Cetin stressed that a solution can be achieved only if the leaders of the two communities reach an agreement. Stating that reopening the Iraq-Turkey pipeline should not be confused with finding a solution to the Cyprus issue, Cetin said these two issues are separate and should be regarded as developments independent of each other.
