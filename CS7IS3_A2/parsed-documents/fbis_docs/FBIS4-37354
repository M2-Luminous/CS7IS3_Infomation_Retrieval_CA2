[Sha'th] Actually, there were two reasons. First, I had to return to Gaza to handle some issues, which would have made my trip to Jerusalem very short and I like to have enough time to see Jerusalem. Also I must add that the mere announcement of my trip to Jerusalem caused an enormous uproar in Israeli rightist circles and maybe in some Israeli Government circles. I was told that there were threats and there would be disturbances if I went to Jerusalem and that this would require my protection by 1,000 Israeli policemen. I do not want to go to Jerusalem under the protection of Israeli policemen and this was another reason for postponing my visit to a later date. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] You had talks in Jericho yesterday with members of the Palestinian side. What happened in these talks? [Sha'th] In fact, Jericho City differs from Gaza and this should be noted clearly. In Gaza, the Israeli forces left the greater part of the Gaza Strip, which is populated by one million people who never see an Israeli and are not subjected to any friction with the Israeli authorities. Gaza is rife with security and peace. As for Jericho, the Israeli authorities are almost besieging the city and a number of roadblocks delay movement between the two parts of Jericho--Jericho and Nizzana. I spent a whole hour forcing the Israeli roadblock to open to let me pass along the main road between Jericho and Nizzana. I traveled by road to Allenby Bridge to be sure myself of what I had been told. Indeed, I became certain that the Israeli authorities prevent trucks and tourist buses from entering Jericho. This means that 1,200 tourists are barred from Jericho every day, which actually means an economic catastrophe for this small city. When they set up roadblocks between Jericho and Nizzana, they bar agricultural goods from entering the market, which also means catastrophe. The situation in Jericho is very worrying, because the Israeli authorities there are not implementing the agreement we had signed and are implementing it only in Gaza. The aim of my trip to Jericho was to acquaint myself first hand with these problems and to forward my demands to the Israeli leadership and say that things cannot go on like this in Jericho. I also spent the night with the liberated brothers whom the Israeli forces kept in Jericho City wrongly and in violation of the agreement. I visited all places to learn first hand how we can avert these problems so that Jericho can enjoy the same freedom, dignity, and security which Gaza enjoys. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] I have in front of me a statement in which you accuse Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin of committing flagrant violations of the peace accord that he signed with the PLO. How true is this statement? [Sha'th] Yes, the statement is true and I said that they prevented me from going to Allenby Bridge and Nizzana City which is an inseparable part of the Jericho area. I experienced these violations first-hand. The agreement does not give them the right to set up any roadblocks between Jericho and Nizzana or between Jericho and Allenby Bridge. It does not give them the right to besiege Jericho and prevent the entry of vegetables or tourists to the city, nor the right to an economic (?blockade) and strangulation of the city. There are also other violations; they are behind in the issue of the prisoners, which I have mentioned. They should have released 5,000 by now and there are still about 1,000 who have not been released. They have withdrawn on time and the Palestinian police forces also entered on time but there are other violations that have to be stopped immediately if we want the peace process to advance and succeed. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] What about Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's return to the Palestinian territories? [Sha'th] There are many considerations governing this and we hope he will be among us soon. But frankly, after visiting Jericho, I join those who advocate the postponement of his arrival until these problems have been resolved. I cannot imagine President 'Arafat facing what I saw with my own eyes in Jericho today. Of course, 'Arafat's trip will not be limited to Gaza and he is bound to go to Jericho. We have to solve these problems, face these Israeli violations, and tell the Israelis that they should rectify the situation. The entire world and the Israelis themselves must see that the situation has been corrected if they want this process to be a success. Once we resolve these problems, I believe that the arrival of brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] will be desirable from all aspects.
