DP leader Zach de Beer said at the IEC's [Independent Electoral Commission] headquarters at Gallagher's Estate that the results were much worse than expected. He attributed his party's poor performance to National Party [NP] propaganda which had called on the electorate to vote for the NP to prevent domination by the ANC-communist party alliance. He said the DP was not considering merging with another party because there were no other attractive prospects. The DP would continue to play an important role as watchdog over human rights and democracy.
