The headquarters will include members of the Federal Interior Ministry, the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service, the Federal Prosecutor's Office and the Federal Committee for Emergencies, as well as Moscow officials. As is known, terrorists from the Vozmezdie (Retribution) group have demanded that the Yakutsk authorites hand over to them US$500,000 and 500 million rubles at Yakutsk Airport on February 4. The terrorists threaten to explode the city's life supporting installations if their demand is not met. Experts of the Russian Interior Ministry believe that the threat of the explosion is no more than a bluff since the criminals need only money. Moreover, competent bodies together with army specialists are carrying out operational measures to locate and defuse any possible explosive devices. The Trans-Baikal regional centre of the Federal Ministry for Emergencies has been put on red alert. Rescue teams are on board an aircraft at a Moscow airport, ready to take off for Yakutsk any time.
