SVT leader and outgoing Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka told a political rally here Monday he would not entertain a coalition with an Indian political party if his party won the general election. Rabuka blamed a "bad experience" with the Indian-dominated Fiji Labour Party (FLP) after the 1992 general election, when it supported his candidacy for the prime ministership. Rabuka said FLP leader Mahendra Chaudhry had made uncompromising demands on the SVT which he later could not honour. These included the review of what Chaudry described as the "racist 1990 Constitution" which gave indigenous Fijians a parliamentary majority of 37 seats in a 70-seat House of Rpresentatives and the abolition of a value added tax (VAT). National Federation Party (NFP) leader Jai Ram Reddy responded sharply Tuesday saying it was Rabuka who had talked about coalition with the NFP in the past. Reddy, who was leader of the opposition in the last House of Representatives, had supported Rabuka's plan for a government of national unity announced in November 1992. A committee of which Reddy was a member sat on several occasions to look into the issue but nothing eventuated. In his response Tuesday, Reddy said in a statement that his party's priority was "to secure as many Indian seats as possible and to press for the review of the 1990 Constitution through dialogue with the Fijian leaders." Reddy said he had repeatedly warned since 1992 of the dangers of becoming locked under the present constitution into a coalition which he said could become "embarrassing if no progress was made on the review (of the constitution) satisfactory to the party." It was therefore academic for Rabuka to rule out a coalition with the NFP, Reddy said. "The NFP has no intention of repeating the mistake that the Fiji Labour Party made in 1992," he added.
