Referring to the investigation, the PGR said autopsies and ballistic tests were performed yesterday with 30 corpses found in Ocosingo, Chiapas. The PGR reported 26 of these corpses showed no signs of having received a coup de grace shot. The studies and experts' reports on the four other corpses, which showed a shot in the skull, revealed they had died on different days and at different hours and showed that the shots were fired from a short distance. It also reports that two corpses sustained shots with calibers that are smaller than those reserved for or used by the Armed Forces. A third corpse sustained injuries caused by a very powerful weapon, and a fourth corpse sustained shots fired by a shotgun, given the metal shrapnel wounds it had, the PGR said. The PGR also said that in three of the cases the reports rule out the possibility the shots were fired by a member of the Mexican Army, because it does not use the type of weapon used to inflict them. Referring to the shot fired by a very powerful weapon, no one has been able to ascertain from which side it came, because the armed and violent group has been using that type of weaponry, the PGR said.
