Chu, Korean agent of the French arms dealer, is believed to be either in the United States or Northeast Asia. He fled the country Dec. 15. The military prosecution is seeking to catch Fuan in a way that minimizes international diplomatic friction, and will consult with the Foreign Ministry and maintain close ties with law-enforcement agencies in countries such as France. The military prosecution freed an Army colonel and Navy captain in charge of overseas procurement at the Defense Logistics Agency on Saturday, suspending the charges against them. The duo are Col. Yun Sam-song, head of the agency's overseas procurement office, and Capt. To Chong-il, a division chief in Yun's office. The two officers and a Defense Ministry civilian, who was also released, will be referred to a disciplinary panel, a Ministry source said. The Ministry said Friday [7 January] the probe had revealed that the 6.7 million-U.S.-dollar shell fraud was the product of a conspiracy between Fuan and Chu.
