Production Democracy's Hopes and Disappointments"] [Text] Tula--Vladimir Dronov and Yuriy Tarasov came to be plant top managers through the same scenario--elections. At the end of the 1980's, in the fashion of the times, the combine plant was electing a director. Yu. Tarasov, who by then was already the plant's acting general director, lost the election. The job went to V. Dronov, deputy director of a neighboring plant--an outsider, so to say. Tarasov, however, survived the blow and a year later had his revanche at the Tula Railroad Machinery Plant, coming in ahead of seven contenders there. Apparently, new ideas sound more convincing coming from a new person. Or perhaps it is true that no man is a prophet in his own land. Now the era of production romanticism is becoming a thing of the past. Euphoria is being replaced by the rational, and emotions--by calculations. At recent stockholders meetings of the Tula Armory Plant [TOZ], for instance, the delegates expressed no-confidence in outsiders and rather unanimously voted for the old director, N. Maslennikov. True, the results of the meeting are currently being challenged. Opponents contend that the law was violated. But this no longer incites previous passions. Commenting on these disputes, a local newspaper offers the conclusion that "the idea of elected management has exhausted itself. We have left this stage behind. And democracy does not apply here." The paper also speaks rather skeptically of privatization, comparing it with collectivization. As to the stockholders meeting, it goes so far as to call it "a wake for the old TOZ." "Now it is a joint-stock company, which is doled out puny crumbs from the budget, and the collective must look for a way out on its own." Does this mean that the longed-for economic independence has lost value in the eyes of the people and even has become a cause for condolences? Ruble Equivalent of Freedom Generally speaking, the sad fate of a collective which "has to look for a way out on its own" does not evoke particular sympathy in the hardened hearts of the public. Therefore a trump card in the arguments against privatization is that it allegedly impoverishes the state, depriving it of its riches, the treasury--of revenue, and the people--of social protection. This argument seemingly even is supported by the economic situation. The year 1994 began with delays in payments to budget-financed organizations. But is privatization the culprit? In Yu. Tarasov's opinion the reverse is true. "When I came to Zheldormash [railroad machinery plant], the plant was nothing but a burden for the state, producing 11 million rubles [R] of output and not contributing a kopek to the treasury. Because there was only one type of tax then--profit tax. At the same time, it received R1 million a year from the treasury in the form of subsidies. Since converting to joint-stock holding we have not received a kopek from the budget, while we paid more than R1.5 billion last year alone in the form of taxes. So I ask: Which is better for the state?" It was exactly privatization, in Yu. Tarasov's opinion, that provided the plant with an incentive to modernize production. The Zheldormash put into production new track-repair machines, which the railroad industry has "accepted" and gladly buys, and opened a new furniture production facility, creating 300 new jobs in the process. A considerable part of the profit goes into expansion of production. In the environment of general decline, Zheldormash increased its output by 20 percent. It managed to allocate some money for social needs as well: It built a 144-apartment house, purchased two buildings in a recreation facility on the Oka River, and built a heated stadium and soccer field. Of course, the insolvency crisis is affecting Zheldormash, too, but not to such an extent as, for instance, the combine plant. The Dead Grab the Living The 12,000-employee Tula Combine Plant [TKZ] was officially considered a flagship of national agricultural machine-building. Although strictly speaking it built not combines but headers. Combines were made at Rostselmash [Rostov Agricultural Machinery Plant], while the Tula flagship supplied header components for it. At the beginning of the 1980's the TKZ, following Rostov's footsteps, began modernization, which cost (according to official data) R414 million (today the same figure would be expressed in billions). Tula was supposed to put into production headers for Don combines--90,000 units a year. The plant was declared an all-Union shock-labor Komsomol [All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League] construction project. Eyewitnesses maintain that the entire oblast construction complex worked on the TKZ modernization project. Equipment was brought mostly from Japan and Germany, and additional workers from Ashkhabad ((Ashgabat)) and Tashkent. Venerable elders were brought in by plane from far and near mountain villages. As the project neared completion, however, it came out that an error had found its way into the calculations of the modernization project's authors: The battle for the harvest did not need 90,000 headers--16,000 would be enough. After modernization--which, by the way, was never completed--the plant was left with R45 million worth of unneeded Western equipment and special-use equipment for the production of wide-cut headers that cannot be modified. "Good-bye to people's money invested in modernization," the transformation plant newspaper KOMBAYNOSTROITEL in the beginning of 1990 summed up dejectedly. The discovery was unsettling. New times were already knocking on the door, while the plant was firmly positioned to become a drain on the treasury. And since the treasury was getting increasingly emptier day by day, the plant, according to its newspaper, "kept beating on the door of its ministry begging for another handout." Correctly appraising the situation, Dronov promised the collective "to rid ourselves of the demeaning role of Rostselmash appendage," to retrofit the plant for the production of profitable and prestigious goods, and gain economic independence. This earned him victory at the elections. Some consider it a Pyhrric victory, though. Dronov did break out of Rostselmash's grip. Instead of harvesters, the plant is producing hitch-on combines, woodworking benches, electric motors, carts, and other apparently needed goods which were expected to ensure profits and hence economic independence. So far, however, the expected profit--and independence with it--has proven elusive. The products are not selling well. Some because of the low purchasing capacity of agricultural consumers; others are not competitive; still others are not produced in enough quantity to generate real income. As a result, the plant today owes banks more than R7 billion, which is, in expert estimates, equal to almost 70 percent of the value of its property. Workers have not been paid for four months; the budget does not get any tax revenue. Unpaid liability amounts to R730 million. "In the current economic situation," admits Dronov, "we cannot do without credits." He means, of course, preferential credits, which strictly speaking are budget subsidies. At the end of last year the situation at the combine plant was discussed in the government. Dronov was promised R5 billion, which he never got. "It is a paradox," said one of Dronov's colleagues commenting on the latter's request. "In the past everybody dreamed of economic independence; now they demand help from the state. But if you are independent, what right do you have to ask for it? The price of freedom is business activities, a new financial strategy, and perhaps even deprivation." Does History Repeat Itself? The first stockholders meeting at the combine plant is scheduled for May. Dronov is facing elections again. Except that now the decisive vote will come mainly from buyers, not stockholders. This is the substance of true economic democracy. Voting by their hard-earned rubles, consumers have no mercy on failing producers. And the task of the meeting's participants is to register and carry out their will.
