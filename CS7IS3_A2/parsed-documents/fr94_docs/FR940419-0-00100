(These are not toll-free numbers.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement The information collection requirements for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget, under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3520), and assigned OMB control number 2501&hyph;0013. This interim rule does not contain additional information collection requirements. II. Background The HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) was enacted under title II (42 U.S.C. 12701&hyph;12839) of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;625, approved November 28, 1990). On March 19, 1991, the Department published a proposed rule (56 FR 11592) to implement the HOME Program. The Department received 119 public comments in response to the proposed rule. After reviewing and considering these comments, HUD published an interim rule on December 16, 1991 (56 FR 65313), inviting additional comments on the program. The Department received 118 public comments on the interim rule. In partial response to these comments and HUD's experience in implementing the program, an interim rule to make necessary changes on an expedited basis to the December 16, 1991 interim rule was developed. In addition, the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (HCDA 1992) (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992) included a substantial number of amendments to the HOME program. Some of the HCDA 1992 amendments that were determined to be immediately effective were included in the ``necessary changes'' interim rule, which was published on December 22, 1992 (57 FR 60960). The remaining HCDA 1992 amendments determined to be immediately effective were published in an interim rule on June 23, 1993 (58 FR 34130). Other HCDA 1992 changes were determined to require the publication of a proposed rule with an opportunity for public notice and comment before they could be implemented. A proposed rule for this purpose was published on April 29, 1993 (58 FR 26048). The Department received 21 comments in response to the proposed rule. Twelve were from state agencies; four were from local agencies; and five comments were from associations. This rule implements the April 29, 1993 proposed rule as an interim rule. This rule is being published as an interim rule and not as a final rule because the HOME program regulation at 24 CFR part 92 has not yet been issued as a final rule.
