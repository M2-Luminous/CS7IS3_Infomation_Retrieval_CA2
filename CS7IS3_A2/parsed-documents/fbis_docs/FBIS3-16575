Finding itself in a grave situation, the government has found a way out in confiscating currency funds from economic players. On 5 March, the Belarusian Council of Ministers issued a decree "on emergency measures for the Republic to reduce debts to the Russian Federation for gas and other energy carriers." In accordance with this document, 20 percent of funds in freely convertible currency and Russian rubles are being deducted from the accounts of all enterprises. It is characteristic that the accounts of Belarusian economic players in both republican and foreign banks are being cleaned out. This action is reticently referred to in the decree as "hiring for a period of three months under government guarantee." But those were only the first flowers. On 11 March, the government published an addition to this decree. Now all enterprises, including joint ventures, must hand over their March profit in freely convertible currency and Russian rubles to state currency funds. The Council of Minister kindly promises to compensate for losses in Belarusian rubles at the Republic's national bank's exchange rate of 2 February 1944. The comrades from the government were obviously modest in selecting that date. Why not set 7 November 1917 as the starting point (or rather reckoning point)? The arbitrary cessation of trading at the interbank currency exchange until 1 April was the logical continuation of the Council of Ministers' actions. Now, determining the exchange rate for foreign currencies against the Belarusian ruble is the exclusive prerogative of the Republic's national bank. Although the government's actions are invested with outwardly legal forms, this alters nothing. Essentially, it is a case of the nationalization of a substantial proportion of the funds belonging to commercial structures. It is not difficult to predict where this will lead. "We are almost guaranteed a couple of suicides," Mikhail Shevelzon, vice president of the Belarus union of entrepreneurs, believes. "People will simply be unable to settle their debts. If the state cannot pay its debts, a specific businessmen is obliged to be answerable in any situation. In addition, according to my calculations, about 70 percent of Belarusian enterprises' capital is already working outside the republic. As a result of the government's actions, this figure will obviously grow. The situation that has taken shape will also undoubtedly affect foreign investments." Naturally, the Belarusian Government does not want to demonstrate so graphically to Russia, with whom it actually intends to unite, but the Minsk bureaucrats obviously do not understand that in our case the exchange is only a reflection of several other processes. In particular, according to the figures of the BELORUSSKAYA DELOVAYA GAZETA, 2.3 trillion rubles in unsupported credits were earmarked in January-February to subsidize agricultural enterprises, to cover the budget deficit, and for some other purposes, which is nearly twice last year's emission. Now, agrarian experts are demanding a further 6 trillion. But the government seems to believe that unification will write off everything and the Belarusian bureaucrats will yet again be able to enter paradise on the Russians' backs. Over the weekend the cash dollar exchange rate rose from 8,500 to 11,000 Belarusian rubles. Comment is superfluous. Meanwhile, it emerged that the World Bank credit intended to support the Belarusian ruble exchange rate had been given out by the government to pay directly for energy carriers. This was announced by Stanislav Bogdankevich at a conference of the National Bank leadership and chairman of the boards of commercial banks. This fact will hardly give rise to a positive response among international financial circles. The Belarusian Government is deceiving not only Western bankers, but also its own fellow citizens. In February, from the platform of the Supreme Soviet Vyacheslav Kebich swore that there would be no increase in prices for basic foodstuffs before the unification of the monetary systems. But on Saturday a loaf of bread was sold in stores for 300 rubles instead of Friday's price of 120 rubles. To avoid undesirable consequences, the government announced in advance that as of 1 April (we will have a good laugh then) the minimum wage will be raised from 30,000 to 60,000 rubles. In this case, it is appropriate to ask: Where is the money coming from? Are we going on a spree at Russia's expense again? What is happening today is only the start of the collapse. The Belarusian noose has been coiling long enough, but the finale has nonetheless arrived. A natural finale. So far, it is unclear how exactly the union of entrepreneurs will react to the Council of Ministers' March decrees. Perhaps it will adopt a tough stance, but it will hardly be able to influence the government. On the other hand, the businessmen themselves have already drawn the necessary conclusions. A leader of a large commercial structure who wishes to remain anonymous ("I may still have to work in this country") told an IZVESTIYA correspondent: "No one intends to feed this government. Any normal economic player will stop showing his currency profit. This is robbery. The nomenklatura undertook this step out of despair: The incompetents from the ranks of former party members are simply incapable of anything else. Now they have one commodity left that they can sell -- sovereignty -- and the status of a province in the Russian empire suits them very well." The government has made its move, but what next? Let us allow that it succeeds at least partly in extinguishing the debt for energy carriers. But given the present state of the Belarusian economy, in a couple of months everything will be the way it was before, and then what? I very much doubt that entrepreneurs will give the Council of Ministers the opportunity to rob them again. Alas, it looks as though the principle "if we can last the day we can hold out for the night" is prevailing in Kebich's cabinet. As before, the desired unification of monetary systems is looming. But even if this dubious measure does take place, will the prime minister's team survive until then? It is no accident that the currency exchange auctions have been repealed. Their cessation was preceded by a scandal at the last auctions, which was held 10 March. Some 40 minutes before they started, representatives of the National Bank, citing a letter from the bank's chairman, Stnbislav Bogdankevich, demanded that currency purchasers supply copies of the contracts for purchasing goods abroad. No one had heard a word beforehand about the chief banker's message and so entirely naturally no one had the documents. After lengthy disputes, the auction began, but after the dollar exchange rate had risen from 9,120 to 12,200 Belarusian rubles the results of the auction were simply revoked. To avoid such undesirable figures in future, the auctions were simply canceled. For three weeks for the time being but it is by no means certain the exchange will resume work 1 April.
