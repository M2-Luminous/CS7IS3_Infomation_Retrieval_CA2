It took the GKN group over one and a half months of fighting on the stock exchange to win its takeover bid for the Westland helicopter manufacturer. It had to raise its offer to about 5 billion French francs [Fr] before the last institutional shareholders would agree to sell their shares so that GKN would own 54.4 percent of the Westland stock. Westland's Fr3.8 billion of aeronautical activities will therefore be consolidated with GKN's activities, forming a diversified group worth a little over Fr25 billion in sales, including Fr3.6 billion in the defense sector. At present, the GKN group, which achieved sales of Fr21.3 billion in 1993, is not very active (5 percent) in the defense field. This small activity involves light armored vehicles of the Warrior family (700 units manufactured so far), and Saxon wheeled vehicles (146 units manufactured). Its main activities, however, lie in the field of mechanical automotive equipment (53 percent), agricultural equipment (18 percent), industrial services (15 percent), and distribution (9 percent). GKN's interest in the helicopter manufacturer dates back to 1988, when it took over 22 percent of the capital held by Fiat and Hanson, during the "Westland affair." This also gave it a chance to appoint two directors on the Westland board. Early this year, United Technologies, the parent company of Sikorsky, sold its 18.7-percent interest, so that GKN then owned 47 percent of the stock. The group then launched its takeover bid, which was said to be hostile because Alan Jones, the Westland chief executive officer, wanted above all to retain his group's independence. Actually, after the events of 1988, the Yeovil helicopter manufacturer recovered quite well. It drastically reduced its costs (at the cost of 2,000 layoffs) and doubled its backlog of orders (to Fr12 billion). In 1993, its profits increased by 60 percent (Fr260 million), with sales of Fr3.8 billion, thanks in particular to sales of spare parts for its base of 1,000 machines in operation. It even achieved a small feat, achieving sales of Fr2.5 billion on the helicopter market (with a Fr250 million profit) while delivering only four units! As for its prospects, they rest essentially on the EH-101 transport helicopter, which it will start delivering in 1996 and for which the potential market is estimated at 750 units; and on the Apache combat helicopter that Westland will manufacture under license if it is chosen by the government. With Westland among its assets, the GKN group will strengthen its defense pole and constitute a consistent line of military products well placed on the post-cold war markets: rapid action relying on high-speed (air and land) vehicles. Moreover, this acquisition should enable the new group to obtain some tax benefits, and to have a better debt-equity ratio and a complete line to offer during industrial compensation negotiations.
