The majority of the loans from the World Bank went to powering the province's economic growth in sectors including agriculture, industry, transport, energy and education. The province now has over 20 such projects funded by the World Bank, which have been completed or are under construction. Of more than one billion yuan of the total investment the province put into water control projects, over 100 million U.S. dollars -- or 870 million yuan worth -- came from the World Bank. So far, a group of water conservation projects has gone into operation and brought about good economic returns for the local people. Construction of another giant irrigation project backed by the World Bank is also well on its way. When completed in 1996, it will benefit nearly four cities and 24 counties in the province, with an increase in grain output estimated at one million tons yearly. In an effort to use the waste land and waters along the coastline, several aquatic breeding zones with high production of shrimp and prawns have been built with loans from the World Bank. To support the nationwide "spark plan" launched in 1991, the province used 65 million U.S. dollars in loans to bolster the technological development of its township enterprises, collectively- owned firms and other economic group companies. To date, 47 projects in this sector have been authorized by the World Bank, an increase in annual output value expected to reach 2.5 billion yuan. The World Bank also financed the construction of the province's infrastructural projects. A highway expansion project leading from the provincial capital Nanjing to Shanghai opened to traffic ahead of schedule thanks to timely funds provided by the World Bank. To ease the transport "bottleneck", loans from the World Bank were also used to tackle the "Grand Canal" in southern Jiangsu to make it more navigable. Several bridges and ship lock projects have already been completed and put into use.
