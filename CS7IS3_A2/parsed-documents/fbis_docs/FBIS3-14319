It is true that there should be no double standards in Lebanon, that all people are equal before the law, and that no one is above the law. We are being true to ourselves when we maintain that we support all the security measures taken by the Lebanese authorities to pursue the suspicious role played by the Lebanese Forces, primarily Ghidras [headquarters of Lebanese Forces Commander Samir Ja'ja']. The government is not only doing the right thing but is also dutybound to use its legal powers to arrest suspects, fugitives, and defendants in operations against state security. It is true that the Lebanese Forces' information media unscrupulously threaten the homeland's unity, fan the fire, and castigate the state and its institutions. These media fail to blame the Zionist enemy, who strikes at the homeland, its unity, and its Christians and Muslims. As a matter of fact, when the media fails to adopt a responsible position they become irresponsible and, consequently, the government is not to blame for the way it deals with them. Despite their dangerous role against Lebanon and its unity, no one has tried to harm these media organs. We support the security measures that the Lebanese legal authorities have taken to preserve security. The government is right when it says that security must cover all Lebanese territory. Therefore, we speak the truth and mean it when we denounce the military parade staged by the Hizballah in Ba'labakk to mark the Jerusalem Day anniversary. We are against this encroachment on the state's rights in Ba'labakk, which recurs every month in a desperate attempt to restore the atmosphere of the civil war, which all Lebanese reject. All the Lebanese people reject the civil war and those who seek to remind them of this war and even try to endear its destruction to certain people within their own ranks. We are against this unilateral act that Hizballah performs in one Lebanese area after another in an attempt to show that it is above the law. We are against Hizballah's attempts to create a rift between the people and the state in certain areas, to challenge the state's prestige, and to drive out or subjugate its establishments. We are against the timing that Hizballah chose to challenge the state, first when it insisted on staging the military parade in the streets of Ba'labakk at a time when Lebanese security forces were doing their duty in chasing and hunting down fugitives and wanted criminals on charges of bombings and encroachment on the state establishments. It is unreasonable to see Lebanese security forces doing their sacred national duty of protecting the homeland and citizens' security in one area of Lebanon while those in another area have to relinquish that same duty and are forced to leave their positions because a military force is organizing a military parade. Since it is only natural for the security forces to arrest those who carry unlicensed arms and threaten security in Ghidras, it is unreasonable for groups to take to the streets in Ba'labakk by the hundreds and perhaps by the thousands, flouting the state's prestige, threatening national security and citizens, defying the people's feelings, provoking the formula of coexistence, and arousing hateful feelings that were buried once and for all with the end of the civil war and the advent of social peace. As we support the security forces in hunting down fugitive criminals -- who challenged the state's institutions, laws, and organs -- and call for rewarding the security men who performed their duty while aware of the dangers confronting them, we also call for punishing those who relinquished their official posts in the security departments in Ba'labakk and agreed to be spectators of the military parade. Those who staged the military parade in Ba'labakk sought to negate any state presence in the city. Yes, we will bear in mind the actions of Hizballah and others against the state and its military, political, informational, educational, and cultural establishments. Yes, we will not ignore its plan to bring down the government in favor of chaos where its logic might prevail so that it may control the homeland for reasons that have nothing to do with patriotism or Islam. We view the parade in Ba'labakk as part of this destructive plan under the banner of religion, Jerusalem, struggle, and a march. We believe that Hizballah's timing gave the residents of Ghidras the opportunity to say something true for unholy purposes. We tell the truth for the sake of the truth and for selfless goals when we maintain that Hizballah is in harmony with the Lebanese Forces in its constant endeavor to remain outside the state. Both have a common interest in antagonizing the state. Perhaps every move either party makes against the state is used to serve the interests of the other party. Both parties have become two sides of the same coin, generating chaos and serving the interests of others at the expense of Lebanon, namely, the state and its establishments. We do not believe that the state is worthy of survival if it fails to abide by its own logic that was manifest in two cases: First when it did its duty in Ghidras and, second, when it hunted down those who challenged the state in Ba'labakk. This is the truth told for the sake of truth.
