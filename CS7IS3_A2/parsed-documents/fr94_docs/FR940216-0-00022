FR940216-0-00022 FR940216-0-00008 The Council met on December 6&hyph;10, 1993, to review the best available scientific information concerning groundfish stocks, and to consider public testimony regarding 1994 groundfish fisheries. Scientific information is contained in the November 1993 SAFE report for the GOA. The November 1993 SAFE report was prepared and presented by the GOA Plan Team to the Council and the Council's Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC) and Advisory Panel (AP) and includes the most recent information concerning the following: (a) For pollock: Data from the 1993 spring hydroacoustic survey in Shelikof Strait conducted by the Alaska Fisheries Science Center; egg production estimates of spawning biomass; estimates of catch-at-age from the 1992 fishery; updated estimates of catch; length-frequency data from the 1993 hydroacoustic survey and the first quarter of the 1993 fishery; (b) For sablefish: Data from the 1993 Cooperative and Domestic Longline Surveys; (c) For Pacific cod: Size composition data from the NMFS longline surveys of the GOA were updated through 1993; (e) For flatfish: Ageing information for rex sole allowed computation of F 30 % and F 35 % values; and (f) For groundfish, generally: Harvest and discard data from the NMFS Observer Program Office for 1993. The Plan Team recommended that, starting in 1994, rex sole be removed from the deep-water flatfish category and be managed as a separate target species category to provide flexibility in managing rockfish bycatch. For establishment of the acceptable biological catches (ABC) and TACs, the Council considered information in the SAFE report, recommendations from its SSC and AP, as well as public testimony. The SSC adopted the ABC recommendations from the Plan Team, which were provided in the SAFE report, for all of the target species categories, except that for Pacific ocean perch (POP). The Council adopted the SSC ABC recommendations for each target species category, except for POP. The Council's recommended ABCs, listed in Table 1, reflect harvest amounts that are less than the specified overfishing amounts (Table 1). The SSC calculated the POP ABC by applying a fishing mortality rate of F=0.08 that would reduce the spawning biomass per recruit ratio to 44 percent of its pristine level and further reducing F to 0.04 based on the ratio of current female spawner biomass to the optimal level. This rate was then applied to the 1994 exploitable biomass of 101,800 mt. The Plan Team reduced this value further by the ratio of F 35% /F 30% , resulting in an ABC recommendation of 3,030 mt, to ensure that the ABC was less than the overfishing level of 3,940 mt. The SSC considered this adjustment inappropriate, stating that it arbitrarily foregoes catch without providing biological justification. The SSC recommended that the ABC for POP be set at 3,943 mt. However, the Council adopted the recommendation of the Plan Team and set the ABC for POP at 3,030 mt. The Plan Team's ABC of 3,030 mt better conforms to the policy objectives of the POP rebuilding plan established under Amendment 32 to the FMP, adopted by the Council in September 1993 and submitted for Secretarial review on December 18, 1993. 1. Specifications of TAC and Apportionments Thereof Among DAP, JVP, TALFF, and Reserves The Council recommended TACs equal to ABCs for pollock, Pacific cod, sablefish, shortraker/rougheye rockfish, pelagic shelf rockfish, demersal shelf rockfish, thornyhead rockfish, and northern rockfish. The recommended TACs for Pacific cod, sablefish, shortraker/rougheye, thornyhead rockfish and northern rockfish are at levels that will support bycatch needs in other fisheries. Other TACs are set at levels that are fully utilized in the directed fisheries. The Council recommended TACs less than the ABC for shallow-water and deep-water flatfish, POP, other slope rockfish, Atka mackerel, rex sole, flathead sole, and arrowtooth flounder (Table 1). The sum of the TACs approved by the Council for all GOA groundfish is 304,595 mt, which is within the OY range specified by the FMP. The sum of the TACs is lower than the 1993 TAC sum of 306,651 mt. The sum of 1994 ABCs for all groundfish is 553,050 mt, which is lower than the 1993 ABC total of 732,868 mt. For pollock, in September 1993, the Council adopted a preliminary ABC of 78,000 mt for the Western/Central Regulatory Areas. However, at the September Plan Team meeting, the Plan Team requested that four additional exploitation strategies be explored. Based on the results of these new analyses, which were presented at the November 1993 Plan Team meeting, an ABC of 102,000 mt was recommended for the Western/Central Areas. The Plan Team recommendation represents the fishing mortality strategy that was associated with a 95 percent chance of maintaining the spawner biomass level above the threshold level (F=0.20). The Plan Team chose this fishing strategy because of recent trends in poor recruitment of GOA pollock and because of ecosystem concerns. The Council concurred with the conservative exploitation strategy and recommended a TAC and an ABC of 102,000 mt for pollock for the Western/Central GOA for 1994. The TACs for shallow-water (Western GOA) and deep-water (Central GOA) flatfish and rex sole (Central GOA) were set at 4,500 mt, 7,500 mt and 7,500 mt, respectively. These amounts reflect recent harvest levels and will limit the halibut bycatch associated with these fisheries. The TACs for flathead sole and arrowtooth flounder were set at 10,000 mt and 30,000 mt, respectively, also to limit halibut bycatch. As discussed above, consistent with the Council's previously adopted rebuilding policy for POP, a conservative exploitation rate was recommended. The recommended 1994 TAC of 2,550 mt was based on a rate intermediate between the optimal fishing rate and the rate required to provide unavoidable bycatch. The POP ABC of 3,030 mt, recommended by the Council, provides a buffer between the TAC (2,550 mt) and the overfishing level (3,940 mt). The Council also recommended that the overfishing level for POP be apportioned by regulatory area. The Council adopted the AP's recommended ``other rockfish'' TACs for each regulatory area as follows: 199 mt for the Western Regulatory Area; 988 mt for the Central Regulatory Area; and 3,813 mt for the Eastern Regulatory Area. The Council was concerned that the directed fishery for ``other rockfish'' in the Eastern Regulatory Area could result in high bycatches of other target species categories. The Council was particularly concerned that high bycatches of demersal shelf rockfish (DSR) in the Southeast Outside District of the Eastern Regulatory Area could occur. In 1993, a trawl vessel operator caught substantial amounts of DSR in this district as bycatch while conducting a directed fishery for ``other rockfish.'' As a result, the DSR TAC was reached prematurely and resulted in economic losses to Southeast Alaska fishermen who otherwise depend on DSR for a certain amount of their annual income. Therefore, the Council recommended that the TAC for ``other rockfish'' be set at an amount that would only support bycatch needs in other directed fisheries. NMFS has determined that a TAC of 1,048 mt for the Eastern Regulatory Area would support bycatch needs in other directed fisheries. This amount was derived using the amount of ``other rockfish'' bycatch caught by vessels participating in the 1993 pelagic shelf rockfish directed fishery.
