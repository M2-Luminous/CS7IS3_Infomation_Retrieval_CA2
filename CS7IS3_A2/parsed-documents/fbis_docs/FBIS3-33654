The PFLP and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP], as well as other factions, moved their headquarters from Beirut to Damascus after the Palestinian resistance evacuated Beirut in September 1982, while Fatah and other factions moved from Beirut to Tunis. Following his return from Baghdad a few days ago, PFLP Political Bureau member 'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh told AL-RA'Y that the PFLP delegation's visit to Baghdad had nothing to do with this subject, and said the PFLP's main office is still in Damascus. Malluh denied that the opposition factions, including the PFLP, are facing harassment by the Syrian leadership. He described the press reports published by London newspapers on moving the PFLP headquarters from Damascus to Baghdad as completely untrue, and said the front has the right to be present in the Arab states bordering Palestine. He said that cooperation and coordination between the Palestinian opposition forces and the Syrian leadership continue, based on their position which calls for full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian and Arab territories, and their joint position on the dangers of self-rule because it is unfair to the Palestinian national rights. Meanwhile, a DFLP official said he expects a DFLP delegation to visit the Iraqi capital within 10 days. DFLP Political Bureau member Saji Salamah denied any intention to move the front's headquarters from Damascus to Baghdad, and emphasized that the DFLP delegation's visit to Baghdad had been decided a long time ago. The visits by the PFLP and DFLP delegations to Baghdad are the first since the Syrian-U.S. summit in Geneva. Fatah and other factions have announced that they will move their headquarters to the self-rule region after Israel's withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, expected to be completed next April.
