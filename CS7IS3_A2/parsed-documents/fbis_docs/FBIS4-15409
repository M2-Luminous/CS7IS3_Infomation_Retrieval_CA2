Zaveryukha said Russia's current stocks of soft grain will last until the new harvest, those of fodder for 1.5 years and those of rice and other cereals for two years. In 1993, Russia concluded contracts on the purchase of 16 Mn tons of grain, while its imports totalled only 11 Mn tons the same year. In 1992, Russia's grain purchases amounted to 26 Mn tons. At the same time, Zaveryukha called for stricter control over the use of stocks of grain and other food staples. In his opinion, this is a task for a nation-wide network developed by the World Bank, Russian Agriculture and Food Ministry and the Finance Ministry which would store information about the current state of the stocks, prices of the products and other data.
