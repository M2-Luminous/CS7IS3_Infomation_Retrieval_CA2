Will your commission make a statement about this at the next session of Parliament? [Natadze] The views of our commission have indeed been ignored during the process of negotiations concerning the Abkhazian conflict. As we are unable to participate in the work of the Georgian delegation, it is natural that we will not be able to have any influence on the results of the negotiations. As regards making a statement in Parliament, the commission has specific plans but a statement will be made not on behalf of the commission but by ordinary parliamentarians. [Kurdovanidze] Batono Nodar, your attitude to this document is well known. Could you comment briefly? [Natadze] Our defeat in Abkhazia is possibly a double defeat: first de facto, second de jure. De facto, everything that could have been lost has already been lost except for the upper part of the Dali gorge. We gain nothing from a cease-fire; only in the Kodori gorge can there be a temporary cease-fire. Yet, this will also not be a victory because signing the treaty will not prevent the opposing side from engaging in warfare. As for the legal side, up to now, we had not lost; however, with this document, we have lost badly. Its signature means that the Georgian state is capitulating not only on the military front but also from the legal standpoint. It surrenders the most important defense barrier that we have in this sphere. [Kurdovanidze] Batono Nodar, this document was preceded by eight agreements that were signed by the Georgian delegation. Is not the agreement of 14 May the logical result of that policy that has been conducted by the Georgian authorities over the last two years? [Natadze] Of course. This is the logical escalation of our policy of capitulation. However, I wish to emphasize that the deterioration of our position and the development of the scenario do not come to an end with the signing of this document. The scenario embraces the following stages: When the Russian Army arrives on the left and right banks of the Enguri River and occupies a zone stretching approximately 20 kilometers, they will be given the chance to work on the citizens in the way they want. It is clear in what way this will be. They will try to activate those people who are dissatisfied with the government's policy and form an armed opposition, which will lead, if not to a civil war, then to civil strife and slaughter. Then, they will succeed in spreading tension to Poti. As soon as this happens, at the invitation of the authorities or even without it, they will enter Poti and occupy it. The whole scenario is developing in such a way that the Russians will occupy Poti. Why are they interested in doing this? Because, by taking Poti, they will cut off not only Georgia but also Armenia and Azerebaijan and the whole of Central Asia beyond the Caucasus from the ocean. In this way, the plan to create a West-East corridor will be thwarted for some time. Russia, on the other hand, will continue to exert total influence upon both the Caucasus and the whole of Central Asia. I do not exclude that, as early as two years ago, before the war in Abkhazia had begun, the wholly despicable campaign in Zugdidi and Tsalenjikha had been aimed at preparing the psychological ground for the future experiment with Poti. The arguments presented by E. Shevardnadze that we need this document because Russia is powerful and we cannot resolve this problem without it, does not signify in any way that the problem will be solved following its intervention. It is possible that, on this occasion also, Russia will deceive us. The head of state likewise does not exclude this. Then, what is the point of trying something for the sixth time that has been attempted five times before? It turns out that Shevardnadze expects the Russians to go against what is written in the document. However, I view this to be naive. [Kurdovanidze] That is to say, you believe that the government's and E. Shevardnadze's policy toward the Abkhazian problem cannot stand up to any criticism. Do you not think that one way of recovering Abkhazia is for the head of state to resign? [Natadze] Shevardnadze is unable to govern Georgia. First of all, he cannot control the internal situation. He is unable to combat the wave of criminal gangs [bandokratia] and the economic collapse against which a struggle could be launched and is unable to create an army, which could be done very well. E. Shevardnadze is able to resolve diplomatic and political problems better than others and, therefore, his departure from the political arena would not be advantageous. Shevardnadze is of such value to us that we can pay a high price for him, but not any price. Consequently, it is necessary to limit considerably his powers. As regards the internal government of the country, these functions should be transferred to more than one person. The Georgian Government's policy toward Russia has been one of capitulation from beginning to end and, in reality, disadvantageous to us. It is necessary for Russia to have a Georgian leader who is sympathetically disposed toward it and a government that is willing to please. Therefore, they will do everything to ensure that Georgia has a pro-Russian government. [Kurdovanidze] Batono Nodar, does the parliamentary minority have a concrete plan of action regarding this question? [Natadze] Today, in Parliament, there is no longer so much importance attached to how much support this or that position receives or to what extend it is well argued and how sound it is in essence because, in a crisis situation, support mechanisms change and, in the end, the greater part of the deputies in Parliament will adopt that position that it considers expedient. The session held on 13 May clearly showed us that Shevardnadze's position is extremely weak. As soon as it was demonstrated that the head of state was unable to hold the views that he used to, his blind followers began to abandon their positions like rats fleeing a sinking ship. For example, a meeting of the Union of Georgia's Citizens (I would call it the Union of Slaves) was held on Sunday that was designed from the start to be an extravagant congress, but few people turned up. I would call this meeting "Walpurgis morning" as the witches gathered in the morning instead of at night. Thus, we can use the following words to characterize Shevardnadze's policy -- collaborationist and puppet-like in its status.
