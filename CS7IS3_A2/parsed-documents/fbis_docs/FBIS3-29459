Ochirbat to India the president has granted an interview to the newspaper "HINDUSTAN TIMES". Answering the question of the newspaper correspondent, what he expects from the visit to India, the head of the Mongolian state notes that Mongolia and India were maintaining friendly relations from the ancient times. These traditional relations, according to the outstanding son of India J. Nehru, have more than 1500 years history. Then the President P. Ochirbat expresses satisfaction with the present successful development of friendly relations and cooperation in all spheres, including political, pointing out to an important role of the dialogue of leaders of the two countries of the last years in the cause of strengthening confidence, mutual understanding, cooperation between Mongolia and India. I am confident, announces P. Ochirbat, my present visit will become an important event in the history of mutual relations of the two countries and will open a new page. During the visit the signing of a number of documents, including an agreement on friendly relations and cooperation between the two countries, an agreement on foundation of an intergovernment commission on cooperation, an agreement on refusal of double customs duties and income taxes, and an agreement on prevention of evasion of payment of taxes, is expected, says the president. Answering the question of the newspaper about the state of trade cooperation between Mongolia and India, P. Ochirbat announces that in relations of long centuries between the two countries the trade relations prevailed. The first trade agreement between Mongolia and India was signed in 1968. The volume of Mongolian export to India constituted in 1992 3.8 thousand US dollars, in 1993 1268.3 thousand US dollars. The volume of Indian export to Mongolia constituted in 1992 1268.3 thousand US dollars, in 1993 1759.3 thousand US dollars. In this connection P. Ochirbat also points out to the changes in structure of commodity circulation in the last years, its shifting from the state limits to the private sphere, which creates favourable preconditions for its expansion, opens wide perspectives. Answering the question about the existing difficulties in expansion of trade relations and the ways of overcoming them, the Mongolian president names such objective reasons as Mongolia does not have an outlet to sea, absence of direct land transport communication between the two countries. In P. Ochirbat's view, for overcoming these difficulties it is necessary, first of all, to create conditions for development of air communication, use the privileges granted to the countries, which do not have an outlet to sea. Secondly, also the transport agreements signed between Mongolia and her two neighbours are of great importance in this cause. Answering the question about the unsolved issues of development, which Mongolia is facing now, and the role, which India can play in solution of them, the head of the state stresses that the country has encountered with many problems on the way of transition to market economy. Among them providing with the dwelling, rendering support to the aged persons and children, providing them with social protection offer considerable difficulties. I think that the Indian Government can render a concrete support in this cause within the framework of realization of concrete projects, says the Mongolian president.
