The congress was held in the Silverton City Hall and delegates and other members of the party turned up in large numbers from all over the country and packed the hall for the proceedings. The decision to hold the congress on a historic day such as 31 May [Republic Day] met with great approval among party members. After leader Jaap Marais's inspiring speech on political strategies, party members could again look forward to the difficult but exciting road that lies ahead in the future of the HNP. Party members once more came to realize that the HNP was the only party which had the leader and the commitment to lead the Afrikaner people in the dark days ahead. The rest of the day's activities were based on possible changes to the HNP's program of principles, the constitution, and the party's authority structures in the light of the struggle ahead. Changes have been proposed to improve the HNP's effectiveness in the changing times in which the De Klerk government has plunged us. This will put the HNP in a position to oppose the government, as should be the case in a democratic order. The HNP is to take the lead in the spirit of resistance and opposition against the humiliation and defamation of the Afrikaner nation and its language. On the basis of nationalism, emphasis in HNP policy will fall strongly on each nation's preference for that which is its own. There was a general feeling in the audience that it was only a matter of time before HNP policy and principles were regarded as the only ones capable of resolving the South African situation. Through the funds that have been collected by workers in the party, especially in parts of the Cape province, it can be deduced that throughout the country the Afrikaner nation hungers for truth, and that Afrikaners are once again rallying to support the HNP in its struggle against enemies of the Afrikaner nation.
