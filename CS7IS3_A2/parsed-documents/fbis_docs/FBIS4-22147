Proshin and Colonel Yu. Andreyev] [Text] Radical changes in the military-political situation in Europe, the result of deep socio-economic reforms in East European countries and CIS states, have made adjustments to the coalition military doctrine of NATO. The "new strategic concept" adopted at a session of the North Atlantic alliance in Rome in 1991, which actually is the coalition military doctrine, defines the basic requirements for the bloc's armed forces, taking into account the changed situation in Europe. Its most important guideline is revision of the priority directions of NATO activities, and the emphasis is being shifted from the military to the political area. The bloc leadership's approach to defining a security threat has also changed, which is expressed in the renunciation of the traditional interpretation of the "threat from the East" as the main destabilizing factor. The term threat has been replaced by the relatively neutral concept of risk. This means primarily the military might of Russia and the CIS, as well as the instability of the situation in countries of Eastern Europe, crises and conflicts outside the European continent, and the danger of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Therefore, one of the bloc's basic functions is considered the monitoring of crises, including activities to prevent them, which assumes a combination of measures of a political and military nature. The NATO leadership has planned by the year 2000 to conduct a radical reform in the area of organizational development of the joint armed forces, which along with their technical re-equipment will ensure optimal defense sufficiency for the bloc. In doing so, main efforts are directed at creating small mobile groupings of forces able to respond adequately to various types of threats. The substance of the planned military reform in NATO essentially comes down to reducing the numerical and combat strength of permanent readiness forces with a simultaneous increase in the role of reserve components and improvement of the system of mobilization deployment. During the course of the force reorganization, three main components of NATO's general-purpose forces are being formed: Reaction forces, main defensive forces, and reinforcement troops. In the estimate of the bloc's military experts, the transition to such a three-component structure will make these forces more flexible, which will ensure multiple variations of their combat employment -- from autonomous use of limited troop groupings in local conflicts to successive involvement of all components when there is a threat of large-scale military operations being unleashed. The bloc leadership assigns an important role to NATO ground forces in accomplishing those military-political and military tasks which may arise in the future. This article devotes main attention primarily to the development of this branch of the armed forces. Reaction forces are viewed as a combat-ready component of the NATO Armed Forces intended for priority use in the event of crisis situations. Structurally, the reaction forces include "immediate reaction forces" [IRF] and "rapid deployment forces" [RDF]. The "immediate reaction forces" will be created on the basis of NATO's existing mobile forces, which includes eight reinforced battalions (two from Germany and one each from Belgium, Great Britain, Italy, Canada, the Netherlands, and the United States) and one company (from Luxembourg). During a threatening period and for the duration of exercises, the headquarters of mobile ground forces is brought up to strength, and an army aviation group and an engineer company (from the United States), an artillery headquarters, an air support and reconnaissance center, signals and electronic intelligence battalions, logistic battalions, a military police subunit (from Great Britain), a communications center (from Germany), and a helicopter squadron (from Great Britain and Germany) are deployed. Combat and logistic support subunits are attached to mobile ground forces battalions. Two German airborne battalions are reinforced by an artillery battery and two companies (signal and medical). The total numerical strength of mobile ground forces is about 10,000. Armament includes 125 guns and mortars of various calibers, 198 ATGM's, and 56 antiaircraft weapons. In the future, it is planned to transfer to them separate subunits from Denmark, Spain, and Norway and thus bring the total numerical strength to 14,000-15,000 people and the number of battalions to 11. It is believed that employment of the IRF will have two aspects: Military-political and military. In the first instance, they act as a deterrence factor; the multinational composition makes it possible to view their participation in combat operations as a joint reflection of an attack on the block member countries. The military aspect involves using the IRF as an advance guard to support the advance and deployment of the "rapid deployment forces" on the threatened axis. The RDF must be ready for combat operations in 72 hours. The "rapid deployment forces" will become the basis of the reaction forces and will consist of formations of all branches of the NATO Armed Forces, which will provide them complete independence when organizing and conducting combat operations. The basis of the RDF ground forces is to be a allied army corps [AAC], which includes 4-5 divisions. It may include an armored division and mechanized division from Great Britain, and an air-mobile division and mechanized division of mixed composition. The experience of NATO Armed Forces exercises of recent years shows that an RDF air-mobile division may include one air-mobile brigade each from Belgium, Great Britain, and the Netherlands and an airborne brigade from Germany (Exercise Certain Shield-91). A mechanized division may include Greek, Italian, and Turkish brigade. A fifth division (presumably a tank division) is to be transferred from Germany's Bundeswehr. The final composition of the AAC has not yet been determined. The RDF can be additionally built up by 5-6 divisions from European NATO countries. The composition of the assigned forces will depend specifically on the situation taking shape and the scale of the possible military conflict in the initial stage of which it is planned to use the RDF. The readiness period of large units and units included in these forces by the start of combat employment in the intended areas of operation will be 7-14 days, depending on the remoteness of the predicted areas of probable crisis situations. The following requirements are imposed on large units and units of RDF ground forces: --High combat readiness as a most important indicator of their capability for rapid assembly, advance (transfer) to intended areas of operation, and successful accomplishment of combat missions. To do this it is necessary to have a high level of manning and training, as well as the conduct of intensive training of staffs and troops with the practice of different variations of combat employment of the RDF. --High mobility is the main characteristic of the RDF which provides the capability for advancing a considerable distance in a short time period, rapid operational deployment, and conduct of highly mobile combat operations regardless of the terrain relief at any time of day and in various climate conditions. This will be achieved by introducing into the RDF highly mobile large units and units equipped with air-transportable armament, providing them sufficiently with air and sea transport, and also creating stockpiles of supplies. The main defensive forces (regular and mobilized formations) in the new structure will comprise the basis of the NATO Armed Forces groupings. They are considered the first operational echelon when conducting large-scale military operations. By the year 2000 these forces may number 34-36 divisions. In the assessment of NATO experts, decreasing the danger of the sudden unleashing of war in Europe and also the formation of a buffer zone with the CIS countries and Russia will enable command authorities not only to reduce the number of large units in the bloc's armed forces but also decrease the level of combat readiness and the strength level of divisions and separate brigades of the ground forces. The basis of the main defensive forces will be multinational allied army corps, which it is planned to subordinate to the command authorities of the allied ground forces. Deployment of the multinational formations is to be accomplished as part of the RDF and the main defensive forces in the European Theater of War. In peacetime, the headquarters of the multinational large units and formations are to be manned with personnel from the armed forces of the countries that are participating in creating these units. Large units and units of the allied army corps will be subordinate to the national commands and may be transferred under the command of allied headquarters just for the period of conducting measures of operational and combat training, and also in crisis situations. The interest demonstrated in NATO towards multinational formations is explained more by political than military considerations, which creates a firm basis for preserving the permanent presence of foreign troops, including U.S. Armed Forces, on the territory of Germany. In this regard, during the majority of the fall exercises held in 1992, not only did they practice variants of conducting combat operations, but they also studied the structures and combat capabilities of the multinational large units and formations being formed. Special attention was given to organizing coordination both at the operational echelon and the tactical level. In particular, within the framework of the "Wekkerer Schwabe" command and staff exercise of Germany's II Army Corps, the concept of combat employment of an army corps of multinational composition was studied. It was one of the largest measures of this nature in the Central European Theater of Military Operations. In addition to German troops, staffs of large units and units of the U.S. and French armed forces participated in it. The basic goals of the exercise involved testing and updating plans for combat employment of large units and units of the army corps jointly with allied troops in operations of the initial period of a war, practicing the principles of combat use of multinational formations and large units, and also questions of training staffs and command personnel for conducting offensive and defensive combat operations. According to preliminary assessments of the NATO allied armed forces command authorities, large units of a multinational composition will have sufficiently broad combat capabilities. Today, the bloc's leadership has begun practical implementation of plans for creating multinational AAC's. Already this year two AAC's will be formed (two divisions is each--from the U.S. and German armies). In all, it is planned to deploy up to six allied army corps in the Central European Theater of Military Operations. They will include large units and units from the ground forces of Belgium, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, and the United States. However, full implementation of these plans for creating AAC's requires a number of organizational-technical measures aimed, in particular, at solving problems of compatibility of communications systems, overcoming the language barrier, and also differences on the level of training staffs and troops of the participating countries. Reinforcement forces will include regular and mobilized formations in European NATO countries and those being transferred from the United States and Canada, which are not part of the main defensive forces. They are intended for reinforcing the first operational echelon and also for creating operational and strategic reserves in a theater of military operations and a theater of war as a whole. In the assessment of military experts, the reinforcement forces can number 18-20 divisions. Periods of mobilization and redeployment will be 30 days or more. Questions of improving the command and control system occupy an important place within the framework of the planned reorganization of NATO Armed Forces in the immediate future. Emphasis is placed on increasing centralization of command and control at the operational level primarily by eliminating intermediate command and control entities and creating new, larger coalition commands and headquarters. In particular, commands and headquarters of the Northern and Central army groups have been disbanded this year, and a command and headquarters of allied ground forces in the Central European Theater of Military Operations have been created based on them. NATO's military-technical policy for the next 10-15 years calls for creating and improving new models of armament for the ground forces and also upgrading existing types of weapons. Fourth-generation tanks having great firepower and improved armor protection are scheduled to enter service in the late 1990's. In addition, building up the defensive and fire capabilities and increasing the maneuverability of large units of the ground forces will be accomplished by equipping them with new models of infantry fighting vehicle, artillery systems, MLRS multiple-launch rocket systems, and third-generation ground- and helicopter-based antitank guided missile systems with a firing range of up to 5 km, which according to their characteristics will be considerably more effective than existing ones. On the whole, an analysis of the new concept adopted in NATO shows that the bloc's leadership intends to conduct a radical reform of the ground component of the NATO Armed Forces. This reform, in addition to technical re-equipping of the forces with new armament, will ensure the alliance an optimal defense sufficiency. The main efforts are directed at creating small and highly mobile force groupings capable of reacting adequately to different types of threats (risk).
