According to a statement issued by the DSS Information Service, the chairman of the Communal Council in Vrsac was forced to defend his property himself after his business premises had been broken into several times and the police had failed to react. In Bujanovac, a DSS parliamentary candidate was brutally attacked and injured by Goran Veljkovic, son of the local strongman, Socialist Party of Serbia deputy Randjel Veljkovic, while in Surdulica -- claims the statement -- the local authorities have selectively and illegally seized the business premises belonging to the wife of the DSS Communal Council chairman in this town. All these cases show -- the statement concludes -- that the authorities, instead of solving the vital problems that they have caused, are increasingly resorting to violence.
