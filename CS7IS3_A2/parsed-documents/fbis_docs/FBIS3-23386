A finger has been pointed at Iran in Shapur Bakhtiar's murder, the shah's former prime minister, who was assassinated on 6 August 1991 in his peaceful villa Suresne, on the outskirts of Paris. This ultrasensitive dossier, which after two years of investigation consists of several thousand pages, should soon come to a conclusion. Within the next few days, the Chamber of Accusation of the Paris Court of Appeal, which met last Monday, will make a decision: Either to remand the suspects accused in the assassination of the Tehran regime's opponent to the Assize Court; to request more information; or to simply shelve the case on the basis of a nonsuit ruling. In theory, nine suspects, all Iranians or of Iranian origin, could be called to the dock. In theory, because only three of them were arrested and imprisoned in France. Of all the members of the commando unit that, on 6 August 1991 evaded the vigilance of the CRS [Republican Security Police] and entered Bakhtiar's residence, the police could catch only Ali Rad Vakili [name as published] after a long chase through Paris, Lyon, Sallances, Valence, Annecy, and Lake Geneva. The other defendants, against whom international warrants for arrest have been issued, are still on the run or back in Iran. Judge Bruguiere's preliminary investigation and the 177-page final charge by the public prosecutor link the Tehran mullahs. The document of the antiterrorist section abounds with details. It incriminates no fewer than three Iranian ministries: the Telecommunications Ministry, an adviser of which allegedly helped two of the murderers get visas; the Foreign Ministry, one of whose officers, Zeynal Sarhadi [name as published], is accused of having supervised the commando members' escape from France; and the Intelligence and Security Ministry, which is mentioned several times in the public prosecutor's report. [Information Minister] 'Ali Fallahian himself, vice minister at the time of the murder, appears to have been one of those who ordered Bakhtiar's murder. His name and his private telephone number were found in the diary of one of the defendants imprisoned in France, a former journalist and correspondent in Paris. The conclusions of the Public Prosecution, written down black on white in its charge, are very meaningful: "The Iranian intelligence services effectively participated in the operation of the criminal association" set up to murder the former prime minister who was ousted by Imam Khomeyni in 1979. More evidence needed in support of these conclusions? The dossier contains a telephone number linked to Tehran's special services and which was called several times by some of the accused. And the dossier provides a very detailed description of a structured logistical network between Iran, France, Switzerland, and Turkey, which was uncovered with the help of telephone listings. Tehran is still denying these accusations. [passage omitted]
