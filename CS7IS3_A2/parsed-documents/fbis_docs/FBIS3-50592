Source is cited in parentheses following each item. The Economy Ministry reported the following figures for 1993: - Inflation was 12.1 percent (government goal: 12 percent). - GNP increased 5 percent (last year's total was 4.6 percent). - Fiscal deficit was 1.8 percent of GNP. - Exports equaled $600 million. Despite a drop in coffee prices, exports increased 22 percent, and exports of assembled goods increased 39 percent. - Net international reserves were $663 million. - Increase in formal employment, according to Social Security affiliation, was 13 percent. Economy Minister Enrique Cordova believes that 1994 could see an economic upswing in El Salvador but warned that "economic growth must be maintained until the year 2000 to recover pre-1978 levels." (San Salvador LA PRENSA GRAFICA in Spanish 29 Dec 93 p 3) The 1992-93 coffee harvest reached 3.3 million quintals, while the 1993-94 crop is expected to reach 2 million quintals. Some of the reasons for the reduced production is the development of new neighborhoods on land previously used for growing coffee, the lack of adequate attention to coffee plantations, and the 20 percent export retention in force since October to improve prices.
