FR940607-0-00065 FR940607-0-00017 Commenters generally favored adopting an exemption addressing these circumstances, agreeing that Title XI appraisals did not enhance the safety and soundness of these transactions because the lenders were basing their decision to extend credit on the value of collateral other than real estate. Some commenters suggested that this exemption could be combined with the abundance of caution exemption. Although there are situations in which the two exemptions overlap, the agencies believe that both exemptions are necessary because there will be transactions that qualify for one exemption, but not the other. (5) Real Estate-Secured Business Loans of $1 Million or Less The agencies are adopting a new exemption for business loans with a value of $1 million or less where the sale of, or rental income derived from, real estate is not the primary source of repayment. The agencies also are adopting the proposed definition of ``business loan'' as a loan or extension of credit to any corporation, general or limited partnership, business trust, joint venture, pool, syndicate, sole proprietorship (including an individual engaged in farming), or other business entity. This provision allows a regulated institution to take real estate as security in connection with a loan to a small- or medium-sized business when the primary source of repayment for the loan does not depend on sale of, or rental income derived from, real estate. The final rule differs in two respects from the proposed rule. First, the exemption is available for business loans of $1 million or less. The proposed rule would have exempted business loans less than $1 million. The change was adopted to reduce confusion by making this provision consistent with the way other limits are treated in the rule. The change affects the scope of the exemption very slightly. Second, under the final rule, the exemption is available for business loans that do not depend on real estate sales and rental income as the primary source of repayment for the loan. The proposed rule would have exempted business loans that were not dependent on sale of, or rental income derived from, the real estate taken as collateral as the primary source of repayment. The change narrows the scope of the exemption by preventing a borrower from qualifying for the exemption by showing that the primary source of repayment for the loan is income from real estate sales and rentals involving real estate other than the real estate in which the lender has a security interest. This means, for example, that a real estate developer cannot qualify for the exemption by showing that a real estate-secured loan for one project, in which the lender has taken a security interest, will be repaid with income from real estate sales or rentals from other real estate projects, in which the lender does not have a security interest. The following examples illustrate the application of this exemption. Example 1: The owner of a shop seeks a term loan for $1 million or less from a regulated institution. The loan will be repaid with income derived from operations. The regulated institution would not extend credit to the borrower without a lien against the real estate. However, because the loan is for $1 million or less and the sale of, or rental income derived from, real estate is not the primary source of repayment, a Title XI appraisal would not be required for this transaction under this exemption. Example 2: A company acquires an adjacent parcel of land to construct an office building. The company seeks a loan of $1 million or less from a regulated institution to provide construction financing and a permanent mortgage for the office building. The company intends to lease part of the building and will use the rental income to help repay the loan. The lender estimates that operations of the business would contribute approximately 45 percent of the funds necessary to repay the loan and rental income approximately 55 percent. The regulated institution should conclude that rental income derived from real estate serves as the primary source of repayment for the loan. Therefore, assuming no other exemption is applicable to the transaction, a Title XI appraisal would be required. Increased Lending to Small- and Medium-Sized Businesses. In the experience of the agencies, the appraisal requirement may have adversely affected the ability of small- and medium-sized businesses to obtain credit. In particular, there are indications that the cost of an appraisal may impede small- and medium-sized businesses from receiving working capital, operating loans, and other business-related credits that otherwise would be consistent with prudent banking practice. The majority of financial institutions and financial institution trade associations that responded to the agencies' request for comment on the effect of the business loan exemption on credit availability stated that the proposed exemption would increase credit availability by reducing the cost and time to make real estate-secured business loans. These commenters generally stated that the changes would have the most significant effect on credit availability for small- and medium-sized businesses. Some appraisers also stated that the proposed changes would increase credit availability. A large number of commenters responding to the specific request for comment thought that the changes would have no effect on credit availability. These commenters included appraisers and appraiser trade associations, a small number of financial institutions, and other commenters. Some of these commenters stated that the ability of financial institutions to earn a reasonable return by making relatively risk-free investments in U.S. government securities was the cause of credit availability problems. The agencies believe that the final rule may reduce the cost of real estate-secured loans to small- and medium-sized businesses and increase the availability of loans to these borrowers. Effect on Safety and Soundness. Some commenters stated that this exemption would eliminate the requirement to obtain Title XI appraisals for a large portion of the real estate-secured business loans in their communities. Others stated that this exemption raised safety and soundness concerns because the only tangible collateral for many businesses is real estate. Though real estate may be an important asset of many small- and medium-sized businesses, the agencies have concluded that this exemption for certain business loans that do not rely on real estate as the primary source of repayment will not threaten the safety and soundness of regulated institutions nor pose a threat to federal financial and public policy interests. Although the agencies are not requiring Title XI appraisals in connection with these business loans, the agencies are requiring regulated institutions to obtain appropriate evaluations of the real estate collateral. The evaluation should provide the institution with sufficient information on the value of the real estate to satisfy principles of safe and sound banking. In addition, during each required full-scope, on-site examination, each agency will analyze the prudence of each institution's credit underwriting practices, including appraisal and evaluation practices, as appropriate to the institution's size and nature of its real estate-related activities.
