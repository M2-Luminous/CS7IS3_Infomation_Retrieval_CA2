At a news conference on 23 March at the North Korean Embassy in Beijing concerning the resumption of the U.S.-South Korea "Team Spirit" joint military exercise and the deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea, Ambassador Chu Chang-chun said that "unless they are halted, there will be no recourse but to go to war. The entire responsibility rests with the two countries (the United States and South Korea)." In the embassy, photographs from the Korean crisis period were displayed. Prior to this, at a 19 March working level meeting in Panmunjom held to discuss the exchange of special envoys between the North and the South, North Korean representative Pak Yong-su suggested the possibility of war by declaring that "Seoul is not far from here (Panmunjom). In case of war, Seoul will be engulfed in fire." He even added that "in that event, it will also be difficult for you, Mr. Son (the South Korean representative), to survive." It had to be without doubt a comment which he was instructed to make by the highest authorities, since an official at a mere outpost could not use an expression such as "war" at his own discretion. It is said that representative Pak made that comment while looking at a memo which he had prepared beforehand, and that a North Korean propaganda broadcast at the DMZ [demilitarized zone] kept repeating "[we will] start the offensive in early April." The United States and South Korea, on the other hand, have decided to "resume Team Spirit," and to deploy Patriot missiles in South Korea. The South Korean Defense Ministry on 24 March made public that they had already completed a plan for a five-stage "absorbing and unifying operation 5027," which includes immediate retaliation, occupation of Pyongyang, and so on, to be implemented in the event North Korea invades the South. This is the first time the tension between the North and South has become so high since the 1983 terrorist bombing incident in Rangoon. Building a Sense of Crisis in Hopes of Gaining Advantage in Negotiations Why has North Korea used such excessively provocative expressions? Specialists on North Korea in Seoul believe that their intentions include the following: 1) It is the final raising of the ante prior to playing the "nuclear card;" 2) By generating fear of war, they will heighten the sense of crisis for doves in South Korea and the United States, and gain an advantage in future negotiations; and 3) It is intended to strengthen the unity of the nation. For North Korea, the "nuclear card," with which they make others suspect that they have developed or are developing nuclear arms, is their last trump card for solving their present international isolation and economic difficulties. In fact, by using this card, they have succeeded in bringing the United States, which wants extension of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), to the negotiating table, and they have gained concessions such as halting military exercises and the start of U.S.-North Korea diplomatic normalization negotiations. The specialists suspect that this [use of threatening expressions] may be their way of testing the water to determine if they can make one more push. Setting aside the national unity policy, so far their strategy to gain concessions through a hardened posture has not met with success. In Seoul, it has hardly affected the price of stocks and there is no move toward hoarding: the people have accepted this development calmly. It is said that in South Korea public opinion in support of the flexible line followed by the Kim Yong-sam Government toward the North has been strong, but because of the recent comments the hawks' voices have rapidly become stronger, and it is getting harder for the government to compromise. The United States plans to bring this issue to the United Nations Security Council. It plans first to pass a resolution criticizing North Korea, and if no result is obtained, it wants to move on to economic sanctions. The responses of Japan, South Korea, and the United States, which until now were subtly different in approach, has become a unified response. And the emergence of such an international situation makes it difficult for even China, which North Korea relies on, to use the veto. Far Eastern Issues Research Institution Director Kang In-tok [as published] observes that "the North has made an incorrect reading of the international situation because of their cold war mind set and dogma. I wonder if it [North Korea] has given the impression to the world that it is not a party with which one can negotiate in a normal manner." Of course this is not to say that there is absolutely no risk that the heightened tension might trigger an accidental explosion and lead to war. But most observers believe that in the near future North Korea has no choice but to resume negotiations with the United States. North Korea has in the past suddenly changed important policies, such as the resumption of Japan-North Korea diplomatic normalization negotiations, and joining the United Nations. In such a case, how China behaves will be the key factor. Bullish Comment is Reverse Side of Fear -- The "Inferno" Will Be Pyongyang For the offensive side the value of a surprise attack is extremely great. It was Sunday morning, 25 June 1950, when North Korean forces broke through the 38th parallel. It was also Sunday when the Japanese Navy attacked Pearl Harbor at dawn of 7 December 1941 (local time). The fact that the North Korean side says "we will make Seoul an inferno" and "there is no recourse but to go to war," is to abandon the effect of a surprise attack if it really intends to attack. It is a common practice to keep a low rhetorical posture when one starts a war, because it is convenient to declare internally and externally, after the war starts, "we had no choice but to retaliate because the other side launched an attack." In this sense, it would be appropriate to interpret the offensive utterances by North Korea as a bluff derived from its fear of war. There are reasons that North Korea fears war. Although it is said they possess 730 fighter aircraft, most of them are old Chinese-made MiG-17's and 19's. The only modern planes are some 10 to 20 MiG-29's and 30's, some Sukhoy-25 ground assault planes, and 40 or so MiG-23's, totaling a little under 100 aircraft. Even if 120 MiG-21's can be utilized, this comes to only 200 odd aircraft. On the other hand, South Korea's F-16's, F-4's, and F-5's, which total about 340 planes, can all be used at the front. Moreover, 72 U.S. Air Force F-16's are stationed in Korea, 160 U.S. Air Force and Marine Corps Air Wing aircraft are stationed in Japan, and 60 fighter and assault planes from U.S. aircraft carriers bring the total to some 630 aircraft. The performance capabilities of the aircraft are different. In particular, the gaps are great in electronic technology such as radar, computers, and electronic countermeasures, and in information gathering ability by airborne early warning aircraft and reconnaissance satellites. Also, North Korea has a fuel shortage, and per pilot flight training per year is said to be four to six hours. This is the same as a "paper driver" [that is, someone who is qualified on paper, but has no practical experience]. When all these elements are taken together, the United States-South Korean side has absolute aerial superiority. Lightweight "Nuclear Weapon" Not Completed? Even if the North Korean forces make an offensive move, because they will be hit from the air and their supply trucks will be destroyed it is likely that they will be driven back without passing through the South's defensive positions. The only strategies left for the North would be to have its 60,000 special forces invade alongside the mountains, to fire Scud missiles, of which it is said to possess over 300, or for fighter airplanes, prepared to make only a one way attack, to invade with bombs at low altitudes. The reason the U.S. forces are positioning "Patriot" antiair missiles in South Korea is not to defend Seoul from the Scuds. The Patriot is almost useless against ballistic missiles. It is to protect the U.S. bases from aerial attacks. There is a suspicion that North Korea has made a "nuclear detonation device," but it is fairly certain that it has not made any lightweight "nuclear weapon" deliverable by missile. But chemical weapons are of World War I technology, so information that the North is making them is most likely true. If chemical warhead-armed Scuds were to be shot into Seoul, since South Korea has not made preparations with gas masks, protective clothing, and antidotes for the civilian population as Israel has, it would trigger great chaos. If the population of 20 million from Seoul and its surrounding areas attempted an exodus, the U.S.-South Korean counteroffensive operation could be stalled in the waves of refuges. As for Japanese, there are about 3,000 who live in Seoul, and about 10,000 tourists are expected to be in the city. Their rescue would be difficult. On the other hand, the U.S.-South Korean naval and air forces would gain command of the air, would severely bomb Pyongyang and Wonsan on the east coast, and would also attack with "Tomahawk" cruise missiles from surface vessels and submarines. Against the American electronics interference technology and the stealth fighter airplanes which would not show up on radar, there is nothing the North's antiair missiles can do. North Korea must know that it is Pyongyang which would become an inferno. But as long as the combined 600,000-700,000 troops are facing each other along the 240-km front line, the South Korean side has entered into alert status, and has come to feel nervous about the North Korean comments on war, there is a slim chance that small clashes at the border could expand into full-scale battles. Along the demilitarized zone, there also have been frequent incidents in the past of shootings between patrols from both sides. Thus, when tension becomes heightened, an unexpected situation could easily occur.
