However, in the interest of preserving the facade of unity, the senior leadership has asked officials, academics and the media to stop open debates about controversial issues including the national growth rate. In a rare move, Mr. Li yesterday invited regional cadres, experts and noncommunist politicians to air their views on the report, which will be presented to the NPC when it opens on March 10. The principles underlying the report were disclosed by the premier at an enlarged meeting of the State Council yesterday. "We must seriously handle well the relationship between reform, development and stability," XINHUA (the NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY) last night quoted Mr. Li as saying. The premier repeated the development strategy adopted by the Politburo last month: "Seize the opportunity; deepen reform; expand the open door; promote development; maintain stability." He added the report would be guided by patriarch Deng Xiaoping's theory for building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The drafting team of the report is headed by the Deputy Director of the State Council Research Office, Wang Mengkui, regarded as a cautious technocrat. Sources said the report would give pride of place to stability, and that in spite of the reference to Mr. Deng's edicts, his ideal about "fastpaced reform and growth" had been dropped. For example, the Politburo has decided that, to curb hyperinflation and fixed-assets investment, the growth rate must be scaled down from 13 per cent last year to nine per cent. The sources said, however, that the leadership was thrown off balance by statements made by Mr. Deng in Shanghai last week. Following his practice for the past three years, Mr. Deng exhorted the Shanghai leadership to "go faster" in economic development. While the patriarch had made no direct reference to other provinces and open cities, his words of encouragement to Shanghai were seen by regional cadres as support for their high-growth strategies. Chinese economists said the nine per cent growth rate, which would be written into the report, would encounter opposition. They said if Beijing failed to restore financial discipline, a new austerity programme similar to the one launched in June, could not be ruled out for the second half of this year. Beijing, however, was anxious to keep the debates about the growth rate under wraps . While Mr. Li was preparing the final drafts of his Government Work Report, the Politburo and Cabinet were mapping out ways to ensure that local administrations and enterprises did not embark on another wave of excessive investments.
