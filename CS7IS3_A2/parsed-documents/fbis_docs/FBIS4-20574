Kumashiro, Yokohama National University] [Text] Boron carbide (B[.sub]12[/]C[.sub]3[/]) and boron phosphide (B[.sub]12[/]P[.sub]2[/]) are materials which belong to boron modification of the a-rhombohedral type, and accordingly their physical properties can be understood in the same line as for _a_-rhombohedral boron. Their vibrational properties have recently been studied, in particular by Raman spectroscopy. With respect to optical properties, _a_-rhombohedral B is classified to uniaxial crystal, and hence the anisotropy of the vibrational properties is very important. The space group of the crystal is R3m and the crystal is not piezoelectric. Hence, Raman active vibrations are by no means polar modes. In Raman scattering, the standard procedure of group theory is valid for the identification of vibrations. Calculation of the scattering efficiency is straightforward and the peak frequencies are independent of the angle :gv between the wave vector of a phonon and the c-axis. For IR spectra, on the contrary, the situation is a little different. Not only the intensity but the peak frequency depend the angle _th_. The degeneracy predicted by group theory is sometimes lifted due to the presence of the macroscopic electric field. An anisotropy of this kind is illustrated in the figure for two hypothetical cases. Figure (a) illustrates the case that the electrical interaction overcomes the anisotropy of the crystal, while figure (b) shows the case that the anisotropy of the crystal overcomes the electrical interaction. In the latter case, the anisotropy becomes appreciable in IR spectra. Effective charge is another aspect of anisotropy appearing in the charge distribution. This quantity is a measure of the separation between the TO and LO modes. Figure 1. Angular Dependence of the Phonon Frequency. (a) Electrical-interaction predominant; (b) Anisotropy An anisotropy of such a kind has not been studied for these materials. Part of the reason is the difficulty of obtaining good-quality crystals. Another part lies in the measurement itself. For bulk crystals, only reflectance type is available for IR spectra, precise determination of the peak by Reststrahlen is relatively difficult, owing to its rather broad nature. For this purpose, it is more desirable to use the transmission-type spectroscopy for thin films. Technological development in thin film growth by molecular beam methods brings us the potential to solve this problem, good-quality B[.sub]12[/]P[.sub][/]2 singlecrystal will become to be available. In the present paper, we represent preliminary discussion of vibrational properties, which will serve as an aid for the interpretation of vibrational spectra of boron-rich solids with rhombohedral structure.
