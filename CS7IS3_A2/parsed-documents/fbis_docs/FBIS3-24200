The Russian President's Edict No. 1765 allows administration chiefs to approve local election statutes themselves: The parliament is only just beginning to consider a general federal law. One doesn't have to be a genius to imagine what will happen. However, much is already clear: Read our item. "There is a vast bureaucratic plot against democracy in the country, which took shape just before the parliamentary election," says Vladimir Rasskazov, former people's deputy and chairman of the banking subcommittee of the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet, retired vice-chairman of the Russian Central Bank, and current president of the All-Russian Stock Bank. "I know from personal experience that local nomenklaturas were given complete control over the elections to the Federation Council." Like every businessman, he supports his statements with specific documents and facts, although many of them are clearly colored by the pain of a person who has lost an election campaign. Vladimir Rasskazov ran for the Russia's Choice bloc for an Arkhangelsk Oblast seat in the Federation Council. His opponent, Yuriy Guskov, chairman of the Arkhangelsk Oblast Soviet and before that first secretary of the Arkhangelsk Oblast CPSU Committee, was nominated as candidate by the Russian Communist Party. He won by 9,000 votes. In Vladimir Rasskazov's view, this was a result of machinations, forgery and outright legal arbitrariness of the local powers that be. Nor was it only the issue that communist representatives could conduct their campaigns directly at enterprises during work hours, which democratic candidates could not. Or that the oblast radio would fall silent "for technical reasons" precisely when broadcasting an interview with Vladimir Rasskazov. Much more mysterious was the kaleidoscope of number errors in the Arkhangelsk election returns. Thus, 42,000 ballots more were cast for the Federation Council election than in the federal district, where parties and blocs were determining their standing with the people. What does this suggest? Two assumptions come to mind: Either the voters deliberately failed to cast their "party" ballots, or someone deliberately stuffed the ballot boxes with extra "paper" ballots, which decided the outcome of the race for the upper chamber of parliament. There are many such flaws. For example, the total number of ballots issued to voters or cancelled was 118,508 less than the number of registered Arkhangelsk voters. One can think of many reasons for this. Say, again blame voters who for some reason put the lacking number of ballots in their pockets. But is it possible that more than 100,000 people would want to commit an identical prank? Or could one justifiably say that voter turnout in the oblast was expected to be low, so fewer ballots were printed in order to save paper. For all its peculiarities, the complex existing situation may not have aroused so many distortions if Vladimir Rasskazov or his representatives had a document stating the total number of printed ballots, indicating how many were handed out and how many remained in reserve. The absence of such information has aroused the most evil suspicions of the losing side: Where the ballots "saved" before or after the election? Try and find out now, while 116,000 election ballots account for almost 20 percent of the vote. Also surprising are the "miracles" of the Solovetsk election precinct, where 434 voters cast a total of 1,604 ballots. It is hard to imagine that in their civic enthusiasm the Solovetsk citizens managed to vote several times. Was this some unfortunate accident? Quite possible, but if the mistake was discovered and not corrected one can't help thinking of direct fraud. "Nevertheless," says Vladimir Rasskazov, "a preliminary count of votes in Arkhangelsk, Severodvinsk and Novodvinsk, which include half the district constituents, showed that 1.7 times more had voted for me than for my opponent. Seeing this, the district commission immediately halted ballot collection for three days. In the final result Yuriy Guskov was already ahead..." Incensed by such "democratism," Vladimir Rasskazov prepared papers and appealed to the Central Election Committee and procurator agencies, seeking a recount of the Arkhangelsk Oblast ballots. So far with no result. "As fate would have it, the Central Election Committee's complaint commission is headed by P. Zhigaltsov, an Arkhangelsk crony of Yu. Guskov," says the would-be deputy, explaining the reason for his unsuccessful quest for the truth. The first thing that comes to mind after talking to him is: Here is a person who has lost an election and now seeks to make a political issue of it. New times breed new traditions. And all his appeals to courts and procurator offices, allusions to the biased makeup of election commissions "formed back in 1989 by the communists," and "the absence of the possibility to monitor their actions by democratic forces" could be seen as an effort to create "publicity" around his name with an eye on future elections. You must agree that if something like this were expounded by some run-of-the-mill politician or a representative of the humanities his words could be classified as populism. But the assertions of a ranking banking-brokerage executive well versed in the intrigues of the powers that be, moreover an economic scholar with two university degrees who acquired professional experience both as a director at the Computer Center and in academic and research work at the economics and management chair of a technical college, tend to ring true. Moreover, the results of the latest election reflect, as on a screen, the strategic redeployment of the communist-soviet nomenklatura forces, bringing hidden secrets to light. Understanding that the democrats' political prestige depends on the local successes of the changes taking place, and that the apparat plays a key role in this process, the nomenklatura, having regained consciousness after the August debacle, hastily began to deploy its people over the entire vertical of power. Launching a personnel offensive, it soon gained control over Russia's major regions. Suffice it to cite facts for just a few of them (see table). ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Oblast |Total number of administ-|Of them, former secretar-| | |ration chiefs |ies or executives of cen-| | | |tral, oblast, city, rayo-| | | |n CPSU committees | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Rostov |58 |28 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Voronezh |33 |25 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Belgorod |27 |21 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Irkutsk |38 |16 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Novosibirsk |37 |14 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Sverdlovsk |24 |12 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In Krasnoyarsk Kray, every other city or rayon administration chief is a former CPSU apparatchik. And if one considers personnel who completed the Higher Party School, then it is all of 80 percent... This was described and happened two years ago, but for some reason we only now seem to have overcome amnesia and are worriedly asking: How come that in, say, Penza Oblast 40 out of 45 seats in the legislative assembly have gone to former party committee secretaries, deputies of disbanded soviets, directors of plants and state farms, and other local leaders of communist orientation? And now, egged on by Sergey Filatov, chief of the Russian president's administration, and Nikolay Medvedev, chief of that administration's department for work with territories, the democratic chorus has suddenly voiced its alarm at the possibility of the formation of a "red belt" made up of regions with strong anti-reform moods around Moscow and the return of the local party-managerial nomenklatura to power. Actually, it never lost that local power, only adapting deftly to circumstances. We all remember the metamorphoses when the leaders of party committees of various levels instantaneously, like a shoal of fish following some signal known only to them, occupied leadership position in soviets of the respective levels, and then, with the same alacrity, moved over to the positions of administration chiefs. Now, again in consort, they are occupying the seats of dumas and other legislative bodies. Today the entire nomenklatura force is following their bosses in the "personnel offensive." Which is to say that so far the only "belt" around Moscow has been "red."
