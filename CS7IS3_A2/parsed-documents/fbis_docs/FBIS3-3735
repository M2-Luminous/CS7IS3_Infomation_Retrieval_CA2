The report gives a factual summation of the work in the past year and puts forward positive and prudent tasks for the coming year. The session has decided to approve the report. The session points out: This year will be crucial for accelerating the establishment of a socialist market economic system and maintaining a sustained, rapid, and healthy development [chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] of the national economy. To successfully fulfill the various tasks established by the current session, we must carry out the work in all fields across the country under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line; must comprehensively implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; and must subordinate to and serve the overall interests of seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability; seeing to it that reform, development, and stability coordinate with and promote each other. The session emphasizes: We must steadfastly take economic construction as the central task and shift the focus of economic construction to improving economic efficiency. Agriculture is a major issue having a vital bearing on the overall national economic situation and social stability. Therefore, we must take practical and effective measures to strengthen the role of agriculture as the foundation of national economy -- giving particular attention to the production of grain, cotton, edible oil, meat, sugar, and vegetables; actively assisting the development of village and township enterprises; developing the rural economy in an all-round way; earnestly implementing programs to aid the poor; reducing peasants' burdens; and doing everything possible to increase peasants' incomes. We must go all out to improve the performance of large and medium state-owned enterprises, continuing to change the operating mechanisms of state enterprises, actively carrying out the pilot project for establishing a modern enterprise system, strengthening the internal management of enterprises, building up the vitality and stamina of enterprises for further development, striving to preserve and increase the value of state-owned assets, and bringing into play the role of state enterprises as the mainstay of the national economy. We must strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control, energetically adjust economic structure, maintain a rational investment scale, strictly control commodity price rises, firmly curb inflation, and strive to strike a basic balance between total supply and demand of the national economy. We must open the country wider to the outside world and expand cooperation and exchanges with foreign countries. We must continue to improve the people's livelihood on the basis of economic growth. The session points out: In view of the relatively large number of reform programs to be launched this year, we must make meticulous preparations to ensure the smooth implementation of reform programs. We must take the overall interests into account, correctly handle the relationship between the central and local governments and national and local interests, and harness the enthusiasm of all sectors. We must summarize experiences in good time and properly resolve problems and contradictions cropping up in reform. We must reinforce discipline to ensure strict enforcement of orders and prohibitions. The session urged: We should further strengthen socialist democracy and legal institutions, conscientiously protect citizens' legitimate rights and interests, ensure smooth progress in reform and development, and promote overall social progress. We should redouble our efforts to promote diligent and clean administration, prevent corrupt practices institutionally, and wage a resolute struggle against all kinds of corrupt practices. We should promote the practice of building the country through thrift and hard work, and oppose extravagance and waste. We should continue to carry out in-depth education on the legal system among all citizens so as to heighten the legal sense in all segments of society. Leading cadres at all levels should take the initiative in studying and abiding by the law, strictly enforce the law, and safeguard the dignity of the law. Governments at all levels must learn to manage economic and social affairs through legal means and exercise the reins of governance according to law. Acting in accordance with the law, we should resolutely fight against various criminal activities that seriously jeopardize people's lives and property and hurt modernization, and earnestly exercise comprehensive management over public security. We should maintain and improve the system of autonomy for minority regions, safeguard unity among various nationalities and national unity, and promote common prosperity among various nationalities. We should heighten the national defense awareness of all people and intensify efforts to modernize national defense. The session urged: We should unswervingly uphold the principle of carrying out two tasks simultaneously and paying equal attention to both, and strengthen socialist spiritual civilization. We should arm people across the country with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and strive to nurture a new type of citizen with lofty ideals, moral integrity, better education, and a strong sense of discipline. We should devote great efforts to developing science and technology, education, cultural services, health care, and physical culture; promote the close integration of science and technology with the economy; and do a good job of educational reform and development. We should firmly implement basic national policies on family planning and environmental protection, and exploit and utilize natural resources in a rational way. The session pointed out: We should continue to firmly implement the principles of "peaceful reunification and one country, two systems" while actively advancing the great cause of reunifying the motherland. To ensure the smooth change of governments and smooth transition in Hong Kong and Macao, we should lose no time in making all kinds of preparations for our country's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao on the basis of the "Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China," the "Basic Law of the Macao Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China," and relevant decisions by the NPC and its Standing Committee. Sino- Portuguese cooperation on the Macao issue has proceeded smoothly. The responsibility for the termination of talks between representatives of the Chinese and British Governments on Hong Kong's 1994/95 electoral arrangements rests entirely with the British side. The Preliminary Working Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR] should extensively unify Hong Kong compatriots and make all kinds of preparations for establishing the Hong Kong SAR and the first government and legislative body there in accordance with the "Decision of the National People's Congress on the Method for Forming the First Government and Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region." The Chinese Government and people are determined and able to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on schedule and to maintain Hong Kong's long-term stability and prosperity. We uphold the principle of one China in solving differences between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait through increased contacts and consultation. Realizing the peaceful reunification of the motherland is the common aspiration of all Chinese people, and any attempt at or action of splitting the motherland is useless. We pin our hopes on the Taiwan authorities, especially the Taiwanese people. We hope the Taiwan side will place national interests above everything else and work with us toward developing cross-strait relations and promoting the peaceful reunification of the motherland. The session pointed out: We should steadfastly carry forward the independent foreign policy of peace, resolutely oppose all forms of hegemonism and power politics, and maintain and develop friendly relations and cooperation with other countries on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence. China attaches importance to human rights and is willing to attend discussions on the human rights issue held by the international community on an equal footing. However, it will never allow any individual to interfere in its internal affairs under any pretext. Along with people in other parts of the world, the Chinese people will continue to contribute to establishing a new international political and economic order that is just and rational, to safeguarding world peace, and to promoting common development. The session urged people of all nationalities across the country to work in concert, enthusiastically carry out reform, rely on themselves, carry out arduous pioneering work, and strive for new victory in reform, opening up, and modernization under the CPC's leadership and under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line.
