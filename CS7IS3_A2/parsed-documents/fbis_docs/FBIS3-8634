On this occasion, we asked her to comment on the documents signed in Washington. [Turkovic] They were preliminary agreements on forming a federal Bosnia-Herzegovina and a confederal union of the two sovereign states, the Republic of Croatia and the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The agreement involves calming down the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and not only that: It might eliminate the danger of the definitive collapse of the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina and of creating a precedent that would then definitely also be applied to the Republic of Croatia. [Jelovac] You, therefore, think that signatures of the Croatian and Muslim representatives in Washington saved the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Turkovic] They saved Bosnia-Herzegovina for sure, but partly also Croatia, considering what could happen after a possible division of Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Jelovac] What kind of state will it be? What about the Serbs, who are a constituent nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Turkovic] Bosnia-Herzegovina should be organized as a federation, composed of cantons that would be constituted according to the majority nation, whether Croatian or Bosniak. Naturally, the concept of federation, i.e., of cantonization, is open and offered to the Serbs as well. [Jelovac] With regard to the great interest in central Bosnia, can you tell us which central Bosnian towns will be included in the Croatian canton? [Turkovic] Details of that agreement, primarily the borders, the exact areas of demarcation, will be determined on the basis of an appendix to the agreement. Working groups are supposed to determine that in Vienna in 11 days. We will then know the answer to many questions, all the details on the demarcation of the cantons and their number. After that, on 15 March, President Tudjman and President Izetbegovic are to sign the final agreement on the federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the agreement on the confederation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. [Jelovac] The possible confederation foresees a common currency and borders, and the free flow of people and capital. Will there be a border between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, and will there be customs? [Turkovic] As this will be a customs union, there will be no mutual customs duties. The agreement on confederation would have another two additional agreements that are not proposed in their preliminary form. One of them is the agreement on the free flow of goods through the federation, that is, without customs and inspections on the territory of the federation. That solves a very topical problem for Croatia, which is, in a way, divided by Neum. All citizens of the federation will be granted free access to the Republic of Croatia and free use of roads, railroads, and airline routes. Therefore, the agreement allows better communications, which would be very stimulating for economic relations and it would revitalize the economy and tourism, not to mention the stability of the region. [Jelovac] Still, one cannot deny that Bosnia-Herzegovina was not very developed in former Yugoslavia and that it constantly had to be financially supported. Who will finance it now? [Turkovic] Many indicators which were manipulated before cannot indicate the real situation. Bosnia-Herzegovina can surely finance itself, it can even finance a much wider territory. In view of its potential, its mineral resources, and its great concentration of industry, it has no problems in financing itself. Furthermore, Bosnia-Herzegovina also has the chance to get substantial finances from Western European countries, the United States, emigrees, and the Arab countries. This eastern source was very much exploited in the former system, but it was not widely publicized. [Jelovac] Do you see the future federation as a democratic state since Clinton has announced that he will support the existence of Bosnia-Herzegovina even with military force. [Turkovic] That is a matter of scale and the legality of application of the penal system. If it is used to preserve democracy, then it is very much needed. President Clinton spoke to that effect. In order to preserve peace and protect human rights, which was emphasized in the preliminary agreement, even repressive measures might be taken in Bosnia-Herzegovina, if necessary. All that to preserve what people at this moment very much need--freedom, full democracy, and human rights. [Jelovac] If the U.S. initiative forces Croatia to compromise, that is, to accept confederation with Bosnia-Herzegovina, does that mean that Alija Izetbegovic relinquishes the concept of a unitary Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Turkovic] All solutions, especially those in military conflicts, are compromises. Therefore, this solution is somewhere between the interests of the two sides. It is necessary to compromise in order to have peace, normalize relations, and save human lives, which should be our first goal. The U.S. formula is ideal: It enables the preservation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, very substantial rights, and the national identities in this case of two nations, and it also gives a chance to the third one within the framework of the proposed federation. [Jelovac] How do you interpret the return of Russia to the Balkans, and especially to Bosnia-Herzegovina, in view of the open support that it is giving to the Bosnian Serbs? [Turkovic] It is no secret, it is quite clear and quite logical. However, the support can be interpreted in different ways. Someone's patronage can be directed in a positive sense, toward bringing people to their senses. It can also be in a negative context, in the sense of creating irrational illusions about domination and power. At this moment, we see the role of Russia as positive. Russia is obviously having a realistic and rational influence on the Serbs, who probably had illusions about much greater protection, which would unquestioningly protect everything Serbian regardless of reality and the irrationality of the demands. The latest meeting between Karadzic and Kosyrev, which resulted in the Serbs agreeing to reopen Tuzla airport, proves that. So does Karadzic's acceptance of the federation between the Bosniaks and the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and also his openness to finding ways for the Serbs to accept the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation as well. That will not be easy but we must begin somewhere. [Jelovac] The first reactions of the Bosnian Serbs to the Washington agreement called it "an internal matter between the Croats and the Muslims." Judging from the statements of Western officials who do not directly mention the Serbs, the third constituent nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, one gets the impression that the Serbs are even being given the possibility to leave Bosnia- Herzegovina and join the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]. Anyway, Karadzic's main political goal is the unification "of all Serbian lands." What will happen to the Serbs, will they stay in Bosnia-Herzegovina or will they leave? [Turkovic] At this moment, there are different interpretations of the situation. There are external elements that must not be neglected, for they can be crucial. It would be naive to believe that the destiny of the Balkans and Bosnia-Herzegovina exclusively depends upon their inhabitants. There are, of course, much wider strategic interests that have always determined the outcome of conflicts in these parts. [Jelovac] You think that, therefore, the state of Bosnia- Herzegovina will not be able to prevent the possible decision by the Bosnian Serbs to join their native Serbia, if they are not stopped by the appropriate international factors? [Turkovic] If these international factors were in favor of the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina, then such agreements would not be signed. But, even if the international community were intent on dividing Bosnia-Herzegovina, it is questionable whether this could be done. In this case, the situation is just the opposite: We have the very firm stance of the international community and the United States to preserve Bosnia-Herzegovina as an integral country, territorially speaking. That is a factor that the Serbs, too, will have to face and accept the solution. Naturally, not a solution necessarily at their expense, but a solution that is a compromise and departure from their absolute demands. The Serbs will have to come to terms with that. [Jelovac] If the Serbs stay in Bosnia-Herzegovina, what will their relationship be with the Croat-Bosniak federation and the confederation of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina? What will their relations be with their native Serbia? Would it not be a restoration of Yugoslavia, with only the Macedonians and the Slovenes missing? [Turkovic] I would not like to attempt to solve this issue now; we must first see the final shape of the agreement on creating the federation and confederation. There will surely be a role for the Serbs as well, respecting their identity, of course. They will then be proposed a role. [Jelovac] You recently appeared on Croatian Television and, speaking about the ethnic Serbs, you stated: "We will see to what extent the Serbs will remain in Bosnia-Herzegovina." What does that mean, does it mean the Serbs will leave, and where will they go and what will they take along? Bundles or the territory they hold? [Turkovic] You know, all those who cannot fit into a certain framework usually leave certain areas and go somewhere else. With regard to the Serbs, we must say that, unfortunately, a large number of them have blood on their hands as they have committed terrible crimes. Those people, even if there were forgiven, and we should not forgive anyone, will surely not stay where they lived before. They will go somewhere. But many who were misled will stay, for we cannot and must not blame the entire nation for crimes committed by a gang of terrorists that received support from a sizable part of their nation. That is the reality. [Jelovac] Which part of the Bosnia-Herzegovina territory would you give to the Serbs to be annexed to Serbia? [Turkovic] Not a single part. [Jelovac] How do you imagine that 70 percent of the territory will be given back? Through diplomacy and negotiations or through the war option, together with the Croats when they and the Serbs normalize relations? [Turkovic] Greater Serbia is not created only in Belgrade. It does not depend on the Serbs alone. The creation of greater Serbia also largely depends on both the Croats and the Bosniaks. If Croatia agrees to negotiate to divide Bosnia-Herzegovina with the Serbs, then it is creating greater Serbia at the same time. Not only at the expense of Bosnia-Herzegovina, but also at its own. With the unity of the two nations in Bosnia-Herzegovina and with the support of neighboring Croatia, the cause of the problem is slowly coming to the surface. When you have a clearly identified enemy and perpetrator of the aggression, then it is easy to apply punishment and get support for the punishment. [Jelovac] By military means? [Turkovic] We will see about that. It is not only up to us to use those means.
