SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Authority: National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;538, 106 Stat. 3533 (1992) (codified at 47 U.S.C. 901 et seq. ) I. Introduction1 1. The United States has a long-standing commitment to the achievement of ``universal service''_widespread availability of ``basic'' telephone service at affordable rates. First articulated in the early twentieth century,2 universal service has since been adopted by Federal and State regulators as one of the core objectives of U.S. telecommunications policy. For example, it was incorporated in general terms in Section 1 of the Communications Act of 1934.3 More importantly, many of the major regulatory reforms that have been considered over the past several decades_most notably decisions concerning whether and under what conditions to allow competition in telecommunications service and equipment markets_have been evaluated, at least in part, in terms of their possible impact on universal service. 1 This Notice of Inquiry (Notice) and other related documents are also available in electronic form on the NTIA Bulletin Board at (202) 482&hyph;1199. Please set your communications parameters to No parity, 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (N,8,1). Commenters are encouraged to file their comments electronically at the same number. 2The concept was first articulated by Theodore Vail, President of AT&T, in 1907, although his concept of universal service was quite distinct from modern notions of what that term means. See Milton Mueller, Universal Service in Telephone History, 17 Tel. Pol. 352, 353, 356&hyph;358 (1993). 3Section 1 authorizes the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) to regulate interstate and foreign communications ``so as to make available, so far as possible, to all the people of the United States a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and world-wide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.'' 47 U.S.C. 151 (1988). Telecommunications reform legislation pending in both Houses of Congress would make preservation and advancement of universal service an explicit goal of U.S. policy. See S. 1822, the Communications Act of 1934, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. Sections 101, 102 (1994); H.R. 3626, the Antitrust and Communications Reform Act of 1994, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. §301 (1994). 2. Historically, universal service has meant widespread access to voice-grade telephone service, commonly referred to as ``plain old telephone service'' (POTS). The fundamental objective has been to give all Americans an opportunity to pick up the telephone and, at a reasonable cost, have a voice conversation with anyone else in the country or, increasingly, the world. In recent years, however, many have questioned whether traditional notions of universal service are adequate to meet the needs of the American people, now and in the 21st century.
