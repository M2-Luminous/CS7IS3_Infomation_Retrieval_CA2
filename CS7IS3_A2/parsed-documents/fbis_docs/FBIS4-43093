The Greek position was outlined by Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, who has returned from Istanbul. On the possibility of a Papandreou-Ciller meeting, Athens will discuss it only if a good climate is created in the two countries' relations. Our correspondent Foivos Karzis has the following report: [Begin recording] [Karzis] Greece has the right to defend its sovereign rights. This is Athens' reply to the interventions by partners and allies in Greek-Turkish relations. A Papandreou-Ciller meeting is possible only if there is enough improvement in the bilateral climate. Mr. Papoulias was categorical when he commented today on the statement made by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher yesterday. [Papoulias] I will repeat what I have told Mr. Christopher. Of course, what Mr. Christopher said I will convey to the prime minister. This is natural. However, regarding my response to Mr. Christopher -- first, that it is a matter of Greek-Turkish relations; second, if Turkish aircraft did not violate our airspace the problem would not exist; and third, I added that it is Greece's sovereign right to defend its national sovereign rights. [Karzis] German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel also called for a detente in the Greek-Turkish crisis but he avoided taking sides. [passage omitted] [Karzis] However, the Papoulias-Cetin meeting yesterday seems to be creating a prerequisite for detente. [Papoulias] As I also said yesterday, this would be desirable so long as a different climate is created;, we also agreed with Mr. Cetin that the tone of the rhetoric should be lowered, that we must try to developed a different climate in the Greek-Turkish relations. Of course, the culmination of this course would be a possible Ciller-Papandreou meeting. [Karzis] The foreign minister was also clear about Greece's position on the Bosporus straits [Istanbul Bogazi] as Turkey is trying to create obstacles in the free passage of ships. Mr. Papoulias said: Greece insists on the principle of free navigation in the straits. [end recording] The Greek foreign minister arrived in Ioannina a short time ago where he discussed in more detail his contacts in Istanbul. Our correspondent Yeoryios Kirousis has the following report: [Begin recording] [Papoulias] Greek-Turkish relations need a different climate that would lead us to more stable relations with Turkey. [Kirousis] Upon his return to Ioannina from Istanbul this evening, Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias expressed the hope that Greek-Turkish relations would enter a more stable climate. The Greek foreign minister also discussed the Patriarchate's security in Turkey. [Papoulias] The meetings I had were a very good opportunity to raise the Patriarchate issue. These meetings were very important, and I asked all my interlocutors to do what is proper for the Patriarchate's security. [Unidentified correspondent] What about the Cyprus issue? [Papoulias] I think that my most important statement in Istanbul was that of the confidence-building measures having died because of Rauf Denktas' behavior as well as because of Ankara's tolerance. [Kirousis] Referring to his meeting in Turkey with his Albanian counterpart Alfred Serreqi, Mr. Papoulias stressed that Albania's policy with regard to European integration is neglecting respect for human rights and international rules of behavior. Mr. Papoulias said: Greece wants good relations with Albania but the neighboring country should also have the same intentions. [Papoulias] I repeated to Mr. Serreqi once again that our desire is to have good relations with Albania. However, it depends on the Albanian Government's behavior, on respect for the rights of the Greek minority, and on the abandoning of a fruitless and provocative policy which has been followed until now with regard to the Greek minority in Albania.
