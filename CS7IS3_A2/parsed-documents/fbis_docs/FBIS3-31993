He is reportedly being influenced by the local military leadership who has been purportedly left out by the "Yankees," who fear the Paraguayan military will mistakenly get the credit for the work. Sources contacted yesterday said that Wasmosy met with members of the Permanent Commission of Congress, who were asked to reject the U.S. Government offer because it will result in a national political-military dispute that can be avoided by rejecting the offer. Several deputies held negotiations yesterday to avert the loss of important aid because of squabbles among national political sectors. To get the offer rejected, Wasmosy reportedly met members of the Permanent Commission of Congress at the presidential residence to ask them for their "support." Congressional sources have told NOTICIAS that Wasmosy asked the legislators to reject U.S. Ambassador Jon Glassman's offer because of the privileges the Americans want to build these installations. The same sources added that Wasmosy is refusing the offer in view of a political-military problem which arose because the U.S. Embassy demands that no Paraguayan military be involved in the project. According to these sources, Wasmosy already gave his approval to Glassman at the beginning of January, but the president changed his mind after consulting the military commanders. It has been learned that the president is looking for a dignified way out. In view of this, he is meeting legislators so that Congress, not he, will "supposedly" be the one to reject the offer. The same sources added that the problem is that the Paraguayan Army has already promised "to build one school per year." It has been learned that legislators are studying the issue closely because the Paraguayan military law does not allow the Armed Forces to discredit politicians by committing themselves to build schools. Moreover, they said, this is not an Armed Forces task. The 14-point agreement to be signed by the two governments establishes that the U.S. contingent will be relieved of some chores. Moreover, it will be provided with transportation. The agreement specifies that all privileges will apply only for the fulfillment of the mission. Deputy Blas Llano was among those who, led by Congressional Permanent Commission Chairman Juan Carlos Ramirez Montalbetti, attended the meeting with Wasmosy on 26 January. Yesterday he paid a suspicious visit to the U.S. Embassy. Asked if he discussed the issue of the arrival of the American contingent, he answered yes. He added that consultations were being conducted to avoid losing the donation. Llano said: "I am only obtaining information to see how we can obtain this aid." The U.S. Government has offered to build one health center, eight schools in rural areas, eight wells with raised water tanks, the corresponding plumbing and pumps, and to repair the roads leading to the construction sites. The United States wants only the Public Works Ministry involved in the project. The project -- named "Strong Roads 1994-South" -- will be carried out by the U.S. Southern Command Task Force unit that is stationed in Panama. It will be held between 16 May and 15 September. In exchange for the works, the United States will conduct long- range deployment exercises. The agreement to be signed the U.S. Embassy specifies that the soldiers will not use heavy artillery or armored vehicles but that they will carry pistols. The installations will be built in Santa Lucia, San Salvador, Santa Clara, San Francisco, Libertad and the city of "6 de Enero" in San Pedro department. Deputy Euclides Acevedo (National Encounter Alliance), first vice president of the Chamber of Deputies, said yesterday that only a joint session of Congress may authorize or reject a U.S. Government offer. However, he said that Congress is displeased over the arrival of the U.S. military contingent "because we have our own Armed Forces." Acevedo added that he lacks sufficient information on the U.S. Government offer but stated he is not in favor of Congress authorizing U.S. military forces to build schools in Paraguay. He said: "In principle, I do not fully agree with it. This is a sovereign country with its own Armed Forces. They should clearly specify the true objective of this trip because I do not see what the U.S. Armed Forces have to do with building schools in Paraguay." Asked if he approves Army Commander Lino Cesar Oviedo's commitment to build "one school per year," Acevedo merely said that "the entire issue will be studied" in Congress.
