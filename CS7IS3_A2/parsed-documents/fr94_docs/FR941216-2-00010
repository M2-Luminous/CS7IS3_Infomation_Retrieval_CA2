FR941216-2-00010 FR941216-2-00005 In determining which surrogate value to use for each factor of production that was not sourced from a market-economy country, we selected, where possible, from publicly available, published information that is: (1) an average non-export value; (2) representative of a range of prices within the POI if submitted by an interested party, or most contemporaneous with the POI; (3) product-specific; and (4) tax-exclusive. With the exception of corn cobs and furfuryl, we used Indonesian import prices taken from the Indonesian Foreign Trade Statistical Bulletin_Imports, November 1993. For furfuryl and corn cobs, we relied on a December 5, 1994, U.S. State Department cable from the U.S. Embassy in Indonesia. We were unable to find public information on corn cobs. In the case of furfuryl, the publicly available data that we found was inconsistent ( see attachment three of the concurrence memorandum to this proceeding). We used Indonesian transportation rates taken from a September 18, 1991, U.S. State Department cable from the U.S. Embassy in Indonesia to value inland freight between the source of the production factor and the furfuryl alcohol factories. In those cases where the respondent failed to provide any information on transportation distances and modes, we applied, as the best information available, the furthest distance and the more expensive mode of transport available from the surrogate information we had selected. To value electricity, we used public information from Electric Utilities Data Book for the Asian and Pacific Region, (January 1993) published by the Asian Development Bank. For other energy inputs, we relied on values for Indonesia published in Energy DÃ©tente, and Indonesian Foreign Trade Statistical Bulletin_Imports, November 1993. To value labor amounts, we used labor rates published by the Bureau of International Labor Affairs, U.S. Department of Labor, in Foreign Labor Trends_Indonesia, 1994. We adjusted the factor values, when necessary, to the POI using wholesale price and consumer price indices published by the International Monetary Fund. To value factory overhead, we calculated percentages specific to the furfuryl alcohol industry based on a December 2, 1994, U.S. State Department cable from the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta. For general expense percentages, we used the statutory minimum of 10 percent of materials, labor, and overhead costs calculated for each factory. For profit we used the statutory minimum of eight percent of materials, labor, factory overhead, and general expenses. We did not have Indonesian values for either general expenses or profit. We added packing based on Indonesian values obtained from a December 2, 1994 U.S. State Department cable from the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta. All Other Rate MOFTEC and CCCMMC have identified two PRC exporters of furfuryl alcohol to the United States during the POI. Both have responded in this investigation. Accordingly, we have based the All Other Rate on the weighted average of the margins calculated in this proceeding.
