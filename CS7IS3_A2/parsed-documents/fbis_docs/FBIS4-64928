In the period leading up to the Folketing election, the Radical Liberals are busy deciding who they will consider working with after the election and who will feel the Radical sting. All through the past decade, the Radical Liberals have grown used to the circumstance that governments could not be formed without them. The mere idea that there could be a government that would not be dependent upon the Radical Liberal adaptability is reason enough for Marianne Jelved to want to test her might. Were the Liberals and Conservatives to receive a majority that included the Progress Party, Jelved would be hard as nails. Under no circumstances would her party support the Liberal-Conservatives on those issues the Progress Party would have no part of. It is not immediately evident why Jelved suddenly has so much against her old coalition partners in the Progress Party. No doubt she is recalling Niels Helveg Petersen's well-considered words to the effect that he would rather drop below the number needed for representation in parliament than work with the Progress Party. After the 1989 budget agreement, the Radical Liberals and the Progress bunch were slapping each other on the back. For the first time, the Progress Party had voted for a budget, while the Radical Liberals repeatedly declared that the important thing in politics was what you got done, not who you did it with. Just 10 days ago Jelved wrote an article in which she stated that "The Radical Liberals have a clear policy that we strive to implement whenever we can." But now that clear policy has been turned over to expose a muddier underside. The Radical Liberals can no longer turn their backs on whatever they feel like under the respectable guise of cooperation or influence, as Jelved formulated it this weekend. Before righteous indignation obscures her vision, Jelved needs to remember how with a single-seat majority, she and her party helped to ram through an extensive tax reform. At that time, there was no fault to be found in bloc politics even in its most blatant form. Why, then, have moral fits when another majority in the Folketing gets the same opportunity -- and uses it? Three years ago, the Radical Liberals went to the polls depending upon the Liberals and Conservatives' continuation in power. Now Jelved has said that she will make life difficult for those very parties should they come to power after the election. But perhaps the Radical Liberals are merely preparing to change sides again. Indeed, that must be it. The government has a strategy meeting at Toruplund today and tomorrow. The Radical Liberals cannot "decently" -- if that term is recognized by the party -- say such a thing publicly at this point. So why not froth at the mouth over the old coalition partners, the better to camouflage your future plans.
