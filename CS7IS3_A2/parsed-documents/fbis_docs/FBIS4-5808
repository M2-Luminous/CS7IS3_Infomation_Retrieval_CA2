Japanese financial market sources expressed surprise at reports out of Frankfurt on the rate cut, but said the scale is small and unlikely to affect foreign exchanges. In Frankfurt, the German central bank announced it will slash its discount rate to 5.00 percent from 5.25 percent per annum, and the Lombard rate to 6.50 percent from 6.75 percent per annum, effective from Friday.
