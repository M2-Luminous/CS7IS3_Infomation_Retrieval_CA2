The plan was drawn up by the State Environment Protection Agency (EPA), the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Forestry, other ministries and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It is the first national bio-diversity protection plan aided by the Global Environment Fund. Bio-diversity, including animals, plants and micro-organisms, refers to ecosystem diversity, species diversity and genetic diversity. Xie Zhenhua, director-general of EPA, said that sustainable development is at the core of China's strategy to conserve bio-diversity. The strategy -- a sustainable use of living things and a guarantee of a healthy cycle for the ecosystem -- is expected to help create sound material and environmental conditions for a sustainable development of the national economy and the whole society. He said that China would soon take some specific measures to ensure the fulfilment of the overall bio-diversity protection plan. China would first decide which places and species need the most urgent protection, set up a monitoring system and information centers on bio-diversity, launch experimental projects to return artificially-bred species to nature, introduce a bio-diversity appraisal system, establish special funds for bio-diversity protection and expand international cooperation in this sphere. Song Jian, state councillor and minister of the State Science and Technology Commission, noted that currently bio-diversity is seriously endangered by cutting and burning trees on a large scale, improperly reclaiming grasslands and wetlands, over-hunting of wild animals and over-gathering of wild plants, inappropriate use of pesticides, destructive fishing and environmental pollution. "Bio-diversity has become a priority global environmental issue and the loss of bio-diversity is threatening people's life and development," he warned. He said China is one of the dozen "mega-diversity" countries in the world. It has some 2,340 kinds of land vertebrates, or 10 percent of the world's total, and more than 300,000 species of flora, which ranks it third in the world. "In view of these facts, bio-diversity conservation in China is of great international significance," Song stressed. The Chinese Government has been consistent in its efforts to protect the eco-environment while developing its economy and eliminating poverty, he said. He added that the newly-launched action plan, a set of guidelines for bio-diversity conservation throughout China, will prove to be of great value in getting the whole of society to conserve the unique, rich and varied bio-diversity of China. Xie said that the painstaking efforts made by the departments involved have begun to yield results. He recalled that China has since 1956 established more than 760 nature reserves, and the protected area now amounts to 6.8 percent of the country's entire territory. He also said that China now has 110 botanical gardens, over 40 zoos, 26 breeding centers for endangered animals and more than 230 farms for rare and precious animals. Today's conference to launch the bio-diversity action plan for China was attended by more than 400 government officials, experts, foreign ambassadors to China and representatives from the U.N. Development Program, the U.N. Environment Program and the World Bank.
