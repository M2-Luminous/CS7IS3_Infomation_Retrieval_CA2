FBIS4-10310 "drlat069_c_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-069 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 MEXICO Authorities Release One Suspect Authorities Release One Suspect PA1104042294 Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0229 GMT 11 Apr 94 PA1104042294 Mexico City NOTIMEX Spanish BFN [Excerpt] Mexico City, 10 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- The Special Assistant Prosecutor's Office in charge of clearing up the murder of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio reported today that one of the suspects in the case was released with reservations and that formal jail warrants were issued for two others. The Attorney General's Office of the Republic (PGR) added that Jose Rodolfo Rivapalacio Tinajero was released under "legal reservations," due to lack of evidence of his participation in Colosio's murder, which took place on 23 March. In an official communique, the PGR added that formal jail warrants were issued for Rodolfo Mayoral Esquer and Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela, as being probably responsible in the murder, to the degree of co-participants as aides or accessories to the crime. The Mayorals, father and son, were acquitted on charges of criminal association due to a lack of evidence; nevertheless, if new evidence is found the case could be reopened for the same crime. Included in this case are Tranquilino Sanchez Vanegas and Mario Aburto Martinez, perpetrators of the crime that took place in Tijuana, Baja California State, in northwestern Mexico. The four individuals remain incarcerated in the Almoloya Penitentiary in the State of Mexico, 90 km from this capital where they are to be processed. In the Rivapalacio Tinajero case, the Attorney General's Office made him responsible for incorporating Tranquilino Sanchez Vanegas, Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela, and Rodolfo Mayoral Esquer into the group he organized, apparently to keep order during the Lomas Taurinas political event.
