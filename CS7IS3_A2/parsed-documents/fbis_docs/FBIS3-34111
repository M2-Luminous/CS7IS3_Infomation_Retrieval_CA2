The brother president made a speech, in which he expressed happiness to share with the brother officers, noncommissioned officers, and troops their celebration of the divisions's founding anniversary. He praised the role played by the members of the 1st Armored Division in defending the revolution since the Division was formed as a first battalion in the Armored Corps in 1967. The struggler of the Division fought bravely to defend the revolution and the Republican regime after pledging to God, the homeland, and the revolution to champion the will of the people and their aspirations for a better life. They, along with their brothers the members of the Armed Forces, were heroes in the 70-day epic when they defended Sanaa against the conspiracies of the mercenaries and the enemies of the Republican regime. The brother chairman said: We are confident that our Armed Forces, which defended the Republican regime and made precious sacrifices, will offer more sacrifices in the defense of national and Yemeni unity and will fight anyone who entertains the idea of harming the people's great achievement. The Armed Forces will also firmly oppose all elements that try to harm the great achievement made on 22 May 1990 -- an irreversible achievement for all the Yemeni people that cannot be relinquished. Addressing troops, noncommissioned officers, and officers, he said: You should be armed with national awareness and vigilance to perform your national duties in defending the people's gains, primarily unity and democracy. Your potent weapon is not armored vehicles or equipment or supplies, but your faith in God and the homeland, the revolution and unity. We are confident that our Armed Forces in al-Mahrah, Sa'dah, Shabwah, Hadramaut, Ta'izz, Ibb, Abyan, Lahd, al-Hudaydah, Ma'rib, and any governorate in the republic, will be with the homeland and the people and will never be a pliable tool in the hands of any element or party that wants to harm the homeland, its unity, and democratic approach. Also, they will not allow the forces that are hostile to the revolution, unity, and democracy to achieve their aims or set the clock back. History has a bright record of our Armed Forces and its valiant men. At this important juncture in the life of our homeland, history will only record a bright chapter about the sacrifices of our Armed Forces and their firm support for the people's choices and their championing of its causes and constants, foremost of which is safeguarding unity and democracy. The annals of history will only include the names of sincere people who are faithful to their principles and who make sacrifices for these principles. History will not include the names of indecisive, weak characters who have no principles. The brother chairman added: Unity was achieved by a peaceful, democratic means. It made Yemen a giant in front of the world. It is unacceptable that whims and personal interests should gain the upper hand and harm this achievement. We should be more mature in our conduct and thinking in light of this great event and the changes yielded by our new situation. I am fully confident that all the heroes of our Armed Forces will be the shield of unity and will fight relentlessly all those who urge division and all forms of regional, parochial, and racial affiliations. We are a Yemeni, Arab, and Muslim people whose loyalty is to God, the homeland, the revolution, and unity.
