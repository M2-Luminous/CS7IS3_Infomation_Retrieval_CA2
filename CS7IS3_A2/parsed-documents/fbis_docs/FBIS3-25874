This action by our compatriots is something we should be alert to. The Chiao-Tang talks between the two organizations will be held soon. On the eve of the talks MAC Vice Chairman Kao Kung-lien said his group considered the meeting a routine one to discuss low-level and economic matters and he did not expect much from it. [Begin Kao recording] The SEF and the ARATS will soon hold a five-day meeting in Beijing. The meeting will mainly discuss routine and economic matters. Meanwhile, we hope the two sides can further exchange views on problems and obstacles faced by the meeting. [end recording] Vice Chairman Kao Kung-lien also made a statement in the light of Communist China's current policy toward Taiwan. He said: Following the Ku-Wang meeting, Communist China has repeatedly said that the era of using dialogue to solve disputes has come; however, Communist China's hostility against us has not lessened. According to MAC's understanding, Communist China has adopted dual tactics in dealing with Taiwan. On the one hand it uses its open policy in economic affairs to attract Taiwan businessmen and absorb capital from Taiwan, on the other hand it has begun acting without commenting on its military preparations for aggression [qin lue] against Taiwan. [Begin Kao recording] They have realized that the work of peaceful reunification cannot be accomplished quickly, but they have also stressed that the matter must not be delayed and have called for a sense of urgency. Their inner circle [nei pu], therefore, has repeatedly threatened to maintain its military menace toward Taiwan. In order to stop this threat causing Taiwan businessmen to hesitate or shift funds to other places, they have also stressed that preparations for a military struggle [chun shih tou cheng] should be extremely calm and collected [pu tung sheng se], be solid, and done without saying anything. [end recording] Vice Chairman Kao Kung-lien emphatically pointed out that it was precisely because of Communist China's hard line attitude that exchanges between the two sides of the strait should continue to be conducted prudently.
