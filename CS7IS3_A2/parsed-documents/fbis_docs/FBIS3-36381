All these major events took place beyond Russia's boundaries but were very closely linked to the Russian domestic political life, Itogi host Yevgeniy Kiselev said. The bloodiest tragedy of the civil war occurred in Bosnia last week, where an explosion in the market place in Sarajevo killed 68 people and injured nearly 200. According to Kiselev, the event prompts an association with the tragic shot in Sarajevo in 1914, which triggered off the first world war. The attitude of the world community to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia began to change radically lately, Itogi said. Calls to lift the blockade of Sarajevo, besieged by the Serbs, are becoming increasingly frequent, as well as calls to use armed forces for the purpose. But some experts believe that the use of the military could make the knot of the conflict still tighter. Extremists are seeking to goad politicians into making ill- considered decisions, Kiselev said. The Russian Foreign Ministry expressed its indignation at the act of terror in Sarajevo, Itogi said. The ministry said in a statement that a prompt and impartial investigation should be conducted immediately and those guilty should be punished exemplarily, regardless of who they are. Within the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Russian- Georgian summit was undoubtedly the key event, Itogi said. According to the ITV correspondent, who covered Boris Yeltsin's trip to Tbilisi, it was "a strange visit", whose high-sounding declarations left unanswered the key question about Russia's strategy in the Caucasus. ITV experts and presidential council members Emil Pain and Andrannik Migranyan commented on the visit. The upshot of their comments was summed up by Kiselev as follows: Many specialists view the visit as Yeltsin's desire to extend personal support to Eduard Shevardnadze. During Yeltsin's visit to Tbilisi, twenty-five documents were signed. Of prime importance was the Treaty of Friendship, Goodneighourliness and Mutual Assistance, the significance of which was seen in different light by various political parties. According to Sergey Shakhray, the preservation of the Georgian state's integrity met Russia's strategic interests. But Shakhray pointed out that the flame of the civil war in Georgia could be extinguished only through the recognition of the federal character of Georgia and the granting of more autonomy to Abkhazia, Ajaria and Ossetia. Russian nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy criticised the treaty caustically. "We do not have such a state as Georgia," he said straightforwardly. Russia's Choice Chairman Yegor Gaydar expressed concern over the transfer of Russian arms to Georgia. He said these weapons could be used to bolster the internal strife. Communist Party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov said this document "can destabilise the situation in the entire Caucasus". According to Pavel Felkengauer, an analyst for the newspaper SEVODNYA, "Russia is more and more getting involved in conflicts which it is unable to resolve. Russia's policy in the region is undergoing continuous changes. Russia does not have a well- thought-out military political conceptual framework for its actions in the Caucasus." The presidential elections in the Crimea, another major event last week, brought to power as the Crimean republic's first president a pro-Russian nationalist Yuriy Meshkov. The electoral campaign on the Crimean peninsula was accompanied by "an unprecedented wave of crime," Kiselev said. Yuriy Meshkov said in an interview directly after the results of the elections became known, that one of his first steps would be to sign a trade and economic agreement with Russia and to work towards a qualitative improvement of relations with Ukraine. According to some experts, the results of the elections in the Crimea have raised a question about the preservation of Ukraine's territorial integrity and have posed a threat of disintegration which can provoke a conflict on an unprecedented scale. Chairman of the Ukrainian Popular Movement Vyacheslav Chernobyl declared that Ukraine "should not have permitted the presidential elections in the Crimea. Former Ukrainian Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma said "neither Moscow nor Kiev has any reason for playing the Crimean card. Because any dispute between Ukraine and Russia over the Crimea would be tantamount to the greatest tragedy". A public opinion survey has revealed that 58 per cent of those polled reject the possibility of a Russian-Ukainian conflict over the Crimea, Itogi reported. Nonetheless, "The tension is likely to increase in the triangle Moscow-Kiev-Simferopol because of the growing nationalist tendencies in the Crimea, Ukraine and Russia. Itogi interviewed Stanislav Shushkevich, the Belarusian leader who was sacked by the parliament but said he did not intend to leave the political arena. He said he pinned all his hopes on the new elections. As concerns relations with Russia, he said the parity of prices, above all those of energy resources, was one of the chief aspects. "We are spending 14 per cent of our budget to clean up the effects of the Chernobyl tragedy, while Russia is spending a mere 0.5 per cent. This is not quite fair, if you see what I mean", Shushkevich said. Itogi reported on Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's trip to the former Yugoslavia, during which he advocated the establishment of the East- European community of all Slav peoples. Voskresenye reported the celebrations of the 90th birthday of outstanding Russian test pilot Valeriy Chkalov, remembered in Russia and the United States. One of his colleagues, Colonel-General Baydukov recalled their flight across the North Pole to the United States in the thirties. Russia's chief prosecutor Anatoliy Kazannik appeared on Voskresenye to talk about his recent visit to the Lefortovo prison, where he met Ruslan Khasbulatov and others. "I felt terribly sorry for these people," Kazannik said.
