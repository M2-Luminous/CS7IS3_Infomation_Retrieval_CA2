FR940223-0-00026 FR940223-0-00015 20 CFR Parts 404 and 416 [Regulations Nos. 4 and 16] RIN 0960&hyph;AD12 Reopening Determinations and Decisions AGENCY: Social Security Administration, HHS. ACTION: Final rules. SUMMARY: These final rules revise our regulations to clarify the longstanding policy of the Social Security Administration (SSA) that the Agency on its own initiative, as well as at the request of any person claiming a right under the Social Security or supplemental security income (SSI) programs, may reopen and revise a final administrative determination or decision. EFFECTIVE DATE: The final regulations are effective February 23, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Henry D. Lerner, Legal Assistant, Office of Regulations, Social Security Administration, 6401 Security Blvd., Baltimore, MD 21235, (410) 965&hyph;1762. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: We are revising §§404.987 and 416.1487 of our regulations to clarify that we may reopen and revise a final administrative determination or decision either on our own initiative or at the request of a person who was a party to the determination or decision. Prior to August 5, 1980, our regulations expressly provided that we had the discretion to reopen and revise a final determination or decision, including a final revised determination or decision, either on our own motion or upon the request of any party to the determination or decision. See 20 CFR 404.956, 404.957, 416.1475 and 416.1477 (1980). On August 5, 1980, however, we published, pursuant to the notice of proposed rulemaking procedures, final regulations which reorganized and restated in simpler language our rules on the administrative review process, including our rules for reopening and revising final determinations and decisions. This recodification was undertaken as part of a Department-wide effort to make the rules clearer and easier for the public to use and understand (45 FR 52078, August 5, 1980). Our existing regulations on the procedures for reopening and revising a determination or decision were a part of the recodification that was published and became effective on August 5, 1980. Although no substantive changes were intended with regard to the authority to reopen on our own initiative, the regulations, as recodified, have been read by some to permit reopening and revision of a final determination or decision only when the beneficiary or claimant requests reopening. With respect to the reopening and the revising of a final determination or decision, §§404.987 and 416.1487 of our existing regulations state that ``[y]ou may ask that a determination or a decision to which you were a party be revised.'' These sections have created some confusion and have been read by some courts to mean that we may not reopen and revise a final determination or decision on our own initiative. The final rules eliminate the ambiguity that exists in our regulations regarding our authority to reopen and revise a final determination or decision on our own initiative. The final rules revise §§404.987 and 416.1487 to state explicitly that we may reopen a determination or decision that has become final on our own initiative or at the request of an individual who was a party to the determination or decision.
