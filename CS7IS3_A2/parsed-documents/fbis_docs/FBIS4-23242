The PDCI will not withdraw the right to vote of "people who, since 1945, have been voting in Cote d'Ivoire", said Laurent Dona Fologo at a rally in support of President Henri Konan Bedie, who came to power after the death of President Felix Houphouet-Boigny on 7 December in Yamoussoukro, central Cote d'Ivoire. The rally was organized at the weekend in Bassam (43 km east of Abidjan). "There is no question about that. It must be clear to everybody," added Fologo, minister of state in charge of national integration in the first post-Houphouet government. "[Word indistinct] and clear that those who are qualified to vote must vote," the PDCI general secretary concluded. The PDCI has the majority in the Ivorian parliament.
