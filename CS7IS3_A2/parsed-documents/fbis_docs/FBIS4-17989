"Not a single former USSR state, including Russia, has legally demarcated frontiers with China," Nazarbayev stressed. In his opinion, the bilateral accords on transport give Kazakhstan access to all Chinese provinces and to Central Asia. He spoke highly of his talks with Li Peng on global issues, on the situation in CIS, and on Kazakh-Chinese relations. He called fruitful the exchange of reform-making experience, which has, as he put it, an Asian flavor. Nazarbayev was pleased with Li Peng's support of his initiatives to build up trust and set up a common market in Asia.
