Geheyan Hydropower Station will be composed of four 300MW generators. Installation of the No. 2 generator began on 5 April 1993, and assembly of the entire generator and static debugging were completed on 19 November 1993. The trial operation was successful on the first attempt and its maximum load reached 300MW. During the process of installing the No. 2 generator, the engineering and technical personnel created another new record in China's large water turbine generator installation and debugging: they took just 38 days to install the rotor of the No. 2 generator, 53 days less than No. 1. They took just nine days from full water debugging to the first connection to the grid, one day faster than the No. 1 generator which attained an advanced international level. After the No. 1 generator was placed into operation and began generating power ahead of schedule on 4 June 1993, they took only one-half year for the No. 2 generator to begin generating power ahead of schedule, which was 6 months and 29 days ahead of the original design power generation construction schedule.
