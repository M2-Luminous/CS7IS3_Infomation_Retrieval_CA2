"What was signed with one hand cannot be erased with the other." In December 1993, 117 countries -- including the United States and Argentina -- reached an agreement for the protection of intellectual property rights within the framework of the Uruguay Round of GATT talks, which included the issue of medicine patents. This agreement, for which both our country and your country have actively worked, sets precise international medicine patent norms. Consequently, we do not understand the reason for the continued threat of commercial sanctions and preconditions for joining NAFTA, under the pressure some U.S. PMA [Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association] laboratories are exerting, ignoring the agreement the two governments have signed. The pharmaceutical laboratories with Argentine capital have repeatedly and unsuccessfully tried to meet in your country with the pharmaceutical industry (PMA) and the U.S. trade representative to help find a reasonable solution to this problem, but we never got any answer. Despite the fact that the GATT agreement does not fully reflect our interests and position, we accept it and respect it. We ask you to request a similar attitude from your pharmaceutical industry, which is represented by the PMA, respecting the decision made by the international community.
