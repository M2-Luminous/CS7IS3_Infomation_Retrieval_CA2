Tkachenko: "Preliminary Results: One Year After Kim Yong-Sam Took Office as South Korean President"] [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Big hopes were placed on a new policy in Seoul regarding North Korea and reducing tensions on the peninsula. The president conceived the idea of a gradual convergence between North and South resulting from joint efforts to overcome animosity and mistrust, broaden cooperation, and ensure mutual coexistence and prosperity. The key feature of the new ideas was that the convergence was to be voluntary and democratic, i.e., the majority of the population in the North and South would agree to live together at the same standard of living in two parts of a unified country. Nonetheless, in spite of the proclaimed declarations relations between North and South have noticeably worsened in the last year. The euphoria caused by the sensationalized agreements reached in 1991-1992 on reconciliation and reducing tensions, was replaced by a deep pessimism. Contacts in humanitarian and cultural spheres that had been maintained even during sharp confrontation were broken off. The cause for stagnation in inter-Korean relations involved a nuclear arms problem on the peninsula, MAGATE [IAEA, International Atomic Energy Agency] inspections of both DPRK nuclear sights and military bases in the North and South, and a bilateral agreement on a nuclear-free zone. No agreement was successfully reached on these issues during inter-Korean negotiations, and now a dialog is underway between the U.S. and the DPRK. There were no major events that transpired last year in the development of Russian-South Korean relations. A feeling of dissatisfaction arose in connection with Russia's failure to act as a bridge between North and South Korea when a sharp political crisis followed the DPRK's decision in March to withdraw from a nuclear arms nonproliferation agreement. However, what bearing could Russia have had on the situation after relations became paralyzed between Russia and the DPRK for ideological reasons? The role traditionally belonging to Russia as a peacekeeper and guarantor of security in Korea has now gone to China, which is now skillfully performing these duties to its obvious benefit. No boom in economic relations has taken place between Russia and the Republic of Korea. The exchange of goods between them has not even exceeded the 2 billion dollar mark, that is, it has remained at the same level as our trade in 1988 with North Korea. Not one of the 23 projects for economic and scientific-technical cooperation submitted for review to the South Korean government by Russia has been realized. The problem of Russia repaying 1.5 billion dollars in credit extended to us by the Republic of Korea, has also not yet been resolved. This year Kim Yong-Sam will visit our country. Now is the time for tallying up results, studying prospects for strengthening cooperation between our countries to our mutual benefit, and preparing new terms and agreements. The Russian-Korean summit meeting, as expected, will allow for making our relations more dynamic and purposeful. [passage omitted]
