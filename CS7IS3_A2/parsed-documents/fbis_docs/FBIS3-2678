A senior government official said today. Addressing the ongoing session of the National People's Congress, Chen Jinhua, minister in charge of the State Planning Commission, said that the main task of macro-controls is to maintain an overall balance of supply and demand. "To fulfill this task, we must use all means to increase effective supply and prevent overall social demand from rising too rapidly," he told the NPC deputies. "First, we will exercise strict control over investment in fixed assets," he said. Banks must strictly abide by state plans on loans for fixed assets investment and should refuse to finance any new projects not approved by the State Council or the State Planning Commission, or any projects outside state plans. "Second, we will rationally control the growth of consumer demand," he said. Third, it is necessary to continue to keep money supply and credit under control, and tighten budgetary restraint, he said. Chen Jinhua stressed that macro-controls should focus on controlling the margin of overall price rises. "There will be intense pressure with regard to price hikes this year, " he said. "Therefore, while pushing ahead with price reform, we must use every possible means to keep the margin of price increases within the planned range as a macro-control target," he said. He listed the following measures to attain that goal: -- Working hard to increase effective supplies of goods and making every effort to promote the production and supply of daily necessities; -- Carefully organizing the implementation of price adjustment measures formulated by the state; -- Removing obstacles in goods circulation and marketing; -- Setting up and optimizing a reserve system for grain, cotton, cooking oil, meat, sugar and other major farm products as well as risk funds for grain and non-staple foods, in order to effectively regulate market volumes and keep prices fairly stable; -- Improving the market monitoring and controlling system; and -- Strengthening market regulation and tightening supervision over prices and market order. Chen Jinhua said that all departments and local authorities must respect the authority of the state macro-control system and improve the overall balance of economic activities so as to avoid violent economic fluctuations. Moreover, it is also necessary to strengthen monitoring of economic trends and make forecasts and warnings more accurate, he said, adding, "we will deepen reform of the planning system."
