Journalists were told this by Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich after his talks with Viktor Chernomyrdin, head of the Russian government. The Belarusian prime minister believes that this step will make it possible to avoid military-political polarization in Europe. In this connection, Vyacheslav Kebich thinks that after Russia's admission to NATO Belarus may also become a member of the bloc. He stated that the question of the position of the two countries in respect of joining NATO will be discussed during the visit to Moscow next week by Stanislav Shushkevich, chairman of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet. This was reported by INTERFAX.
