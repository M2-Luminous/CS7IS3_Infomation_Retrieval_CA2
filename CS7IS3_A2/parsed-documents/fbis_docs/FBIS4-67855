It has been reported the Patriots will be deployed around Seoul. As early as the beginning of this year, the United States and the ROK agreed in principle to deploy Patriot missiles on U.S. military bases in the ROK to deal with ``threats from the North.'' The missile deployment plan was strongly criticized by the DPRK. Later, the situation on the Korean Peninsula became relaxed; the Patriot missile deployment plan was shelved after the DPRK reached agreements separately with the IAEA and the United States on the settlement of the nuclear issue, and North and South Korea resumed consultations on an exchange of special envoys. Recently, the settlement of the DPRK nuclear issue again encountered difficulties as the various parties have completely different appraisals of the results of the IAEA's early March inspection of the DPRK's nuclear facilities. Against such a background, the United States has revived its plan to deploy Patriot missiles in the ROK. The U.S. deployment of Patriot missiles aroused strong opposition from the DPRK. On 28 March, a DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman issued a statement saying the Patriot missiles to be deployed to the ROK are an improved model, which can be used as an offensive weapon and can hit any target on the Korean Peninsula due to the local terrain. For this reason, the U.S. description of the Patriot deployment as ``purely defensive'' is groundless. Moreover, the deployment seriously violates relevant provisions of the Korea armistice agreement and it is a ``dangerous military action'' intensifying the situation on the Korean Peninsula. The DPRK has repeatedly reiterated that it hopes the nuclear issue will be resolved through dialogue, and the exertion of pressure will not resolve the issue but will only make it more complex. Over the last several days, there have been mass rallies in Pyongyang, Haeju, and Kaesong Cities, opposing the U.S. deployment of nuclear weapons in the ROK; and criticizing the U.S. action as an ``open threat'' to the DPRK and as an intentional act to worsen the situation on the Korean Peninsula. Participants in the rallies have demanded the United States halt the Patriot missile deployment immediately, and have said they will be on the alert against the U.S. action.
