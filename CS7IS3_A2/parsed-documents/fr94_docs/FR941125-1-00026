FR941125-1-00026 FR941125-1-00008 I. Introduction These revisions to subpart A and PS&hyph;1 will apply to all continuous opacity monitors installed for purposes of monitoring opacity, as required in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). These requirements may also apply to stationary sources located in a State, District, Reservation, or Territory that has adopted these requirements into its implementation plan. The PS&hyph;1, Specifications and Test Procedures for Opacity Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems in Stationary Sources, was first promulgated in the Federal Register (40 FR 64250) on October 6, 1975. A subsequent revision to this specification was promulgated in the Federal Register March 30, 1983 (48 FR 13322). These specification revisions for COMS's are based on information obtained by EPA from additional experience with the procedures since that promulgated revision. Prior to today's action, the proposal was distributed for comment to a review group of EPA Regional Offices and a State agency. In addition, EPA solicited input from opacity monitor manufacturers and concerned industries. The EPA considered comments from these sources and incorporated additional changes. The specifications, in total, shall apply to all COMS's installed or replaced after the date of promulgation. All COMS that have been installed prior to the date of promulgation of these revisions would not be subject to these revisions unless replaced or specifically required to comply. Following promulgation, a source owner, operator, or manufacturer will be subject to these PS's if installing a new COMS, relocating a COMS, replacing a COMS, recertifying a COMS that has undergone substantial refurbishing (in the opinion of the enforcing agency), or has been specifically required to recertify the COMS with these revisions. The COMS, which met PS&hyph;1 prior to these revisions, may not meet today's proposed specifications. Alternative designs or procedural modifications to PS&hyph;1, approved by the Administrator prior to the proposal of these revisions, are not applicable to monitors subject to these revisions. However, source owners and operators, as well as manufacturers, may apply or reapply per ยง60.11(i) to the Administrator for alternatives to these PS's. II. Summary of Proposed Revisions Today's action proposes to restructure and clarify PS&hyph;1. The proposal restructures organization of the specification and delineation of responsibilities to demonstrate conformance with design, location, and performance requirements. Opacity monitoring system technology works in the following way: light with specific spectral characteristics is projected from a lamp through the effluent in the stack or duct, and the intensity of the projected light is then measured by a sensor. The projected light is attenuated because of absorption and scatter by the particulate matter in the effluent; the percentage of light attenuated is defined as the opacity of the emission. Transparent stack emissions that do not attenuate light have a transmittance of 100 percent or an opacity of zero percent. Opaque stack emissions that attenuate all of the light have a transmittance of zero percent or an opacity of 100 percent. The opacity measured at the location of the COMS is corrected for differences in measurement pathlength from stack or vent exit conditions and reported as the facility's opacity emission. A. Design The design requirements, as promulgated March 30, 1983, continue to be required. The following additional and upgraded requirements are being proposed: 1. The optical alignment device, used to assure that the system is optically aligned, must clearly indicate misalignment before the 2 percent opacity shift allowed by the design performance limit occurs. Therefore, systems with subjective observation indicators, e.g., ``top-dead-center,'' may not comply. Manufacturer evaluations, conducted in 1989 and 1990, found that several manufacturers were revising their alignment devices to clearly indicate misalignment. However, 1992 evaluations have identified a continuing problem of clearly depicting misalignment. Specifically, a COMS was placed in zero alignment, yet, the alignment sight directions would have indicated that it was misaligned. Realignment in this instance could have caused a negative bias in future recordings. 2. In addition, in 1992, EPA observed COMS responses over different distances for the COMS alignment test and concluded that the alignment check should be done at the installation pathlength and not at 8 meters, as currently required by PS&hyph;1. This is also a practice of the manufacturers due to specific aperture, objective lens, and installation pathlength requirements. Because the alignment check and performance test are considered installation pathlength specific and because of the Agency's need to assure clarity in the misalignment, the optical alignment test is now required at the site of the installation. This will provide an opportunity for the enforcing agency and source owner or operator to evaluate and establish clarity in the depiction of misalignment. 3. The angle of view (AOV) and angle of projection (AOP) specifications have been revised. Defined as the angle that contains all of the photopic radiation either detected or projected by the COMS, the calumniation of the light beam has been reduced to a maximum total of 4 degrees. From 1989 to 1992 time period, EPA observed the AOV and AOP testing, conducted by 10 major manufacturers of COMS sold in the United States, and concluded that the AOV and AOP should be reduced from the current 5 degrees to 4 degrees. This change also reflects manufacturers' improvement in the instruments.
