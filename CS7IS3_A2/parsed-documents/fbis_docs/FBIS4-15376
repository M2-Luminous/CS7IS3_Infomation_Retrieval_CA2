During the first round of voting to the Ukrainian parliament Communists gained a substantial success in Eastern Ukraine and National Democrats and National Radicals -- in Western Ukraine. The second voting in elections to the parliament will be held 9-10 April. In Kuchma's opinion, Ukraine "has already crossed the threshhold beyond which is mass industrial recession." He placed the responsibility for this on the government and National Bank. As Kuchma said, he will insist "on the need for a single economic space without which the republics of the former USSR cannot survive."
