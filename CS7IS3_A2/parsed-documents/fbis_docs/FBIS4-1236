"We have no doubt that the documents that are being destroyed contains evidence of how the National Party abused the South African Police for their own petty party political aims," the ANC said in a statement on Sunday [24 April] in reaction to reports that Mr Kriel had shredded the documents on leaving his office. The ANC asked whether the documents were related to Third Force activities. It said Mr Kriel was trying to rob South Africans of their right to know what happened during the apartheid years. The ANC said Mr Kriel would continue abusing power if he gained any position of seniority in the race for the Western Cape premiership. Mr Kriel has said the papers were personal and party political.
