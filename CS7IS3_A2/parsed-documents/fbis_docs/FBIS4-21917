'Arafat bowed his head for a second. Suddenly he turned his back and walked out of the room without saying a word. Senior sources in Jerusalem last night expressed serious disappointment with the PLO's feeble reactions to the terrorist attack in 'Afula and the fact that 'Arafat has not yet condemned it. Arab sources close to Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] claim that 'Arafat relayed a positive message to Hamas in the wake of the attack. According to these sources, in a talk with various activists, the PLO leader voiced a certain measure of support for the attack but noted that due to the negotiations and the political situation, he could not say as much in public. The message was relayed to Ibrahim Ghawshah, the Hamas spokesman in Jordan, but was leaked in the process. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian delegation to the peace talks with Israel, said that the lethal attack in 'Afula proves the need to sign the agreement soon. "This is one of the reasons we are pushing for the agreement to be signed: to put an end to the killings." [passage omitted]
