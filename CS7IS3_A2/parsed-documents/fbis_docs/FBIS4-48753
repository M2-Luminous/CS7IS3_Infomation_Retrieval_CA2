There are 18 ministers and one secretary of state. Mr. Kodjo himself presents the ministerial team and its program: [Begin Kodjo recording] I assure the Togolese people as a whole of my desire to place the government's action in the framework of the joint program of the parliamentary majority, but in a spirit of openness, with its hand outstretched to all. For we must avoid any sectarianism, as we put ourselves resolutely at the service of the Togolese people as a whole. I appeal to the union of all democratic forces, and to all people of goodwill, so that we may consolidate our efforts to respond to the profound desire for change expressed by all the people of Togo. This government is perhaps not the government we should have liked to have formed, but the expectations and the sufferings of the people forced its composition on us. It must get down to work, while at the same time trying to preserve the future. [end recording] [passage omitted]
