[Al-Bid] Only an idiot would say that. Salih has been hatching a plot since the very beginning. His intentions were dishonorable. Unfortunately, we realized this too late. [SPIEGEL] Were you and your Marxist colleagues in Aden not aware of the dangers of unification? [Al-Bid] We thought that after the end of the Cold War, the spirit of the age would influence the responsible persons in Sana'a and Aden. We thought worn-out ideologies would be jettisoned and a common Yemeni model developed. [SPIEGEL] The Muslim-conservative north is accusing the socialists of not having abandoned their communist stereotypes. [Al-Bid] On the contrary, we in the south have permitted all political parties to exist. Even western diplomats are praising our freedom of the press and freedom of speech. State-controlled land and enterprises have been reprivatized, and the state trade monopoly has been abolished. The north has contributed nothing to the Yemeni marriage. On the contrary, the gentlemen in Sana'a, obsessed with their tribal interests and with gaining personal power, are trying to enforce their anti-progressive ideas in the south, even by means of force. [SPIEGEL] And you do not want to change the North Yemenis? [Al-Bid] We want to change society and modernize it, but by democratic means. The elections last year showed that our ideas, geared at a social market economy and political pluralism, have fallen on fertile ground even in the north. [SPIEGEL] In the south, you were able to assert your leading position, but in the north you have gained very little. [Al-Bid] In any case, the election result did not suit the tribal politicians and the social groups linked to them. They thought the oil-rich south would fall into their lap like a ripe fruit. What they failed to achieve with the ballot paper they tried to achieve with a series of political coups and military strength. Why did I return to Aden together with all the other South Yemeni politicians? Because in Sana'a and all over the north, the murderers and Muslim terrorists who are fed by the ruling clique are enjoying total freedom. [SPIEGEL] For your part, you have extended military service and equipped the south with foreign weapons. [Al-Bid] Purely for the purpose of self-defense. Several weeks ago, the Northern Army started cutting off all supplies to our units in North Yemen, in order to destroy them later. The storming of Aden is supposed to take place without any resistance. [SPIEGEL] Can you resist the militarily superior North? [Al-Bid] We will use all the means at our disposal to prevent the Middle Ages from also swallowing the South.
