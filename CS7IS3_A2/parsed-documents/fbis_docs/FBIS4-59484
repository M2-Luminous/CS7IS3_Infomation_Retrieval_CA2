"I'm not turning away from responsibility... I'm working on something which I believe is important," she told AFP. "I have a prior commitment to the Palestine Independent Commission for Citizen's Rights ... and that's where I feel I can be of most use. "I feel that the National Authority should have people of commitment, integrity and credentials. I have chosen where I want to be and that is one way to participate in building our institutions." 'Ashrawi said she had been asked several times, but consistently turned down the offer. "My refusal is not an opposition to the authority itself. I have encouraged everyone to participate in different ways in building our institutions. Everyone does not have to be in the Authority," she said. Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman Yasir 'Arafat named her as one of 15 members to the new self-rule authority for Gaza and Jericho in a list forwarded last week to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. PLO chief negotiator Nabil Sha'th said the Authority would be ready to take up its duties on Wednesday, by when the transfer of power in the autonomous areas is expected to be complete. But 'Ashrawi is reportedly not the only one to have spurned 'Arafat. Israeli television said 'Arafat had appointed two other members Saturday -- Nabulus businessman Munib al-Masri and university teacher Sari Nusaybah, a Middle East expert. The appointments were formally approved in Tunis at a meeting of the PLO's executive committee which also nominated Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, head of the PLO's Information Department, to the authority, a committee member Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi told AFP in Tunis. However, sources close to 'Abd-Rabbuh said he had asked for time to think about it. 'Ashrawi said her commission was now operational from the West Bank town of Ramallah. "The commission is operational already, but we have had some technical problems such as setting up an office, so we are working from my home for the moment."
