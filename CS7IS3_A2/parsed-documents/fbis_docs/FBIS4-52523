Even the North Vietnamese troops were unable to dissolve the KR troops. This is not only my belief; the overwhelming majority of the Cambodian people also thinks so. The people are fed up with war; no one wants to wage war to bleed his own fellow compatriots. Since the entire Cambodian people want peace, the king has called for a roundtable meeting to restore peace with peaceful means, (?thereby making Cambodia prosperous and glorious once again). This is not only my point of view, it is also the opinion of the people in general. Sam Rangsi further said that the king's statement is very correct, because nothing can be resolved militarily. War should be put to a halt. The Vietnamese, who attacked the Khmer Rouge and harassed, persecuted, and oppressed the Cambodian people, were not able to fight a successful war against the Khmer Rouge, so why do we, the Cambodians, need to bleed each other? This only damages Cambodia's interests and benefits foreigners. The latter want us to bleed and kill each other to make our land free, thereby allowing them to dominate and occupy our country. This being the case: 1. Our common belief is that nothing can be solved through military means and that a solution to achieve national unity can only be found through peaceful negotiations. 2. Since all of us want peace, therefore, only the king is able to restore national reconciliation to allow our nation to recover independence and peace 100 percent.
