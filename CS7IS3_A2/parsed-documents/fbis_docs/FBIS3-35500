Ministers estimated that the moves decided by the committee will be operational moves aimed at calming moods, not political moves. Still, on the political plane, Major General Amnon Shahaq, the head of the Israeli delegation to the Taba talks, relayed a message to Dr Nabil Sha'th, the head of the Palestinian delegation, expressing shock at the murders in Hebron. Shahaq passed on the condolences of the Israeli delegation with regard to the murder, and expressed the hope that this tragedy would not harm the effort for peace, an effort which is obviously aimed at preventing such incidents.
