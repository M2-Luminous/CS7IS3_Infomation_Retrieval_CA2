FR940203-1-00017 FR940203-1-00004 (d) For Model 747SR airplanes only: Based on continued mixed operation of lower cabin differentials, the inspection and modification compliance times specified paragraphs (a) and (b) of this AD may be multiplied by a 1.2 adjustment factor. New Requirements of This AD (e) Prior to the accumulation of 11,000 total landings, or within 1,000 landings after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later, unless previously accomplished within the last 3,000 landings prior to the effective date of this AD, conduct a visual inspection to determine if countersunk fasteners have been installed in the area defined in either paragraph (e)(1) or (e)(2), as applicable, in accordance with the procedures described in Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53A2312, Revision 2, dated October 8, 1992. Accomplishment of this inspection terminates the inspection requirements of paragraph (a) of this AD. (1) For Model 747&hyph;100, &hyph;200, &hyph;300, &hyph;400, and 747SR series airplanes: From body stations (BS) 741 to 1000 at Stringers (S&hyph;)34L, S&hyph;34R, S&hyph;39L, S&hyph;39R, S&hyph;44L, and S&hyph;44R, and from BS 1480 to 1741 at S&hyph;34L, S&hyph;34R, S&hyph;40L, and S&hyph;40R. (2) For Model 747SP series airplanes: From BS 520 to 1000 at S&hyph;34L, S&hyph;34R, S&hyph;39L, S&hyph;39R, S&hyph;44L, and S&hyph;44R, and from BS 1480 to 1741 at S&hyph;34L, S&hyph;34R, S&hyph;40L, and S&hyph;40R. (f) If no countersunk fastener is found in the upper row of the lap splice, no further action is required by this AD. (g) If any countersunk fastener is found in the upper row of the lap splice, prior to further flight, perform an HFEC inspection to detect cracking at all locations where countersunk fasteners were found, in accordance with the procedures described in Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53A2312, Revision 2, dated October 8, 1992. (h) If no cracking is detected during any inspection required by paragraphs (g), (h), (i), and (k) of this AD, at any location where a countersunk fastener was found, thereafter repeat the inspection at intervals not to exceed 4,000 landings, in accordance with the procedures described in the Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53A2312, Revision 2, dated October 8, 1992. (i) If cracking is detected during any inspection required by paragraphs (g), (h), (i), and (k) of this AD, at any location where a countersunk fastener was found, prior to further flight, repair and modify that lap joint in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53A2312, Revision 2, dated October 8, 1992. (j) Prior to the accumulation of 20,000 total landings or within 1,000 landings after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later, modify all locations where countersunk fasteners were found, in accordance with the procedures described in Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53A2312, Revision 2, dated October 8, 1992. For purposes of complying with the requirements of this paragraph, locations that were previously modified, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this AD, do not need to be modified again. (k) Prior to the accumulation of 10,000 total landings following modification of the locations where countersunk fasteners were installed, perform an HFEC inspection at all locations where countersunk fasteners were found, and thereafter, repeat this inspection at intervals not to exceed 4,000 landings, in accordance with the procedures described in Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53A2312, Revision 2, dated October 8, 1992. (l) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Seattle ACO. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Seattle ACO. (m) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with FAR 21.197 and 21.199 to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. Issued in Renton, Washington, on January 28, 1994. Darrell M. Pederson, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
