The statement notes that "the earliest organised return of refugees to their homes in Abkhazia without any preliminary conditions and restrictions is among the main issues for restoring mutual trust between Georgia and Russia". The government asks the Russian leadership "to declare unequivocally its negative attitude to statements by the Gudauta leaders on the establishment of an independent Abkhazian state or its accession to Russia". The government "hopes that the visit by President Boris Yeltsin to Tbilisi, the signing of a package of documents and planned measures will help to achieve a large-scale settlement in Abkhazia, unity and integrity of Georgia in the interests of its multinational population as well as to ensure stability and peace in the Caucasus as a whole, in Russia and throughout the world".
