An AFP news dispatch, which was published by BARRICADA on 15 June 1994, addressed those issues and took statements made by Deputy Foreign Minister Dr. Jose Pallais out of context, presenting an incomplete picture. Acting Foreign Minister Dr. Jose Pallais, asked if Nicaragua supports Cuba's reinstatement to the OAS, told foreign correspondents in Nicaragua: "Nicaragua supports it, but Cuba must obviously show some willingness to adopt and share the changes that the inter-American system has experienced within the OAS and the principles and values that the OAS developed in the 1990's." As for the embargo against Cuba, he stated: "Nicaragua, as all Latin American countries, and based on its own experience, does not believe that confrontation and isolation help solve national problems. In Nicaragua we realized that confrontation, war, and embargoes do not work, but consensus, dialogue, and understanding do. Nicaragua and this government are the products of this dialogue. It is therefore logical that we cannot support practices that contradict what we have found to be successful in our country." Jose Pallais added: "The embargo is a unilateral position of the United States. We do not believe in such measures, but it is a unilateral decision of the United States, and the rest will have to be debated at the OAS. Of course, the OAS has changed a lot since Cuba was a member because it has reaffirmed the most important element of its identity; that is, democracy."
