"These can be parallel research with simply the same name, but this is a reseach of our scientists, it has nothing to do with Americans", Zhirinovskiy told TASS on tuesday adding that he had learned about the Ames family from newspapers. Media reports said that the Zhirinovskiy-disclosed secret weapon was created by the U.S. "Gerardo International" company, and, according to its President Neil Gerardo, was obtained by Russians through Ames. "We had and have nothing to do with the Ames husband and wife, and we are not connected with any secret services in general", Zhirinovskiy said.
