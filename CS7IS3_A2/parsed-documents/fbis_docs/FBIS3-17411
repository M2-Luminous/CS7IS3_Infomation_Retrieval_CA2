According to the Party for Russian Unity and Accord [PRES] leader, participating in the elections is not a priority for him. As such, he singled out "the creation of a robust, effective political party, because without such a system there is nothing to be done in politics." [Shakhray] I also see another objective in the next few months -- to create an effective staff at the Ministry for Nationalities and Regional Policy. So far there has been a lot of fuss about it. But we do not have a ministry yet. A minister and five deputy ministers have been appointed. It has been abolished three times within the past two years. That is all. [Sukhomlinova] Your party has been portraying itself as an all-Russian organization that recognizes the principles of federalism and local self-government and is oriented toward a market economy. But what is the use of it? [Shakhray] Our objective is to set up our representation in all echelons of power: from the federal government to the Federation components' bodies of economic authority. This will take two or three years of work. The PRES already has its branches in 66 regions. We have a membership of 22,000 people. But there should be allies, a political infrastructure around the party. [Sukhomlinova] What is your attitude to your rivals? [Shakhray] The issue is not the word "rival." At present, the political picture is dominated by the struggle between three political and economic elites: the regional and sectoral ones, and that of Moscow. The regional and sectoral elites are now joining forces against the Muscovites. But the Moscow group itself is divided into four blocs. As far as it is concerned, one should not forget that 70 percent of Russia's banking capital is concentrated in Moscow... [Sukhomlinova] What four blocs of the Moscow elite are you talking about? [Shakhray] If I were to answer your question specifically, certain names would have to be mentioned... Everything will be clarified in April. Unfortunately.
