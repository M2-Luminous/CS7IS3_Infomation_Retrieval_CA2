Song Ping and Yao Zhenyan attended the meeting. Engineering consultation is a newly emerging industry in the course of reform and opening up. Through rapid development of more than a decade, an independent industry with some 3,000 engineering consulting units of various kinds has taken shape in China. To standardize the management of the new industry and to provide better engineering consultation to economic construction and the total process of engineering projects from policy-making to management, the State Planning Commission recently promulgated the "Interim Procedures for Managing the Engineering Consulting Industry" and the "Interim Procedures for Certifying Engineering Consulting Units." These two sets of procedures prescribe the system for certifying qualifications of engineering consulting units and their compensatory service, as well as the principles for conducting engineering consultation abroad. The Chinese Engineering Consultation Association will certify various Chinese engineering consulting units in stages and by groups, classifying them into grades A, B, and C and issuing certificates according to their qualifications. It is understood that with the approval of the State Council's relevant department, the Chinese Engineering Consultation Association will join the International Federation of Consultative Engineering as a national organization of the Chinese engineering consulting industry. The membership will serve as an important channel for China's engineering consulting industry to converge with international standards and to develop foreign exchange and cooperation with other members.
