FR940812-2-00174 FR940812-2-00065 We received 12 comments from interested parties, including comments from the FCC. The commentators were in unanimous agreement that the redesignations of the Orlando-Daytona Beach, Florida and Hanford-Clovis, California hyphenated markets were not changes in the FCC rules in effect on April 15, 1976, and that the Copyright Office should treat signals in the newly defined markets that were local for communications purposes as local for purposes of computing copyright royalties as well. We issued a policy decision in 1987 accepting the Florida and California market changes for compulsory license purposes. 52 FR 28362 (July 29, 1987). We stated that we were_*␣*␣* formally adopt[ing] the view that signals entitled to mandatory carriage status under the FCC's former must-carry rules as a result of an FCC market redesignation order are to be treated as local signals for purposes of the cable compulsory license. This position is necessarily based upon the interpretations that (1) Congress did not intend §76.51 to be frozen to its April 15, 1976 status for purposes of determining cable systems' local service area and copyright royalty fees; and (2) when the FCC amends its major television market list in 47 CFR 76.51, there has been no substantive rule change effected so as to impact calculation of cable copyright royalties. Id. at 28366 (July 29, 1987). While we noted that our ``interpretation [was] based on the legislative history of the Copyright Act,'' we underscored the moot nature of our policy decision by what then appeared to be the end of changes to §76.51: [T]he changes in the FCC's must-carry-rules following the Quincy decision have essentially mooted the subject of this Notice. When this inquiry began the Copyright Office had concerns about enlargement of the class of local signals under the Copyright Act due to the approximately 400 petitions for market redesignation at that time pending at the FCC. However, it would appear that this policy concern is now eliminated because under the FCC's amended must-carry rules, the major market list is not determinative of must-carry status, and it is unlikely that a large number of market redesignations will be effected by the FCC in the future. Id. The above statement proved to be accurate, especially with the elimination of all must-carry obligations later that year. See Century Communications v. FCC, 835 F.2d 292 (D.C. Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1032 (1988). II. 1992 Cable Act The composition of the major television market list remained intact until the passage of the 1992 Cable Act. The 1992 Cable Act amends the Communications Act of 1934 by, among other things, adding a new section 614 governing the cable carriage obligations for local commercial television stations, i.e. , new must-carry rules. As noted above, the 1992 must-carry requirements no longer involve the major-market list. Nevertheless, section 614(f) of the 1992 Act requires that the FCC's regulations adopted to implement the new must-carry rules ``shall include necessary revisions to update section 76.51 of title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations.'' As we noted in our NOI, the instruction of §614(f) may seem somewhat anomalous since the §76.51 major television market list has nothing to do with the new must-carry obligations of cable systems. 3 See 58 FR at 34594 n.1 (June 28, 1993). In compliance with the statutory directive, however, the Federal Communications Commission on November 19, 1992, published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in MM Docket No. 92&hyph;259, 7 FCC Rcd 8055 (1992) to consider changes to the §76.51 list. The Commission stated that, while the Cable Act was silent as to the reason for changes to §76.51, ``it appears that this [congressional] action would primarily affect copyright liability under the compulsory license.'' 7 FCC Rcd at 8059 (1992). 3 Section 76.51 does have relevance for the Commission's non-network territorial exclusivity, network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules. 47 C.F.R. §§73.658(m), 76.92 and 76.151. In its final regulation issued in 1993, the Commission confirmed its copyright observation and redesignated three §76.51 markets: 1) it added Chillocothe to the Columbus, Ohio market; 2) it added New London to the Hartford-New Haven-New Britain-Waterbury, Connecticut market; and 3) it added Rome to the Atlanta, Georgia market. Report and Order in MM Docket 92&hyph;259, 8 FCC Rcd 2965 (1993). Nonetheless, the Commission took a conservative approach in updating §76.51: We do not believe that a major update of the §76.51 market list is necessary on the basis of the record before us. Wholesale changes in or reranking the markets on the list would have significant implications for copyright liability and for the Commission's broadcast and cable program exclusivity rules. We are not prepared to make such changes on the present record. 8 FCC Rcd at 2979 (1993). Future revisions of the major television market list are to be done on a ``case-by-case'' basis by petition for rulemaking. Id. Although the Commission confined its discussion to the redesignation of markets, it neither embraced nor ruled out the possibility of reordering markets. (``We are not prepared to make such changes on the present record.'') It is therefore possible that future changes to the §76.51 list may include not only redesignations but also reranking and deletions and additions to the market list, although probably in limited circumstances.
