It is not yet known whether the agreement between Sarajevo and Zagreb will also mean a renewal of the Croatian-Bosnian military alliance against the Serbs. Press agency reports talk about a resumption of "low-intensity" combat "in central Bosnia and in the Neretva Valley." Although the agreement provides for the establishment of a unified military command--which means that the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] would also have to be placed under the command of the Bosnian generals--it appears that the time is not yet ripe for such an outcome. U.S. General John Galvin's mission will probably be aimed in that direction. Serbian military sources, however, report certain movements by Bosnian forces in the direction of the Drina front and toward the broader Doboj region, which is the key to controlling vital transportation routes in northern Bosnia. The story about a Bosnian "spring" offensive, which has been announced ever since last October, is still current. It appears that the key moment in consolidating the Bosnian army's ranks was Haris Silajdzic's becoming prime minister in Sarajevo. At that moment (at the end of September 1993) about nine-tenths of Sarajevo residents (according to Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina) did not support the policy of a military solution to the problem of Bosnian access to the sea and the Sava. Is the firm course, however, changing things radically? The Croatian forces were destroyed in central Bosnia and in November Vares fell, thus territorially linking the Tuzla region with Zenica. The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army is organized into six corps: the First (Sarajevo) Corps, the Second (Tuzla) Corps, the Third (Zenica) Corps, the Fourth (Mostar) Corps, the Fifth (Bihac) Corps, and the Sixth (Travnik) Corps. Several independent brigades have also been formed, the most combative of which is the Seventh. There are also operational groups that function under special conditions. The officer corps consists mainly of former JNA [Yugoslav People's Army] officers, only two of whom have finished the War (Generals') School: General Rasim Delic, commander of the Bosnian General Staff, and his deputy, General Jovan Divljak. The Bosnian army is estimated to have about 200,000 soldiers. The General Staff is located in Sarajevo, and commands are conveyed primarily through satellite communications. Quality and Quantity In a Bosnia-Herzegovina TV interview, Alija Izetbegovic said on 24 February that "we are capturing weapons from the enemy, we produce some, and we are trying to import them through certain paths and mountain passes," but undoubtedly weapons are being independently produced to the greatest extent. Belgrade military sources claim that certain weapons are procured within the framework of the "airdrop operation." Clearly, however, that these are negligible amounts. The conflict with Croatian units--which was resolved to a considerable extent in Bosnia's favor--brought Sarajevo control over significant defense industry resources in Konjic (a munitions factory), Travnik (cannons), Bugojno (detonators for artillery weapons), and also in Gorazde, Zenica, and Tuzla. After the successful operations against HVO units in November, there were certain disagreements between Bosnian politicians and individual high-level Bosnia-Herzegovina Army officers. Apparently rotations have been frequent because of that. A person who militarily ensured that the area of the Bihac region would remain mainly (two-thirds) under the central government's control, Col. Ramiz Drekovic, was withdrawn a bit mysteriously, to be replaced by Col. Atif Dudakovic. Drekovic is now the commander of the Mostar Corps. An officer credited with succeeding in keeping part of Mostar under Bosnian control, Col. Arif Pasalic, is currently Bosnia-Herzegovina's deputy defense minister. It is believed that Pasalic is one of the supporters of an assault, a southern Bosnian Reconquista, toward the Adriatic Sea. It is claimed, however, that there is a plan, prepared as early as last year, to break through to the Peljesac peninsula by mid-May! Are the latest events changing things radically? The demilitarization of Sarajevo is freeing up at least 45,000 soldiers in the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army's Sarajevo Corps, and those forces, according to many sources, are already being deployed on other fronts. If there is some kind of peace between the Croats and Bosnians--with American guarantees, perhaps in the form of the demilitarization of Mostar and some cities in central Bosnia--then offensive operations by the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army against Serbian positions are quite possible. A possible Croatian-Bosnian peace will probably renew the establishment of Sarajevo's ground corridors with the sea, and thus the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army's arms build-up could become more intensive. The war is declining in quality (armament) and gaining in quantity (the mass nature of the armies). The forces of the republic of Srpska [RS] are stretched over an enormous front: in the west, up to Bosanska Krupa, to the eastern enclaves along the broader zone of the bank of the Drina, and in the north to Brcko, and to Popovo Polje in the south. Because of the crisis over the airport near Tuzla, the headquarters in Pale issued a mobilization order. In spite of that, it is estimated that the Serbian forces do not have enough personnel. Stormy Reaction Serbian control over eastern Bosnia is currently perhaps the most critical: three enclaves (Zepa, Srebrenica, and Gorazde) are arousing the Bosnian General Staff's hope that a military breakthrough to the Drina is possible. It was heard last week from well-informed Belgrade sources (Warlord Seselj) that the "surrender" of those three enclaves was being considered. That, however, implies Bosnian territorial continuity--and there is still no support for it in Pale (and the commands inside the bunkers in Han-Pijesak). Things are changing with incredible speed. The treacherous mutual tapping on the shoulders of the Serbian and Croatian sides culminated at the end of January in the Milosevic-Tudjman military pact. According to that plan, the RS army was supposed to penetrate the Bosnian defense near Olovo and proceed along the valley of the Krivaja River in order to join up with its forces on Ozren mountain, southeast of Doboj. The Croats would transfer a large number of Croatian Army regular troops to the Lasva valley in order to intensify the pressure and thus facilitate the RS army's action. On the other hand, from the Croatian enclaves near the central course of the Bosna--Zavidovici and Zepce--HVO units were supposed to strike at the Bosnian army from behind when the latter moved to prevent the Serbs' breakthrough along the Krivaja River. The purpose of the operation was clear: to break up the territory under Bosnian control into three parts, thus accelerating principally a bilateral partition of Bosnia, and thereby a happy conclusion of the war as well. In the intelligence field, this would mean encouraging new Muslim autonomist ambitions (like Fikret Abdic). The West, however, is reacting stormily: It is raising a fuss over the hitherto nonexistent problem of the Tuzla airport, with the intention of frustrating the Serbian army's possible intentions of beginning a strike against this city, and thus extending the three critical kilometers of the corridor near Brcko into the interior, toward the south. The Croats were seriously threatened with sanctions, and the (perhaps unplanned) demilitarization of Sarajevo is freeing up enormous Bosnian troops from and around Sarajevo, which are repelling the Croatian offensive against Gornji Vakuf and in the Lasva valley.... Military assessments now indicate that in the long term, Sarajevo has been militarily lost to the Serbian side. The announced "normalization" of life in the city and its vicinity will probably mean the establishment of transportation links between the Bosnian capital and Zenica through Visoko and with Tuzla through the northern Olovo-Kladanj route. It is believed that there are about 650,000 people in that region, mostly refugees from Zvornik, Bratunac, Bjeljina, and so forth. The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army's military forces in Tuzla, however, are relatively poorly armed, but it is believed that it would have to be the future nucleus of a massive strike against the Serbian front lines on the left bank of the Drina. [Box, p 15] Secret SAS Mission The London Sunday Express reported last week that an elite SAS [Special Air Service] British Army unit had been sent to Bosnia on a secret mission to discover Serbian, Bosnian, and Croatian heavy weapons. It is believed, however, that the number of missions for which this unit was sent to Bosnia is much higher. The SAS consists of the 21st, 22d, and 23d Regiments, the 264th Communications Company, and the Commando-45 Paratrooper-Reconnaissance Regiment. It is most likely that parts of the 22d Regiment, located in Herestford with black berets, were sent to Bosnia. SAS units also successfully passed a test in the Falklands war when their commands reported on enemy movements and positions. In "Desert Storm," they proved to be more successful than the U.S. "Green Berets." Their arrival in Bosnia is being associated with Serbian politicians' and generals' serious threats against the Blue Helmets in the event of international military intervention. The Serbian General Staff in Bosnia is now located in Han-Pijesak in eastern Bosnia, in a bomb shelter. Orders are issued from it by cable to units in all parts of the battlefield. This avoids the possibility of radar interference or the interception of command instructions. The SAS's biggest success during the Gulf war, however, is considered to be putting out of commission the underground communications cables between the Iraqi units in Kuwait and the command post in Basra. SAS units are infiltrated deep into the enemy's rear in order to capture or liquidate high-level politicians or officers. They are transported there by helicopters with special navigation equipment. During one characteristic attack against the Iraqi rear an SAS strike group blew up a bomb shelter in which there were 450 Iraqi soldiers and officers. The commander of the UN forces in Bosnia, General Sir Michael Rose, is a member of the SAS. The Bosnian Serbs also have special units, the best known of which are the "Panthers" from Bijeljina. The HVO commander, General Ante Ros, was a member of the French Foreign Legion. Before assuming his present position, he was chief of the Croatian Army's Special Forces Command.
