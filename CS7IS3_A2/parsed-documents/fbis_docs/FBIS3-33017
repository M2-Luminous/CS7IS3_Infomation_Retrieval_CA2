The assault rifle was developed by Lieutenant Colonel Armando Gutierrez Mesa. Margarita Torres has more detials: [Torres] The "Mambi" is designed to fire on assault helicopters, which were used by the Yankees in their aggressions in Panama and the Gulf War. We will learn more of the rifle's combat capability from the coauthor of the project, Lieutenant Colonel Giraldo Perez Banos. [Perez] We have the capability of hitting a target at 2 km with very high accuracy. In tests, we verified that this assault rifle can hit a target measuring 2 meters by 2 meters at a distance of 2 km. That is more than enough to counter this technique by the enemy. [Torres] How much does it weigh? [Perez] This assault rifle weighs approximately 14 kg and can be readily handled by any combatant. It is 1.4 meters in length and its center of gravity has been designed to rest on the shoulder of the marksman, which makes the weapon very easy to use. [Torres] Are we talking about an authentically Cuban assault rifle? [Perez] That is one of its main characteristics. Despite the special period, Cuba has been able to design a weapon with these characteristics that is effective against such means of aggression as enemy helicopters. We have used Soviet 12.7-mm caliber ammunition in it. We have designed a system by which one man can fire an assault rifle of such size by himself. [Torres] The Cuban Science Academy named this portable 12.7-mm caliber assault rifle one of the outstanding scientific projects of the country in 1993.
