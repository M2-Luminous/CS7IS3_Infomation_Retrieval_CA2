FBIS4-21206 "jptdd017__l94049" JPRS-TDD-94-017-L JPRS Narcotics 3 April 1994 LATIN AMERICA PERU Overview of Draft National Antidrug Control Plan Overview of Draft National Antidrug Control Plan PY1504232894 Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 3 Apr 94 pp A14-A15 PY1504232894 Lima EXPRESO Spanish BFN [Article by Liz Mineo] [Text] The creation of the National System for the Control and Repression of Drug Production and Drug Trafficking [Sistema Nacional de Control y Represion de la Produccion y el Trafico Ilicito de Drogas] is the most important contribution encompassed in the national antidrug plan drafted by a commission of experts at the government's request. According to the draft, this new drug control system will group all the many dispersed antidrug government actions which need to be centralized and organized. The new Peruvian Government antidrug policy organization will fulfill functions similar to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, which drafts, centralizes, and implements the U.S. Government's antidrug strategy under the leadership of Drug Czar Lee Brown. The influence of the U.S. model does not stop there, because the National Drug Control and Drug Prevention Plan [Plan Nacional de Prevencion y Control de Drogas]--which is already in President Alberto Fujimori's hands for study and approval--is a Peruvian version of U.S. goals, objectives, plans, and programs in this area. The Peruvian program encompasses drug production and drug trafficking; alternative development programs; and drug prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation. The plans call for the national system to be divided into four subsystems, each of which will concentrate their efforts on drug control and drug repression activities in the battle against drugs; the deviation of chemical precursors and inputs; the transfer of funds and laundered money; drug production and drug trafficking; and the smuggling of arms and explosives. These subsystems will be subordinated to the central organization, which will be in charge of the planning, coordinating, controlling, and information and decisionmaking process of the antidrug efforts to be undertaken by the Peruvian Government from 1994 to the year 2000. In addition to creating this arm for the antidrug struggle, the plan has 20 other objectives, among which are the development of the alternative development program, the monitoring of coca crops, the safeguarding of the environment, and the development of research programs for the beneficial use of coca. The main objectives are centered on the gradual reduction of coca crops, the repression of drug production and drug trafficking, and the decrease of drug use. By the year 2000 the goal of this ambitious project is to incorporate through the alternative development programs at least 50 percent of the peasant population currently involved in coca production for illegal purposes in legal farming activities. In addition to alternative development, the plan proposes a strategy based on the establishment of legal and institutional order. According to the draft, during the 1994-2000 period the promotion of the alternative development program will be granted ``top priority'' with the objective of achieving the reduction of coca crops used for illegal purposes. The national antidrug plan, the first of its kind in our country, was drafted by a multisectorial commission headed by General Arnaldo Velarde Ramirez, Peruvian representative to the OAS Inter-American Committee for the Control of Drugs and Drug Abuse (CICAD). The commission was established in November, and is made up of representatives from government ministries, with support from the United Nations International Drug Control Program [Programa de las Naciones Unidas para la Fiscalizacion Internacional de Drogas] (PNUFID) and prominent experts on the matter.
