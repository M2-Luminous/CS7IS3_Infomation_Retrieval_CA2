The sources told AL-HAYAH that the government would reuse the Damiya Bridge which links Jordan with the Nabulus region, which is not part of the limited autonomous self-rule in Gaza and Jericho, or would establish a crossing point in the city of al-'Aqabah on the Red Sea "to facilitate the passage of Palestinian and Jordanian citizens and to link between the two wings of the Arab world in North Africa and Asia." It is known that travelers between the East and West Bank currently use the King Husayn (Allenby) Bridge and the Prince Muhammad Bridge over the River Jordan in the Jordan Valley. It is clear that any such Jordanian measure will render useless any Palestinian-Israeli agreement on crossings from and to the Jericho region. The Jordanian sources stressed that any such step "will facilitate traffic between the two banks, especially since most West Bank Palestinians hold Jordanian passports." One of the sources criticized Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat due to "his disinclination to coordinate with Jordan" on the issue of crossings, "without taking into consideration that any arrangements on any side of the border must take place through coordination with the other side." The source stressed that Jordan "desires to ease the immense pressure" on the Palestinian citizens in the occupied territories "as much as it can." [passage omitted]
