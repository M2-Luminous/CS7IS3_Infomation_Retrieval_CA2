A total of 1,065 respondents were asked to reply to several questions, of which the following attracted our attention: "Several parties and movements consider forming coalitions for the parliamentary elections. How would you vote if the parties and movements contested the elections grouped together in the following coalitions....?" Three political groupings would acquire more votes than if its individual components went into the elections independently. The coalition of right-wing and liberal parties--Christian Democratic Movement [KDH], Democratic Party [DS], National Democratic Party [NDS], Democratic Union [DU], and Party of Entrepreneurs and Tradesmen [SPZ]--would receive 13 percent of the votes of all respondents (15.7 percent of the votes of those who are determined to vote). The coalition of left-wing and social democratic parties--Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], Social Democratic Party in Slovakia [SDSS], Green Party in Slovakia [SZS], and Farmers Movement of the Slovak Republic [HP SR]--would receive 15.1 percent (18.2). And the coalition of ethnic Hungarian parties--Coexistence, Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement [MKDH], and Hungarian Civic Party [MOS]--would receive 7.5 percent (9.1). The bloc of nationally oriented parties--Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS], Slovak National Party [SNS], and Christian Social Union [KSU]--on the other hand, would receive 19.9 percent of the vote (24.1 percent); that is less than if the HZDS, the formerly ruling movement, opted for an independent ticket. Some "other coalition or party" was preferred by 4.7 percent of respondents. As many as 22.5 percent of respondents were unable to state their preferences. Obviously, a fierce preelection struggle will be waged for this more than one-fifth of undecided voters. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Preferences for Possible Coalitions(in percent) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Right-wing coalition |13.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Left-wing coalition |15.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |National bloc |19.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ethnic Hungarians |7.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Other |4.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Would not vote |8.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Will not state their preferences |9.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Undecided |22.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Note: Survey conducted by Slovak Radio's Methodological Research Department | |from 2 to 10 May 1994 | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
