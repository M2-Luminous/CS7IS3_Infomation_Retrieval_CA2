The No. 1 demonstration reactor is capable of generating about 660,000 kw and the cost of building the reactor is estimated at approximately 400 billion yen, 1.5 times the cost of building a light water rector with the same capability. The building of the No. 1 demonstration reactor will start somewhere between 2000 and 2005. The reactor will go into actual operation in 2030, after construction of the No. 2 demonstration reactor starts. As for the choice of a site for the reactor, President Abe said: "At the present stage, our federation is studying it and our federation will make a close study of potential cites." In a bid to miniaturize the reactor and cut building costs, the federation will adopt a "modified top entry loop-type reactor" with short piping and simple structure for the first time in the world. At first, Japanese electric power companies studied the possibility of building a reactor that could burn only plutonium to draw down Japan's plutonium stockpile out of consideration for the international opinion against nuclear proliferation. In the end, however, the federation has decided to adopt a demonstration reactor model that uses "blanket fuel" to breed plutonium. In response, the government Atomic Energy Commission plans to revise the current long-term plans for development and utilization of atomic power.
