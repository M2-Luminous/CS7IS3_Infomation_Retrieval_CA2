FBIS4-3525 "drchi077_v_94001" FBIS-CHI-94-077 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 TAIWAN Taipei Proposes Qiandao Disaster Talks Schedule Taipei Proposes Qiandao Disaster Talks Schedule OW2004131894 Taipei CNA in English 1241 GMT 20 Apr 94 OW2004131894 Taipei CNA English BFN [By Soifa Wu] [Text] Taipei, April 20 (CNA) -- The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) faxed a message to its mainland Chinese counterpart Wednesday [20 April] suggesting that a special round of talks be held in Hong Kong April 27-29 on issues related to the March 31 Qiandao Lake travel disaster, in which 24 Taiwan tourists died. "We hope Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) will give US a definite answer soon," SEF Secretary- General Chiao Jen-ho said. It was the second time in less than half a month SEF expressed its intention to talk with ARATS about the Qiandao Lake incident. ARATS failed to reply to a similar request made last week. Chiao reaffirmed that the talks will focus on possible compensation for the bereaved families of the incident's victims as well as the protection of Taiwan tourists and businessmen in Mainland China. He again urged Beijing authorities to thoroughly investigate the incident, to make public the results of the investigation, and to respond to 10 unanswered questions of the families, including why autopsies were performed on the victims' bodies without the prior approval of their relatives. "Although ARATS has informed US that mainland authorities have already arrested three suspects involved in the incident, the message was too simple to settle our doubts and apprehensions," Chiao noted. Beijing's handling of the incident angered not only the bereaved families but also the general public and government authorities here. Local travel agencies have decided to stop organizing tour groups to the mainland from May 1. Government-sponsored cultural exchanges with the mainland have also been suspended. Chiao said that unless Beijing opens up about the matter in detail and handles all related issues properly, cross-Strait relations would be adversely affected. SEF and ARATS are semi-official organizations founded by their respective governments to handle cross-Strait exchanges in the absence of official ties.
