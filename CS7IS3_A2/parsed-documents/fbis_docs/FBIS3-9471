"I'm hopeful," Granic said at a brief press conference after talks with Finnish leaders. Granic also said Zagreb was ready to grant limited autonomy to Krajina Serbs but ruled out full "independence" as demanded by local Serbs. The first round of negotiations between Croatian officials and Croatian Serb leaders in Zagreb were adjourned early Wednesday but the two sides agreed to meet again next week. The negotiations at the Russian Embassy were the first of its kind to be held in Zagreb under the auspices of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR). Granic, who arrived here Wednesday evening on a 24-hour visit, had talks Thursday with Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto, parliamentary speaker Riitta Uosukainen and the chairman of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee Pertti Paasio. Granic said he had briefed Finnish leaders on the situation in his country and Croatian policy on the former Yugoslavia. Ahtisaari, who earlier this year was elected Finland's head of state, was himself involved last year in Yugoslavia peace talks in Geneva as a special representative of UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. Helsinki was the last leg of Granic's Nordic tour that also included stops in Oslo, Stockholm and Copenhagen.
