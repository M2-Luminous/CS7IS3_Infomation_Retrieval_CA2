Chiang, minister of economics affairs said Wednesday [20 April]. Chiang made the comment after returning to Taiwan from a three- day visit to Egypt April 17-19. Chiang said he told his Egyptian hosts that resuming direct Taiwan-Egypt airlinks and setting up liaison offices in both countries would effectively strengthen bilateral ties. During an April 18 meeting with Chiang, the Egyptian Industrial and Business Federation said it hoped to attract more Taiwan tourists to the north African country, the minister said. The federation also accepted Chiang's invitation to take part in the Fourth Republic of China [ROC] import fair scheduled to open in Taipei in October, Chiang said. Chiang noted that the Egyptian Government is working to prevent further decline in its large tourism industry by improving the commercial and investment climate, liberalizing currency exchange and cutting inflation. Before visiting Egypt, Chiang attended a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) ministerial meeting in Morocco.
