In a damning report the Health and Safety Commission's advisory committee on the safety of nuclear installations (ACSNI) said failure to plan a deep depository for waste meant there was uncertainty about how to package waste stored at sites of the UK Atomic Energy Authority. This could lead to the "risk of additional doses to workers dealing with waste at nuclear sites." The report also warned that there was a legacy of "inadequate storage" at Dounreay in northern Scotland and, referring to the 1957 fire at Windscale, now part of the Sellafield site, said "there are still serious problems not cleared up since the accident." About 15 tonnes of damaged fuel remains in the core of the atomic pile that was hit by the fire and a further five tonnes of fuel in aid and water ducts. Great care was still needed to avoid the release of materials during work on the site. The committee's chairman, Dr David Harrison, made it clear that the problem of waste should be a main question in the Government's nuclear review, but he said the Energy Minister in communications with the committee had failed to clarify whether the problem would be investigated. The review -- which the Government promised would begin in 1993 -- has been held up partly because the Department of Trade, the Treasury and the Department of the Environment have failed to agree on its terms of reference. The DTI wants a limited study while the rival departments want to study the question of nuclear liabilities and waste. The ACSNI report concentrates on six UKAEA sites: Harwell, Winfrith, Dounreay, Aldermaston, Springfields and Sellafield. It highlights a store at Harwell which fails "to meet modern standards" and "unsatisfactory" storage facilities for low level waste at Dounreay. Of Sellafield it says: "There is a very long programme of work required to get the piles into an adequately safe condition. At present they fall far below the `as safe as reasonably achievable' criterion." The UKAEA said the report recognised "considerable improvements" it had made. Concerns about Dounreay and Sellafield had now been resolved.
