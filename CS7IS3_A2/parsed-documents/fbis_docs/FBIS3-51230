"The independent central banks in all the other countries must, under one form or another, support the general economic policy of the country without, of course, prejudicing their monetary independence. This is what French law says (...). This is also what German law says and, finally, it's what the Maastricht Treaty says." "Likewise, communication between the executive power and the central bank will be natural," continued Mr. Trichet, alluding to the possible participation in council meetings--without voting rights--of the prime minister and the minister of economy. "In countries which are deeply attached to the independence of the central bank, this direct communication between the government and the monetary authority occurs naturally and bears no prejudice against the independence of the monetary institution which alone decides, within the law, that is, without receiving or soliciting instructions from anyone." "The independence of the Central Bank permits improvement of the efficacy of price stability policy, aids the international credibility of our money, and at the same time gives our economy the best financial environment possible," declared Balladur afterward. "I've always thought that the stability of prices was a necessary, if not always a sufficient, condition for durable growth. This stability particularly assumes the operation of an efficacious monetary policy clearly and explicitly oriented towards this objective," he added. "It is credibility which now appears to be the key value, the condition for success (...). When there is total credibility in the Central Bank (...) market rates (...) can progressively eliminate (...) risk premiums (...). All countries are gradually reaching the same conclusions on the appropriateness of central bank independence," the prime minister concluded. After its installation, the Monetary Policy Council, which consists of six members, in addition to the Governor of the Bank of France and his two vice-governors, held its first meeting, devoted to setting the length of each councillor's term. After drawing lots, the length of term for Jean Boissonnat and Bruno de Maulde was set at three years, that of Denise Flouzat and Jean-Pierre Gerard at six years, that of Michel Albert and Michel Sapin at nine years. These are not renewable except for the three-year terms.
