Officials of the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia will hold discussions to prepare for possible referral of the problem to the Security Council, according to the official. Han is visiting Washington to discuss ways to cooperate with the U.S. Government in dealing with the nuclear issue. "Han and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher agreed in their talks that a meeting of UNSC members at the IAEA will be useful in finding joint measures to cope with the nuclear problem at this stage," the official said. If the permanent UNSC members discuss the problem in New York now even though the problem has not yet been referred to the United Nations, it might unnecessarily provoke Pyongyang, he added. "That's why they decided to discuss the problem at the IAEA," he said.
