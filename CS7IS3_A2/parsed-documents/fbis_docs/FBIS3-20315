Klaus began his official visit on Thursday [24 March] and returns to the Czech Republic on Sunday. The first phase, the transformation phase, includes all the basic reform measures. In the subsequent stage there are no visible new reforms but the reform process is deepened and improved. It is important to proceed with reform decisively and rapidly throughout, he said. He recalled a paper he read at a UN conference in Finland on reforming centrally planned economies in June 1989 -- a few months before the anti-communist revolution in Czechoslovakia. His pre-revolutionary conclusions proved to be correct and were confirmed after the Velvet Revolution, he said. The Paasikivi Society, named after the Finnish president of 1946- 1956, was established in 1958 with the aim of developing the study of foreign policy and became a basis of the Finnish International Relations Institute. Today Klaus also met Pertti Salolainen, the Finnish deputy premier and minister of foreign trade. Salolainen is the chief Finnish negotiator in talks with the European Union (EU), and consequently his talks today with Klaus focused chiefly on EU integration. Salolainen said Finnish advice particularly on the EU's regional and agricultural policy could be very useful to the Czech Republic. In these areas Finland had had great difficulties adapting to the European system, he said. Salolainen explained that his country's two main reasons for seeking EU membership were the possibility of developing closer links to West European security structures through economic integration, and secondly, psychologically, to assuage Finland's feeling of isolation after the other Scandinavian countries joined the EU. The official part of Klaus's visit to Finland then ended with a ceremonial dinner held by Premier Esko Aho. On Saturday morning Klaus and his wife will journey to Lapland to spend a private weekend deep in the arctic circle in Ivalo, where, well-informed sources say, he will drive snow scooters and ride an a reindeer sled.
