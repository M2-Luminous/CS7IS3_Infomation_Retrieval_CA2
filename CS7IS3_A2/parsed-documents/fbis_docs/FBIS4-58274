Syria firmly believes in a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East based on the resolutions of international legitimacy, a peace that entrenches international law as the sole umbrella for this peace. Syria is a basic party to the peace process. Without active Syrian participation, peace cannot prevail in the region. Still, Syria cannot be lured into half-way solutions or half-way settlements. Syria will not bargain on Arab rights and Arab lands. Syria sees no chance for peace unless this peace is just and comprehensive. The U.S. secretary has much experience with Syria, where he has held lengthy talks several times. On more than one occasion, Syria has supported the U.S. Administration's efforts to relieve the peace process of the Israeli intransigence and behavior that Tel Aviv's rulers hoped would abort the entire process. During the recent and historic Geneva meeting between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton, the U.S. President announced his open support for President al-Asad's call for an honorable peace of the brave. Christopher joined President Clinton in expressing the conviction that Syria's role is central to the success of the peace process. They repeatedly hailed Syria's constructive efforts. It is an established fact that Israel has placed every possible obstacle in the way of a just and comprehensive solution of the region's crisis. Israel has sought to replace the Security Council resolutions, the principles of the Madrid conference, and the essence of the U.S. initiative itself with partial and phased settlements that do not meet minimum Arab aspirations and rights. To the contrary, these settlements entrench occupation and colonialism, and exasperate tension in the Middle East. For more than two years, the Syrian, Lebanese, and Jordanian delegations to the Washington negotiations were unable to convince Israel to discuss the subject of withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories. Israel has openly rejected discussing the subject of withdrawal from the Golan and south Lebanon, and has proposed an endless series of conditions, restrictions, and advance security arrangements in return for promises of partial withdrawals. Israel did not discuss with the Arabs in Washington the realization of a just, comprehensive, and equitable peace. Instead, it discussed the imposition of its settlements, which seriously undermine the principles of just and comprehensive peace. The Israeli position can be summed up as follows: Arabs should prove their peaceful intentions by concluding treaties, normalizing relations, opening borders, and subjecting their occupied territories to long-term Israeli control. This is not peace. It can never lead to peace. It is an attempt by the occupier to entrench its occupation and impose its will. It is natural that Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan reject such an alleged and deceptive peace, and adhere to the Security Council resolutions and the Madrid conference agreements. One principle of a solid peace is that this peace should be equitable and just, and should return rights to their owners. Israel's leaders are completely aware of Syria's positions. They know there will be no peace without Israel's complete withdrawal from the Golan and all the occupied territories. They also know Syria will in no way involve itself in partial settlements and compromises. So, the proposals that Israel asked the U.S. secretary to bring with him will not be serious if they do not meet Syria's demand for full withdrawal. If peace can be realized through deeds, not words, then Syria is waiting for deeds, not words. These deeds include full acceptance of the Security Council resolutions, not proposals that circumvent these resolutions and evade the principle of full and rapid withdrawal, the dismantling of all settlements, and the evacuation of all settlers. Syria supports just and comprehensive peace. It will continue to work tirelessly for just and comprehensive peace, but within the framework of international legitimacy and its resolutions.
