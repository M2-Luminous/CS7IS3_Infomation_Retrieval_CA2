Kim Chong-su, deputy chief of the North Korean mission to the United Nations, said Pyongyang is willing to allow IAEA inspectors to witness the changing of fuel rods at the Yongbyon nuclear reactor, but that it cannot accept additional checks of the radiochemical laboratory. He said, ``We have allowed every inspection to ensure the continuity of nuclear safeguards. We have shown everything to the IAEA, and the proposal for additional inspection of the laboratory is an absurd demand.'' North Korea sent a message to the agency Wednesday proposing that IAEA inspectors witness the upcoming changing of fuel rods at the country's five-megawatt nuclear reactor at Yongbyon.
