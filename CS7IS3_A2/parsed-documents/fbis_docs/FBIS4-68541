The selection included meat and fish refrigeration plants, dairy combines, vegetable warehouses, firms trading in groceries, canned goods, wine and spirits items, etc. The results of the poll make it possible to draw a conclusion as to the essential differences in the evaluations of the current market situation made by representatives of the former state food trading enterprises and private firms. The general deterioration in the situation in wholesale trade in foodstuffs in Moscow, which was observed in both sectors of the market, can be singled out as the main trend for the month. At the same time, while for private firms it was accompanied by a noticeable drop in trade turnover, estimates of the volume of sales in the past month made by the directors of state and privatized enterprises on the whole proved to be favorable. At the same time, the predictions and expectations of private wholesalers for the next quarter remained considerably higher. The dynamics of the wholesale prices also differed. Twenty-six percent of the private wholesalers raised their prices in March, and the same number dropped them. As a result, on the whole for this sector of the market, a "zero" rise in prices was noted for the first time. Conversely, in the state sector, 50 percent of the firms polled raised their prices, and not a single one began lowering them. Higher inflationary expectations were also characteristic for state trade. FIGURE In our opinion, the difference in the estimates of the current market situation and the predictions made by respondents of INIOR [Institute of Organized Market Research] and VShE [Higher School of Economics] were caused, in the first place by the varied trade assortment. Food commodities in daily demand, as before, were to a considerable extent sold through the former state wholesale bases. It is obvious that, by virtue of the poor elasticity of demand, the drop in trade turnover here proves smaller, and the potentials for a further rise in prices --greater than for the commodity products list characteristic of private trade. In the second place, the more flexible and quicker reaction of the private trade firms to an unfavorable change in the system of foreign economic regulation might play a certain role. According to the estimates of INIOR and VShE specialists, the forthcoming March introduction of new customs duties was reflected in the prices of Moscow private trade as far back as January-February. It is this (and not just the reserves accumulated) that made it possible for them to avoid raising prices in March. The state and privatized enterprises, on the contrary, follow the change in the foreign conditions of the functioning market in their price policy.
