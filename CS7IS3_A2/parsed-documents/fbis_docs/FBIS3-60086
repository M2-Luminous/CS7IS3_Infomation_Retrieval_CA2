The Nigerian tourists, Mir Zafar, 32, and Amin Gaffy, 36, who are now visiting Thailand, said it was possible that smuggling of narcotics out of Thailand had been suspended for the time being as many key drug traffickers were arrested last month. The two Nigerians were referring to an announcement made by the Narcotics Suppression Bureau (NSB) last month that about 400 kg of heroin, including the 259 kg which was smuggled from Thailand by sea to Nigeria, was seized in Lagos on December 30. Heroin destined for Lagos from Thailand was seized on several occasions and a number of suspected Nigerian drug traffickers arrested. Tbe two Nigerian tourists who are interested in narcotics affairs in Asia, especially Thailand, said that although major narcotics routes from Burma, via Thailand, to international markets are being blocked, it does not mean that the heroin trafficking from this country to other parts of the world would be halted in the longer run. The two who arrived in Bangkok last week said Pakistani mafias had played their key roles in recruiting Africans and Nigerians as drug couriers and had formed a human rights group to launch campaigns against the Thai government for alleged inhumane treatment of foreign prisoners including Nigerians serving sentences for drug offences. The Pakistani drug ring leaders stil exist but they have kept a low profile since the large heroin seizures, the Nigerian tourists said. Officials from the Office of the Narcotics Control Board (ONCB) said yesterday that they are following suspected foreign drug couriers now in Thailand. They will be arrested when sufficient evidence is acquired, they said.
