Its Vice-President Roman Sawinski told reporters Thursday that a growing economic activity in the first quarter was accompanied by lower inflation and stabilization in the labour market. Moreover, the financial situation of enterprises improved which contributed to higher tax revenues of the state budget. On the other hand, long-term unemployment increased, as did the number of people who lost their right to unemployment benefits, and the scale of joblessness among young adults widened, the GUS reports indicate. After a relatively moderate wage growth recorded in January and February, March saw an increase of 14.8 percent on February. The main trends in the Polish foreign trade in 1993 were a bigger deficit, growing imports, higher turnover with the European Union [EU] countries, and low level of trade with the East and Central European states. Presenting the picture of Polish trade with foreign countries in 1993, Malgorzata Fronk of GUS said that exports reached over 14 bn dollars, and imports -- over 19 bn dollars, leaving a trade gap of some 5 bn dollars, a twofold increase on 1992. Much of the higher imports resulted from increased purchases of capital goods and production inputs. Compared to 1992, imports of chemicals increased by 46 percent, of machinery - by 44 percent, of wood and paper products - by 42 percent, said Fronk. The share in overall imports of fuels and energy and of foodstuffs fell. The share of the EU in Polish exports reached 63 percent, and in imports - 57 percent. Germany remained the largest trade partner for Poland. The largest trade deficit Poland had with Italy (728 m dollars) and Britain (475 m dollars). Trade with the East-Central European countries grew by 20 percent in exports and 25 percent in imports. Russia remained the largest trade partner in this area.
