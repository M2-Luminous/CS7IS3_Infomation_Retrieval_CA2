Support to the demand was issued in the name of the European Union [EU] by Greece, in its capacity as the current presiding member of the EU, as well as by Iceland, Canada, Denmark and Poland, said Toivo Klaar, head of the political department at the Estonian Foreign Ministry. All speakers at the meeting also said the issue of the troop withdrawal must not be linked to any other topic. They expressed hope that negotiations between Estonia and Russia will go on. A representative of Poland in his speech said concentration of Russian troops in the Kaliningrad region was causing worries and leading to a destabilization of the situation in the region. Russia at the meeting repeated its earlier position, speaking about the need to resolve the issues "in complex." The Russian representative also said 90 percent of the troops his country used to have in the Baltics had been pulled out. The Latvian delegation at the meeting was more optimistic, saying Russia and Latvia were closer than ever to concluding an agreement, a representative at the Estonian Foreign Ministry added. The head of the ministry's political department said all senior officials at the Prague meeting represented their countries' foreign ministers. Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Mari-Ann Rikken also announced that the ministry had received a statement by Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl in reaction to the recent statements by Russia. Kohl in the message says that the Baltic Sea is no less an European sea than the Mediterranean, and, therefore, countries situated on the coasts of the Baltic Sea must belong to the EU.
