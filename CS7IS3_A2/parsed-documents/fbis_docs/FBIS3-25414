The FPI, he said, will send 21 delegations or more to all areas of the country to hold discussions with the people. Concerning the holding of elections, he sounded a note of warning to the government: He said that in the case of fraud, he is not sure that the FPI will be able to contain the anger of its members: [Gbagbo] I told my listeners clearly that Houphouet is Houphouet, but that after Houphouet, it is no longer Houphouet. Since 1990, I have said that Houphouet has cheated, but all the same, I sent activists go and tell everyone to remain calm, that this was not serious. I am not sure I can keep the people calm if it is not Houphouet who is cheating. It is easy to avoid the risks--by not cheating. We are ready to help any government hold free and fair elections, so that the winner should be recognized as the winner and the loser recognized as the loser. That is why immediately after our December 1992 convention, we established an electoral committee chaired by our comrade, Professor Oulai Hubert. This electoral commission completed the first part of its work on 13 August 1993 and we presented the document to the then prime minister, Alassan Dramane Ouattara. We were expecting him to invite us to a meeting with the Democratic Party of Cote d'Ivoire, on one hand, and all the parties interested in the elections, on the other, under the auspices of the government. After the change of government, we went back to see the new prime minister, Daniel Kablan Duncan, and gave him another copy of the same document, dated 13 August 1993. As of right now, we are still waiting to be invited to hold a serious and important session in order to avoid fraud, and hence, trouble. [Agnimel] Concerning devaluation and its effects, the FPI secretary general made the following suggestions: [Gbagbo] By increasing the price of fuel, the government has run the risk of effecting all the products. On the day of the devaluation, I spoke to AFP; I wanted to suggest that the government freeze the prices of some commodities, including fuel. Then, at the same time, I learned that they had really drawn up a list of goods, including fuel, whose prices had been frozen. So I did not make any declaration, because fuel is an important factor as far as the economy is concerned. Even the price of onions will increase if you increase the price of fuel. The price of pepper will increase if you increase the price of fuel. This is because it is transported from its place of production to its place of consumption. When they took the risk of increasing the price of fuel, it is evident that the price of everything else must increase. Of course, it is not surprising to see the trade unions meeting here and there to prepare their fight. I would like to state very clearly that we are not keeping our flag in our pocket. We will give our active and unflinching support to all workers who fight to reconquer their lost purchasing power.
