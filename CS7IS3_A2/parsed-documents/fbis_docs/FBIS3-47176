Sihanouk, in a statement released by state news agency AKP Saturday, said that apart from Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge, the only anti-Vietnamese pogroms took place after the then Prince Sihanouk was ousted in a 1970 US-backed coup d'etat led by General Lon Nol. "The non-Khmer Rouges patriotic Cambodians only struggled against the Vietnamese agressors but never allowed the human rights of civilian Vietnamese men and women to be violated," Sihanouk, who is undergoing surgery for cancer in Beijing, said. [passage omitted] Sihanouk said an "Australian personality" made the accusation during an interview with BBC television. Sihanouk turned the accusation around, asking: "Were the white Australians themselves perfectly irreproachable in their policies and acts towards the (non-white) ethnic minority who were the original owners of Australia?". [passage omitted] Some 20,000 ethnic Vietnamese fishing people fled Cambodia in the run-up to last May's U.N.-supervised elections to escape a Khmer Rouge campaign of ethnic cleansing. [passage omitted] Although many of the families could speak Khmer and had fished the waters of the Tonle Sap, Cambodia's great lake, for generations and others were married to Cambodians, they found themselves stranded as the government would not let them return. Sensitive to the effectiveness of Khmer Rouge propaganda, the government said it first needed to draft an immigration law. But months later, Minister of Information Ieng Mouli said no decision had been made on whether the boat people could return as the law had yet to be discussed.
