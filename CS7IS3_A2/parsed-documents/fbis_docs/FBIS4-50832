Work started again at the Shaoguan Mineral Refining Plant in northern Guangdong in late April, almost three months after the factory's 500 workers went on strike complaining that the factory manager, Zeng Wanhua, was an incompetent brute. The strike took more than two months to resolve. Zeng was replaced by a shop steward, Tang Zhenmao. During this time the factory's losses piled up, forcing the Guangzhou branch of the China Non-Ferrous Metals Corporation to step in to pay salaries. "If you don't pay attention to the interests of the workers, they have the right to try to bring about changes," said the ebullient Tang, a worker in the mineral-separating room before being chosen by workers to replace the now retired Zeng. Tang said the 200 renminbi (about HK$178) per month salaries at the Shaoguan factory were "pitiable" and forced most workers to moonlight to make ends meet. "[We] ousted Zeng to save ourselves," he said. While Chinese officials supply regular reports of labour disputes in foreign-owned companies, little is heard on the subject of state-run factory disputes. This may be because of China's socialist roots, which assert that workers' interests are the same as managers in the state sector. China's constitution does not give workers the right to strike. "As a socialist country, we believe the interests of workers and the enterprise are the same. So we are not going to advocate strikes," said Wang Chidong, the deputy director of the grass-roots work department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) in Beijing. "We feel strikes make labour relations too tense. It is the most extreme kind of behaviour," Wang said. But with disputes rising, officials say a new "three-party principle" (involving government, enterprises and unions) will be adopted to replace the increasingly ineffective work of Communist Party cells in smoothing labour frictions in state enterprises. An ACFTU document on the role of unions in China's move to corporatise its state-owned sector was submitted to Beijing leaders in April. It calls for the establishment of German-style supervisory committees composed of management and labour representatives. Chinese labour ministry officials also say a better arbitration system will be set up to deal with the growing number of labour disputes which cannot be resolved internally. Arbitration centres in China handled 11,400 disputes in 1993, up 51 per cent on a year earlier, although no breakdown of the number involving state sector workers was given. The ACFTU admits that 7 million workers in state enterprises suffer "inferior living conditions", and even poverty. Nationwide, more than 40 per cent of state enterprises -- which employ close to 200 million workers -- lost money in the first quarter of this year. Recent official reports from the state-sector-dominated provinces of Liaoning, Sichuan and Hubei show a growing number of state enterprise workers taking similar "self preservation" measures as were adopted in Shaoguan. These mainly involve dumping the factory's core business to go into more lucrative trades. But increasingly, they also include ousting incompetent managers and recouping months of unpaid salaries.
