The Russian Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations told Interfax that the two states were to increase mutual deliveries of oil and sugar in 1994. Russia would export 4 Mn [million] tons of oil by the end of 1994 (instead of 2.5 Mn tons, the delivery of which was coordinated in late 1993) in exchange for 2.5 Mn tons of cane sugar, exceeding the earlier expected volume of deliveries by 2.5 times. According to Russian Foreign Economic Relations Minister Oleg Davydov, "Russia is very interested in importing Cuban sugar since it has big industrial capacities specially established for processing of cane sugar." Russia and Cuba also intend to develop bilateral cooperation in other spheres. An International Russian-Cuban Trade Economic Association Roskuba was established last week in accordance with the inter-government agreement of December 24, 1993. The association includes more than 10 Russian state and commercial structures, for instance the joint stock companies Aeroflot--Russian Air Lines, Ingosstrakh, Vneshtreidinvest, Rosdetspetsprodukt, the state committee Rosvooruzhenie and the Russian Federation Trade Industrial Chamber. The association's main purposes are to contribute to the development of trade, direct relations between enterprises and organizations, mutual utilization of industrial capacities and investment and to establishment of trans-national commercial, finance and industrial structures.
