He added: "I was shocked when I read the report: `The extension of Greece's territorial waters to 12 nautical miles is a reason for war. We should go to war with Greece.'" Cetin stressed that when writing such reports, journalists should consider the possible consequences. He added: "Certain journalists sit at their desks and concoct news reports.
