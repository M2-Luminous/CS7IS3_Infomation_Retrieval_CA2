That is unfortunate, Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes said today. He is in Stockholm because of the continuing state visit here of the Belgian royal couple. [passage omitted] [Correspondent Lars Gunnar Erlandson] Willy Claes is in Stockholm in connection with the state visit to Sweden of the new Belgian royal couple. King Albert and Queen Paola and the Swedish royal couple drove in horse-drawn carriages across sunny Stockholm today. The foreign minister had talks with his Swedish colleague Margaretha af Ugglas. The talks concerned, among other things, the formal voting at the EU parliament tomorrow. Willy Claes reassured the possibly nervous members of the Swedish Government: Everything points towards the fact that the four countries seeking membership will be accepted, the Belgian foreign minister said. Margaretha af Ugglas took the opportunity to persuade Belgium, an EU country, that Sweden with its considerable contribution of troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina should also be allowed to take a little more part in decisionmaking when decisions are made by the superpowers and the EU.
