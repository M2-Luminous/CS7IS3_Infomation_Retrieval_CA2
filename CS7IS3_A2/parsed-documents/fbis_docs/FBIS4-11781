Yet, the blockade was extended with the approval of all five on the pretext of routine extension, and the dissemination of a good measure of hope that the position would completely change in favor of lifting the blockade after two months; that is, during the next Council session in May. The proof was that the traditional chairman's statement on the extension, which is normally released every two months by the Council, was not issued this time because of what they termed a "split" between the permanent member states over the draft of that statement. It is really unfortunate, in my opinion also, that our papers have been carried away by this game of nations and have entered into some kind of race between them to break the good tidings to the citizen about an impending breakthrough in our tribulation, while what was required, according to the science of politics -- and this is another aspect of the whole issue -- was that we should not have tampered with the citizen's sentiments and thoughts by relying on certain situations that developed here and there connected with the motives and calculations of all these sides in the Security Council. The sides in the game of nations have reduced the issue of the criminal blockade on Iraq, in which all the permanent members and other world nations have taken part, into a mere statement. On this basis, a Don Quixote-like battle has taken place in which wooden swords were used, and here lies the theatrical. Those who opposed the draft of the chairman's statement and insisted on including references to Iraq's cooperation with the world organization, but could not do so due to the opposition of the United States, Britain and Argentina, should have lifted the blockade themselves or transformed the Council session into an occasion for a general debate on the sanctions, which have been imposed on our country, with the view to removing them or using the veto against any U.S. endeavor to prolong the blockade -- which is what I referred to in my article last Saturday -- in order to affirm the credibility of their new conviction, interpret their words into actual deeds, but above all, affirm something which is even more important; namely, their freedom to determine their own foreign policy and to make decisions according to national and international interests, not as they are required to do by others now or at any other time. In order not to deceive our people -- and this is a matter that concerns us in the press and the other news media -- we must convey to them the full picture about any situation. In the case of the last UN Security Council session, we should not have relied on ready-made analyses or answers concerning the positions taken by the permanent member states of the Security Council and other members in the Council. When we explain to the people what happened by saying that this means the beginning of a split between the big powers because some of them -- and this is the prevalent talk now in political writings -- have began to realize the danger of being continuously dragged behind U.S. policy, and to clearly see their interests with Iraq, for instance, which are long and historical interests, we should also tell the reader that what took place in the Security Council was a political exercise by some people for different reasons that concern only them. Each state that spoke about the positive points in the Iraqi position did so with the aim of bargaining with the Americans over certain national and other issues by using Iraq this time. Therefore, as far as I am concerned, what took place in the Security Council does not deserve the importance it was given by our press or the foreign press. What took place was an attempt to calm Iraq, reduce world public pressure to lift the blockade on Iraq, and to busy everyone at least for the present time with the game of the division within the Council without disturbing or annoying the United States. In the final analysis, this is a gain for the United States and not really for Iraq. True, what took place -- and regardless of the opinions expressed in this article -- was a positive development in the positions of Russia and France in particular, since China is known to have expressed its reservations on every resolution adopted against Iraq right from the beginning, we must not exaggerate that development, unless it develops into a definite new relationship with Iraq, outside U.S. trusteeship, as of now and without waiting for the next Security Council session in May.
