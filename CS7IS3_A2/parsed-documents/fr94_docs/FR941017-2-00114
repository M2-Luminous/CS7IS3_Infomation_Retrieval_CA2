The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public Reference Branch. Applicant's Representations 1. Applicant is an open-end management investment company that was organized as a common law trust under the laws of New York. On December 11, 1989, applicant registered under the Act as an investment company. Applicant has not filed a registration statement to register its shares under the Securities Act of 1933. 2. Yankee Funds, a registered investment company was composed of several investment portfolios, including a money market portfolio (the ``Yankee Money Market Fund''). The Yankee Money Market Fund invested in applicant and owned substantially all of its units of beneficial interest. The three holders of beneficial interest in the Yankee Money Market Fund gave notice by May 10, 1993, that they wanted to redeem their entire holdings. On May 10, 1993, to satisfy the redemption request, a complete redemption distribution totalling $65,585,130 was paid by applicant to the Yankee Money Market Fund in complete liquidation of its interest. On February 22, 1993, the board of trustees of applicant authorized the actions necessary to effect the termination of applicant as an investment company. 3. The expenses applicant incurred in connection with the liquidation included professional and custodial fees and expenses totalling $30,750. Certain persons connected to applicant, including its investment adviser, agreed to assume applicant's deferred unamortized organization expenses as of October 31, 1991. Because these persons assumed the organizational expenses, applicant had no outstanding deferred organizational expenses upon liquidation. 4. Applicant has no debts or other liabilities that remain outstanding. Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceeding. 5. Applicant is not now engaged, nor does it propose to engage, in any business activities other than those necessary for the winding up of its affairs. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
