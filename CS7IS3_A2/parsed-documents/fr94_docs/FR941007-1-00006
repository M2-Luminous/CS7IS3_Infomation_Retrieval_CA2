FR941007-1-00006 FR941007-1-00001 The Department believes that the relationship between price and marginal cost, including the marginal cost of emission controls, bears significantly on the size of the incremental adjustments to be made in the analysis in order to incorporate environmental and energy security externalities into the assessment of net national benefits. The Department will consider this relationship in determining the monetary values (if any) that should be placed on the external or marginal environmental and energy benefits likely to result from appliance efficiency standards. The consideration of marginal costs in this context also raises the question of whether the Department should use marginal electricity prices, rather than estimates of average retail prices, for the calculation of net national benefits. The Department invites comments on these issues. c. The potential impact of externalities on the determination of appliance efficiency standard levels. As noted above, the net national benefits estimated by the Department to result from appliance efficiency standards have, in the past, excluded environmental and energy security externalities. The Department recognizes that the approach taken for including these benefits in economic analyses of alternative appliance standards may vary, depending on issues and variables that are specific to each standard under consideration. Any estimates of environmental externalities would reflect ranges of uncertainties and be considered with other national benefits associated with appliance efficiency standards. The consideration of externality values may or may not influence the appliance efficiency standards selected for one or more appliances, depending on the quantitative externality estimates and their relationship to the costs of higher efficiency and other elements of the analysis. d. The structure of the Department's analysis. The Department intends to adopt a consistent approach in the treatment of externalities and the development of externality values throughout these rulemakings. Therefore, this analysis starts with consideration of crosscutting issues that are likely to bear on all standards and all types of externalities. This analysis of crosscutting questions provides a framework for an analysis specific to each type of externality. The following discussion is framed around a series of focused issues for public comment. For convenience, the main issues addressed are numbered consecutively throughout the entire notice. The numbered set provides a convenient summary of the Department's current view regarding the issues that bear on the development and use of externality values in the appliance standards analysis. Issues related to toxins, solid waste, and discharges affecting waste quality are not discussed in detail in this notice. However, the Department invites comment on the potential importance of these emissions pathways to the determination of externality values. Comments that are structured so as to address the same generic and externality-specific issues raised in this notice, while also identifying other issues unique to particular pollutants or media, would be particularly helpful. Finally, it is worth emphasizing that the Department's current positions on many issues outlined below is not yet firm. Responses to issues in this supplemental Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking could substantially alter the Department's approach as the rulemaking progresses. Parties are also encouraged to raise, and comment on, additional issues related to evaluating externalities and the use of such estimates in determining appliance standard levels. II. Crosscutting Issues a. Relationship to Existing Environmental Regulation and Existing Uses of Externality Values in the Resource Planning Process Issue I: The relationship between existing environmental regulations or the use of externality values in the resource planning process and the use of externality values in setting appliance standards. Based on its current information, the Department does not believe that existing programs of environmental regulation or existing uses of externality adders in the resource planning process preclude the use of externality values in analyses considered in setting appliance standards.
