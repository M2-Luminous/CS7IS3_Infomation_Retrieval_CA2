[Qaddur] There are no threats, strictly speaking. Turkey is a neighbor, and Turkish officials understand we will not bow to threats. On a government-to-government level, the two sides are interested in developing friendly relations. Some Turkish journalists, however, sometimes level charges over one issue or another. In the meantime, the Turkish Government has pointed out that these charges are not necessarily representative of its policies. Turkey is as willing as we are to improve our bilateral ties. As for the Euphrates, which originates in Turkish territory and traverses Syrian territory before it ends in Iraq, it has been an international waterway for thousands of years, on the banks of which many civilizations have flourished. In accordance with international rules regulating the use of river waters, the three countries are all rightful claimants. Hence, the existence of three-way technical committees working on the water distribution. In 1987, we reached an agreement with the Turks under which Turkey committed itself to the allocation of 500 cubic meters per second for Syria before the Ataturk Dam is filled. A clause in a protocol signed during former Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel's visit to Syria on 20 January, 1993 provided for an even greater amount than that. [Fathi] Will Syria give assurances to Israel of a share in the water once peace in the Middle East is established? [Qaddur] The Golan is Syrian territory. Israel has been stealing water from the Golan and south Lebanon. The Israelis are estimated to be misappropriating an annual 300 million cubic meters from the Golan, which is Syrian territory. Syria needs the water. Future water projects will try to utilize technology for optimum use of the water. This is because the water reserves are not enough to meet Syria's requirements. We have irrigation and electricity projects in the east of the country, and any shortfall in the water will result in the depopulation of the area. Syria does not have enough water to spare for Israel. As for assurances to Israel, when peace comes and Israel vacates the occupied Arab territories, mechanisms will be created to handle cooperation among the countries of the region. It is premature to talk, at this point in time, about cooperation and guarantees to Israel. [Fathi] After the Palestinian-Israeli agreement was signed, and after the PLO violated the Arab coordination, to what extent can Arab coordination, particularly among the parties concerned with the peace process, be achieved? [Qaddur] No doubt, this agreement caused a huge rift in the coordination among the states participating in the negotiations. We believe that the unity of Arab ranks will serve the peace process, and that any breakthrough on a single track will complicate this process and will have negative repercussions on it. This is because we are trying to establish a comprehensive and just peace. Therefore, there should be a unified Arab position. A strong partner will make peace, but a weak one will make war. Syria always works to achieve at least the minimum requirements of the ongoing peace process. [Fathi] Will you go to the 12th round of negotiations? [Qaddur] We are committed to the peace process, to which we have been a party since the beginning, in accordance with the bases of the Madrid conference. These bases were agreed upon through elaborate discussions with the former U.S. Administration. Eleven rounds of talks were held, during which there was complete Arab coordination. Therefore, there has been a true orientation toward peace. Syria is still committed to coordination. However, it seems that Israel is so far unprepared for peace and is not sincere about it. Israel is behind the delay of the 12th session. It justifies this by the need for time to digest the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. In fact, Israel wants to usurp more Arab rights. We are ready to go to Washington on the condition that we receive confirmed guarantees about the achievement of progress during the next round. [Fathi] How can progress be achieved during the next phase? [Qaddur] If we return to the Madrid formula, we will find that the objective is to achieve a comprehensive peace on all fronts of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The Madrid formula is not aimed at achieving bilateral solutions between Israeli and Arab parties. The goal is a comprehensive peace binding all parties to the conflict. This is what will end the conflict and return rights to their owners. The mechanism for attaining this goal is negotiations on all Arab tracks with Israel. The mission of the Syrian-Israeli track is to discuss the issue of the occupied Golan. Other tracks discuss other bilateral issues. The final outcome of these tracks will be a comprehensive peace. Isolating and ensnaring any Arab party into an agreement with Israel will disturb the Madrid formula and will weaken the Arab position, especially with regard to the issue of coordination. In the long run, this will not be in the service of peace. [Fathi] What about reports of secret contacts between Syria and Israel? [Qaddur] Peace is a noble goal, and it does not need any secret agreements. No one has to be ashamed of it. Yet, there was secrecy about the eleven rounds of the Washington talks. The problems that were discussed during the negotiations were not divulged. This was considered secrecy. Approximately 7,000 pages were written in such secrecy. [Fathi] How do you assess the progress on the Syrian-Israeli track so far? [Qaddur] We can say that Israel is still far away from the requirements of peace. Whenever the two delegations reach the main point, namely, total withdrawal from the Golan, the Israelis start talking about the fruits of peace. The Israelis have not shown any signs that they will withdraw from the Golan. They have not said they are ready to carry out a total withdrawal from the Golan, although they know that Syria will not relinquish any inch of its land. Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 are the basis for the peace process. Israel entered the negotiations aware of this. These two resolutions stipulate Israel's withdrawal from all the territories that were occupied in 1967. [Fathi] There is much talk about Egypt's role in the peace negotiations. How do you view that role? [Qaddur] The Egyptian minister of state for foreign affairs has said that Egypt is an Arab state and is not, as some Western papers are saying, playing the role of a mediator. Egypt is not playing the role of a mediator but is an Arab party, like Syria and other Arab parties, that is seeking peace in the region. It has more freedom than some Arab parties due to the state of its international relations. It is an Arab country and it is eager to preserve Arab rights. There is a wide-scale coordination between Syria and Egypt on the highest level, especially between President Hafiz al-Asad and President Husni Mubarak, to achieve a comprehensive and just peace. This is an aspect of the distinguished relations between the two countries.
