"The U.S. announcement on January 6 of its intention to reduce quotas for Chinese textile imports by 25-35 per cent was unreasonable, flimsy and in total ignorance of international and bilateral agreements," pointed out Li Zhongzhou, a deputy director general for international relations of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec). The U.S. move has run counter to the Uruguay Round of talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), which wound up last month with a new agreement to phase out quota restrictions on textiles within 10 years, he told China Daily yesterday. "We cannot help doubting the sincerity of the U.S. in honouring multilateral agreements, with its steep rise in quota restrictions against China shortly after the birth of the Gatt Uruguay package," he said. The U.S. decision has also trampled on the Multi-Fibre Arrangement of which both China and the U.S. are signatories, he explained. The arrangement stipulates that the quota imposed by an importing nation or region on any textile product must not be less than its actual import volume during the previous year. And the importer must increase the amount of imports under quota management by at least 6 per cent per year. Li said the U.S. practically has not increased quotas for Chinese textile imports. The latest massive reduction "speaks volumes about the fact that the U.S. is binding other nations, but not itself, to international agreements. He said the U.S. also has ignored the eighth provision of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement, which rules that an importer should first consult with an exporter if the former claims illicit exports from the latter. If the two sides can't reach a solution, they should resort to the Textile Surveillance Body (TSB). "The U.S. apparently has not complied with this practice," Li said. He said the U.S. lacks sufficient proof for its charges against China's "massive illicit transshipments." "And whatever proof it has, the U.S. can hardly justify its reduction by as much as 25-35 per cent," he asserted. It is obvious that the U.S. is seeking trade protectionism under the veneer of stopping illicit transshipments, he added. He also blamed the U.S. for being unwilling to join hands with China to clamp down on such illegal activities. He said China had hoped to set up a strict inspection system in co-operation with the U.S. to combat the problem, but the U.S. has insisted on its right to slash China's quotas unilaterally. "The U.S. is not ready to co-operate in the least sense." he said. He urged the U.S. to revoke its decision and return to the negotiation table to find a satisfying solution. "Otherwise, China will be forced to submit the dispute to the arbitration of the TSB, and respond with retaliatory measures," he said.
