The great leader President Kim Il-song in his New Year address defined this year as an agriculture-first year and put forward a task to concentrate efforts on the agricultural production. Last year the agricultural working people in Pyongwon County did farming on a scientific and technical basis as demanded by the chuche method of farming, thus producing 40,000 more tons of grain than in the preceding year. They are concentrating on farming preparations, having set themselves the high goal of topping last year's harvest by 30,000 tons this year in which falls the 30th anniversary of the publication of the rural theses (February 25, 1964). The county overfulfilled its plan of compost production, a part of farming preparations for this year, on January 20 and has carried most of it out to the paddy and non-paddy fields. All preparations for sowing seed rice on cold-frame beds including windbreak fence, humus soil and high-yield seeds have been completed in the main on the cooperative farms in the county. The repair and readjustment of tractors and rice-transplanting, rice seedling-plucking, weeding and other farm machines is being hastened at the final stage. The county carried out the cleaning of two hundred odd kilometre- long waterways and the repair and readjustment of hundreds of water pumps, electric motors, and transformers 20 days ealier than last year. Meanwhile, the Pyongwon automobile parts factory, the Pyongwon garment factory and other factories and enterprises in the county have manufactured a number of minor farm implements and sent them to cooperative farms. In recent few days the county secured 671,000 pieces of minor farm implements of 106 kinds and quantities of farming materials through an all-people campaign.
