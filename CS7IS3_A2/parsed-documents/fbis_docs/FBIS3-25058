Controversial Returned Exiles Committee President Pat Hlongwane, told a Radio Transkei talk-show on Sunday [6 February] his organisation was determined to track down and eliminate the top ANC leaders responsible for all the atrocities in ANC camps in Angola and Zambia. Mr Hlongwane said Transkei military leder Maj-Gen Bantu Holomisa was also on their hit list because Gen Holomisa had not assisted with investigations into the death of returned exile, Sipho Phungulwa, who was allegedly gunned down by Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- MK] members at the Ngangelizwe township outside Umtata five years ago. "We were on the verge of assassinating him (Gen Holomisa) the other year at the Carlton Hotel in Johannesburg, but we missed him," Mr Hlongwane said. Mr Hlongwane called Gen Holomisa "a political prostitute" whom he said was appointed by South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha. The Transkei leader, however, had changed his allegiance to the ANC when Mr Mandela was released. Asked about his relationship with the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement -- AWB], Mr Hlongwane said he had met the AWB leadership and attended a rally on Saturday. He said he had approached the AWB in a bid to secure arms to protect himself against threatened attacks by Gen Holomisa. Mr Hlongwane said he would align himself with any party taking an anti-communist stance during the forthcoming elections.
