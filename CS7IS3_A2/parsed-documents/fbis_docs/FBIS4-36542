Are you satisfied? [Benbitour] The rescheduling is based on an economic program that was examined with the IMF. The agreement we signed with the Paris Club reduces the foreign debt by $5 billion (out of a total of $26 billion -- LE FIG-ECO editorial note). As we hope that these credits will be made available quickly, the rescheduling should make it possible for us to finance the program. [Nicaud] When taking the IMF, the World Bank, and the European Union into account, how much money do you hope will be made available? [Benbitour] A total of $1 billion from the IMF, another $1 billion from the other institutions, and $5 billion from the rescheduling. This does not include bilateral assistance in the form of commodity credits. [Nicaud] Did France make a special effort? [Benbitour] France stated that it would maintain the level of the financing facilities that it has previously made available to us (5-6 billion French francs -- LE FIG-ECO editorial note). However, the most important thing is the quick availability of the credits. Indeed, when launching a recovery program, negative effects such as the rise in the price of products following a devaluation (dinar was devalued by almost 50 percent) come immediately, whereas positive effects come later. This difficult period for the people must be limited. It is a question of credibility. [Nicaud] Does this rescheduling not come too late? [Benbitour] It comes at the right time. Over the last six years, foreign debt has represented 75 percent of export earnings. In 1993, it rose to 86 percent and it could have exceeded 90 percent this year if there had been no rescheduling. As you know, Algeria lives mainly on its exports of hydrocarbons. In 1991, Algerian oil was worth $21 a barrel. This year, we have planned the budget on a $15 basis. Each dollar less per barrel represents a $500 loss in income for the whole year. In six years, Algeria had to cut its imports by half. Because of a lack of supplies, namely, spare parts, the industrial sector is operating only at 50 percent of capacity. [Nicaud] The Paris Club agreement complements a readjustment program jointly developed with the IMF. What are the next steps? [Benbitour] We will concentrate our efforts on reducing the budget deficit from 9.2 percent of GDP last year to 3.2 percent in 1994. This objective is possible due to the devaluation of the dinar. [Nicaud] With 2 million people out of work, unemployment remains the number one problem in Algeria. What impact do you expect your program to have on employment? [Benbitour] Nearly 250,000 people enter the labor market each year. Up till now, the government has granted money to anyone whose income does not exceed a certain amount. We would now like to give compensation to those who engage in public utility activities. This requires a complete remodeling of the system. Besides the gas industry, we are targeting growth in those sectors employing a large number of workers.
