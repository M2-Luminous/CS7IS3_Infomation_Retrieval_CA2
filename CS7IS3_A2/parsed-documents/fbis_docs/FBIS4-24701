Guangdong's annual investment in fixed assets currently accounts for approximately one-tenth of the country's total. Today, at a time when macroeconomic regulation and control are being intensified, whether Guangdong is able to effectively reduce its investment has become a central issue in the course of economic development this year. Over the past two years, Guangdong has witnessed the most heated economy since the beginning of reform and opening up in the province, and the scope of investment has swollen rapidly. In 1992, the province's investment in fixed assets exceeded 70 billion yuan, accounting for approximately one-tenth of the country's total of more than 750 billion yuan. This represented an increase of 92 percent, which was 54 percentage points higher than the national average. Last year, affected by macroeconomic regulation and control, investment was reduced to a certain extent, but investment in fixed assets was still booming and exceeded 146 billion yuan during the entire year, representing an increase of 58 percent over 1992. The drastic expansion of the scale of investment has injected vitality into Guangdong's economy and has played an indispensable supporting role in rapid economic operations. Experts here maintain that the approximate 20 percent economic growth rate in Guangdong last year was obviously due to the substantial increase in investment there. Last year, the province accelerated its construction of infrastructure facilities with the aid of sharp increases in investment. A total of 26 key projects with an investment amount of over 1 billion yuan each were established, and quite a few infrastructure facilities were completed and put into production, laying down the foundation for rapid economic development. However, the growth of investment in fixed assets at a super-rapid speed for two consecutive years has also given rise to the problem of "swollen investment," which has had the following negative impacts: 1) The funding shortage has meant that funds have not been available for a number of construction projects and have affected the macroeconomic results of investments, 2) The sky-rocketing prices of building materials -- that of plate glass has practically doubled -- have constituted an inflationary pressure. According to statistics, the total amount of investment projects under construction in Guangdong during the past two years exceeded 370 billion yuan. A number of major reform measures will be introduced this year. Guangdong has proposed to properly handle the relationships between reform, stability, and development and to strengthen its control over the scale of investment in fixed assets. As has been revealed, a set of regulations on managing investment in fixed assets is currently being drafted. This indicates that Guangdong has given consideration to fixed assets investment on a long-term basis. Guangdong has adopted six measures to reduce investment in fixed assets this year. One one hand, it has done what it could to ensure the funds required by the key projects, and, on the other, it has strictly implemented an investment licensing system to control the initiation of projects. Judging from the first quarter of this year, investment in fixed assets has been brought under control. The investment of 2.9 billion yuan in 33 key construction projects has been fulfilled with good progress, and investment in fixed assets amounting to 16.3 billion yuan has also been fulfilled. This represents an increase of 51 percent, which is lower than that of the corresponding period last year. As predicted by specialists, the growth of investment in fixed assets will be more appropriately controlled within 40 percent in Guangdong this year. Nevertheless, Guangdong is still faced with quite a few thorny problems in controlling investment in fixed assets: First, the task will be difficult and the road will be long as the province tries to reduce the investment scale of state-owned enterprises. Last year, in the multiple economic sectors, investment of state-owned enterprises in fixed assets increased by the largest margin, reaching 71 percent. Due to the transformation of operational mechanisms, enterprises now possess more decisionmaking powers and have the right to define the orientation of investment, and this will certainly give rise to the issue of unnatural expansion in investment. Solving this issue is particularly difficult for the government. Second, investment projects under construction last year involving more than 200 million yuan will be transferred to this year, and this will make controlling the overall scale of investments for this year considerably difficult.
