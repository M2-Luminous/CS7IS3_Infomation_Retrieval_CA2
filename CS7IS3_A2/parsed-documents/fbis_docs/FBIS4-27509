The speakers at the rallies said that the South Korean workers were paid less than one fourth of the minimum living cost for their intensive labour of longest working hour in the world. But the Kim Yong-sam group is pursuing even the wage-curbing policy under the pretext of "share of pains", they noted. Charging that the South Korean puppet clique issued an order to brand the struggle of the workers for wage hike and "labour-management dispute" as illegal to severely counter them and mobilised all the repressive forces to crack down on them at the point of bayonet, they said: "If the South Korean workers vacillate in the present-day struggle or pin any illusion and expectation on the authorities and enterpreneurs, it will result in binding them faster to the chains of oppression and capital," the speakers said, and stressed: The South Korean workers must give a teaching to the exploiters in concerted efforts. The South Korean workers must wage a vigorous struggle to get U.S. imperialist forces of aggression withdrawn from South Korea, abolish the fascist laws and repressive tools, let the present "civilian" government resign and establish a genuine independent government. The working class in the northern palf of Korea will achieve the reunification of the country without fail by pooling efforts with the South Korean workers.
