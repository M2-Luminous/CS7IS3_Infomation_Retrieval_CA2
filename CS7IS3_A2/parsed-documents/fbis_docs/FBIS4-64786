The labor market, they say, is a late indicator of economic trends, and provides few conclusions about the overall economic situation. The 20 largest German industrial enterprises will shed a total of 50,000 jobs in 1994, compared to more than 100,000 jobs shed in 1993. Most of the jobs will disappear through earlier retirement or natural fluctuations. The Automobile Industry Association says: "Regardless of the economic recovery, the negative trend is continuing, although a slight improvement can be noted." The Association of German Machinery and Equipment Producers says: "The situation is still deteriorating. The reduction of jobs in some enterprises is greater than the demand for jobs in others." The Central Electrical Industry Association says: "The fall in employment is gradually slowing down, but a total stop is not expected until the middle of the year." The planned reduction of jobs in this sector until the end of the year is 10,000. The Metal Industry Employers Association says: "We still have a surplus of jobs, but the restructuring is continuing. One-third of our firms wants to transfer a part of their production to more cost-effective foreign territories." The Chemical Employers Association says: "The personnel reduction is continuing, though not as much as in 1993."
