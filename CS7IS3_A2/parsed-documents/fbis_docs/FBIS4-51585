Tan Sri Muhammad Muhd. Taib, chairman of the UMNO Liaison Committee for the Federal Territory and Selangor, said yesterday that a review should be made of UMNO membership lists and voter lists to ensure that all members become voters in general elections. He said that UMNO members who are found qualified to vote but have not registered should be helped to register. "It is regrettable that there are UMNO members who are qualified to vote but are not registered as voters," he said today after attending a meeting for the signing of a cooperative agreement between the Selangor Foundation and Pembinaan Mitra Jaya Sdn. [Incorporated] Bhd. [Limited] (PMJ). Last Friday [25 March], UMNO Vice President Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak, who is also chairman of the UMNO Membership Enlargement Committee, said that 388,466 UMNO members who are qualified to vote have not yet registered. Muhammad said the UMNO Liaison Committee for the Federal Territory and Selangor will discuss the issue, primarily to determine the exact number of UMNO members over 21 years of age who have not registered as voters. He said those who are 18 are qualified to be UMNO members but cannot yet register as voters.
