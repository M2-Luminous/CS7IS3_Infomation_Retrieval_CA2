The report of the coup was circulated after the distribution of a hand-written statement in Djibouti city. The report was carried by AFP three days ago. In a statement to AL-HAYAH, Ahmed Dini stressed that he is in constant contact with the other members of the political and military leadership, who told him that the "information leaked by the government and the quarters colluding with it are absolutely baseless." He went on: "Under the interception policy pursued by the government of President Hassan Gouled Aptidon, it is trying to fabricate a coup and problems inside the opposition, instead of working to solve the country's endless problems." Asked about the military situation in north Djibouti, he said: "On 3 March government forces tried to infiltrate our positions in the Mabla area between Tadjoura and Wabekh [as transliterated], but they were forced to return to their bases after suffering heavy losses in lives and equipment." [passage omitted] Concluding his statement, Ahmed Dini Ahmed said: "A few weeks ago I made extensive contacts with most leaders of the Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy and decided in principle to hold an emergency meeting on 20 March to discuss military and political developments in the light of my visit -- the first of its kind -- to Belgium, Germany, and Italy."
