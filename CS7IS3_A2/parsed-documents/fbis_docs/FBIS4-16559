"We would like to express our deep regret and our condolences to the relatives and friends of those who died," the diplomat said in an interview with Interfax today. "However, the incident has caused us serious concern since this happened in the so-called no flight zone in Iraqi Kurdistan, to the north of the 32nd parallel, controlled by the "coalition deterrence forces" consisting of air units of the Western participants in the anti-Iraqi coalition, the activities of which were not defined by appropriate international decisions," the Russian diplomat emphasized. He said the world community should expect careful and impartial investigations into this tragic incident and to be informed on all the details of it.
