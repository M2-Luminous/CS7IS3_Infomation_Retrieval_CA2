A high-ranking official at the South Korean Embassy in Washington disclosed that Christopher conveyed the U.S. Government's position to the South Korean Government through Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord. Christopher said the United States would continue consultations on sanctions against Pyongyang at the U.N. Security Council until it became apparent that North Korea had frozen its nuclear development program. Meanwhile, South Korean Ambassador to Washington Han Sung-su met with Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci to exchange views on American policy toward North Korea, which seems muddled after Carter's recent statement in Pyongyang. At the meeting, Gallucci was quoted by the high-ranking official as stressing that "Carter's statement in Pyongyang is not the official position of America."
