Since the Oslo agreement, Israel has been submitting proposals which contradicted the core and the articles of the agreements in all areas of security, administration and economy; a matter that might result in an organized form of occupation instead of ending it. The Israeli side to the negotiations proposes limited and restricted prerogatives for the Palestinian police force. It also proposes a map of the withdrawal from Gaza Strip that will in fact lead to the enlargement of the settlements, as this map stretches to 13 kms along the Palestinian coast and other area in parallel to the Green Line. This is done to weaken and marginalize the role of the Palestinian authority; and to maintain the control of the occupation in a camouflaged way. These Israeli stances and proposals are responsible for a lack of a real progress in the negotiations, and for reaching the date of 13 April without achieving any results; contrary to the claims of the government of Rabin that is trying to blame this delay on the PLO. The Palestinian position, expressed following the Hebron massacre and the suspension of negotiations, is not the reason behind the lack of progress. On the contrary, the facts confirm that Israel's measures, taken in the aftermath of the massacre by imposing wide-ranging sanctions against the Palestinian people represented in the imposition of a curfew, an economic embargo, acts of killings committed by forces of occupation in Hebron and Gaza, and especially the assassination of six cadres from the PLO's militants are responsible for such a delay of progress. All this represents the real reason behind a delay in the negotiations; and behind stripping them from any seriousness and credibility. The Israeli proposals, currently submitted on the negotiating table in Cairo, continue to revolve around the same framework, i.e., they aim to strip the agreement of the transitional phase from its content; and a replace the withdrawal with new forms of occupation and hegemony. The government of Israel bears responsibility for the quasi-impasse that the peace negotiations have reached. There are no indications that point to the serious desire of the Israeli Government to reach a fundamental progress during the coming weeks. The PLO will deal with this situation from the point of view of our experience in the negotiations of the past months and the negative results that we have reached, to protect the interests and rights to our people; and to establish the peace process on serious and effective foundations.
