FR940202-1-00048 FR940202-1-00015 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 661 [Docket No. 940120&hyph;4020; I.D. No. 011094A] RIN No. 0648&hyph;AE05 Ocean Salmon Fisheries Off the Coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) requests public comments on a proposed rule to implement Amendment 11 (amendment) to the Fishery Management Plan for Commercial and Recreational Salmon Fisheries Off the Coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California (FMP). Amendment 11 would modify the spawning escapement goal for Oregon coastal natural (OCN) coho salmon and the criteria for establishing and managing subarea allocations for recreational coho salmon harvest south of Cape Falcon, Oregon (45 ○46 ’00 ’ ’ N. lat.). The amendment is intended to: (1) Address persistent low OCN coho stock abundance and annual escapement goals below maximum sustainable yield (MSY); (2) to prevent imbalances in recreational coho harvest allocation at low allowable harvest levels; and (3) to prevent the frequent use of emergency rulemaking to implement annual management measures. DATES: Written comments on the amendment and the proposed rule must be received by March 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be sent to J. Gary Smith, Acting Director, Northwest Region, National Marine Fisheries Service, 7600 Sand Point Way NE., BIN C15700-Bldg. 1, Seattle, WA 98115-0070, or Dr. Gary Matlock, Acting Director, Southwest Region, National Marine Fisheries Service, 501 West Ocean Blvd., suite 4200, Long Beach, CA 90802&hyph;4213. Copies of the amendment, including the environmental assessment and the regulatory impact review/initial regulatory flexibility analysis, are available from Lawrence D. Six, Executive Director, Pacific Fishery Management Council, Metro Center, suite 420, 2000 SW. First Avenue, Portland, OR 97201&hyph;5344. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 0 William L. Robinson at 206&hyph;526&hyph;6140, Rodney R. McInnis at 310&hyph;980&hyph;4040, or Lawrence D. Six at 503&hyph;326&hyph;6352. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The ocean salmon fisheries in the exclusive economic zone of the United States (3 to 200 miles offshore) in the Pacific Ocean off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California are managed under the FMP. The FMP was developed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. (Magnuson Act), and approved by the Secretary in 1978. Since then, the FMP has been amended 10 times, with implementing regulations codified at 50 CFR part 661. From 1979 to 1983, the FMP was amended annually. In 1984, a framework amendment was implemented that provided the mechanism for making preseason and inseason adjustments in the regulations without annual amendments. Amendments to the framework FMP were implemented in 1987, 1988, 1989, and 1991. The Council prepared Amendment 11 to the FMP and submitted it to the Secretary for approval under the provisions of the Magnuson Act. On January 10, 1994, the Secretary began formal review of the amendment. A notice of availability for Amendment 11 was filed with the Office of the Federal Register on January 14, 1994, announcing a public comment period on the amendment. The FMP amendment process for Amendment 11 was initiated at the April 6&hyph;9, 1993, Council meeting with the presentation of several alternative proposals by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) to address OCN coho salmon management concerns. Council discussions at its September 15&hyph;17, 1993, meeting identified three alternatives, in addition to the status quo, requiring further analyses. A draft amendment was prepared and distributed to interested persons for review in October 1993. Comments were invited, and public hearings were held November 8&hyph;10, 1993, in Tillamook and Coos Bay, Oregon, and Eureka, California (58 FR 57978, October 28, 1993). During the public hearings, the ODFW and the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) presented for Council consideration a joint recommendation regarding recreational allocation. After considering the comments received on the draft amendment at the public hearing and Council meetings, and from its Salmon Technical Team, Salmon Advisory Subpanel, and Scientific and Statistical Committee, the Council, at its November 17&hyph;19, 1993, meeting, selected the preferred alternative, which is based on the joint recommendation by the ODFW and CDFG. The Council's recommendation is a modification of the alternatives described in the draft amendment for public review and falls within the scope of those alternatives. The purpose of Amendment 11 is to modify the spawning escapement goal for OCN coho salmon, and the criteria for establishing and managing, when harvest levels are low, subarea allocations for recreational coho salmon harvest south of Cape Falcon, Oregon. The OCN coho stock is composed of naturally produced coho salmon from Oregon coastal streams. OCN coho are important contributors to the ocean salmon harvest, as the stock aggregate constitutes the largest component of naturally produced coho caught in ocean salmon fisheries off Oregon and California. In any given year, OCN coho stock numbers are used to set the allowable coho harvest rate for combined natural and hatchery production for the area south of Cape Falcon.
