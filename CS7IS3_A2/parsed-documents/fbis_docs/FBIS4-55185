Bosnian Croat delegation head Kresimir Zubak said that there are problems surrounding the issue of the borders and that they could be resolved only as part of a package. The Muslim side has proposed that Herzegovina be divided into two cantons: one Croat and the other with power-sharing on a parity basis. On the other hand, the Croatian side insists on a single Herzegovina. Muslim delegation head Haris Silajdzic said that he expects nothing from today's negotiations in the U.S. Embassy in Vienna.
