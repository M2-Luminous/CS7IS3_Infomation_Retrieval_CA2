FR940207-2-00176 FR940207-2-00080 B. The CDSC Arrangement 1. The Fund proposes to implement a CDSC arrangement for Class B shares (the ``Class B CDSC''). If Class B shares are redeemed within six years after the end of the calendar month in which a purchase order was accepted, a CDSC will be imposed by applying a specified percentage ranging from 1% to 5% to the lesser of the aggregate net asset value of the shares at the time of purchase, or the aggregate net asset value of the shares at the time of redemption. The existing schedule may be modified in the future, and other schedules with different percentages and periods may apply to different classes created in the future. Any variations in the CDSC schedule will be set forth in the applicable prospectus. Any change in the terms of the CDSC would not affect shares already issued unless the change resulted in terms more favorable to the holders of such shares. 2. No Class B CDSC will be imposed on (a) redemptions of shares held for more than six years after the end of the calendar month in which the purchase order was accepted, (b) amounts representing an increase in the value of a shareholder's account due to increases in the net asset value per share, or (c) shares acquired through reinvestment of income dividends or capital gains distributions. In determining the rate of any applicable CDSC, it will be assumed that a redemption is made first of shares that are not subject to the Class B CDSC and then of shares held for the longest period of time. This will result in the CDSC being imposed at the lowest possible rate. 3. Applicants may waive the Class B CDSC in the following instances: (a) Retirement distributions to participants or beneficiaries from (i) retirement plans qualified under section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (``Code''), (ii) Code section 403(b)(7) plans, (iii) deferred compensation plans under Code section 457, and (iv) other employee benefit plans, following retirement, termination of employment, as the result of a loan made by a retirement plan that permits loans, as the result of the hardship of a plan participant (to the extent permitted by the Code), and/or the attainment of age 591/2 of a plan participant (if such payments are made pursuant to a systematic withdrawal plan where the payments do not exceed the then applicable effective maximum free withdrawal amount, annually of the value of the account); (b) distributions from IRAs prior to and/or following the attainment of age 591/2 (if such payments are made pursuant to a systematic withdrawal plan where the payments do not exceed the then effective maximum free withdrawal amount, annually of the value of the account); (c) redemptions made following the death or disability (as defined in the Code) of a shareholder; (d) distributions and redemptions made automatically and periodically pursuant to a systematic withdrawal plan where the payments do not exceed the then effective maximum free withdrawal amount, annually of the value of the account; (e) a tax-free return of excess contributions made to any retirement plan; (f) the combination of the Fund or any Series of the Fund with any other investment company by merger, acquisition of assets, or otherwise; and (g) redemptions effected pursuant to the Series' right to liquidate a shareholder's account if the aggregate net asset value of shares held in the account is less than the then applicable effective minimum account size. If any of the waiver categories are offered and subsequently discontinued, appropriate disclosure will be made in the applicable prospectus and investors who purchased their shares prior to such change will continue to be entitled to such CDSC waivers. In addition, if a Fund waives or reduces a CDSC, such waiver or reduction will be uniformly applied to all shares in the specified category. 4. A shareholder will be credited with any CDSC paid in connection with a redemption of any Class B shares followed by a reinvestment in Class B shares of such Series or another Series within a time period specified in the current prospectus of the Fund, currently anticipated to be 90 days after such redemption. The credit will be paid by the Distributor. Applicants' Legal Analysis 1. Applicants request an order exempting them from the provisions of sections 18(f)(1), 18(g), and 18(i) of the Act to the extent that the proposed issuance and sale of various classes of shares representing interests in the Fund might be deemed: (a) To result in a ``senior security'' within the meaning of section 18(g), the issuance and sale of which would be prohibited by section 18(f)(1); and (b) to violate the equal voting provisions of section 18(i).
