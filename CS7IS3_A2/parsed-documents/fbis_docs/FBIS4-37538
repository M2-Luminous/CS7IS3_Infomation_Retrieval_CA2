In a statement to the IRAQI NEWS AGENCY, the minister said that participants in the conference have decided to retain until the end of this year the OPEC's current output ceiling of 24.5 million barrels per day. He added that Iraq's participation in the conference has proved its positive role in serving the organization's goals of protecting the interests of the OPEC member states. The minister also said he had held meetings with oil ministers on the sidelines of the conference to explain the impact of the economic blockade imposed on Iraq--a blockade which has prevented Iraq from investing its oil wealth. He added that during these meetings, he asserted that Iraq would return to the oil market as soon as the blockade is lifted, would remain a positive factor, and would exert every effort to maintain OPEC's interests.
