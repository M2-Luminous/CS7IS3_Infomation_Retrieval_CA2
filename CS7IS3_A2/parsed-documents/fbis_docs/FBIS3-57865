The number of asylum seekers last year decreased by approximately 100,000 -- from 438,000 to 322,000, which is 26.4 percent less than in 1992. This is what Federal Interior Minister Manfred Kanther (Christian Democratic Union) says in his latest asylum report (which is still secret). The upshot: "The declining tendency has stabilized." In the last month, in December, there were no more than 14,000 asylum applications (in the same month of the previous year, the figure was 32,000). The main countries of origin in 1993 were what is left of Yugoslavia (73,000), Romania (73,000), Bulgaria (23,000), and Turkey (20,000).
