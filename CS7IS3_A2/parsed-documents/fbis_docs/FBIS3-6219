Global unemployment involves many structural problems, he stressed at a regular news conference after a morning cabinet meeting, but he acknowledged Japan is likely to be under fire at the Detroit meeting for its stubborn current account surplus. The ministerial meeting of seven industrialized powers is a place for broad debate on dealing with unemployment, Fujii said. He repeated that Japan is trying to boost domestic demand, which would help curb the imbalance, expressing hope for "large effects" from last month's 15 trillion yen economic stimulus package. He also repeated that Japan is crafting measures to further open its markets, promote new business and restructure industry. Asked if Japan could explain its views adequately without the finance minister present, Fujii said he thinks Labor Minister Chikara Sakaguchi is "clearly" explaining the Japanese position in Detroit. Fujii said there are no bilateral meetings officially scheduled at a meeting later this week of finance ministers from members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, but that he favors such exchanges. Asked if he wants to meet separately with his U.S. counterpart Lloyd Bentsen, Fujii said only that he favors bilateral meetings with "several people."
