Matsunaga will attend the two-day conference, which begins next Tuesday, in place of the three cabinet ministers who have been forced to skip the OECD meeting due to a tight parliamentary schedule, the official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said. It has been customary for Japan to send the chiefs of MITI, the Foreign Ministry and the Economic Planning Agency to the annual OECD meeting. All of the Group of Seven major industrial countries except Japan will dispatch cabinet ministers to this year's gathering, which will focus on three key topics of growth and employment, reinforcing multilateral trade systems and a new role of the OECD amid the rapid change in the international situation.
