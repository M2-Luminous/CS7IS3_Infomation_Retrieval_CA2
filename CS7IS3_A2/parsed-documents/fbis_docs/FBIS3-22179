The area suitable for agriculture is 27,349 square kilometers; evergreen forests account for another 28,353 square kilometers; deciduous forests, 23,434; and as for maritime coastal resources, the southern zone has most of the mangrove forests with 46,756 hectares. The country's water resources include 19 important rivers, of which the largest are: the Patuca, Ulua, Chamelecon and Aguan Rivers in the Atlantic zone; and the Choluteca and Nacaome in the Pacific zone. These natural resources are undergoing great pressure from unscrupulous investors who stop at no outrage to obtain a few millions, without concerning themselves about the rest of the population. According to studies, approximately 100,000 hectares of evergreen, deciduous, and mangrove forests were destroyed this year [1993]. The causes were various: forest fires, migrant farming, extensive livestock raising, poor land distribution and ownership, timber exports, use as firewood, salt production, and the shrimping industry. The rivers suffer most from these problems, since into them are discarded garbage, construction debris, silt, fecal matter, industrial wastes, and dangerous chemical residues, such as nondegradable fertilizers, pesticides, and fungicides. Drought also contributes resulting in most medium-sized and small streams drying up, reducing the volume of water carried by the principal rivers. The environmental problems that affect people are alarming, including: a rise in the temperature, erosion, droughts and floods, poor agricultural production, respiratory, contagious, and infectious diseases, skin allergies, and cancerous growths. In order to halt this accelerated process of self-destruction, experts in environmental affairs recommend stricter laws, institutional responsibility, more resources and better management for environmental protection, inventories and data centers for protected areas, and better programs for promoting public awareness through environmental education. Respect by politicians for renewable natural resources is also necessary, since any damage to these resources is irreversible.
