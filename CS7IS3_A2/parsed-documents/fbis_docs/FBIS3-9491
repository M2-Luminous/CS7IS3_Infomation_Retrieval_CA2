[Kucan] Good evening. [Hochner] Mr. President, only 40 km south of your country a war is still going on, even though now there appear to be signs of a peaceful solution for Bosnia. How optimistic are you that what now looks like the beginning of a peace settlement will bring real peace to Bosnia? [Kucan] We have to be optimists. What is currently going on is still a consequence of the exhaustion caused by this senseless war and of the world's bad conscience as a result of its inadequate commitment. This should have happened long ago. The fact remains that the solution to this crisis now involves Brussels, Washington, and Zagreb, on the one hand, and Moscow and Belgrade, on the other. These are now, finally, the proper partners, who may be able to influence the course of the war, and who may achieve the pacification of the area and turn war into peace. However, this is far from being the solution to the crisis in the Balkans. [Hochner] You have come to Austria to ask for Austrian support for Slovenia's ambition to join the European Union [EU]. From where does Slovenia's desire arise? Is it participation in Europe's economic market or do security issues constitute a decisive factor? [Kucan] Slovenia's desire to be included in the process of European integration is understandable and is related to the desire of all former East bloc countries. It pertains not only to economic issues but also to political issues and matters of security policy, particularly as a result of the fact that you mentioned at the beginning, namely that the war is still raging only 40 km away from Slovenia. Still, we are interested in getting closer to the EU primarily to achieve democratization of relations within Slovenia, and to achieve the consolidation of democratic institutions, also as far as relations between the civilian state and the defense and military complex are concerned. [Hochner] The biggest political problem between Slovenia and Austria, or rather the biggest problem in terms of economic policy, is Slovenia's huge trade balance deficit with Austria. In case Austria joins the EU do you expect that this would also improve Slovenia's access to the Austrian market, and do you not fear that, as a EU member, Austria would insulate itself more strongly against Slovenia? [Kucan] The trade balance deficit is indeed a major problem. The two sides, especially the two governments, are determined to solve this problem because it has reached a political dimension. In December, Prime Minister Drnovsek paid a visit to Vienna and the issue was discussed at great length. Nevertheless, there are differing approaches to solving the problem, there are several possibilities. Should Austria become a EU member on 1 January 1995, the solution would be of a certain kind, and if it does not, then it might also make sense to discuss a free trade agreement. [Hochner] Looking at the difficulties within the EU in connection with the enlargement by Austria and the three other membership candidates, when do you expect the EU to be ready to enlarge the community by countries in eastern and southeastern Europe, notably Slovenia? [Kucan] It is a question of interest and of clearer views on what the future of Europe should look like. The more the EU enlarges, the more intense internal relations will become. Any enlargement also means a higher level of integration, which in turn means that antagonistic positions on principles will deteriorate, namely the principle of consensus as the basic principle within the EU, and on the other hand, the principle of efficiency. After all, if a union is not efficient its very existence does not make sense. Still, in a democratic community such antagonisms are not irreconcilable, but it is difficult to solve such problems. I think that at the moment these quandaries are occurring with Austria [words indistinct] London-Vienna -- which only proves that enlargement and integration will be very difficult. [Hochner] Thank you very much for the interview, Mr. President.
