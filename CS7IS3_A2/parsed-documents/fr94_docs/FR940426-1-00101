ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: EPA is proposing to approve revisions to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Florida through the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) for the purpose of establishing a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (PROGRAM), which will be fully implemented by November 1994. This implementation plan was submitted by FDEP on February 24, 1993, to satisfy the federal mandate, found in section 507 of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (CAA), to ensure that small businesses have access to the technical assistance and regulatory information necessary to comply with the CAA. DATES: To be considered, comments must be received by May 26, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to Mr. Carlton R. Layne at the EPA Region IV address listed below. Copies of the material submitted by FDEP may be examined during normal business hours at the following locations: Environmental Protection Agency, Region IV Air Programs Branch, 345 Courtland Street, Atlanta, Georgia 30365. Air Resources Management Division, Florida Department of Environmental Protection, Twin Towers Office Building, 2600 Blair Stone Road, Tallahassee, Florida 32399&hyph;2400. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Carlton R. Layne of the EPA Region IV Air Programs Branch at 404&hyph;347&hyph;2864 or at the above address. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Implementation of the CAA will require small businesses to comply with specific regulations in order for areas to attain and maintain the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the emission of air toxics. In anticipation of the impact of these requirements on small businesses, the CAA requires that states adopt a PROGRAM, and submit this PROGRAM as a revision to the federally approved SIP. In addition, the CAA directs the EPA to oversee the small business assistance program and report to Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing a PROGRAM are set out in section 507 of Title V of the CAA and the EPA guidance document Guidelines for the Implementation of section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. In order to gain full approval, the state submittal must provide for each of the following PROGRAM elements: (1) The establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide technical and compliance assistance to small businesses; (2) The establishment of a state Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory process; and (3) The creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP. FDEP has met the following requirements of section 507 of Title V of the CAA by submitting a SIP revision that implements the following required PROGRAM elements and implementation schedules. The PROGRAM will be fully implemented by November 15, 1994. 1. Small Business Assistance Program FDEP has established a Small Business Section (SBS) which will incorporate the following six requirements set forth in section 507 of title V of the CAA: A.
