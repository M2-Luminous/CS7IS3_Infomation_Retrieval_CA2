The opening ceremony was presided over by Governor Ma Zhongchen. [passage omitted] In his speech, Li Changchun first analyzed the province's current agricultural and rural situation. He said: Following the deepening of reform in the 1990's, Henan's economy has entered a new development period. Agriculture has started transforming from a single type of cultivation structure into an overall aspect embracing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries. Industry, commerce, construction, and transportation are are undergoing comprehensive transformation. The rural economy is developing from the small-peasant economy into an open socialist market economy. Most peasants are beginning to move toward moderate prosperity after resolving the problem of adequate food and clothing. New vitality and vigor are emerging in the entire agriculture and rural economy. In the last three years, grain output has remained at more than 30 billion kg and stood at 35.3 billion kg last year, a record high in history. The output of cotton, tobacco, and oil-bearing crops has remained stable. Forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries have seen comparatively great development. After topping 100 billion yuan in 1992, the gross output value of township and town enterprises throughout the province continued to grow in 1993 and was expected to reach 195 billion yuan, an increase of 62.5 percent over the previous year. In 1993 the peasant per capita net income was estimated at 660 yuan, an increase of 133 yuan over 1990. He pointed out: We must soberly understand that prominent problems obstructing the province's agricultural and rural economic development have not been fundamentally resolved. New contradictions and problems have emerged in rural reform, opening up, and economic development. Peasant income increases slowly, the rural socialized service system is imperfect, agricultural investment is inadequate, agriculture is not strong at resisting natural disasters, there are many instable factors in rural areas, peasant burdens have not been fundamentally resolved, and the situation in the social order is grim. [passage omitted] In conclusion, Li Changchun pointed out: Henan is a big agricultural province, in which agriculture and the rural economy play a decisive role in entire national economic and social development. There is a need to strengthen party leadership over rural work to bring about faster and better development in the rural economy. Leading cadres at all levels should constantly improve their work style and work methods, strengthen their study and investigation, and enhance their leadership level. [passage omitted]
