"Pyongyang seems to have decided to accept nuclear inspections because it wanted to deal with economic problems such as food shortages and to keep relations with the international community from deteriorating further. The Japanese Government regards Pyongyang's decision as a change in attitude toward the international community, and so decided to work to restart negotiations with Pyongyang on normalizing ties," NHK said. Negotiations between Japan and North Korea broke off at the eighth round of talks in Beijing in November 1992, when Tokyo demanded an investigation into the alleged abduction of a Japanese woman named "Yi Un-hui." North Korean terrorist Kim Hyon-hui, who planted a bomb on a South Korean airplane that exploded over the Andaman Sea off Myanmar in November 1987, confessed that she had learned Japanese from a Japanese woman who had been abducted from Japan to Pyongyang by North Korean agents. Pyongyang refused the investigation demand and no meetings between Tokyo and Pyongyang have been held since.
