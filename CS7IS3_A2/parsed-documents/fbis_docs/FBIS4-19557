Bloodthirsty conflicts are breaking out around the world, but America seems not to see them. This is how future historians will describe American foreign policy in recent years. On the one hand, fraternal words, perhaps the most encouraging words, displaying the most solidarity and the most human sentiments since the Kennedy era. And, on the other hand, an almost complete absence of action, which renders the world's sole major power immobile in the face of transformations that are both tragic and radical. Transformations that certainly also entail a political cost, which extends beyond the cost in terms of bloodshed that is being paid now. The list is a long one. It is enough to cite the collapse of Africa, the destructive fury of South Africa, the distant and daily massacres in Bosnia, and the nearer, terrible, and entirely unobstructed massacres on the hopeless island of Haiti. Anyone wanting to defend the virtual absence of American foreign policy could cite the many diplomatic initiatives taken by the Clinton Administration in almost all the tragedies shaking the world. If it were me, I would not choose that approach. This, because it embodies frightening inconsistencies, always followed by inaction and silence. The public worldwide has lost count of the warnings, threats, and ultimatums issued to Serbia. Apart from the brief intervention by NATO aircraft around Sarajevo, which suspended that city's suffering after two years, there is no trace of American thinking on the former Yugoslavia. Or, rather, there are occasional, confused traces. They are characterized by good intentions, are inconsistent, and immediately come to nothing. The President, who is a man of common sense, is patient and does not remain silent. But any explanation (either by him or by his secretary of state, his secretary of defense, or his national security adviser) does not negate the lack. Clinton is an honest man. He says that this time it was impossible and that something else will be tried. Often attention is diverted away from Washington toward the failures of the United Nations. The United Nations now seems like a rickety bureaucracy entirely unequal to the enormous task that this "post-Cold War period" has set on its shoulders, already overburdened by bureaucracy and lacking in political vitality. With regard to the United Nations, we should recall instances of personal heroism, isolated and stubborn commanders who persist in performing a task that nobody supports. The exception are the staff of UNICEF who, whatever happens, will not abandon the children with whom they manage to deal. But this is the strength of certain individuals, not the actual political fiber of the organization itself, which is bowed under the excessive burden of too many crises, each of them too heavy. But, apart from the organizational and logistical disasters that have hindered it, the United Nations is unable to choose a policy line, to form an autonomous world view. No more than can the drivers of the few ambulances summoned to the site of too many tragedies. However, this line of defense cannot apply to the United States. The world's major power, we imagine, cannot escape the need to occupy a position on the world's troubled stage. This position should indicate its degree of involvement, its timetable of commitments, its will to intervene, and the need to abstain, in accordance with the principles that presidents sometimes refer to as a "doctrine." This need is not based on an inexorable ideological impetus (which of course sometimes colors decisions, as in the case of Roosevelt's pledge to intervene against Nazism and fascism). It is based on an awareness of the fact that every tragic and uncontrolled event in world politics entails a cost. And that this cost is bound to increase with the passage of time, the increase of the tragedy, and the growth in the number of victims. It is a cost that inevitably is laid on the table of the American Government. I just mentioned Roosevelt, the great leader of world antifascism. It is difficult not to consider (a debate in this regard has recently begun in the United States) how much more limited, in terms of destruction and lost lives, World War II would have been if America, long misled by bad advisers, had perceived the danger immediately. However, the real problem is not reluctance to intervene, but the absence of a policy with its own design, a world view, and a scale of responses capable of providing guidance, clarifications, and explanations. And also [a policy] capable of enabling the other actors on the world stage (for instance, the Serbs with their field guns or the Arab governments that pay the Hamas murderers working against Rabin and 'Arafat) to foresee the danger to which they are exposing themselves. This, in fact, the confused combination of the reluctance to intervene and the virtually complete lack of a political vision, is the essence of the tragedy entitled, "America's absence from the world stage." Doubtless the youthful President Clinton was elected because of the dislike for the interventionism of the aging George Bush, who grew up in the trenches of the Cold War, in which every enemy move had to be countered immediately. People saw the Iron Curtain collapse and tasted victory. And, like after every victory, they wanted to return home. Unfortunately, that which has been created around this "return home," which Clinton has led, is not a reasonable practice of limitation and cautions, but a redefinition of the "national interest." While at the time of the Iron Curtain this interest embraced virtually everything -- from a rising in Malaysia to a government crisis in Italy -- now the new definition leaves the page blank. Nothing, it has been theorized, must concern America unless it affects its people, its territory, and its economy. This theory, some will point out, was formulated on the Right of the American political system. Its preacher in the latest presidential campaign was Pat Buchanan, the Republican candidate that challenged George Bush. That theory, though defeated in the elections, has silently invaded American culture, occupying its center, excluding only a humanitarian Left that continues (in vain) to represent the cries of anguish. This is how the great mistake occurred. The reasonable tendency to intervene less in world affairs became entangled with the questionable but peremptory definition of the "American national interest." And it has led not to a policy of prudence but to a nonpolicy. The sensitive heart of the system, which is its efficient and communicative President, gives a voice to those who communicate to him the suffering and tragedies of the world. But his hands do nothing, his cabinet does not ponder, his people do not act. Not even in order to say how they intend to limit their action. There is no action. The result is a vast emptiness. In a world without trustworthy governments that looks increasingly like the engravings of Piranesi, the Milosevices run free and the Zhirinovskiys act in the certainty that they can do so with impunity. I am not talking about physical threats. I am talking about the certainty of not violating any rules, because the world's greatest power has set no rules to define what is tolerable and what is intolerable. It does not take a great political analyst to see that this vacuum not only enlarges the extent of the tragedy and the anguish that disturbs the world, but also betrays any definition of the American national interest that is not abstract or artificial. Sooner or later the cost of what is happening in Gorazde and Rwanda, in Haiti, and among the terrorists, the new torturers, and the new Nazis of the world will be laid at Washington's table. And the cost will be very high. Not to mention the dead.
