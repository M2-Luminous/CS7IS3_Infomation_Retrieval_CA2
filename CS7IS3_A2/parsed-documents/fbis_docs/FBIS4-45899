The Supreme Court's acquittal of a 36-year-old Haitian caused particular indignation. After being convicted by a city court and the Eastern High Court for having unprotected sex with 23 women, the 36-year-old man was surprisingly acquitted yesterday. Shortly after the Supreme Court's decision, an HIV-infected female drug addict was acquitted in a similar case before the Western High Court in Arhus. The Conservative spokesman on legal affairs, Helge Adam Moller, compared these cases to attempted murder and demanded an immediate change in the criminal code. The chairmen of the two coalition parties CD [Center Democrats] and the Christian People's Party made similar demands. Yesterday, Justice Minister Erling Olsen (Social Democrat) issued a brief news release stating that the verdicts "could bring about a change in the law," so that HIV-infected persons who fail to protect their partners could be punished. But prominent experts on the criminal code with whom BERLINGSKE TIDENDE has spoken warn emphatically against changing the law. Professor of criminal law Gorm Toftegaard Nielsen, University of Aarhus, believes this could give women a false sense of security. [passage omitted]
