He also said the Yemeni crisis has been internationalized by the Security Council's intervention. Should we consider this to be a real failure by the Arab League to intervene in the crisis? [Abu-al-Nasr] I do not want to say the situation is a failure or success, because the efforts are continuing. The Arab League and the United Nations have tried. This does not mean the two organizations have failed to achieve a cease-fire or that the door has been closed to future attempts by the Arab league or the United Nations. These efforts are continuing and cooperation with the Arab League is also continuing. There are constant consultations between the UN and Arab League secretaries general to reach a solution. I do not want to get into the issue of internationalizing the problem because what concerns us now is stopping this tragedy and the Yemeni people's suffering. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Should we expect a new intervention by the Arab League? [Abu-al-Nasr] If the two parties agree. The issue is now being raised at the Security Council and undoubtedly the Arab League will cooperate with the Council to urge the parties to comply with the resolutions passed in this regard.
