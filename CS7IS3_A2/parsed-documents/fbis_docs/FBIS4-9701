FBIS4-9701 "drlat062_f_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-062 Daily Report 30 Mar 1994 CENTRAL AMERICA El Salvador No Majority Winner in Election Forces Runoff No Majority Winner in Election Forces Runoff PA3003235194 Panama City ACAN in Spanish 2201 GMT 30 Mar 94 PA3003235194 Panama City ACAN Spanish BFN [Text] San Salvador, 30 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- The ruling Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) captured 49.05 percent of the votes in the 20 March election, while the leftist coalition, partly formed by former guerrillas, garnered 24.9 percent of the votes. Today, the Salvadoran Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) announced that as a result, a runoff election will be held. The right-wing ARENA candidate, Armando Calderon Sol, fell just short of an absolute majority (over 50 percent of the votes). He will face Ruben Zamora, from the leftist coalition, in a runoff on 24 April. After 10 days of vote counting, the TSE has announced the official election results and has scheduled runoff elections, the date for which has already been agreed upon although it will be officially announced in 72 hours. Electoral authorities have not yet announced official results of legislative and municipal elections, also held on 20 March, in which, according to the provisional vote count, the two leading groups won percentages similar to those in the presidential election. Yesterday Calderon acknowledged he had not won an absolute majority and announced his participation in the runoff. This despite the fact that while the vote count was still proceeding Calderon asked Zamora to withdraw from the runoff and concede the election. Zamora was nominated by former guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) and by the social democratic parties: Democratic Convergence (CD) and the National Revolutionary Movement (MNR). According to official presidential election results, ARENA won 641,108 votes, which represent 49.05 percent; the leftist coalition 325,582 (24.90 percent); and the Christian Democratic Party (PDC) 214,277 votes (16.39 percent). The National Conciliation Party (conservative) garnered 70,504 votes (5.39 percent); the Unity Movement (MU, evangelical), 31,502 votes (2.41 percent); and the National Solidarity Movement (MSN, evangelical) 13,841 votes (1.06 percent). The Authentic Christian Movement (MAC, right-wing), which nominated a woman for the presidency, Rhina Escalante de Rey Prendes, was unable to attract the 1 percent needed to stay alive in the political arena and thus will cease to exist as a political party. The total number of votes cast in the presidential election was 1,411,320, of which 4,849 were challenged, 70,503 were annulled, and 28,311 were blank. Even though the TSE did not announce official figures for abstentionism and even though the total number of eligible voters (some 2.5 million) has not been provided due to census problems, the provisional vote count placed abstention at around 45 percent. Jaime Romero Ventura, a TSE magistrate, said that today, political parties will be officially notified that a runoff will be held so they can resort to any available legal mechanisms. He added that according to the law, 72 hours must pass once results are announced so any party can appeal before the TSE can officially call a runoff in the presidential election. Romero Ventura said Easter might delay the announcement until Tuesday, the first working day after the holiday, when the TSE would announce the results and call a runoff election between ARENA and the leftist coalition. The two political forces have already begun campaigning and molding alliances with their sights set on 24 April, even though the main potential source of additional votes, the PDC, has announced it will not support either candidate. Of the smaller organizations, the PCN, traditionally linked to the military, has already expressed its support for ARENA, an organization already favored to win the election. The 20 March elections, witnessed by some 3,000 international observers, were held without major incident. They were the first elections in the country since the 1992 peace agreements between the FMLN and the Alfredo Cristiani government, which ended 12 years of civil war.
