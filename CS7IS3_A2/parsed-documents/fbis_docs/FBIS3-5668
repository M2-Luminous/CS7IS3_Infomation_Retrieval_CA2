U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced that 73 million dollars of fresh U.S. assistance will be provided to Cambodia over the next two years, while Japan was expected to offer 9 billion yen in new grant aid over a year. Pledges made at the two-day meeting of the International Committee on the Reconstruction of Cambodia (ICORC), participated in by 32 countries, the European Union, and 12 international bodies, are scheduled to be tallied up for announcement on Friday. At the outset of the meeting, Cambodian First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh conveyed an appeal from King Norodom Sihanouk for a modern-day "Marshall Plan" to help put the war-ravaged country back on its feet. In a message sent from Beijing, where he has been undergoing medical treatment, Sihanouk said, "the gift of which my country has the greatest need, having suffered from so many years of turpitude and devastation, is none other than a new unconditional Marshall Plan gauged to specific needs." Sihanouk's reference was to a multibillion-dollar plan drawn up by U.S. Secretary of State George Marshall in the late 1940s to rehabilitate the shattered economies of post-World War II European nations. Christopher, meanwhile, urged continued global attention to the problems faced by Cambodia and called for sustained assistance to help it recover from the disasters of its past, as well as "to help Cambodians take charge of their future." "Events in Cambodia no longer make front page news around the world," he said. "That is in many ways a happy sign, but it is not a reason to shift our attention. As Cambodia moves from crisis to normality it is vital that we stay engaged." Ranariddh, who was accompanied by Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, told the delegates, "Cambodia deserves your help because it helps itself." He said that the government, in the five months since its formation in the wake of last May's U.N.-supervised general election, has accomplished a great deal in spite of the meager resources at its disposal. Heeding international recommendations, Ranariddh said Cambodia has implemented administrative reforms, put its finances in order, stabilized the local currency and worked out a satisfactory budget. Sihanouk's message enumerated six priority areas for external assistance -- basic human needs in terms of sufficient access by the population to food and medical care, agricultural and rural development, infrastructure repair, environmental protection, education and technical training, and industrialization. He placed the utmost importance on improving conditions in rural communities, where over 80 percent of all Cambodians eke out a living, most of them "lacking even a roof over their head, sufficient resources, work or the prospect of finding any." Gordon Bilney, Australian minister for development cooperation, echoed that "while macroeconomic assistance to restructure the economy remains a vital goal...specific action to alleviate poverty...must remain a high priority." The first ICORC meeting, held at a working-level in Paris last September, saw 119 million dollars in fresh commitments added to the 880 million dollars garnered at a previous ministerial conference on Cambodia held in Tokyo in June 1992. While most of those funds were for short-term financial support, the present ICORC meeting is focused on Cambodia's mid- to long-term aid requirements. Economy and Finance Minister Sam Rangsi detailed those requirements and expressed confidence that with the support of the donor community his government "can extend the `East Asian miracle to Cambodia'." He took the occasion to unveil Cambodia's new liberalized investment law, which he said will not discriminate between Cambodian and foreign nationals, will guarantee remittance of foreign currencies and will offer various clear incentives. Delegates from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) praised the Cambodian Government for policies that have brought rapid economic growth, slashed inflation and turned about the fiscal deficit. But they warned that the macroeconomic situation remains fragile, with the country still highly dependent on external financing and suffering from a limited foreign exchange earning capacity. The international financial organizations urged Cambodia to provide a vision of where the economy is headed, continue moving toward a market economy, strengthen the role of the private sector, work on rectifying the fiscal deficit and develop the skills of the country's work force.
