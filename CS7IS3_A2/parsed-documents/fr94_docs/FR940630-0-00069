FR940630-0-00069 FR940630-0-00026 State oxygenated gasoline regulations will be enforced by the Standards Division of the North Carolina Department of Agriculture. The Standard Division has agreed to inspect, a minimum of one time per season, 40 percent of all retail gasoline stations located in the program area. The inspections will consist of fuel sampling and record review. The Standards Division has the authority to stop the sale of the product and give fines. The fine will be calculated by multiplying the amount of fuel found in violation by the price difference between oxygenated and clear gasoline and then doubled. EPA's sampling procedures are detailed in appendix D of 40 CFR part 80. North Carolina has elected to use the ASTM&hyph;D48150989 test method, which has been approved by EPA. North Carolina is using the same testing tolerances established by EPA. Additionally, North Carolina has adopted labeling regulations consistent with the Federal regulation. Final Action EPA is approving the regulation because it meets all applicable requirements for oxygenated fuel programs. This action is being taken without prior proposal because the changes are noncontroversial and EPA anticipates no significant comments on them. This action will become effective on August 29, 1994, unless adverse comments are received by August 1, 1994. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on the proposed rule (please see short informational notice published, simultaneously, in the proposal section of this Federal Register ). Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1), petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by August 29, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(2).) This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for two years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continued in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for a revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
