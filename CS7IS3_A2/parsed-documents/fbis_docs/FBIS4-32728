In her opinion, emphasis must be laid on the transformation of state-owned enterprises into joint-stock companies. Schmognerova sees differences between the ministries which are preparing privatization in that the Privatization Ministry stresses the overall volume of property to be privatized in coupon privatization, whilst the Economy Ministry considers its impact on individual enterprises. Schmognerova agrees that this impact must be taken into consideration. However, she rejects the opinion that the application of this method will cause the present enterprises' managements to lose their power position. She also disagrees with the view that the SDL [Party of the Democratic Left] regards managements as its sphere of influence. "At least 80 managements were formed under the previous governments in which the SDL had no seats," Schmognerova says. On the other hand, it would be a sin not to motivate capable managements by giving them a share in privatization. "But if managements are not capable it would be better to replace them," she says.
