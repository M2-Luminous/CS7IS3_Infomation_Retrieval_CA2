FR941004-1-00119 FR941004-1-00018 (d) Grants: General. (1) Grants may be made to eligible Indian tribal organizations in a State which has a jointly developed child and family services plan approved and in effect. (2) Federal funds made available for a direct grant to an eligible ITO shall be paid by the Department, from the title IV&hyph;B allotment for the State in which the ITO is located. Should a direct grant be approved, the Department shall promptly notify the State(s) affected. (3) If an eligible ITO includes population from more than one State, a proportionate amount of the grant will be paid from each State's allotment. (4) The receipt of title IV&hyph;B funds must be in addition to and not a substitute for funds otherwise previously expended by the ITO for child welfare services. (5) Only the following fiscal and administrative requirements in 45 CFR 1357.30 apply to Indian tribal grants under this section: (i) §1357.30(d) Enforcement and termination; (ii) §1357.30(e) Matching and cost sharing; (iii) §1357.30(f) Prohibition against purchase or construction of facilities; (iv) §1357.30(g) Maintenance of effort; and (v) §1357.30(i) Time limit on expenditures. 19. A new §1357.50 is added to read as follows: §1357.50 Direct payments to Indian tribal organizations (title IV&hyph;B, subpart 2, family preservation and support services). (a) Definitions. Alaska Native Organization means any organized group of Alaska Natives eligible to operate a Federal program under the Indian Self-Determination Act (Pub.L. 93&hyph;638) or such group's designee as defined in section 482(i)(7)(A) of the Act. Indian tribe means any tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community of Indians that is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians; and for which a reservation (including Indian reservations, public domain Indian allotments, and former Indian reservations in Oklahoma) exists. Tribal organization means the recognized governing body of the Indian tribe. (b) Eligibility for funds: FY 1994. (1) Section 432(b)(2) of the Act provides that the Secretary may not approve a plan of an Indian tribe whose FY 1995 allotment under subpart 2 would be less than $10,000. Therefore, only those Indian tribes whose FY 1995 allotment is $10,000 or more are eligible to receive funds beginning in FY 1994. (2) ACF will pay any amount to which an Indian tribe is entitled to the tribal organization of the Indian tribe. (c) Eligibility for funds: FY 1995. In order to receive funds under title IV&hyph;B, subpart 2, in FY 1995, an Indian tribe eligible for planning funds in FY 1994 must submit a Child and Family Services Plan that meets the applicable requirements in section 1357.15 of this Part. (d) Eligibility for funds: FY 1996 through FY 1998. (1) ACF will make grants to additional Indian tribes in FYs 1996 through 1998, based on anticipated increases in appropriations. (2) Allotments will be calculated in FYs 1996, 1997, and 1998 as required in Section 433 of the Act. Those Indian tribes in each year whose allotment is at least $10,000 will be notified of their eligibility to apply. (3) In order to receive funds, an Indian tribe must submit a Child and Family Services Plan (CFSP) that meets the applicable requirements of 45 CFR 1357.15. The plan must cover a one, two, or three year period (between FY 1996&hyph;FY 1998), depending on when the Indian tribe applies. There are no funds available for planning in FYs 1996&hyph;98, but the Regional Office staff of ACF will, through the joint planning process, assist the Indian tribe in developing its CFSP.
