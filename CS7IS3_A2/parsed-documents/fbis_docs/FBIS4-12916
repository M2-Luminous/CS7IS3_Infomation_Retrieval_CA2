FBIS4-12916 "drnes072dd_94003" FBIS-NES-94-072 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs Sha'th Expresses Anger Over Hadera Attack Sha'th Expresses Anger Over Hadera Attack TA1304160594 Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew 1400 GMT 13 Apr 94 TA1304160594 Tel Aviv IDF Radio Hebrew BFN [Telephone interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian delegation to the Cairo talks, in Tunis, by Moshe Shlonsky, commander of IDF Radio in Tunis, "earlier today" -- recorded in English] [Text] [Shlonsky] Mr. Sha'th, what is your reaction to this morning's terror attack in Hadera? [Sha'th] I have heard of this incident, and it makes me very sad and very angry to see civilians, innocent people get killed in Hadera, in 'Afula, in Hebron, or in Gaza. To me this is all needless bloodshed of innocent people that should be stopped immediately; by continuing the peace process, it can be stopped. [Shlonsky] You know, the Israelis are waiting for an official condemnation by Chairman Yasir 'Arafat... [Sha'th, interrupting] The chairman has just made a statement in Strasbourg that I believe has been communicated everywhere. [Shlonsky] In which he is condemning the attack? [Sha'th] Yes. [Shlonsky] You know, the Israelis were very surprised after the Hebron...not surprised, but maybe disappointed, that after the Hebron attack the Palestinians withdrew from the talks. Do you expect the Israelis to do the same now or to continue it? [Sha'th] I think we should continue this peace process, because I think we should not confuse the cause and effect -- I mean the more we delay this peace process the more it will encourage the enemies of the peace process to continue doing things like this, whether in Hebron or in Hadera. And I see now more than ever that we need to finish as quickly as possible and implement our peace on the ground in order to swing the whole public opinion in the Palestinian areas, in the Palestinian occupied territories and in Israel to support the peace process. [Shlonsky] You know, there is a feeling in Israel that you cannot control your people, or the Palestinians as a whole, to continue terrorist attacks [sentence as heard]. The peace process is continuing, and while the peace process is continuing these terrorist attacks are occurring here and there. [Sha'th] Yes, this is very natural, because so long as we have absolutely no way to control these matters -- our police force is still totally outside the territories, and our people also have occurrences such as the massacre in the Hebron mosque -- there is no way to either control by police or to control by public support. We have a peace process, but this peace process has not been implemented on the ground and people have not seen any of its benefits, nor any of its police manifestations.
