The visit began on Wednesday. The article is headlined "Will Russian Peacekeepers Be Brought to Abkhazia?". "Fifteen hundred Russian peacekeepers are supposed to be brought to the area of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. Peacekeeping units from other CIS countries are to be brought to the region at subsequent stages of the operation to settle the situation there. "Final decisionmaking is within the competence of the Russian president who chairs the council of the heads of state of CIS countries." NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA runs an article contributed by Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev under the headline "The Military Doctrine and Security of Russia". Grachev explains the essence of the most important provisions of the military doctrine and peculiarities of the contemporary military-political and geostrategic position of Russia, determining basic approaches to ensuring her national security. Touching upon nuclear weapons, Grachev pointed out as follows: "One of the paradoxes of the nuclear age is the fact that nuclear weapons while piling up in the arsenals of adversaries during the Cold War, assumed a new form of their existence as a political deterrent to a large-scale war". KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star) carries an article about the Russian Defence Ministry's special control service which monitored foreign nuclear tests. "The main method to detect underground nuclear explosions is a seismic one. Over a span of 35 years, the ministry's monitoring service recorded more than 600 various nuclear detonations at foreign test sites. They were conducted by the United States, France, China, Britain, and India. "After the Cold War ended, nuke test monitoring problems did not diminish. Countries began to conduct only underground nuclear detonations of low and very low yield. There also emerged countries which are potential possessors of nuclear weapons". KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA reports, referring to informed sources in the Russian Government, that "the question of Viktor Chernomyrdin's resignation from the premiership on health grounds and the appointment of Yuriy Skokov has been decided in principle in President Boris Yeltsin's entourage". The newspaper's opinion is that Skokov's expected appointment is prompted by the fact that "the Russian parliament ceases to be controlled by the president. Therefore, most likely, Skokov, in exchange for his appointment to the premiership, promised Yeltsin to ensure the pilotage of the president-drafted bills through the State Duma". TRUD runs an open letter by researchers from the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences to Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. The researchers urge him "to keep the established procedure for financing the academy as a separate item in the federal budget". Researchers point out that "research funding has ceased. Funds assigned for the payment of salaries to the research staff and attending personnel in April-May 1994 accounted for 65 percent of the necessary amount. Russian medico-biological science, which once won world recognition, may be ruined and its restoration would take decades". PRAVDA carries an interview with Olzhas Suleymenov, a prominent Kazakh poet and member of the republican parliament. Touching upon the idea of establishing a Euro-Asian confederation, Suleymenov expressed the conviction that "a confederation or a union of independent states of Eurasia is a historical inevitability. The Commonwealth of Independent States is the threshold of such an entity". The newspaper SEGODNYA (Today) comments on the incident involving the U.S. C-130 cargo plane which was forced to land at Adler by Russian jetfighters while on a flight from Frankfurt on Main to Tbilisi. The paper points out that "in view of the break-up of the Soviet air defence system, Russia has to set up new air defence district boundaries, in the Caucasus in particular, which served as the subject of study by U.S. and NATO radio reconnaissance centres in Turkey. The presence of reconnaissance equipment on board the C-130 is not ruled out. According to onboard documents, the plane carried a diplomatic cargo, an inspection of which was scarcely probable".
