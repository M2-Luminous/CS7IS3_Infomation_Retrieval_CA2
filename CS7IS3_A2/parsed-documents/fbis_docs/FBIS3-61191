Prim Minister Yuriy Luzhkov insisted upon this figure despite the fact that it will require a substantial reduction in the expenditures of the government of Moscow next year--the draft of the budget, which takes into account the needs of the city in a maximum way, has a deficit of more than R7 trillion. At a regular meeting, the Moscow government in the course of three and a half hours tried to find ways to cut the deficit. For this, priority expenditure articles that constituted the so-called protected group of expenditures and articles that were subject to reduction were determined. The government assigned social programs, the housing construction program, energy support for the city, the collection and processing of garbage, and also the reconstruction of the center of the capital to the "protected" group. A reduction of the expenditures part, even by a total of 100 percent, will not bring the desired results, inasmuch as just the "protected" programs require more than R16 trillion, but the expected incomes of the city treasury are limited to R14 trillion. Therefore, the department of finance put forth several proposals to increase budget revenues. In particular, it was proposed to transfer housing construction projects to investors, and not to finance them directly. Moreover, the Moscow government intends to "extract" R2.5 trillion from the federal pocket in the form of subventions, "regardless of whether they are there or not." Speaking at the meeting, Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nikolskiy reported that in view of the reduction in outlays for the renewal of the rolling stock of the city's transport, there will be a significant increase in fares next year. Starting on 1 January, a Metro trip will cost Muscovites and guests of the capital R50, and an even more substantial increase in fares on city transport is expected by the end of the year--up to R160, and on the Metro--up to R200.
