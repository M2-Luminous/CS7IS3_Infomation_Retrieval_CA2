The Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in its statement expressed "its concern about the European Council's resolution". Until now, despite Azerbaijan's efforts, all internationally adopted documents neglected to mention Armenia, as a country, as a participant in the conflict. The Azerbaijani Ministry of Foreign Affairs sees the resolution of the European Council as "a success in Azerbaijan's diplomacy". A representative from the Greek Embassy in Baku stated that they do not have the text of the resolution that was taken by the European Council. Greece is in charge of affairs concerning Azerbaijan for the European Council.
