Tang and Sofia Wu] [Text] Geneva, May 19 (CNA) -- The fifth meeting of a special working party screening Taiwan's application for membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) ended here Thursday [19 May] with some results. "We have made progress in negotiations on our terms of entry into GATT," said Sheu Ke-sheng, Taiwan's vice economic affairs minister and chief negotiator in the three-day meeting. Many GATT contracting parties reaffirmed their support for Taiwan's GATT accession during the meeting, Sheu said. "Nevertheless, they also want us to make sure that all GATT requirements are respected," he admitted. Foreign delegates urged Taiwan to remove restrictions on car imports, improve market access for farm products, open up its lucrative government procurement contracts to foreign bidders and to guarantee protection of patents and copyrights. Sheu explained Taiwan's comprehensive trade liberalization plans and its determination to abide by the GATT-initiated Uruguay round trade liberalization accords concerning service industries and intellectual property rights protection. "We are prepared to deal with services trade issues with the intention to become not only a GATT contracting party but also a full member of the World Trade Organization (WTO)," Sheu noted. The WTO will supersede GATT early next year. The United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the European Union have expressed the intention to talk with Taiwan on the opening of its service markets. Sheu further said Taiwan would try to bring its government procurement rules in line with GATT requirements before joining the trade regulatory body, but this would require legislative and administrative changes. He asked interested GATT members to submit to Taiwan all tariff reduction request lists before July 31 so that Taiwan can start an overall assessment of offers it would make. The GATT working party will prepare a "checklist" of problems that need further discussions in future sessions. The working party, founded in 1992, has yet to decide when the next meeting will be held. Sheu said earlier he hopes the sixth meeting of the working party can be held in late July to speed up Taiwan's GATT entry. Taiwan has held first rounds of negotiations on tariff and non- tariff issues with a dozen nations, including Switzerland, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Hungary, Chile and Turkey. It held a second round of such talks with the U.S. in Washington earlier this month. The 33-member Taiwan delegation will hold further discussions with several other countries here before it returns to Taipei next week.
