FR940505-2-00078 FR940505-2-00052 The Mexican long-nosed bat ( Leptonycteris nivalis ) is known to occur in central and northern Mexico, the Big Bend area of Texas, and Hildago County, New Mexico. The species roosts in caves, crevices, mines, and occasionally man-made structures. The only known Mexican long-nosed bat roost in the United States is found in the Big Bend National Park, Texas. This roost is used for a relatively short period during the summer. The Mexican long-nosed bat feeds primarily on the nectar produced by night blooming plants (Agave spp.) and is one of only two bat species found in the United States that is nectarivorous. These bats appear to follow the seasonal blooming of agave plants. The Mexican long-nosed bat is threatened by loss and disruption of roosting and foraging habitat. Preferred (historical) roost sites are a limiting factor for this and other bat species. When occupying a roost, this bat appears to be particularly sensitive to human movement and disruption. Mexican long-nosed bat roosts are threatened by curious individuals, cave vandals, and citizens attempting to eradicate vampire bats.The foraging habitat of the Mexican long-nosed bat is threatened by producers of tequila, mescal, and pulque who harvest heads from flowering agave stalks before they mature and producers flower. Except for protection of plants and roost sites in the Big Bend National Park, food producing plants and roosts are generally unprotected. The objective of the Draft Recovery Plan for the Mexican long-nosed bat is downlisting. Downlisting is selected because there is insufficient information regarding the bat and its habitat to specify delisting criteria. Downlisting criteria are specified in the plan. Recovery efforts outlined in the plan focus on roosting and foraging habitat identification and protection, public education, and research to determine biological and habitat requirements of the species as they apply to identification and protection efforts. The Mexican long-nosed bat recovery plan has been reviewed by the appropriate Service staff in Region 2. The plan will be finalized and approved following incorporation of comments and materials received during this comment period. Public Comments Solicited The Service solicits written comments on the recovery plan described. All comments received by the date specified above will be considered prior to the approval of the plan. Because the majority of this bat's range is found in Mexico, the Service is especially interested in soliciting comments from Mexican biologists and others who have studied the bat fauna in Mexico. Authority The Authority for this action is section 4(f) of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1533(f). Dated: April 28, 1994. Lynn B. Starnes, Acting Regional Director.
