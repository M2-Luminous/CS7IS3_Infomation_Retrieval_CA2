This plan was the core of Tudjman's policy over the last two years, said Manolic, who has become leader of a new party -- the Croatian Independent Democrats (HND), a breakaway faction of Tudjman's ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ). Manolic, in an interview to the Zagreb GLOBUS weekly, accused Tudjman of having succumbed, in his expansionist policy, to the strong influence by Croat mps from southern Bosnia-Herzegovina. Manolic said "a division of Bosnia may lead to one of Croatia," but "history would never forgive" Tudjman any such "strategic mistake." Manolic laid all blame on Tudjman for a one-year Croat-Moslem war in Bosnia-Herzegovina which ended under U.S. pressure last month when the warring sides agreed on a Croat-Moslem federation to be set up in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The new party, HND, would strengthen the opposition in breaking Tudjmans power monopoly as the "biggest obstacle" in the way of what he called the "functioning of democratic institutions" in Croatia. Tudjman was responsible for the split in his party (HDZ), from which the HND originated, said Manolic, the ex-chief of the secret police, because, "with the HDZ as it is now, it is quite impossible" for Croatia to become "a genuinely democratic state."
