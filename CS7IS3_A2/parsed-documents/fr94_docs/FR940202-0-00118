FR940202-0-00118 FR940202-0-00013 Service Response: As discussed in the response to Issue 3 above, only those projects with Federal involvement would be directly affected by critical habitat designation. The Service does not anticipate any circumstances in which there would be Federal involvement in water extraction processes on private property within any of the critical habitat areas. Water extraction rights on private property could not be negated because of critical habitat designation. Issue 8: The benefits of designating certain areas such as Newhall property on the Santa Clara River do not exceed the economic costs of such designation. Current and potential revenues from agriculture, housing development, and filming activities on Newhall property, within proposed critical habitat, exceed $200 million, and revenues from adjacent Newhall activities potentially impacted by the designation exceed $160 million. In addition to Newhall, other property owners have expressed concerns over the costs of mitigation requirements that would be generated by the critical habitat designation on their lands. Service Response: Newhall's analysis (Newhall Land and Farming Company 1992) and comments submitted by other landowners are based on the assumption that designation of critical habitat would prohibit or substantially modify all activities within the designated boundaries. The response to Issue 6 above indicates that the Service anticipates very few, if any, projects to be stopped or significantly modified due to critical habitat designation itself. Any impact on these projects would be through section 9 prohibitions on taking. In addition, habitat occupied by vireos is already protected because of its status as a federally-listed species. The Clean Water Act, National Environmental Policy Act, Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, Federal wetland policy, sections 1601 and 1603 of the California Fish and Game Code, and the California Environmental Quality Act also provide various degrees of consideration or protection for these areas. The requirements of these statutes overlap considerably, and ascribing costs incurred for mitigation or compensation to each of these statutes separately is problematical. If occupied vireo habitat, jurisdictional wetlands or waters of the United States are to be affected by a Federal agency or project proponent, that agency or project proponent is presently required (in the absence of critical habitat designation) to replace those values with from 1 to 5 acres of appropriate habitat created for every acre lost. However, this replacement is generally mandated at the Federal level only if the impact exceeds 1 acre under the Corps' Nationwide Permit Program implementing, in part, section 404 of the Clean Water Act or if vireos would be affected by the project pursuant to section 7 of the Act and the implementing regulations pertaining thereto. With critical habitat designation, the essential elements of suitable, but unoccupied, habitat must be preserved through project design or mitigation. Thus, designation of critical habitat generally would have an incremental economic effect only on federally involved projects that are less than an acre in size or that require mitigation measures above and beyond what is currently being negotiated or required given the vireo's status as a listed species and the regulatory authority of the Corps of Engineers and California Department of Fish and Game to require the minimization or mitigation of impacts to jurisdictional wetlands or waters. Therefore, those mitigation measures attributable solely to critical habitat designation (e.g., the replacement or rehabilitation of small amounts of habitat, contributions to habitat or species management funds) are expected to be relatively infrequent and add only incrementally to project costs. Costs associated with wetland creation are discussed under the response to Issue 3 in the revised proposed rule (57 FR 34892).
