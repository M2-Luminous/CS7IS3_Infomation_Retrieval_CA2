The DOE expects to make several grants in Fiscal Year 1996 to meet the objectives of this program. It is anticipated that $1 million will be the total funds available in Fiscal Year 1996 subject to the availability of appropriated funds. Awards are expected to range from $10,000 to $200,000, with the number of awards determined by the number of fundable applications and the total amount of funds available for this program.
