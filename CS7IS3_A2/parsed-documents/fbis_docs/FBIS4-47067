Their generous sponsor is the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The names of these companies and description of investment projects so far have not been made public, despite the promises of high-ranking government officials to observe complete openness in this matter. The guarantee agreement on loans, on the other hand, which was signed at the end of last year, is not a secret: Its text was submitted by the government for ratification to the Supreme Council. The guarantee agreement is written in terse and tough language; it is a supplement of sorts to the main--loan--agreement, intended to dot all of the "i's." According to this document, Kazakhstan "unconditionally guarantees as the principal borrower rather than as a guarantor, the payment in proper and timely manner of any and all monies due by the credit agreement, both on the indicated repayment date and before it...." The bank has the right to request, and the republic is obligated to supply, various financial and economic information, including data on the balance of payments, Kazakhstan's foreign debt, draft decisions affecting the banking sphere, the mechanism of bankruptcy, and taxation. In other words, the creditor wishes to protect the project from possible surprises and demands that a prior concurrence be obtained with respect to principal reformist steps on the part of the Cabinet of Ministers and the parliament. The most delicate point in preparation of such documents is the issue of collateral that guarantees the repayment of the loan. Russia, for instance, when agreeing last year to print "new" rubles for us, set a condition to put up a part of the republic's gold and foreign currency reserves as collateral for repayment of this "technical credit." Some agreements entered by international banks use the principle of "negative collateral": If you do not repay the loan on time or do not make timely payments, the creditor has a right to freeze your foreign currency assets in other countries. In the case of Kazakhstan, a compromise was found, verbatim wording of which would take nearly a quarter of a newspaper page. Kazakhstan undertakes an obligation to grant the EBRD loan a priority in allocation, use, and distribution of foreign currency holdings. Should an unforeseen situation arise where the republic would find itself owing several creditors at once and short on foreign currency reserves, Kazakhstan is "quickly and without cost to the bank to back up the loan principal, interest, and other loan-related fees by an equivalent right of withholding with respect to OTHER PUBLIC ASSETS satisfactory to the bank." "Other assets" mean the property of the "guarantor" or of subjects owned by it, including gold and other foreign currency assets. Thus, one way or the other, the bank will have to be paid on time. In addition, Kazakhstan is responsible for paying any professional, banking, transfer, or foreign currency commission fees and expenditures incurred in preparation of this agreement and accompanying documents.
