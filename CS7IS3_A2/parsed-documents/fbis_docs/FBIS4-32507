Lord Owen and the other co-chairman of the international conference on the former Yugoslavia, U.N. mediator Thorvald Stoltenberg, arrived in the Croatian capital of Zagreb on Saturday evening for talks with Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. Lord Owen told the press in Zagreb that "if things went wrong in Bosnia, there is always a danger of the Bosnian and Croatian Serbs link-up, and (of) the Croats and Muslims, and another big war involving both Bosnia and Croatia". Serbs proclaimed their national states on historically and ethnically their territories in Croatia -- the republic of Serb Krajina (RSK), and in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- the Srpska republic (R.S.) in late 1991 and 1992, respectively, that is, after the two republics forcibly seceded from the former Yugoslav Federation. Lord Owen said that the main topic of the Zagreb talks was how to renew the talks between the RSK Serbs and Croatian authorities. Lord Owen set out that no date had been set for a new round of Croat-Serb talks, which were put off last on June 16. The international negotiator underscored that the talks must be held separately from those between the Bosnian Muslims, Serbs and Croats. The co-chairmen of the international conference on the former Yugoslavia visited the capital of The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), Skopje, and Belgrade before arriving in Zagreb. They conferred with FYROM President Kiro Gligorov and President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia.
