At a Korea-China trade ministers' meeting held here Thursday, Chinese Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Minister Wu Yi said China would lower both tariff and non-tariff barriers for imports from South Korea. Under the agreement, Daewoo Motor of Korea and a Chinese company will shortly conclude a barter contract to exchange 5,000 Daewoo cars for Chinese corn and machine parts. The contract will signal Korea's first car exports to China: previously, used Korean cars have been sold illegally in China. Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Kim Chol-su requested that China open its car market so that Korean automakers can produce vehicles in joint ventures in China. Kim also asked for Chinese cooperation in Yukong's oil refinery construction project in Shenzhen, Daewoo's car parts factory project in Shandong Province and the Korea business center's construction project in Beijing, to which Wu responded positively. In addition, Kim and Wu agreed to promote bilateral cooperation in automobiles, medium-sized aircraft, electronic telephone switching systems and high-definition television. On China's application for GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) membership, Wu asked for Korea's support and Kim said Seoul would cooperate as Beijing carries out trade reform to join GATT.
