FBIS4-58249 "drnes085_l_94010" FBIS-NES-94-085 Daily Report 2 May 1994 ISRAEL IDF Patrol Comes Under Fire in Gaza Strip IDF Patrol Comes Under Fire in Gaza Strip TA0205054194 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew 0510 GMT 2 May 94 TA0205054194 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Hebrew BFN [Report by Nisim Qeynan] [Text] It has just been released for publication that shots were fired at an IDF [Israel Defense Sources] patrol in the southeastern corner of the Qatif Bloc settlement of Ganey Tal at about 0620 this morning. Four soldiers were wounded in the incident. As a result of the gunfire, the patrol driver lost control of the vehicle, which overturned and plummeted about 10 meters down a sand dune. An Army helicopter evacuated the wounded to the hospital. Two of the men, who suffered moderate injuries, apparently caused by the gunfire, were evacuated to Soroka Hospital in Beersheba, while the other two, who sustained slight injuries, evidently as a result of the car's overturning, were moved to Barzilay Hospital in Ashqelon. It has been further learned that the gunshots came from a two-story house on the outskirts of Khan Yunus, whose Amal neighborhood borders on Ganey Tal. The house has been known to serve as a terrorist hideout and observation post in the past. The IDF and the security forces have mounted a manhunt for the terrorists, who fled the house. No arrests have been made. The number of assailants is unknown, although an initial debriefing indicates that the shots came from at least two firearms.
