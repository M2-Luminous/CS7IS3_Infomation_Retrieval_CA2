From the very first moment, it was clear that the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre would result in a harsh condemnation of Israel. Any American effort to prevent more painful damage was doomed to fail. The UNSC resolution portrays Israel as a country unable to provide security for the Palestinian residents of the occupied territories by itself. Therefore, the United Nations demands that Israel host an international observer force which would supervise the Israeli military government. The fact that Jerusalem was mentioned as part of the occupied territories reinforces the United Nations' refusal to recognize the undivided city as Israel's capital. The U.S. policymakers tried to prevent such a resolution; but other than blocking a demand that the international observer force be armed, it scored no substantive achievement. The procedural achievement -- holding a clause-by-clause vote -- only allowed the Americans to express their reservations over the mention of Jerusalem. But the pressure AIPAC [American Israel Public Affairs Committee] put on the U.S. Administration to order its UN representative to veto the entire resolution did not succeed. Clinton and Christopher can tell American Jewry that they did their best to soften the blow to Israel, but the scope of the Hebron disaster reduced their ability to do so. The government certainly entertains no illusions about the gravity of the U.S. failure -- which is its own failure as well. At the same time, it is trying to find consolation in the fact that the UNSC resolution could pave the way for the resumption of contacts with the other peace process partners. Nevertheless, any Israeli attempt to diminish the impact of the resolution -- for example, restricting the number of observers to a certain minimum -- might be dependent on concessions we will have to make in the direct negotiations with the PLO delegation. Naturally, the fact that the PLO leadership agreed to receive the Israeli delegation and hold discussions with it, which means the resumption of the negotiations about an early withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, is welcome. At the same time, Rabin will apparently have to agree that the Tunis discussions will also deal with the means that need to be employed to protect the Palestinians. The qualification made last week, according to which the issue will be discussed "in accordance with the government's resolution," should not mislead us. We had better not act surprised when the PLO, on whose territory the discussions are being held, demands that all the Jewish settlers be evacuated from Hebron. Even if the government wishes to hold on to Qiryat Arba' for the time being, there is no reason to expect that it will succeed in holding on to the Jewish settlement inside Hebron by concentrating the settlers in one or two sites instead of the current seven. Had the government pulled them out immediately after the massacre -- risking petitions to the High Court of Justice and braving the opposition -- Israel could have suffered less damage at the UNSC. At this time, there is serious doubt whether the government will be able to avoid making the move it had hoped to avoid while leaning on the United States. The right-wing parties have no reason to claim that their demonstrations influenced the government. The fact that the belief that Israel would be able to avoid paying a price for the Hebron massacre was mistaken is now clearly visible to all.
