Under the proposals, Latvia should naturalize citizens' spouses and children, and ethnic Latvians who still lack citizenship in 1994 and 1995. In 1996, citizenship should be offered to all permanent residents who speak Latvian and have lived here a certain number of years, recommended van der Stoel. The residence qualification could be 20, 30 or 40 years, he said. This option, said van der Stoel, would not threaten the identity of the Latvian nation and would provide non-citizens with clearcut future prospects. Van der Stoel criticized as too vague the naturalization mechanism in the ruling coalition's citizenship blueprint. The resident non-citizens may find it difficult to judge their prospects to ever get naturalized, the high commissioner said. The Latvia's Way-Farmers' Union bill grants citizenship under a system of annual quotas. The government sets the quotas in compliance with the current economic and demographic situation to ensure the development of Latvia as a national state. The parliament passed the first reading of the bill Nov. 25. Gorbunovs pointed to one major shortcoming in van der Stoel's proposal. The bulk of non-citizens came to Latvia by 1977 what may lead to mass-scale naturalization if the country introduces a 20-year residence threshold, for example, in 1996. The speaker told van der Stoel that the new version could only be considered if the problem of repatriation of non-citizens was tackled simultaneously. Gorbunovs suggested that the CSCE structures could be helpful in drafting a repatriation program, just like they are helpful in settling the citizenship issue. The Saeima (parliament) would discuss the high commissioner's recommendations when discussing the citizenship bill. At the same time, Latvia waits for conclusions by international organizations to whom the citizenship bill was sent for expert study, Gorbunovs added.
