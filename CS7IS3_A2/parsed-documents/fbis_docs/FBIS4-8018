Kontic praised the Russian Federation for its increasingly active role in the efforts aimed at finding a just solution to the crisis in former Yugoslavia, said a statement released by the Yugoslav Information Ministry. In May 1992, the U.N. Security Council imposed comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) for its alleged involvement in civil war raging in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina among the local Moslems, Serbs and Croats. Kontic briefed the Russian delegation -- which is headed by Vice President of the Russian Academy of Sciences Nikolay Laverev and which also includes former Soviet premier Nikolay Ryzhkov -- about the current political and economic situation in Yugoslavia, especially the results of the economic recovery programme launched earlier this year. Ryzhkov is president of the Moscow School of Business Management and Administration founded by the Yugoslav company Braca Karic. The Russian academicians communicated to Kontic the unanimous stand of Russia's leading scientists that the impermissible blockade of Yugoslavia should be ended, and expressed satisfaction at Moscow's more active role in resolving the problems in former Yugoslavia. The Russian delegation was also received by Serbian Parliament Speaker Dragan Tomic, who expressed appreciation for their support. Although support from some quarters has come late in the day, it has nevertheless come in time to sober the international community and make it realize that the cruel sanctions against the Yugoslav people should be lifted as soon as possible and never used again against any other nation, said Tomic. Laverev said this type of contacts helped the world realize the truth about Yugoslavia. "Your plight teaches us caution," he underlined, and added that the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Russian people, and other factors in Russia were supporting Yugoslavia in its just struggle for independence. The Russian delegation also had a meeting with the dean of Belgrade University, Professor Dragutin Velickovic, and explored possibilities of cooperation between Belgrade University and Russian scientific institutions.
