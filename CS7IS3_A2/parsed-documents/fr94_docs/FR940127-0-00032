FR940127-0-00032 FR940127-0-00007 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;ASO&hyph;10] Designation of Class E Airspace, Adel, GA agency: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. action: Final rule. summary: This action establishes Class E airspace at Adel, Georgia. A VHF Omni-Directional Range/Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME&hyph;A) Standard Instrument Approach Procedure (SIAP) for the Cook County Airport has been developed and controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface of the earth is needed to contain instrument flight rules (IFR) operations when utilizing this SIAP. effective date: 0901 UTC, March 3, 1994. for further information contact: Robert L. Shipp, Jr., Airspace Section, System Management Branch, Air Traffic Division, Federal Aviation Administration, P.O. Box 20636, Atlanta, Georgia 30320; telephone (404) 305&hyph;5591. supplementary information: History On August 25, 1993, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class E airspace at Adel, Georgia, to accommodate a VOR/DME&hyph;A instrument approach procedure to the Cook County Airport, Adel, Georgia (58 FR 47411). The proposal was to add controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface to contain IFR operations in controlled airspace during portions of the terminal operation and while transiting between the en route and terminal environments, and to change the operating status of the airport from visual flight rules (VFR) operations to include IFR operations concurrent with publication of the SIAP. Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. Airspace Reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the term ``transition area'' and has replaced it with the designation ``Class E airspace'' for airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Designation for Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth are published in paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298, July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class E airspace at Adel, Georgia, to accommodate a VOR/DME&hyph;A SIAP based on the Moultrie VOR to the Cook County Airport. Controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface is needed to contain aircraft executing the approach. Aeronautical maps and charts will reflect the defined area which will enable pilots to circumnavigate the area in order to comply with applicable VFR requirements. In addition, the operating status of the Cook County Airport is changed from VFR operations to include IFR operations concurrent with the publication of the SIAP. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
