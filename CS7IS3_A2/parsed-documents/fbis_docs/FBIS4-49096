The report, on the economic outlook for the rest of the year, warned if strong retrenchment measures were adopted, the country's momentum of growth would be thrown into chaos, leading to an economic "hard landing". The Spring Quarterly Report was jointly compiled by economists at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the State Statistics Bureau. Under one scenario, it predicted some economic contradictions would remain unresolved. It said the Government would have to relax macrocontrol in the face of growing opposition from regions and enterprises. This would lead to a "hasty rebound" of the economy and the revival of inflation, it said. "Based on the situation in the past few months, the danger remains," the report said. It stressed the need to seek a balance between economic growth and inflation. "We have to accept that a considerable level of price rises is inevitable in the course of full-fledged reform. It is the price we have to pay. But on the other hand, we have to be on constant alert to keep the level of price increases to one that the public can bear. This will be conducive to creating conditions for reform and a relatively rapid pace of economic growth," the report said. It said "opportunity and risk" would co-exist for the rest of 1994, stressing that failure to control investment and money-supply would be damaging. The report said the fiscal system would remain stable if the issue of new currency was controlled within 160 billion yuan (HK$142 billion [Hong Kong dollars]) and new loans did not exceed 550 billion yuan. Fixed-asset investments would not get out of control if money supply targets were met. "Even if we were able to have one or two more percentage points of economic growth, there would be negative impact if inflation surges to 20 percent. Ultimately, the economy will drop into a nadir. The process of economic reform will be severely jeopardised," it said. China's economy would stay on a "positive cycle" if annual economic growth reached 10 percent, investment growth dropped to 20 percent and inflation was contained about 10 percent.
