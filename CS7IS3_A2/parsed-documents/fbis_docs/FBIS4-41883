FBIS4-41883 "drsov125_a_94022" FBIS-SOV-94-125 Daily Report 29 Jun 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Official Denies Yeltsin Target of Athens Bombing Official Denies Yeltsin Target of Athens Bombing LD2706203494 LD2706203494 BFN [Editorial Report] Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian at 1245 GMT on 27 June carries a telephone interview with Andrey Olegov, a spokesman for Russian President Boris Yeltsin's security service, by Mayak Panorama correspondent Anatoliy Fedorov. In the interview, Olegov denies a report published over the weekend in MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS under the title of "Assassination Attempt on Yeltsin?" The article says that on 24 June, about an hour before Yeltsin visited the Greek parliament building in Athens, an unidentified device exploded in the parliament building. The security service's information on the incident indicates that an explosive device was planted near the entrance to the European parliament building a few hours before the EU summit meeting on Corfu. The blast caused panic but no injuries. President Yeltsin was attending the Corfu meeting at the time. The Athens police links this terrorist act with the Revolutionary Popular Struggle organization, which is opposed to Greek membership of the EU. Olegov says: "In this case, then, this should primarily be regarded as a demonstrative act aimed against the Greek membership of the European Union, not as an act directed specifically against the representatives of heads of state who were present at the European summit on Corfu." He adds that the Greek police are investigating the incident.
