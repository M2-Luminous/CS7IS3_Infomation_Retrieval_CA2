He gave no comment to the talks rescheduling. He said that the invitation to the Russian side was sent on time. Russia insists on further work by expert teams because it believes the plenary meeting was not prepared completely. Taranu believes the Russian delegation to be using this pretext so as to wait for the results of the parliamentary elections in Moldova and change the position concerning the Russian army in line with the results. Local observers believe Moscow expects pro-Russian parties to come to power in Moldova. Such a result would strengthen Russia's negotiating position. Taranu said that if Moldova's principled position concerning the schedule for the withdrawal of the 14th Russian Army is changed, he will refuse to head the Moldovan delegation at the talks. Moldova insists on the complete withdrawal of the 14th Russian Army before July 1, 1994. The Russian delegation believes in the mean time, that the army withdrawal should be conditioned by the adoption of a special status for the Transdniestrian region.
