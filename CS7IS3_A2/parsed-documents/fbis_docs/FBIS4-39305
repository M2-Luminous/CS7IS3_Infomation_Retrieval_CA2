Yeltsin said this today after he had bought a book by well known Russian poet Alexander Pushkin in a bookshop in Tverskaya Street (to mark the 195th anniversary of Pushkin's birth). Yeltsin repeated that on June 6 the celebrations in Normandy had just begun and each town in Normandy would celebrate the day of its own liberation from fascists. Yeltsin announced that the Russian delegation had been invited to one of the Normandy towns on June 28-29. Yeltsin underlined that established tradition was also of importance. "When we were celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the battles around Moscow and Stalingrad, etc., we did not invite any of our allies either. However, this does not stop us from being partners in all spheres, from trusting each other, respecting each other and resolving together international problems," Yeltsin emphasized. Yeltsin confirmed his intention to meet Russian writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn. Currently, Solzhenitsyn is visiting the Russian Far East.
