Such a conclusion inevitably arises when one reads, ``A Handbook on Urgent Measures for Reducing the Ecological Risk from Technogeneous Accidents and Catastrophes,'' prepared by the RF Federal Mining and Industrial Inspectorate for a session of the RF Interdepartmental Commission on Ecological Safety. The development of industrial production, particularly the most dangerous ones--the chemical and petrochemical, the oil and gas-refining sectors, and the mining and metallurgical complex--in and of itself already increases the risk of technogeneous accidents. What with the existing technical equipment at the majority of our enterprises, the danger increases manyfold. In 1992 there were 430 accidents at production facilities and sites monitored by Gosgortekhnadzor [probably, State Committee for Technical Oversight of the Mining Industry], the material losses from which amount to nearly R2 billion. Twelve train wrecks and 1,020 other incidents occurred during rail shipment of hazardous materials, in the course of which there were 817 cases of leakage of petroleum products, chemicals, and other toxic substances. In the first half of 1993, 196 accidents took place, with material losses amounting to nearly R1.6 billion. The causes are the commonly-known and traditional ones. The level of scientific research on industrial safety is inadequate to the demands of the present, which has a significant effect on the quality of design and planning work, and retards the redesign of systems for insuring stable, accident-free industrial production facilities. The grossest violations of safety requirements result from deviations from modern technology, and improper engineering decisions. The obsolesence of fixed capital at enterprises in the chemical complex, for example, amounts to 70-75 percent (having been in operation for 20 years and more). And finally, the very practice of financing environmental-protection measures out of ecological funds. According to data from Mintopenergo Rossii [RF Ministry of Fuel and Energy], in 1992 only 25 percent of the funds were expended as directed. In major industrial regions--Angarsk, Kemerovo, Ufa, Dzerzhinsk--an enormous amount of highly-toxic substances are piling up--cholrine, ammonia, hydrocyanic [prussic] acid. In the event of the development of a chain of accidents at such enterprises, the scale of the consequences is hard to imagine. Fires, explosions, and discharges of toxic products are increasingly the causes of people perishing. In the last year alone, at sites of the chemical complex, there were 82 accidents involving the destruction of production facilities and significant discharges of harmful substances. Material losses from these accidents amounted to R55.7 million. In the first eight months of this year 24 accidents took place. The handbook cites examples of the major ones. In 1992, at the Bratsk Chlorine Plant, as a result of loss of hermetic sealing on a condenser shell, chlorine was discharged into the atmosphere for 16 minutes, and it became necessary to evacuate the personnel at two neighboring enterprises. An investigation established that the enterprises had not resolved questions of accidental release of gases. An especially dangerous situation came to pass at enterprises in Irkutsk Oblast. In 1990 alone, 50 accidental discharges took place for which emergency gas rescue equipment was employed. Enterprises for extraction of minerals and the exploitation of mineral resources are exceedingly dangerous to the environment. Here it is necessary to solve the most complex problems with respect to engineering. Pumping wastes deep underground and discharge of waste waters--sooner or later turn out to be time-bombs. Special threats are posed by landslides, sudden destruction of the sides of quarries and dumps, and the destruction of rock faces. Carrying on underground mining operations beneath water-bearing strata poses significant risk, and protecting mines from flooding is an almost unsolvable problem. For instance, beneath the cities of Berezniki and Solikamsk, after many years of mining operations, 170 million cubic meters of empty space has been formed; in the event these spaces were to be accidentally flooded, the catastrophic results would be hard to predict. There has already been one such instance in the history of our potassium industry. In 1986 at the Verkhnekamsk deposit, a mine with a capacity of 7.6 million tons per year was flooded. Losses subsequently amounted to over R300 million. The working group which prepared ``A Handbook on Urgent Measures for Reducing the Ecological Risk from Technogeneous Accidents and Catastrophes,'' proposes a number of measures which, in its opinion, would permit stabilizing the situation in the next two-to-three years. Apart from the stereotypical ``intensification of criminal, administrative and economic liability,'' it proposes developing a concept for a ``National Policy of the Russian Federation in the Sphere of Technogeneous and Economic Danger,'' and also other draft laws which establish the legal basis for industrial and ecological safety. In addition, state oversight organs have taken special pains to point out the following circumstance: Under conditions of changing the forms of property, and the transfer of responsibility from the level of ministries and departments to the level of associations, corporations and concerns, the latter do not envisage or do not attribute the proper significance to the functions of managing ecological and industrial safety. Some entrepreneurs and enterprise managers are reducing or entirely eliminating the corresponding services, and are using the assets thus freed up as reserves for reducing expenditures and guaranteeing immediate profits. Thus, Gosnadzor RF [RF State Committee on Oversight] certifies that the economic mechanisms of today do not permit employing economic levers and stimuli to ensure production safety. It only remains to point out the fact that over the course of the many decades of the Soviet period a ruinous ecological policy was pursued, in the absence of any new economic conditions. Moreover, many joint stock companies and associations are--yesterday's ministries and departments, as a rule with the previous leadership intact, and consequently the former level of thinking.
