The provisions of §§200.187 and 200.188, permitting continued assistance, prorated assistance or temporary deferral of termination of assistance for certain families, do not apply to any person who is determined to be a noncitizen student, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, or the family of the noncitizen student, as described in paragraph (c) of this section. (b) Noncitizen student. For purposes of this part, a noncitizen student is defined as a noncitizen who: (1) Has a residence in a foreign country that the person has no intention of abandoning; (2) Is a bona fide student qualified to pursue a full course of study; and (3) Is admitted to the United States temporarily and solely for purposes of pursuing such a course of study at an established institution of learning or other recognized place of study in the United States, particularly designated by such person and approved by the Attorney General after consultation with the Department of Education of the United States, which institution or place of study shall have agreed to report to the Attorney General the termination of attendance of each nonimmigrant student (and if any such institution of learning or place of study fails to make such reports promptly the approval shall be withdrawn). (c) Family of noncitizen student. The prohibition on providing assistance to a noncitizen student as described in paragraph (a) of this section also extends to the noncitizen spouse of the noncitizen student and minor children of any noncitizen student if the spouse or children are accompanying the student or following to join such student. The prohibition on providing assistance to a noncitizen student does not extend to the citizen spouse of the noncitizen student and the children of the citizen spouse and noncitizen student. §200.190 Compliance with nondiscrimination requirements. The project owner shall administer the restrictions on use of assisted housing by noncitizens with ineligible immigration status imposed by this part in conformity with the nondiscrimination requirements of, including, but not limited to, title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d&hyph;2000d&hyph;5), section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794), the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601&hyph;3619), and the regulations implementing these statutes, and other civil rights statutes cited in the applicable program regulations.

(a) Protection from liability for project owners. HUD will not take any compliance, disallowance, penalty, or other regulatory action against a project owner with respect to any error in its determination of eligibility for financial assistance based on citizenship or immigration status: (1) If the project owner established eligibility based upon verification of eligible immigration status through the verification system described in §200.185; (2) Because the project owner was required to provide an opportunity for the family to submit evidence in accordance with §200.183; (3) Because the project owner was required to wait for completion of INS verification of immigration status in accordance with §200.185; (4) Because the project owner was required to wait for completion of the INS appeal process provided in accordance with §200.186(e); or (5) Because the project owner was required to provide an informal hearing in accordance with §200.186(f). (b) Protection from liability for State and local government agencies and officials. State and local government agencies and officials shall not be liable for the design or implementation of the verification system described in §200.185 and the informal hearings provided under §200.186, as long as the implementation by the State and local government agency or official is in accordance with prescribed HUD rules and requirements. §200.192 Liability of ineligible tenants for reimbursement of benefits. Where a tenant has received the benefit of HUD financial assistance to which the tenant was not entitled because the tenant intentionally misrepresented ``eligible status'' (as defined in §200.182), the ineligible tenant is responsible for reimbursing HUD for the assistance improperly paid. If the amount of the assistance is substantial, the project owner is encouraged to refer the case to the HUD Regional Inspector General's office for further investigation.
