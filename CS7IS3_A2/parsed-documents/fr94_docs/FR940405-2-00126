Request for a waiver of the disposition rules for HUD-acquired one- to four-family properties which restrict occupancy by a homeless leasee in transition to a maximum of 24 months. Nature of Requirements: The purpose of the program described in 24 CFR 291.400 is to assist individuals and families who are homeless by providing them with transitional housing. Use of HUD-acquired properties by lessees must be with the understanding that the housing provided under this program is transitional and the occupants are expected to seek and obtain permanent housing resources within two years. Granted By: Don I. Patch, Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Grant Programs. Date Granted: Longview Texas, March 10, 1993; Wasilla, Alaska, April 22, 1993. Reasons Waived: The waivers were granted for good cause to facilitate a homeless individual in each of the community mental health centers to move from transitional to permanent housing. In Longview, an extension of 12 months was granted to allow time for completion of job training. In Wasilla, an extension of 6 months was granted after which entitlements would be available for the individual to achieve independent living. 113. Regulation: 24 CFR 576.55(b)(2). Project/Activity: Saginaw, Michigan; District of Columbia; and Savannah, Georgia. Request for extension of the deadline for the expenditure of Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG) funds.
