The two draft laws are: the draft supplementary regulations governing severe punishment of criminals who organize and transport others across the border (boundary) illegally; and the draft law on the protection of investments of Taiwan compatriots. In the reports, Xiang Chunyi and Wang Shuwen said: Following the preliminary examination of these two draft laws by the fifth meeting of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee, the Law Committee and the Legislative Affairs Commission distributed copies of the draft laws to the relevant provinces and autonomous regions as well as the central departments concerned, and invited the central relevant departments and legal experts to forums to further solicit their views. Based on the views of the Standing Committee members and relevant NPC special committees after deliberation, as well as the opinions of local governments, departments, and experts, the Law Committee examined the draft laws and deemed it necessary to enact the supplementary regulations and the law on protection of the investments of Taiwan compatriots. The committee holds that the draft laws are basically feasible; and after revisions, the committee proposes that the NPC Standing Committee deliberate and approve the draft laws. On the supplementary regulations, Xiang Chunyi said: Some members and local governments suggested that in order to severely punish criminals who organize and transport others across the border (boundary) illegally, the regulations should clearly stipulate the death penalty for such criminals who have committed other serious offenses. Therefore, the Law Committee proposes that the draft regulations be revised as follows: "Offenders who also commit the crimes of killing, injuring, or raping illegal emigrants, or who also commit the crimes of killing or injuring law enforcement personnel, may be sentenced to death pursuant to the law." Meanwhile, similar revisions were suggested regarding the regulations governing penalties for criminals who transport others across the border (boundary) illegally. Some members suggested a harsher penalty for state functionaries whose violation of the regulations constitutes a crime. Hence, the Law Committee proposes that the draft regulations be revised as follows: "State functionaries in charge of issuing passports, visas, and other entry and exit documents, who knowingly issue exit or entry documents to illegal crossings of the border (boundary); and border defense, customs, and other law enforcement personnel, who knowingly let illegal emigrants cross the border (boundary), shall be sentenced to not more than three years of fixed-term imprisonment, criminal detention, or control; in serious cases, the sentence shall be not less than three years and not more than 10 years of fixed-term imprisonment." On the law on the protection of the investments of Taiwan compatriots, Wang Shuwen said: Based on the suggestions of some members, local governments, and departments, the Law Committee proposes that the law be revised as follows: "This law is formulated with a view to protecting and encouraging investments by companies, enterprises, and other economic organizations, as well as individuals, from the Taiwan region in other provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, and to promoting the economic development on both sides of the Taiwan Strait." Some members and departments suggested that this law should provide a clear definition of the investments of Taiwan compatriots, and it should only apply to the investment activities of Taiwan compatriots. Therefore, the committee proposes that the law contain the following provisions: "This law applies to the investments of Taiwan compatriots; in circumstances where the law does not provide a stipulation, they shall be enforced according to other relevant state laws and administrative rules governing the investments of Taiwan compatriots." "The investments of Taiwan compatriots referred to in this law are investments by companies, enterprises, and other economic organizations from the Taiwan region in other provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities." Wang Shuwen said: Some departments suggested that in addition to protecting the investments and investment returns of Taiwan compatriots in the mainland, it is also necessary to protect the personal safety of the investors. Hence, the committee proposes that the draft law be revised as the follows: "The state, by law, protects the personal safety, investments, investment returns, and other lawful rights and interests of investors." Some members suggested that we should encourage Taiwan compatriot-investors to use their investment returns to make new investments, which should not be limited to convertible currency. Therefore, the committee proposes that the draft law be revised as follows: "Taiwan compatriots-investors may use convertible currency; machinery, equipment, or other material goods; industrial property rights; and nonpatented technology as investments." "Taiwan compatriot- investors may use their investment returns to make new investments. He added: According to provisions of the draft law, "enterprises funded and set up by Taiwan compatriot-investors in the mainland should comply with the state's national economic and social development plans and industrial policy." At the suggestion of some members, the committee proposes that the provisions be revised as follows: "Enterprises set up with the investments of Taiwan compatriots should comply with the state's industrial policy and should be beneficial to national economic development."
