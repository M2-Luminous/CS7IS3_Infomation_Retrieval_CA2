The conference closed its doors, but opened doors to ties between Cuba and its children abroad. The closing remarks were by Politburo member Jose Ramon Balaguer: [Begin Balaguer recording] We conclude the Nation and the Emigre Community Conference with great satisfaction and the natural uncertainty of those who begin a new path. Beginning our journey down a new road is precisely what we have been doing here these past three days. [end recording] The meeting that was called by the Cuban Government continues a process which began in 1978 and that did not conclude with just words. Regarding this conference, Politburo member Carlos Lage said: [Begin Lage recording] These meetings were held in an atmosphere of respect. I believe these meetings have been useful and positive and that they will not end here, but will continue. I believe we can expect many things. Just yesterday we announced some measures we had been analyzing. There may be many openings, but the reality of our relations with the emigre community is facing a difficult obstacle, an obstacle that cannot be ignored: the U.S. blockade against Cuba. [end recording] The hosts announced several measures that will contribute to advancing this identification between the two sides of the Cuban culture. [passage omitted]
