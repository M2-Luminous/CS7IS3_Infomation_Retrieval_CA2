The meeting was prompted by the extremely difficult financial situation in the Army and the Navy, the need to look for extra ways to cut military expenditures, to choose priorities in spending, and to tighten economic austerity. The meeting was attended by Army General P.S. Grachev, Russian Federation defense minister; A.A. Kokoshin, his first deputy; State Tax Service chief V.V. Gusev, and other senior officials. The defense minister pointed in his report to the financial- economic service's considerable contribution to the organization and preparation of new, highly efficient Armed Forces. At the same time, he stressed that in current conditions one of the main objective of commanders and chiefs of all ranks is the search for ways to cut spending and to make sure that all money appropriated for defense needs are spent efficiently. Given drastic cuts in appropriations for Army and Navy equipment, every ruble spent for these purposes should serve to strengthen the Armed Forces as much as possible. At the same time, it was noted that even in these difficult conditions concern for servicemen, civilian personnel, Armed Forces veterans, and their family members remains a priority objective. The defense minister stressed that at a time of inflation and legislative confusion only the financial-economic service can securely shield the army from those who would like to cash in at its expense. Army Gen. Grachev said that financial staffers should be the first to help commanders solve financial and economic problems. Given that, the Defense Ministry leadership will do its utmost to boost the prestige of the financial-economic service and to enhance its status. Participants in the meeting put a lot of questions to the State Tax Service chief, because relations between the service and the Armed Forces have yet to be fully straightened out. Even the cost of meat produced on military units' own subsidiary plots for the personnel mess list is often taxed locally. The military have been fined for delaying payments to the budget and pensions fund, which is absurd because the nonpayments have been caused by the sluggish and incomplete financing of the Armed Forces from the federal budget. The State Tax Service chief promised that these matters would be sorted out in the very near future.
