In the 100 days from 1 January to 10 April 1994, how have things been going with the various reform measures newly presented? What are the social effects? Facing these questions, Feng Bing, deputy secretary-general of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economic System answered: "Generally, the implementing of various reform measures has been very smooth, and the assessment from top to grass roots is very high." Feng Bing indicated that over the past 100 days, reform in the macroeconomic regulation and control system has been conducted, including finance, taxation, banking, foreign exchange, foreign trade, and planned investment. Tax and Fiscal Reform Is in Period of Fine Tuning He said measures for tax and fiscal reform are basically in operating normally and in a period of fine tuning. From the angle of effects, internal financial revenue in the first quarter markedly increased. Taking January and February for example, internal financial revenue was 50.7 billion yuan, up by 32.1 percent over the same period last year; financial expenditures were 49.15 billion yuan, up by 29.1 percent. Income was 1.55 billion yuan higher than expenditures. Conditions for the issuance of 12.92 billion yuan of national bonds were sound, and people were vying for their purchase. In the course of reform, the phenomenon by which some localities and enterprises arbitrarily raised prices by taking advantage of taxation reform surfaced for a time. Aiming at this phenomenon, the State Planning Commission and Taxation Administration jointly published the "Circular on Banning Price Rises By Taking Advantage of Tax Reform," with the State Council's approval, while augmenting propaganda about and explanation of the new tax system and removing some people's misunderstanding of taxing price subsidies, thus enabling a prompt solution to the problem. Sound Condition in Foreign Exchange Reform The main contents of reform in the banking structure this year are, namely, augmenting central bank's functions, and implementing separation of banking of a policy nature from commercial banking. Work in this arena is actively under way. As Feng Bing disclosed, at present the central bank is fast recovering banknotes from circulation, with 90 percent of the banknotes issued before the spring festival recovered, and the condition of monetary operation is sound. Foreign exchange and foreign trade restructuring with the merger of the two-track exchange rates and implementation of the system of foreign exchange settlement and selling of foreign exchange as the main contents were originally a cause of anxiety because of many uncertain factors and greater risk. However, in the 100 days since the new structure was implemented, progress has been smooth, and conditions are better than expected. The only trouble came in foreign exchange coupons; because of insufficient consideration of the issue, some stores allowed a price hike of goods to be purchased with foreign exchange coupons exclusively. This resulted in a run on foreign exchange coupons and panic buying with them. Later, responsive measures were adopted, and the problem was promptly pacified. The market exchange rate has all along been kept at the comparatively rational level of 8.7 yuan against the dollar. Feng Bing believes that in view of the import-export situation and the revenue and expenditures in foreign exchange, it is entirely possible to stabilize the exchange rate at the present level through regulation of the foreign exchange market. The planned investment structure is under reform according to the original plan. The "change from fund allotment to loans" is being converted to the "change from loans to investment." The train of thought of plural investment bodies has already been set, with major foundation work completed. However, it will take some time to shape the system. Reform of the modern enterprise system has not yet spread on a wide scale as of today, and is still in an experimental phase, with 100 enterprises carefully selected for the experiment. The chief hurdles to enterprise transition to the modern enterprise system are, first, excessive social burdens; second, excessive overstaffing; and third, heavy debt burdens. Feng Bing believes the solution to those problems primarily calls for the enterprises' own efforts; however, support and help from governments at all levels are also indispensable. Consumer Prices on the High Side Calls For Attention The deputy secretary-general believes the smooth going of various reforms is based on stability, especially economic stability, namely being free of vicious inflation. He said the price rise range in China in March was 30 percent. The price level was on the high side, which calls for our attention. He denied that the price rise was related to reform in the macroeconomic regulation and control system, especially tax reform. He said that the general level of tax burden has remained unchanged and would not push prices up. It might lead to some readjustment in individual enterprises, but the effect on the general price level is insignificant. He stressed that inflation did not result from reform; on the contrary, reform of the macroeconomic regulation and control system is the most effective means to reduce inflation. Feng Bing attributed the price rise to two major causes, first, expansion in the scope of investment in fixed assets. Last year, the general input was 110 billion yuan, up by 50 percent from the previous year; this year, the input was 130 billion yuan, up by 20 percent from last year. Too many projects broke ground last year; because they were behind schedule, they helped in expanding the investment in fixed assets this year; consequently, they became the direct cause for increased issuance of banknotes. And second was the expansion in consumption funds, which also resulted in pushing up prices. Besides, the general price level has remained high; this condition is connected with the aftermath of price reform and price readjustments as well as price rises in farm produce. However, he believed that all this did not pose an absolute threat to consumer prices, because the aftermath of price readjustment almost ended by the end of last year. In addition, there was a good harvest in grain last year, with a comparatively ample supply of such farm and sideline produce as meat and eggs. Based on the aforesaid facts, Feng Bing said that so long as a good job is done in resolving the excessive scope of investment in fixed assets and the expansion in consumption funds, in addition to maintaining steady growth in agricultural production and adopting measures to promptly ease social psychological pressures, vicious inflation will be avoided. At the same time, if China can insure the down-to-earth implementation of reform measures in the course of operation without distortion, the prospects of various reforms in China will be very bright.
