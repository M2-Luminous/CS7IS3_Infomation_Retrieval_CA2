At a news conference he failed to comment at length on the activities of his "prime minister" Bujar Bukosi in Washington, where this man had requested support from U.S. officials for separatist demands for the secession of Kosovo and Metohija from Serbia, but stressed that these activities were "within the framework of regular visits to and contacts with the United States." The DSK president welcomed the Belgian foreign minister's visit to Tirana, dubbing as "press speculations" hints that Willy Claes would convey to Albanian President Sali Berisha the European Union's stance on the inviolability of borders and its position that Kosmet [Kosovo and Metohija] Albanians can seek a solution only within the context of autonomy. Not ruling out the possibility that Claes and Berisha could examine all options for resolving the Kosmet issue, Rugova declared that, as "president of Kosovo," a title he had bestowed upon himself, he would take into account the will of the Albanians expressed at the referendum. This, he said, means "an independent and neutral Kosovo" which, in his view, is "a compromise solution acceptable to both Albanians and Serbs." He described the Yugoslav Government's decision not to allow foreign missions in Kosovo as "confirmation of a stubborn and damaging policy pursued by the Serbian authorities." Speaking about the German authorities' intention to deport several thousand Yugoslav refugees, mostly Albanians, Rugova said that he had received official assurances that this would be done "as painlessly as possible," but he failed to elaborate on what this meant.
