The document, a copy of which has been made available to Interfax by the Congress of Russian Communities, points out that "the Estonian side by its actions is provoking mass acts of civil disobedience and in the background of a continuously worsening economic situation are preparing to introduce police rule." The community charges the Estonian nationalist government with the intent to start ethnic cleansing in the republic by various means, direct deportation included, for which a concentration camp has been set at Rummu near Tallinn, and a special police service is being formed. The community regards as humiliating for Russia the Estonian government's demands that the Russians permanently residing in the republic and persons without Estonian citizenship be required to formally apply for residence and employment, and that retired army officers are additionally forced to present their army service records and results of medical checks on AIDS, tuberculosis, and other diseases. Those without residence permits are declared illegal foreign migrants and are expelled from Estonia immediately. But even with residence permits, the Russians and other nationals who have permanently lived in Estonia are only entitled to temporary residence (5 years) with all the ensuing consequences (the loss of the right to privatize housing, buy property, etc.), the appeal says.
