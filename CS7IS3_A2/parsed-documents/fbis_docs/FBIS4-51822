The sources said a host of senior bank officials will make a fact-finding tour of China later this month. They said 20 branch managers of Sumitomo Bank will set out on a four-day mission in two groups May 25, one on a tour of Beijing and Shanghai, and the other on a visit to Hong Kong and Shanghai. Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank also plans to send a group of about 10 branch managers on a weeklong tour of Beijing, Dalian, Shanghai and Hong Kong, starting June 4, they said. The sources said Fuji Bank, which started a regular inspection tour of China last year, now plans to increase the number of visits, sending three groups in the first fiscal half, which ends in September. Mitsubishi Bank also is prepared to step up inspection tours of China while Tokai Bank and Daiwa Bank have moved to form a team of experts on China, they said. Japan's investment in China in 1993 soared to about 3,500 cases from about 1,800 cases in the preceding year as an increasing number of Japanese manufacturers established production bases in the country, according to industry figures. Commercial banks intend to improve their services to Japanese firms doing business in the Chinese market, the sources said.
