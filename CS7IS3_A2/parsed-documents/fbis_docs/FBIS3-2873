"I spent the night at the police station and the police made it clear I was not to go too far," Yang said in a telephone interview. His detention came less than an hour after the arrival of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who is expected to ask the Chinese government about progress on human rights. Yang, a 50-year-old veteran dissident, was one of the nine founders of the Peace Charter, a human rights movement set up last November. Two of its leaders, Qin Yongming and Zhou Guoqiang, have been imprisoned. The secretary general of the Human Rights Association, Shanghai-based Wang Fuchen, was also detained for questioning Friday. The Chinese government has launched a major offensive against dissidents and rebel intellectuals over the past 10 days, questioning about 15, of whom three are still in custody. The latest crackdown coincided with the annual session of the National People's Congress, which began sitting Thursday.
