But this view is certainly not endorsed by all. Mr. Ch'en Shao-kan [7115 1421 1949], Secretary General of the Hong Kong Productivity Council, holds that since Hong Kong's industry has moved north, industry has not only not become less important to Hong Kong, but is growing increasingly important instead. So we have these two absolutely differing views involving different understandings of the manufacturing industry and different views on its position. Mr. Ch'en Shao-kan favors a new and correct understanding of the manufacturing industry, with a continued upgrading of the production capacity of Hong Kong's manufacturing industry, so that Hong Kong can develop along with southern China into a world-class manufacturing center. Hong Kong's economic structure has undergone a great change in the last two or three decades. In the 1950s and 1960s, Hong Kong changed from an entrepot-trade port to an export-oriented, light-industrial manufacturing center. Then in the 1970s, it turned to diversified development, with a rising financial industry, so that Hong Kong became one of the world's key financial and service centers. Particularly in the last 15 years, along with China's reform and opening, Hong Kong's economic structure has once more seen new changes. In order to lower production costs, a stream of Hong Kong industrialists have moved their plants to inland China, to exploit China's cheap manpower and land resources in the service of Hong Kong's manufacturing industry. Hong Kong manufacturers now have more than 6,000 independently run or joint-venture plants in Guangdong which, in addition to many other types of projects, employ about 3 million workers, or five times the number in Hong Kong's manufacturing industry. Meanwhile, Hong Kong's entrepot trade is flourishing again. Hong Kong is now the world's tenth largest trade zone, with its industrial and commercial development stimulating further growth of its financial and service industries. This is precisely why many experts and academics, and even the Hong Kong government, all hold that Hong Kong's economy has now been converted to mostly service industries, or that Hong Kong has become a service-type economy. As to this view, Mr. Ch'en Shao-kan, Secretary General of the Hong Kong Productivity Council, and Dr. Huo Ting-yang [7202 1353 3152], an official in the design and automation sector, have various differences. Is the Manufacturing Industry in Hong Kong Not Important? At a meeting with inland experts, they said: In Hong Kong, many hold that since Hong Kong's production process has been moved north, Hong Kong has gradually become a service-type society, with the manufacturing industry of increasingly less importance to Hong Kong's economy, which argument is of great concern. If Hong Kong turns into a service society, Hong Kong's economy may become "hollowed out," which would not be in line with Hong Kong's interests. In fact, as to Hong Kong's current situation since its factories have been moved inland, the manufacturing industry remains increasingly important to Hong Kong's economy for the following reason. While Hong Kong products used to be basically assembled in Hong Kong (the process has now been moved to southern China), Hong Kong manufacturers have certainly not abandoned industrial production, but are simply putting more emphasis on aspects, such as product design, manufacturing design, industrial-pattern manufacturing, parts deals, and packing. It could be said that if Hong Kong did not have an industrial-production manufacturing capability, the current factory growth in the Zhu Jiang [Pearl River] Delta zone would not necessarily be in its current state. Even more importantly, Hong Kong plays a role as an industrial-support port, doing all that it does for industrial production, a role that is still not reflected in any statistical data. How Do We Distinguish the Manufacturing From the Service Industry? This point also illustrates the confusion and narrowness in Hong Kong's definition of the manufacturing industry. For instance, in the current manufacturing industry, employees are differentiated by all in-factory sanitation workers and accounting personnel being listed as manufacturing-industry employees, while product designers in offices are often listed as service personnel. Such a statistical method is very primitive and backward, unable to reflect the current state of economic development. The manufacturing industry certainly does not refer to assembly and processing alone, as the assembly costs for higher-precision products generally make up less than 10 percent of overall cost, with manufacturing being a process of turning raw materials into components, and then components into manufactured products. The work of a comprehensive manufacturing enterprise includes all processes, such as R&D, design, tool assembly, material selection, component purchasing, quality control, assembly, packing, and retail sales. As manufacturing operations become increasingly precise and diverse, such "service" components of the production process increase correspondingly. Is It Not More Suitable To Say That Hong Kong Is a Comprehensive Manufacturing Center? It should be said that Hong Kong is now developing from a simple assembly center into a more complete comprehensive-manufacturing center. From this perspective, it can be said that China and Hong Kong are beginning to evolve a division of labor in which the Zhu Jiang Delta zone handles most assembly operations, while Hong Kong is responsible for preparatory work and later storage, such as marketing, dissemination, purchasing, product development, design, and quality engineering, as well as services, such as final product quality and retail sales. This preparatory work and after service sharply raises the added value of products produced through assembly in China. Taking stock of the economic development of various countries, particularly the United States and Japan, they had already moved their labor-intensive industries as long as two to three decades ago to low-cost zones, such as Hong Kong and Southeast Asia, emphasing the upgrading of their own technology and continuing control of their outside planned development. So Japan remains a very successful industrial nation. There is not much difference in the route taken now by Hong Kong in moving some labor-intensive industries to the mainland and that taken by the United States and Japan two to three decades ago, the only one being that the United States and Japan still emphasize that they are industrial nations, while Hong Kong says that it will and has developed into a service center. But the reality is that Hong Kong's industry has not been "hollowed out" or made responsible for goods flow alone due to the move north, with Hong Kong still in control of design and production technology, and responsible for technology flow. And it is only by controlling these key links that that it can promote industrial development in the Zhu Jiang Delta zone. Should the Emphasis Be On Conversion or Added Value? From another perspective, the crucial issue is not whether the economy should be converted, but rather whether added value can be increased. If the industrial conversion to service trades increases added value, this will be a good thing, but if added value drops instead, this will certainly be bad. The U.S. is certainly now experiencing the problem of its industry being "hollowed out," with its secondary industries being converted to tertiary ones with lower added value. U.S. wages show that an ordinary service worker makes about $40 a day, while the daily wage for manufacturing industry workers is $66, with it being very hard for workers eliminated from manufacturing jobs to find comparable new ones, as manufacturing wages are higher. This shows that added value is lower in U.S. tertiary industries. Another example is post-production semiconductor assembly, a labor-intensive industry for the United States, which, as far back as the 1960s, was transferred to places such as Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. So Americans today absolutely do not know how to package semiconductors, no longer having such technology. Japan is different, in that while it similarly moved labor-intensive industries abroad in the 1960s and 1970s, it kept high added-value production, such as packaging, at home. In other words, while Japan, like the United States, moved its low added-value industries abroad, it never "hollowed out" its own industry, always keeping its highest technology on Japanese soil. Although the United States designed the notebook computer, it does not have high-precision electronic-assembly technology, so cannot produce it. But as Japan has this technology, it can design and produce it. Even Taiwan and Hong Kong can design and produce the notebook computer, as Hong Kong has learned these technologies over a period of time. The crux of the matter is that the distinction between the manufacturing and service industries is certainly growing increasingly blurred, with the need for care being the added-value issue. While certain service added value in support of manufacturing is quite high, the added value of the service industry alone is lower. When service industries are now mentioned, many think first of finance, commerce, service trades, catering, and tourism.... Taking the financial industry as an example, while its added value is not low, it provides very few jobs, meaning that not many can serve in finance. As Hong Kong's overall economy needs to grow, it will always need manufacturing growth. Does Dealing Well With Accumulated Manufacturing Experience Concern Only Hong Kong? It finally needs to be pointed out that Hong Kong should continue to raise the production capacity of its own manufacturing industry. In this area, Hong Kong is ahead of China, having accumulated rich experience. So if Hong Kong strives to become a service society, no longer engaging in industrial-production manufacturing, this would mean abandoning all of its accumulated experience, which would have to be called a waste of resources, as well as a regrettable matter. It is obvious that the rapid growth of southern China's economy is due to Hong Kong's having moved its long-accumulated experience there to benefit southern China too. So continued investment in Hong Kong industry will continue to move Hong Kong's production ahead, actually also continuing to promote China's development. As Hong Kong's human and land resources are now inadequate, with S&T forces also not rich, which might become limiting factors shortly, if Hong Kong and the southern China region can link up closely to form an integrated economic region, most of Hong Kong's resource limitations can be resolved through reciprocal supplementation, mutual benefit, and joint development. Hong Kong is now in an advantageous position, so should do all it can to provide the management and S&T needed to develop this economic region into a world-class manufacturing center, in order to bring its economic potential and impact into full play.
