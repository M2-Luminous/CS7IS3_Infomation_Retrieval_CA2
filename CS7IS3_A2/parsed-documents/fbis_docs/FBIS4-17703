The meeting was held behind closed doors and journalists in Kishinev received official information of its results. The spokesman for the Gagauz leader, Andrei Ibrishim, told Interfax that the two presidents discussed status of the regions densely populated by the Gagauz. He said that the bilateral commission was working successfully and the draft law may be worked out shortly and submitted to parliament within a month. The spokesman refused to disclose the essence of the discussed document. He said, However, it coincides largely with the earlier bill on a special legal status of Gagauzia with account of proposals of the CSCE standing commission and US independent experts. Another problem urgent for Snegur is the settlement of the situation in Transdniestria. Chairman of the parliament of the self-proclaimed Transdniestrian Moldovan Republic, Grigory Marakutsa, said that another round of the Moldovan-Transdniestrian talks would be held shortly. Leaders of Kishinev and Tiraspol deputies of both parliaments and senior Russian officials are expected to take part. According to Marakutsa, following recent elections in Moldova, the situation for Tiraspol changed for the better and hopefully, the two sides will agree to compromise. The Transdniestrian leader believes that Kishinev should agree to the creation of a confederative state to settle the situation. He said that Transdniestria will be part of such a state until Moldova is a sovereign state. However, the official Kishinev is flatly against the variant, said Marakutsa. Its rapprochement with Romania has suspended so far and no one will guarantee that this will never happen.
