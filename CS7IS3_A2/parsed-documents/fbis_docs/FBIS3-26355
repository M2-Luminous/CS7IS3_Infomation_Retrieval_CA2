The localities must comply with the regulations. The laws and regulations formulated by themselves without authorization are all null and void. In view of the proposals made by foreign investors, there will be some readjustment in the detailed rules for implementation to be promulgated very soon. China's real estate developed rapidly last year and the year before, Liu Zhongli said, but the government failed to introduce effective tax categories. Now the State Council has approved the regulations on levying a value-added land tax. As a law, it must be enforced. He clarified some misunderstanding. The value-added land tax is not merely levied on foreign businessmen because tax laws apply to both Chinese and foreign-funded enterprises and individuals. Liu said that the regulations are promulgated to crack down on speculation in real estate. Actually, the returns from real estate go as high as 30 to 40 percent. Liu Zhongli said that he had heard opinions aired by foreign businessmen on the new regulations. He said that their opinions and proposals will be taken into account in the detailed rules for implementation to be promulgated soon. The minister said that the detailed rules constitute a kind of tax law. One of the principles of tax reform is a fair tax burden and unification of tax laws. Liu said that he had not heard about the news of Guangzhou and Hainan promulgating their own sets of tax laws. If some localities have promulgated their own regulations on levying the value-added land tax, they will all be null and void. Liu pointed out that the value-added land charges collected by Shenzhen and other localities in the past will automatically become void following promulgation of the new value-added land tax. All localities should abide by the unified tax system of the Finance Ministry. Despite the implementation of the new tax system, Liu said, preferential policies for the special economic regions will remain unchanged. The value-added land tax is the only thing which belongs to the state. On the question of the impact of the new tax system on foreign investors, Liu Zhongli made an analysis of three aspects: First, in the value-added tax, foreign businessmen, who have signed contracts with China before 31 December 1993 and who have a tax burden, will only have to return the amount of taxes earned in the next five years. Second, company and enterprise income taxes have not increased or decreased, but domestic enterprises are drawing closer to foreign-funded ones. Third, the rate of personal income tax of 90 percent of the foreign staff dropped while only 10 percent rose, with the extent exceeding not more than 5 percent.
