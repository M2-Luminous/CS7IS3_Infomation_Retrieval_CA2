Immediately upon his return, the minister said that the two visits were completely different from the point of view of their contents. The talks in Ljubljana, Slovenia, defined in the dialogue between our minister and his departmental counterpart, Jelko Kacin, were oriented mainly toward an exchange of views on security issues in the Central European region and on the next course of action within the framework of the Partnership for Peace plan. According to Minister Kanis, the talks with President Milan Kucan had a special quality. First and foremost, from the point of view of the broad coalition government in Slovenia, which is fully functional and, therefore, contradicts the claims by some of our politicians about the impossibility of normal activity by such a grouping. The Slovak Army commander, Lieutenant General Julius Humaj, who was also a member of the delegation, briefed journalists on the military aspect of the talks in Slovenia. Among other things, he said that he had followed up on the talks he had had with General Gucman, chief of the Slovene General Staff, last December. Following the division of greater Yugoslavia, Slovenia is at the stage of building up its own army and is resolved to expend considerable resources on this. In this context, it has asked to cooperate with Slovakia, first and foremost, in training certain types of troops. For example, our assistance could consist of training military pilots or artillery gunners. Humaj emphasized, however, that this would require the Slovene Army to also have our systems among its armaments so that it could then, as the case may be, exercise in our military areas. It is simply up to the Slovene side which of our proposals it will accept. With regard to the embargo that is still in force, they are convinced in Ljubljana that it will come to an end this fall and then nothing will stand in the way of even military cooperation. The two sides should sign a specific agreement during the coming visit of Minister Jelko Kacin, which should take place in about a month. The focal point of the visit to Croatia was a visit to the Slovak engineering battalion, which is part of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] forces in Yugoslavia and which, on Saturday, was celebrating its first anniversary in the difficult conditions of the region of its deployment. According to the defense minister, "such activity in UN peacekeeping missions should form a significant element of the Slovak Army's future activity, and, therefore, it is necessary to strengthen it." Kanis also said that very few of Slovakia's citizens are aware of the good reputation these soldiers are earning for us and that they are also creating a very advantageous and suitable basis for Slovak diplomacy in the international arena. "We have to overcome the very simplified views held by our citizens about the activity of Slovak troops in UNPROFOR services. I think our units are doing very well there and that the UNPROFOR command also appreciates them," said the defense minister to reporters in his assessment of the visit following his return to Bratislava.
