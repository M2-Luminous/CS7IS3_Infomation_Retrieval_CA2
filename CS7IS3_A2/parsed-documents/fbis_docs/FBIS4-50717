The 943-kilometer long railway, which cost 1.8 billion yuan, will greatly ease the middle and short-range passenger and freight transport pressure in northern China, officials from the Ministry of Railways said at a ceremony yesterday. The railway will be an important route for passengers, coal and timber from the western part of the region to the eastern coast. Rich natural resources will be better utilized and development of minority nationalities-inhabited areas will be accelerated, officials said. The railway will be a section of the second Eurasia railway, to run from Jinzhou city in Liaoning Province to Rotterdam in the Netherlands via Erenhot, Ulaanbataar and Moscow. The new local railway is aimed to have an annual handling capacity of seven million tons in the near future and 17 million tons later. The track crosses four leagues (prefectures) and 13 counties or banners. The railway will cut 537 km off the route from the four leagues to Hohhot, capital of the autonomous region, compared with the old route via Hebei Province or Beijing.
