Because of heavy snowfalls, most parts of the Tibet Plateau are very cold. To be prepared for future warfare [wei lai zhan zheng] and to train crack troops able to carry out all emergency missions under any weather conditions, the military district, after careful planning, notified all units in the district to immediately leave their barracks and train their troops in snow-capped areas to improve their combat effectiveness. During the last 10 days of January, offices of the military district organized their civilian personnel, cooks, drivers, and other workers to take part in marches. In accordance with their geographical environments and natural conditions, units stationed in Lhasa, Shannan, Nyingchi, Xigaze, and Qamdo Prefectures trained their troops in areas where conditions were unfavorable. So far, over 85 percent of the units in Tibet have carried out their winter training assignments.
