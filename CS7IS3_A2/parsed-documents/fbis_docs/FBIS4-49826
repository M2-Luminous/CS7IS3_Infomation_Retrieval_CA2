They exchanged opinions on China's re-entry into GATT and some other issues of common concern. Li said that eight years have passed since China applied for re-entry into GATT, and now, although the Uruguay Round has ended, the re-entry issue remains unsettled. He said that China was a full participant in the Uruguay Round and China advocates a balance between rights and obligations on GATT issues. Li noted that China, as an open country now, has to practice trade in accordance with international rules, adding that China is making efforts to re-enter GATT and become a founding member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which is due to be set up next year, in order to meet the demands of China's economic development and many other countries' requirements. On market access, Li said this is a gradual procedure and China will lower its tariffs step by step, pointing out that along with the development of China's economy, China will realize its commitment through its own efforts. Touching upon the national treatment issue, Li said that the unification of China's dual-track exchange rates is the most profitable treatment for overseas business people. He continued that the opening of China's service sector, from hotel management over 10 years ago to shops, banks and insurance, has expanded during the past few years. To assure healthy development of China's service sector, Li noted that the opening of this sector should go forward step by step, for China lacks experience and qualified personnel in this field, adding that such an opening will be profitable for both the Chinese and the foreign sides. Li said that the future WTO should treat China as a developing country, and China should never accept the standards for developed countries. Before the meeting, China's Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi also met with Sutherland. Wu said that China needs the assurance of a multi-lateral trade system and the world trade system also needs China as a participant. She added that, without the participation of China, WTO would be incomplete and would lack universality. Sutherland said that China should become a full participant in WTO so as to provide it with both assurance and opportunities, and he expressed hope that both negotiating sides would show some flexibility to achieve the anticipated results at an early date.
