FBIS4-7124 "dreas082_c_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-082 Daily Report 27 Apr 1994 North Korea Rod Replacement To Begin `Soon' Rod Replacement To Begin `Soon' SK2704110194 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1051 GMT 27 Apr 94 SK2704110194 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Fuel Rod of Experimental Nuclear Power Station To Be Replaced in DPRK" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, April 27 (KCNA) -- According to a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the DPRK will soon begin the replacement of the fuel rod according to the operation plan of the 5 megawatt experimental nuclear power station for the present as part of the undertakings for the normalization of our peaceful nuclear activities. Answering a question put by KCNA today, the spokesman said: Consistent is our stand to show the honesty of our nuclear activities, although the replacement of the fuel rod is being made while we are still in a unique status following the temporary suspension of the effectuation of our declared withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Hence, we decided to voluntarily notify the International Atomic Energy Agency of our plan for the replacement of fuel rod and, especially, to allow inspectors of the IAEA to observe the process of replacement of the fuel rod so that they may verify that nuclear materials are not diverted to non-peaceful purposes, and promptly issued entry visas to the inspectors as requested by the agency. If inspection activities falling within the scope of routine and ad hoc inspections are raised in the course of the replacement of the fuel rod, they may be allowed after the nuclear issue is settled in a package deal at future DPRK-U.S. talks. We will leave the fuel rod to be replaced this time strictly under the containment and surveillance of the IAEA and fully provide the continuity of safeguards data. We are studying the problem of "additional inspection" of the radiochemical laboratory raised during the March inspection activities of the IAEA in close relations with the attitude of the United States and the IAEA Secretariat. Hence, we have already notified them that we are willing to allow an "additional inspection" as an exception after examining their future behavior in keeping with the change of the current situation surrounding the exchange of special envoys between the North and South. If the United States and the IAEA Secretariat, ignoring our good will, rudely demand sampling and other inspection activities in disregard of our unique status at the time of the replacement of the fuel rod, we will have to regard it as a sinister political intention to continue more openly the campaign for stifling the DPRK over its peaceful nuclear activities. When an irrevocable complex situation is created by that, we cannot hold ourselves responsible for it at all. If the United States and the IAEA Secretariat respect our unique status and take a fair attitude and position, looking straight at the current situation, another opportunity of finding a fundamental solution to the nuclear issue will be created.
