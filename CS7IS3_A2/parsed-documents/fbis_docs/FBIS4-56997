In addition, it could prevent additional tears, orphans, and widows. Thus, from the humane point of view, it is regrettable. We all would like for it to be right away, immediately; that is why the defense minister made those proposals, because the people in general yearn for it, ask for it, and demand it, de Leon added. Nevertheless, if conditions according to them are not right yet and we have to delay this schedule, which has been signed and must be respected, so be it, because we cannot do anything about it, he concluded.
