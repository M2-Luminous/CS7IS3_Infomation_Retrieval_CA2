According to Grachev, Russia's military doctrine does not regard any country as an enemy, but Russia has its own vital interests, which a strong and highly efficient army should protect. Grachev praised the performance of the artillery school in training skilled military personnel. Today graduation diplomas were given to another 300 young lieutenants, who will put into effect the army reform.
