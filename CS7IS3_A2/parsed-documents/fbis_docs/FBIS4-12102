In a statement, Hamas called on all national forces and groups to meet and formulate a national program on the basis of the Israeli Army's full withdrawal, the removal of settlements, and the election of a national leadership that safeguards the right of the Palestinian people to obtaining their rights and to self-determination. The statement proclaimed Hamas' rejection of the principle of reinstating former mayors instead of the current ones, some of whom were appointed by the Israeli authorities. It called for adopting the method of elections as the only means for choosing leading officials in municipalities, institutions, trade unions, and all popular bodies. Hamas, which is resolutely opposed to holding talks with the Israelis, described the deployment of international observers in Hebron, expected to take place within a week, as a symbolic measure that seeks to justify the resumption of talks between Israel and the PLO. The statement called on all Arab countries to exert pressure on the United States in the wake of its recent stance on Jerusalem, so that the Clinton administration would back down from this stance and declare that, in accordance with international law, the Palestinian territories are occupied. The statement urged the Arabs to adhere to the economic boycott of Israel and refuse to normalize relations with it.
