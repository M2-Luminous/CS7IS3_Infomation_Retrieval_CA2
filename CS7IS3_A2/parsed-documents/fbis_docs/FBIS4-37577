FBIS4-37577 "drnes120dd_94001" FBIS-NES-94-120 Daily Report 21 Jun 1994 Palestinian Affairs 'Arafat Threatens To Call Off Gaza, Jericho Visit 'Arafat Threatens To Call Off Gaza, Jericho Visit TA2106182794 Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television Network in Hebrew 1700 GMT 21 Jun 94 TA2106182794 Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television Network Hebrew BFN [Text] PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat this evening threatened to put off his visit to Gaza and Jericho due to the announcement issued by Rabin's bureau whereby the prime minister and the foreign minister instructed their aides to sever their contacts with Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi. Dr. al-Tibi, an Israeli citizen, played a prominent role in the contacts between Israel and the PLO as 'Arafat's adviser. According to a legal opinion drafted a few months ago by Yo'el Singer, the Foreign Ministry's legal adviser, al-Tibi cannot take part in the negotiations because he is an Israeli citizen. Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen has learned that there have been no official contacts with al-Tibi over the last few months anyway, and that today's announcement came after it was learned that al-Tibi and elements in the foreign minister's bureau continue to be in contact. Al-Tibi argued this evening that he met a few weeks ago with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in the latter's home despite Singer's legal opinion. Officials in the prime minister's bureau explained that anybody may speak to al-Tibi, but that he is not an official address for negotiations.
