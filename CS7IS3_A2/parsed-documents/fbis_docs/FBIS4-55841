Klaus was already refusing to comment on the claim that he behaves arrogantly towards President Havel on Tuesday [17 May]. Targeting Milos Zeman, chairman of the Czech Social Democratic Party, who had made this claim, the prime minister said in the Czech Radio Radizurnal program, among other things: "Regarding famous and world renowned arrogance, he should consider himself and let others live their own lives." Zeman said at the Czech Social Democratic Party conference on 13 May: "We have a certain empathy with the lonely man in Prague Castle, who is now and then bombarded with arrogant telephone calls from the Czech prime minister." Free Democrats (Civic Movement) Chairman Jiri Dienstbier replied to the RUDE PRAVO question concerning Friday's conference: "There are political forces here that are attempting to keep the president in the Castle as isolated as possible."
