FBIS4-5627 "dreas071__a94020" FBIS-EAS-94-071-A Daily Report 10 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Funding Needed for Optical Fiber Cable Network Funding Needed for Optical Fiber Cable Network OW1204105894 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 10 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 3--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1204105894 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MOPT] will press ahead with the expansion of the optical fiber cable communications network across the country from 1994. The MOPT plans to raise the current ceiling of low-interest loans by the Japan Development Bank to the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) and other telephone companies by about 3.3 times after obtaining an agreement on raising the current ceiling from the Finance Ministry late last week. The U.S. Government has announced plans to build an information highway network, and in response, the MOPT has concluded that the government's aggressive assistance to the promotion of upgrading the existing communications infrastructure is indispensable. The telephone companies that will benefit from the government's assistance are NTT, DDI [Daini Denden Company], Japan Telecom, and Japan Highspeed Communications. The MOPT Intends to set the raised ceiling of low-interest loans at a total of 52.5 billion yen after examining their business programs. The MOPT wants to lower interest rates on the low-interest loans to three-fourths the current annual interest rate of 4.4 percent applied to loans for financial investment, with a grace period maximum of 15 years. The current interest rate on the low-interest loans to telephone companies is running at 3.3 percent per annum. Compared with the road network, the optical fiber cable communications network is in a situation where the construction of a highway network is completed, but trunk roads [kansendoro] have yet to be constructed. This situation has resulted from the hesitance of telephone companies to expand their telephone service in areas where they cannot expect profits. The MOPT hopes that the financial assistance will inspire telephone companies to accelerate the expansion of their telephone service in those areas. The Japan Development Bank has thus far used proceeds from sales of government-held NTT stocks as financial resources to extend low-interest loans for the project of building the optical fiber cable communications network, but the network requires relay facilities and the low-interest loans have fallen short of meeting the financial requirement for construction of the optical fiber cable communications network.
