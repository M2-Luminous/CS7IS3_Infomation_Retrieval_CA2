All of them, in keeping with the law and the legal acts of the Depos [Democratic Movement of Serbia] coalition, have had their mandates as deputies wthdrawn, the main committee of the SPO has announced. Slobodan Rakitic, Strahinja Kastratovic, Radomir Urosevic, Pavle Premovic, Obren Joksimovic, Radenko Jokovic, Branislav Rakus, Vojislav Nedeljkovic, Zoran Cirkovic, Jovan Babic, and Jovan Tomic were expelled as members of the SPO. Of the 122 members of the main committee who attended the session, 111 voted for the expulsions, five opposed, and six abstained. In keeping with the law and legal acts of the Depos coalition, the main committee also elected 11 new SPO deputies to the Yugoslav Assembly. They will replace those who have been deputies hitherto and who had their mandates withdrawn by the party today. The new SPO federal deputies on the Depos coalition electoral list are: Dr. Gordana Anicic and Prof. Tomislav Jeremic (Belgrade electoral district), Dr. Danilo Beukovic and Engineer Pera Sijacki (Novi Sad electoral district), Dr. Dragoslav Isakovic and Dr. Dusan Vasic (Uzice electoral district), lawyer Nikola Koca Djordjevic and Prof. Milos Filipovic (Kragujevac electoral district), graduate engineer Dragoljub Janes (Nis electoral district), and lawyer Sreten Nesih (Leskovac electoral district). [only 10 names as received] The main committee rejected all the allegations contained in the letter of the 11 former federal deputies as untrue and designed only to undermine the electoral success of the SPO and Depos. The main committee assessed "the sad fact that the signatories sent their pamphlet-style letter, which was untrue and not based on the facts, to state television and not to the party authorities" as the most arrogant violation of the SPO program and statute. Everything was carried out in accordance with a scenario prepared in conjunction with the special political command of the ruling regime, which is tasked with smashing and shaming the democratic opposition, and especially the SPO and Depos as the most powerful opposition forces, the statement says.
