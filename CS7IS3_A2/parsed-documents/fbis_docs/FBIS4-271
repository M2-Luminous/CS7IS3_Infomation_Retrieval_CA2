FBIS4-271 "drafr067_c_94003" FBIS-AFR-94-067 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Mandela Says No Postponement of Elections Mandela Says No Postponement of Elections MB0604120094 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1133 GMT 6 Apr 94 MB0604120094 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Durban April 6 SAPA -- African National Congress President Nelson Mandela on Wednesday dismissed suggestions that the April elections may be postponed either in war ravaged Natal or nationally. "Let me tell you there will be no postponement of elections...either in the province of Natal or in any of the provinces," Mr Mandela told a youth conference at the University of Durban-Westville. "We will not postpone our freedom...we will not postpone our plans to build a better life for all South Africans," the ANC president said, scotching speculation the election may be delayed. This follows Tuesday's Independent Electoral Committee [IEC] report on the improbability of holding free and fair elections in politically charged Natal. Mr Mandela's remarks were met with wild applause and a standing ovation from hundreds of youths at the conference. Mr Mandela also called on people to give the recently declared state of emergency in natal a chance, saying: "people have questioned -- what is the use of this state of emergency if people continue to be killed? "One appreciates this concern, but it comes from people who have not analysed the situation very well," he said. Explaining his defence of the emergency, Mr Mandela said SA Defence Force [SADF] deployment was a "complicated process". "Stem your judgement until the SADF has brought all the forces required to this province," he added. South Africa had reached a "very critical stage" in its history, Mr Mandela said, referring to recent third force disclosures by the Goldstone Commission. "We've been saying all along the third force exists...we are reaching almost a breakthrough in this regard...we are finding out the people responsible for these massacres." Mr Mandela said present violence in the country was "frightening". He accused the national party government of being "corrupt ... where public funds have been given to black organisations to promote violence". Mr Mandela said the ANC had enjoyed a measure of success through the Transitional Executive Council because it had stopped the government from giving funds to Bophuthatswana. "There are others not very far from you here (kwaZulu) that are not going to get those funds for abuse ... and use to kill innocent people." Mr Mandela charged that the same "corrupt government is steeped in the use of dirty tricks to solve its problems", adding that the NP in some areas of the country was involved in the "dirtiest campaigns". But the NP, he said, was not to be feared in elections because it was a "mouse" and the ANc was an "elephant". Referring to recent opinion polls which said the NP and Democratic Party had made gains at the expense of the ANC, he said: "Even if a mouse eats very well it still remains a mouse and an elephant remains an elephant". Mr Mandela said complacency among ANC supporters was to be feared in the elections. Urging youths at Wednesday's conference, he said, "your task is to work very hard ... spreading the message of liberation". The ANC president criticised conference delegates for not ensuring an attendance that reflected the wider population, which was necessary to allay the fears of minorities during a transformation. "I hope at the end of this meeting you will be able to discuss ways and means of overcoming this challenge you don't appear to have stood up to," Mr Mandela said. "You must extend your hands at mass, temple, synagogue, and schools right across the land," he said to the crowd of youths, one of whom held aloft a poster declaring: "Mandela, we Zulus have faith in your leadership".
