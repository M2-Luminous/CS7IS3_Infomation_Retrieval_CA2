This was announced by a U.S. diplomatic source. The aid shows U.S. support for the Middle East peace process and represents an installment of the $500 million that the United States pledged to extend over five years to back the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, the source said. The source noted that the United States earlier provided 200 vehicles to the Palestinian authority. The source explained that the $5 million will be used to finance commodities and services in the first stage, such as raising salaries; moving police units into Gaza and Jericho; securing temporary lodging; and purchasing food, fuel, and clothing. The money cannot be used for military purposes, the source said. The source said the U.S. grant is part of the U.S. Administration's extraordinary efforts to support and facilitate the deployment of the Palestinian police force so that a secure and stable climate can be created for the continued implementation of the agreement on Palestinian self-rule in Jericho and Gaza as signed in Cairo on 4 May. Concluding the statement, the source said that the United States hopes its contribution will encourage the other donor states to speed up their vital support for peace in the region.
