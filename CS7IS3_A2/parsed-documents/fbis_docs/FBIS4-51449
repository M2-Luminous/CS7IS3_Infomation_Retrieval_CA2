Participating in today's informal group discussions were 49 Hong Kong affairs advisers and 13 new PWC members. The participants expressed their individual views and put forward many constructive ideas and suggestions on Hong Kong's monetary policy, inflation, housing prices, public servants' continued employment after 1997, and youngsters' education; on how Hong Kong's major capital construction could be coordinated and brought into line with that of the mainland; and on other issues touching upon a wide variety of fields such as politics, economics, culture, education, law, and social order. Lu Ping and Zhou Nan spoke separately at the informal discussion. Lu Ping said: Although Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's 1994 and 1995 elections broke down due to the lack of sincerity by the British side, the Chinese Government still hopes to continue maintaining cooperation with Britain in other fields. However, whether or not the two sides can cooperate will mainly hinge on Britain's attitude. He said: On the one hand, we hope for cooperation with Britain; on the other, we should not cherish too many illusions concerning Britain. We should build our work on our own foundation, truly realize participation by the Hong Kong people, and properly carry out various preparatory work during the final transitional period to bring about a smooth transition in 1997. We are now three years away from 1 July 1997, and we still need to carry out a much work of various types. I hope that all PWC members and Hong Kong affairs advisers will actively throw themselves into preparatory work for the HKSAR. He said: Hong Kong has many qualified personnel in various fields; we believe that Hong Kong certainly will be able to enjoy continued prosperity and stability under the future HKSAR government staffed by patriotic Hong Kong people. Zhou Nan said: All of you have put forward so many constructive ideas; this reflects the great sense of responsibility among Hong Kong affairs advisers and PWC members. Zhou Nan said: It is extremely important for the Hong Kong people to take part in local affairs during the transitional period. I hope that Hong Kong affairs advisers and PWC members will always put forward ideas and suggestions to make contributions to Hong Kong's smooth transition and long-term prosperity and stability. Chen Ziying and Wang Fengchao, State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office deputy directors; as well as Qin Wenjun, XINHUA Hong Kong branch deputy director, also participated in this morning's informal discussion.
