Our party has led well the implementation of the resolutions of the seventh party congress, the Central Committee, and the Midterm Party National Conference [MPNC]. Our party has also been consistent in the renovation undertaking by setting up many domestic and external relations policies which were in good accordance with the development rules, popular aspirations, and the trends of our time. Our people at home and friends around the world have strongly supported these policies. We have responded in a timely fashion to all circumstances, maintained political stability, firmly consolidated national defense, pushed socioeconomic development forward, expanded democracy, diversified external relations, and step by step nullified the blockade and embargo against us. These achievements are the results of the strong political acumen of our party, army and people. They also strongly proved that our people are attached as flesh and blood with the party, and are absolutely confident that with its efforts in self-reform and self- rectification, the party is still trustworthy as a true revolutionary party: the party that can motivate unity, solidarity, intelligence, and the strength of people, and the party that always cares for the people's standard of living and the people's government, which is truly a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. It is obvious that the achievements of the past few years are closely related to the construction effort and rectification work of the party, in which contributions by the cadres in charge of party control must be highly appreciated. The comrade general secretary also stressed that the aim of party control work is to ensure that party lines and policies be implemented correctly and innovatively to bring successes to the revolution and benefits for the people. The party cadres should always strive to achieve what is beneficial and avoid what is harmful to the people. These are the basic principles of party control work. Only through control work will we know whether the party resolutions are implemented and whether they are implemented well, and we would also know strong aspects of our lines and policies so that we can further develop them, as well as the weaknesses so that we can adjust and improve in time. Being a ruling party where party cadres are entrusted by the people with various positions in state agencies at different echelons, all cadres should use this privileged environment to develop their ability to serve the people. This privileged environment can also turn easily into a source of corruption and authoritativeness. On one hand, we should strive to educate party cadres to improve and perfect themselves so that they will always follow the just and correct objectives. On the other hand, we have to carry out regular party control work in order to encourage good deeds and prevent bad ones, and also to punish offenders on a correct and timely basis. Control work will help us screen out of the party the corrupt members and select the loyal and enthusiastic ones, those with character and talents who can assume the responsibility of making the party and its cadres worthy of the people's trust. In the situation where the market economy is being implemented and external relations expanded, there would be complicated issues in parallel with favorable conditions. These issues require us to respond actively and positively, especially in preventing the degradations; corrosion of confidence in the revolutionary ideals; corruption; smuggling; bribery; indications of depravation, degeneration, and decadence; all acts of authoritativeness, bossiness, bureaucratism, and coercion; and all opportunistic activities aiming at seizing authority, houses and land, assets, and other properties of the state and the people. These are the basic and urgent duties and contents of tasks for control cadres in the new situation. The party control work aims to develop strength and overcome weakness, making the party more steadfast. In party control work, the cadres need to highlight right and wrong in all targeted activities, so that all loyal and active party cadres will be protected and trusted, with wrong-doers and opportunists punished according to the magnitude of their deeds. All party members should be guaranteed equal treatment from party discipline. The objects of the party control work include organs and member cadres, especially key cadres at all levels. These are the two subjects that must be given equal importance. We must conduct comprehensive control and pay special attention to the implementation of the party line, policy, and regulations as outlined in the MPNC resolution. That is the most comprehensive content of control work. We need to pay attention to the control of members and organs in their observation of the Constitution and the state law. This is the goal that must not be taken lightly in control work. Control work requires every cadre to not avoid and protect individuals and organizations that have violated party discipline, the Constitution, and state law. At the same time, in the current situation, we must clearly protect justice and righteousness by not allowing anyone to take advantage of the control work to disrupt party organizations and tarnish the cadres and members. Our party welcomes and encourages everyone, including non-members, to criticize party organizations and individual members as long as their opinions are honest, constructive, and responsible. That is our party's philosophy, which relies on public opinion and is also an example of our people's civilized attitude in human relations. Control work is not only the work of the control committee but also the task of the entire party, beginning with the committees at all levels. We have to admit that the committees have not been the first to discover troubled incidents in the past few years, including problems among themselves. They only find out problems through party members and the general public. That is the thing that we must resolutely overcome in the coming period. Making the party clean and strong must be the task of the entire party, cadres, and members, beginning with the committees. The important thing is to make the committees themselves clean and strong to set good examples for their cadres and members. In order to achieve that, the entire party, beginning with the committees, the control committees at all levels, and the control cadres, must improve their sense of logic, enhance their knowledge of the actual situation, thoroughly understand the party line and conception, and follow our predecessors' good examples to train ourselves for better political and professional knowledge and working ability to actively contribute to party reform and consolidation, making the party cleaner and stronger. Party control work requires us to heighten our responsibility to the party and the public and to demonstrate our party's spirit of clearness and and straightforwardness, as our Uncle Ho used to say: casualness and carelessness in party control work will cause great damage to the political life of a party member, but leaving his problem untouched will not only damage that party member but also create more problems for the entire organization. Control work must be combined with organization work for the correct and speedy evaluation of cadres and members. Many incidents left untouched for too long in the party are the result of poor coordination between control work and cadre organization work at all levels. The comrade general secretary concluded that the last target that the control work needs to achieve is to make the party organization and contingent of cadres and members cleaner and stronger. The control work must ensure that after the completion of the work, the party organization will become stronger and the contingent of members become more united and mature, not the other way around. The control work and the contingent of the control cadres are enjoying a great honor in contributing their great share in the successful implementation of the political duties set forth by the party. They must satisfactorily serve the party building work and actively contribute to the preparation of the eighth national congress and party congresses at all levels in the coming years. Satisfactorily carrying out the control work is also executing Uncle Ho's philosophy of building our party into an exemplary political organization representing the intelligence, morality, conscience, and honor of the entire nation, deserving a leader and a very loyal servant of the people, as Uncle Ho used to remind us.
