FBIS4-23391 "drafr108_e_94007" FBIS-AFR-94-108 Daily Report 4 Jun 1994 WEST AFRICA Nigeria More Opposition Members Arrested More Opposition Members Arrested AB0406200094 Paris AFP in French 1022 GMT 4 Jun 94 AB0406200094 Paris AFP French BFN [Text] Senator Bola Tinubu told AFP this morning that the government has arrested more opposition figures, among whom was Chief Olusegun Osoba, the former civilian governor of Ogun State in the Southwest of Nigeria. Several other persons were arrested in the eastern and southwestern parts of the country and "we are currently trying to discover their names and numbers," he added. Senator Bola Tinubu is one of the founding members of the opposition National Democratic Coalition, Nadeco, which called on Nigerians to take their destiny into their own hands by restoring democracy to the country. Senate Chairman Ameh Ebute was arrested on 2 June by security forces, following similar calls. Senator Tinubu took part in a Senate meeting after which its president published a communique calling for the formation of a government of national unity and reconciliation, led by the "president-elect" Moshood Abiola, the self-proclaimed winner of the 12 June 1993 presidential election, which was canceled by the military. Yesterday, members from the dissolved House of Representatives also published a communique, which called for Nigerian Head of State General Sani Abacha to relinquish power "at the latest by 11 June," in order to enable the winner of the 12 June 1993 elections to form a "broad-based" national government on the first anniversary of that election. General Oladipo Diya, the reegime's number two man, yesterday stated that the Senate president's call was "illegal," and constituted a "violation of the law." "What responsible government would sit with its arms folded in the face of individuals flouting the laws with impunity? (...) To do so would be tantamount to encouraging chaos," the press quoted Gen. Diya as saying. According to the pro-government DAILY TIMES, Ameh Ebute is expected to be arraigned before a court on 6 June, and could be charged with treason. Moshood Abiola also claimed to have learned with "shock" the arrest of the Senate president. The billionaire Yoruba Muslim, whose statement was reported by the press, said: "To arrest the country's legitimate, elected representatives, simply because they called for respecting the people's aspirations for (democracy) is a criminal act." Mr. Abiola added: "The (ruling) junta, which continues to subjugate our people and denigrate the expression of their sovereign will through diversions, cannot escape the imminent judgment of history." A former head of state, General Olusegun Obasanjo, (1976-1979), who is widely respected in Nigeria, said he had known Abiola "since being in school with him, and I am not in favor of his taking power. I do not think Abiola is the Messiah we are expecting," declared Gen. Obasanjo, whose statement was reported by the press.
