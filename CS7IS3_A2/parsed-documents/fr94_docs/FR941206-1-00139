FR941206-1-00139 FR941206-1-00015 Section 191.1(a) would be amended to conform to the current statute. In 1976, the FAA promulgated part 191 to implement the Air Transportation Act of 1974, Pub. L. 93&hyph;366. Section 316(d)(2) of the FAAct provides, in part, that the Administrator shall prescribe regulations to ``prohibit disclosure of any information obtained or developed in the conduct of research and development activities'' if the disclosure meets certain conditions. This section is a major basis for the current rules in part 191 on withholding information from unauthorized disclosure. In 1990, section 316(d)(2) was amended to provide that the Administrator shall adopt rules to prohibit disclosure of ``any information obtained in the conduct of security or research and development activities *␣*␣*.'' Section 9121 of the Aviation Safety and Capacity Expansion Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;508) (emphasis added). The FAA proposes to amend §191.1(a), to protect information obtained during the course of specified security activities. The FAA also proposes to remove from the title of part 191 reference to the 1974 Act, to avoid any implication that it is the only source of statutory authority for the part. Section 191.1(b) now defines ``record,'' in part, as ``documentary'' material. The FAA proposes to delete the word ``documentary.'' The FAA intends to address all methods of preserving information, including computer records. This would avoid any misunderstanding over whether such records were ``documentary.'' Part 191 now refers to the ``Director of Civil Aviation Security'' as the official who makes the determination on behalf of the Administrator to withhold information. Following a reorganization, the FAA official who makes such determinations now is the Assistant Administrator for Civil Aviation Security. The FAA proposes to amend part 191 accordingly. In addition, the Deputy Assistant Administrator for Civil Aviation Security, and any individual formally designated to act in the capacity of the Assistant Administrator or the Deputy, would have authority to make such determinations. We also propose to state in more detail the extent to which the Assistant Administrator may further delegate the authority to make these decisions. For decisions involving information and records described in §191.7(a) through (i), we propose to permit delegation below the Assistant Administrator level. The information that is described in (a) through (i) is well-defined, and decisions on release or withholding of the information involves relatively objective judgments. Section 191.7(j) provides a ``catch all'' basis for determining that other information is sensitive security information. A decision to release or withhold information under §191.7(j) requires a careful evaluation of, on the one hand, the need to provide the highest level of security to the traveling public by preventing sensitive security information from falling into the wrong hands, and on the other hand, an awareness of the public's strong interest in obtaining information about security in air transportation. These decisions require a careful evaluation of security threats as well as important policies of the agency. Therefore, the FAA proposes that such decisions be made by high policy-level officials, and not below the Assistant Administrator and Deputy Assistant Administrator level. The Assistant Administrator is responsible for carrying out the agency's civil aviation security program, and reports directly to the Administrator. §191.3 . Section 191.3 would continue to state generally that the FAA withholds certain information, but would be clarified to state that part 191 applies, notwithstanding FOIA and other disclosure statutes. For instance, the FAA may adopt certain security rules affecting air carriers and airports without disclosing the rules to unauthorized persons. The FAA proposes to move the provisions currently in §191.5 that describe the circumstances under which the FAA prohibits disclosure of information to §191.3(b). §191.5 . Section 191.5 would contain the requirements that apply to persons other than the FAA. Such persons include air carriers, airport operators, indirect air carriers, and foreign air carriers, and individuals employed by, or contracted by, air carriers, airport operators, indirect air carriers, and foreign air carriers. This section is intended to be very inclusive.
