In the last few years alone, many literary and art works have been created, among them the multi-part feature film "The Nation and Destiny" (part 1 to 18), the revolutionary drama "Under the Banner of Victory" and the long novel "Victory". The literature and art of Korea that greeted a great heyday in the mid-70s under the wise guidance of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is now in full bloom with further development. Comrade Kim Chong-il founded a unique theory on the chuche-oriented literature and art that is centred on man, and established a new creative system to bring an overall renovation in literature and art and has reared a large army of talented men of literature and art. He gave answers to all the theoretical and practical questions arising in the creative work such as making a good choice of seed and conducting a speed campaign in creative activities, making a comprehensive and profound study of life and reflecting it truthfully and retaining the national style in works through the combination of ideology and art and has successfully brought into full bloom the literature and art with untiring energetic guidances. All realms of literature and art -- movie, opera, music, drama, dance, fine art and circus -- have reached a high plane today. In this course, a host of literary and art works have been created, representing the glorious and brilliant history of revolutionary activities, sagacity of leadership and noble virtues of the great leader President Kim Il-song, and new "phibada"-style revolutionary operas in which stanzaic songs, pangchang(off-stage songs), folk dances and stage decor are organically interlinked and new "songhwangdang"- style revolutionary dramas. Works on the themes of revolutionary traditions and socialist realities were created in great numbers, including the feature film "To the End of the World" and "The Trace of Life", the long and medium-length novels "On the Road of Loyalty" and "The Land of Flowers", the music and dance epic "Song of Glory" performed by 5,000 artistes and the music and dance story "The Song of Paradise". Many famous songs and elegant dance works such as "Song of Comradeship", "We Will Go Along One Road Forever" and "Azalea of the Homeland" were created, national musical instruments were improved and a new orchestra based on the combination of Western and national music instruments was created, lifting the chuche art to a higher stage. Recent years witnessed the creation of unique Korean-style electronic music which can represent not only the Korean folk songs and modern songs but foreign folk songs and traditional mass songs of other countries as well. In the meantime, monumental works of art such as the "Mansudae Grand Monument" and the "Samjiyon Grand Monument" have been created and various genres of works of art including paintings, mainly Korean paintings, crafts and embroideries have been produced. Acrobatic art and literature and art of amateurs have also made a rapid progress.
