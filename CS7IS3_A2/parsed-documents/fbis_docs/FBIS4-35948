'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri said southern leaders had "not yet decided" whether to ask for Saudi intervention in the month-long war, but added "everything is possible and legitimate to protect our people". He spoke as northern troops loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih edged closer to the south's bastion of Aden, capital of the self-declared Yemen Democratic Republic. Al-Jifri was commenting on reports of reinforcements to the Saudi military presence on its border with the former South Yemen, which united with North Yemen four years ago. He said the reinforcements were not a Saudi intervention but "a precaution that any state would take in the event of war in its neighbouring state." Al-Jifri said: "I am sure that Saudi Arabia would not intervene unless it was asked to by somebody," adding such a request would be "internationally legitimate." Southern forces loyal to the president's rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid, who declared the breakaway republic on May 21, have accepted UN Security Council Resolution 924 calling for an immediate ceasefire in the civil war. Northern forces, now within 15 kilometers (nine miles) of Aden, have also said they are prepared to accept the UN resolution. Saudi Arabia, which initiated the UN resolution along with other Gulf states, has denied northern charges that it is siding with the south in the war. Saudi's King Fahd has urged north and south Yemen to implement the UN Security Council's call for a ceasefire. "If the north and the south accept UN Security Council Resolution 924, it will be a good initiative and one that should lead to a definitive halt to the fighting," he said in an interview broadcast late Friday on the London-based Arabic television station MBC.
