FR940617-2-00060 FR940617-2-00038 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Savannah River Operations Office (SR); Financial Assistance Award, Intent To Award a Noncompetitive Grant AGENCY: Savannah River Operations, Office, DOE. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The DOE announces that it plans to accept an unsolicited proposal and award a grant to Benedict College, Harden and Blanding Streets, Columbia, South Carolina. The grant, ``Mathematics and Science Enrichment Program,'' will be awarded for a three-year period at a DOE funding level of $648,000. Funds of $200,000 will be awarded for the first budget period, and subject to the availability of funds, the remainder will be awarded for the second and third budget period. Pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b) and 600.14, eligibility for this award has been limited to Benedict College as a result of acceptance of their unsolicited proposal, and DOE has determined that award of a grant is appropriate. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Beth O'Rear, Prime Contracts and Financial Assistance Branch, U.S. Department of Energy, Savannah River Operations Office, P.O. Box A, Aiken, SC 29802, Telephone: (803) 725&hyph;1345. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Procurement Request Number 09&hyph;94SR18432.000. Project Scope The objective of this program is to identify, motivate, and begin preparation of students for science-based careers. The proposed program will offer a year-round science and mathematics enrichment program for 75 youths in grades 4 through 9. The participants in this program will be among those underrepresented in science-based careers (minorities and females). This program will provide to participants assistance in acquiring basic communication, computation and reasoning skills, as well as exposure to a variety of science-based careers through field trips and the use of role models. Benedict College is a Historically Black College or University (HBCU) and falls within the meaning and intent of Executive Orders 12320, 12677 and 12876 pertaining to Government assistance to HBCUs. The participation of HBCUs in federally supported programs is relatively limited. In order to overcome some of these limitations, the Executive Orders directed federal agencies to increase the participation of HBCUs in federally-funded programs and to strengthen their capabilities to provide quality education. This award represents an effort to strengthen the HBCU community. The program proposed in the application is considered meritorious, and the activities to be carried out under this award would not be eligible for financial assistance under any recent, current, or planned solicitation. Based on documentation presented and appropriate evaluation, it is determined to be in the best interest of DOE to award a grant to Benedict College. Issued in Aiken, South Carolina, on June 6, 1994.
