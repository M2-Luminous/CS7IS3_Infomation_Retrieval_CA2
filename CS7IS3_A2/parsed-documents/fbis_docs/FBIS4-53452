(NTT) and other enterprises concerned, industry sources said. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata ordered the freeze and the government will ask local authorities to follow suit, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said. NTT, which plans to raise basic telephone charges by an average 18 percent, said the company will follow decisions by public hearings and an advisory panel at the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry. Company officials, however, said they were upset by the government's decision, which will have an impact on the company's business performance. The nonlife insurance industry also said it was surprised by the decision. Takashi Onoda, head of the Marine and Fire Insurance Association of Japan, told reporters the industry was considerably upset by it. The decision came as nonlife insurers applied to the Finance Ministry for approval of their plans to raise fire insurance rates, effective July 1. Major nonlife insurance companies said they did not know immediately what impact the decision would have on their business. Kohei Abe, president of the Federation of Electric Power Companies, said member companies will decide whether to revise utility charges at their own discretion. The power companies will keep lower rates until September to return foreign exchange gains to consumers.
