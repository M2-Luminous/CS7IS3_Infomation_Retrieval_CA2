FR940412-1-00064 FR940412-1-00011 NHTSA is also proposing to prohibit tandem control by an antilock system, by requiring that no more than two wheels be controlled by one modulator valve. As part of its performance test program, the agency tested four different ABS configurations: individual wheel control, side-by-side control, axle-by-axle control, and tandem control. The agency found that the tandem control system produced stopping distances that were significantly longer than those of axle-by-axle control or side-by-side control, particularly on split coefficient of friction surfaces. These test results are documented in the report, ``Improved Brake Systems for Commercial Vehicles.'' The agency is aware that the proposed requirements would allow a 6 x 4 truck or truck tractor to be equipped with a 4S/3M antilock system, i.e., independent control of each front wheel, select low control on one rear axle, and no ABS control on the other rear axle. The agency's testing has found that vehicle stability is not significantly degraded if two wheels on a tandem are locked during braking. Accordingly, the agency has used this concept in developing the limited lockup requirements for the stopping distance rulemaking where one wheel per axle or two wheels per tandem are allowed to lock above 20 mph during the stopping distance test. The agency requests comments to the following questions about independent control of each wheel on at least one axle and about prohibiting tandem control by an antilock system: 1. Is it appropriate to require independent control of each wheel on at least one axle? 2. Would it be appropriate to adopt the alternative recommendations presented by Rockwell, Freightliner, or Advocates? Would these alternative recommendations provide significantly greater benefits? Would they prevent unreasonably long stopping distances on split mu surfaces? 3. Compared to the original proposal that would allow select low systems, what would be the additional marginal benefits and cost of the requirement proposed in this SNPRM? Of the requirements recommended by Rockwell, Freightliner, or Advocates? 4. Is it appropriate to prohibit tandem control by an antilock system? 5. How much stability degradation has testing showed with a vehicle where one axle of a tandem was not controlled by ABS? Are there other concerns (e.g., tire flat spotting) about an uncontrolled axle on a tandem? 6. Would fleet operators be willing to spend an additional $300 per vehicle to upgrade a 4S/3M system to a 4S/4M system with side-by-side control or axle-by-axle control with in-axle sensors? Comments on this notice must be received no later than 30 days after its publication in the Federal Register . While NHTSA typically provides a comment period of 60 days, the agency has determined that it is in the public interest to limit the comment period to 30 days since the agency is statutorily required to finish rulemaking in mid-1994. In addition, the agency previously provided an opportunity in the September 1993 NPRM to comment on these and other issues in this rulemaking. This notice proposes relatively limited modifications in the agency's tentative position regarding two of those issues. Rulemaking Analyses A. Executive Order 12866 (Federal Regulation) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures This notice is ``significant'' within the meaning of Executive Order 12866. Further, NHTSA has analyzed this supplemental proposal and determined that it is also significant within the meaning of the Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures. The agency believes that the proposal to make the lateral stability and control requirements concurrent with the stopping distance requirements would reduce the rulemaking's costs, based on comments by the manufacturers. The agency further believes that the proposal related to wheel control would reduce cost. The agency's expectations upon issuing the NPRM were that the ABS on trucks, truck tractors, and buses would provide individual wheel control on at least one axle. As such, the safety benefits and cost analyses documented in the Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis were performed assuming that to be the case. Therefore, the agency believes that no additional impact would result from the changes proposed in this notice. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act NHTSA has also considered the effects of this rulemaking action under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Based upon the discussion in the immediately preceding paragraph, I certify that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. C. Executive Order 12612 (Federalism) NHTSA has analyzed this rulemaking action in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612. NHTSA has determined that the proposed rule would not have sufficient Federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. D. National Environmental Policy Act In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, NHTSA has considered the environmental impacts of this proposed rule. The agency has determined that this proposed rule, if adopted as a final rule, would not have any adverse impact on the quality of the human environment. VII. Comments
