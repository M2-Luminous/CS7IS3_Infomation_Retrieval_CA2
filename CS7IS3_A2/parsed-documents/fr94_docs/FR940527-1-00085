FR940527-1-00085 FR940527-1-00014 B. Specific Adjustment for Taxes to the Capital Prospective Payment System Federal Rate (ยง412.312) In the August 30, 1991 final rule implementing the capital prospective payment system, we acknowledged the need to study whether special treatment of the property tax component of capital-related costs is appropriate (56 FR 43364&hyph;43365). Subsequently, comments received on the May 26, 1993 proposed rule asked that we revisit this issue in a timely manner to eliminate any inequitable payment distributions. One of the commenters also suggested a specific methodology to adjust the capital Federal rate using a capital prospective payment system base-year survey to develop a hospital-specific adjustment to the capital Federal rate payment. The Medicare cost report has recently been revised to obtain tax data directly from each hospital for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1991 (FY 1992). These data are just now becoming available to us. Our preliminary review indicates a need for additional information and analysis. The FY 1992 cost report data currently available show that with slightly less than 90 percent of all prospective payment system hospitals in the data base (only 60 percent of which reflect audited data), only 77 percent of the proprietary hospitals reported property tax payments. This leaves a significant number of proprietary hospitals for which no tax data have been reported. In addition, approximately 13 percent of the non-proprietary hospitals are reporting some form of payments ``in lieu of taxes.'' The nature of the payments ``in lieu of taxes'' is not yet entirely clear. Given the limitations of the available data, we believe that it would be premature to develop a proposal for a property tax adjustment. We do not believe that we should proceed with development and implementation of a property tax adjustment until we have determined the status of the reported payments in lieu of taxes and whether an adjustment would be appropriate for these expenses. We also need to determine why a significant number of proprietary hospitals have reported no tax payments and what effect this might have on a budget neutrality adjustment to the Federal rate if a property tax adjustment were adopted. We have therefore asked our regional offices to develop information on a sample of hospitals from each group in order to refine and complete our analysis. We invite submission of relevant information and data by interested parties and the public during the comment period to this proposed rule. Furthermore, although we appreciate the concern that this issue addresses, we believe that at this point the possible adverse effects of our current policy are minimal. Capital costs represent less than 10 percent of total costs and a proprietary hospital's average tax cost burden for assessed property represents only 7 to 9 percent of its total capital-related costs. The tax burden for proprietary hospitals thus amounts to less than 1 percent of total costs. In addition, for the first 5 years of the capital prospective payment system transition period, the majority of payments to most hospitals are based on each hospital's own cost experience. Therefore, we do not believe delaying a specific adjustment to proprietary hospitals until more data are available would cause undue hardship to the affected hospitals. In the interim, we hope to advance the discussion of this issue by raising the issue of whether a property tax adjustment would be appropriate and by presenting one approach to such an adjustment. We welcome comments and recommendations on every aspect of this presentation. One approach to a methodology for a property tax adjustment for proprietary hospitals is to develop a property tax factor (PTF) from data on hospital-specific tax payments in the most recently audited cost reporting year.
