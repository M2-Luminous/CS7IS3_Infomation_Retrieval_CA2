Sit-down strikes by taxi drivers could be seen this morning (local) in different parts of the capital, while the police carried out strict surveillance. Part of the population had to walk long distances to get to work due to the lack of buses. It is estimated that 60 percent of the urban transportation system of Managua is supporting the strike. Two hundred twenty buses of the "Parrales Vallejos" cooperative, the strongest in Managua are parked at stations and along some streets. Managua's transportation system moves approximately 500,000 persons daily. The CNT announced that the pressures for attaining a freeze on the price of oil derivatives will increase depending on how negotiations with the government, which will begin in the next few hours, progress. President Violeta Chamorro said she expected there would be no violent actions and proposed a meeting with the five groups that are made up of transportation businessmen. Meanwhile, it was learned that the government is trying to get Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo to mediate the negotiations. The CNT proposed a bilateral meeting with the finance, transportation, and labor ministers, who signed accords last September and whom the transporters believe are responsible for the unfulfilled agreements. Carlos Palma, leader of the strike, said violent outbreaks will be avoided by keeping the buses at the stations. Regarding the new strike, Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, who will travel today to the Vatican, said he hopes the uprising that left several dead and hundreds wounded and jailed last year will not be repeated. Daniel Ortega, former president and secretary general of the opposition Sandinist National Liberation Front said the government has forced transportation businessmen to strike. Ortega and Obando agree on the need for a negotiated solution to the social-political conflict.
