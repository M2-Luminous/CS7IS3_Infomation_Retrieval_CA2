FR941006-1-00003 FR941006-1-00001 Because this proposed rule would provide an alternative, the economic impact to horse owners would be minimal. The horse owners that would be affected by this rule change are those that have horses which test positive for EIA and voluntarily choose to transport their horses interstate to slaughter under an official seal. APHIS estimates that, annually, between 500 and 1,000 horse operations have horses that become infected with EIA. Although it is not known how many of these operations are ``small'' entities (less than $0.5 million in annual sales, according to Small Business Administration size criteria), it is likely that most are in that category. Current estimates put the number of horses in the United States between 6 and 10 million. In 1993, about 1 million horses were tested for EIA. Of these, 1,859 (about 0.18 percent) tested positive for EIA. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Paperwork Reduction Act In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the information collection or recordkeeping requirements included in this proposed rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under OMB control number 0579&hyph;0051.
