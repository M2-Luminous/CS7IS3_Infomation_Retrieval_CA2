India and Uzbekistan today expressed their resolve to counter religious fundamentalism, extremism and terrorism and signed six agreements, including one on comprehensive economic co-operation aimed at strengthening bilateral relations. An Indian bank and cultural centre alongwith an Indian Chair in an educational institution will start functioning in Uzbekistan shortly, while arrangements were also being made to telecast Doordarshan programmes in this Central Asian republic. The agreements signed at the conclusion of the Uzbek President's visit also covered postal, telegraph and related matters, telecommunications, setting up an Indo-Uzbek centre for Science and technology, transport and transit. Addressing a joint news conference after signing the agreements, the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, and the Uzbekistan President, Mr Islam Karimov, said that there was tremendous scope to increase bilateral trade and participate in joint ventures to boost economic co-operation between the two countries. Both the leaders stressed on building sounder relations and reviving the historical relationship that has existed between the two countries. In reply to a question on the Kashmir issue, Mr Karimov said that his country believed in the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other states and favoured settlement of problems through negotiations. "We intend to strictly follow this policy at all international forums," he added. In his opening statement Mr Rao said that during his talks with Mr Karimov he had explained India's determination to face cross-border terrorism so that people in their countries could live in peace and devote their energies to promoting their well being. In reply to a question how Uzbekistan was coping with the growth of religious fundamentalism, Mr Karimov said the people and government of his country had been strongly resisting this threat from Tajikistan. "Had it not been so I would not have been sitting here today," Mr Karimov remarked. He invited Indian businessmen to visit his country and set up joint ventures. Mr Karimov pointed out that of the 960 joint ventures currently underway in his country a mere 14 were with India of which only six were operational. "This is insufficient for a great country like India," he said while revealing statistics on Uzbekistan's rich mineral resources including gold, natural gas and strategic minerals like uranium. Mr Karimov said that his country attached great importance to the experiences of India as a successful secular democracy. "India has been going along the democratic road for development while being able to simultaneously preserve its national culture and historic traditions. We are presently in a transition period and are in the midst of transforming from a totalitarian state to a free market economy. Our stress will be on attaining self-reliance and preservation of our traditions and ethnic identity. But we hope to learn from the experiences of other countries who have passed through a similar phase," he pointed out.
