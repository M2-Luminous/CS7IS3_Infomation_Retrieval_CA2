The fears are not without reason. The issue is in the first place the unprecedented preparations for the merger of the money systems of Russia and Belarus, which KOMMERSANT-DAILY reported 12 January. Meanwhile, Andrey Kozyrev has also joined in the Russian Government fray over economic integration. In his message to the president the Russian Foreign Ministry chief argues against both Russia's "isolationism" in economic relations with the former USSR republics, and the stepped-up resuscitation of the ruble zone. The general balance of forces within the government, however, is unfavorable for the ruble so far. Uncertainty and political infighting in the top echelons of the Russian executive branch have prompted candidates for the leading roles in the cabinet to issue statements that go beyond the scope of their current powers. In his address to the president, Andrey Kozyrev supports integration within the CIS in principle. He believes that Russia can overcome the economic crisis only jointly with the other former USSR republics. On the other hand, Andrey Kozyrev's statement contains a provision saying that the formation of the CIS economic union is running too far ahead. The union is being hastily equipped with documents describing the final stage of economic integration. In other words, the Foreign Ministry chief is diplomatically objecting to the stepped-up creation of a currency union, especially in the form of a ruble zone. The foreign minister's statement can also be interpreted as follows: While wishing to stay on in the government, Andrey Kozyrev is distancing himself in advance from its fairly likely decisions in favor of the ruble zone's comeback, which may undermine the prospects for Russia's financial convalescence. On the whole, the balance of forces in the government with regard to resuscitating the ruble zone does not appear to be favoring the ruble. If Boris Fedorov follows Yegor Gaydar's suit in compliance with decisions by "Russia's Choice" ruling bodies, there will be no radical market advocates opposing the ruble zone's revival left in the government. Given that regarding this subject the Central Bank sticks to a view that priority should be given to restoring interrepublican economic ties, not to propping up the ruble, then 1994 may mark a return to a situation of two years ago in terms of Russia's subsidizing former Union republics. Meanwhile, according to available estimates, a total of 8 percent of Russian GDP was siphoned off into the republics in 1992, and 25 percent of Russia's price growth was caused by the inflationary dumping of rubles into Russia from the CIS countries. The year 1993 saw only the beginning in switching economic and especially credit and financial relations to market principles (by using the indexation of Russian Government credits through the current exchange rate of the dollar, setting interest rates on the basis of LIBOR [London Interbank Offered Rate], and making insurance currency deposits). Nonetheless, Russia gave its CIS partners credits to the tune of 5.2 trillion rubles in settling trade accounts.

Aleksandr Shokhin signed the 28 December Russian-Belarusian protocol on the readiness to merge the two countries' money systems. He sees the draft agreement prepared by the Central Banks of Russia and Belarus "On the Mechanism of Operation of Belarus' Money System Upon Merging it With That of Russia" as acceptable. Vladimir Mashits holds a wait-and-see stance. He favors a stepped-up creation of a multi-currency payment union of CIS countries, but he does not object to the ruble zone, either.
