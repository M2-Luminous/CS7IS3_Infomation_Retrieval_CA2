FR940921-0-00009 FR940921-0-00005 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;AWP&hyph;16] Establishment of Class E Airspace; Inyokern Municipal Airport, Inyokern, CA AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action establishes Class E airspace at Inyokern, CA. A Global Positioning System (GPS) standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) has been developed for the Inyokern Municipal Airport. Controlled airspace extending from 700 feet above the surface is needed for aircraft executing the approach. This action will provide adequate Class E airspace for instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at Inyokern Municipal Airport. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 UTC, December 8, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Scott Speer, System Management Branch, AWP&hyph;530, Air Traffic Division, Western-Pacific Region, Federal Aviation Administration, 15000 Aviation Boulevard, Lawndale, California, 90261, telephone (310) 297&hyph;0697. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On June 24, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class E airspace at Inyokern, CA. (59 FR 32669). A Global Positioning System (GPS) standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) has been developed for the Inyokern Municipal Airport. Controlled airspace extending from 700 feet above the surface is needed for aircraft executing the approach. Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. One comment was received. China Lake Naval Air Weapons Station requested the exclusion of Class E airspace from Restricted Area R&hyph;2505. The Restricted Area was excluded in response to their request. The coordinates in the proposal are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in this Order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class E airspace at Inyokern, CA, to establish controlled airspace from 700 feet above the surface for aircraft executing the GPS SIAP into the Inyokern Municipal Airport at Inyokern, CA. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
