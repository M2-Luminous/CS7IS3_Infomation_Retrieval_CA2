The address emphasizes that today "a society is being built where money and only money is the law, arbitrariness substitutes for legality, and lies--for morality... In doing this, the champions of the bright capitalist future never bothered to ask ordinary people whether they want this kind of life." The Labor Party's Provisional Executive Committee believes that the "political and social rights of the people can be defended only by combining efforts."
