The spy suspect was identified only as Yi Pok-hon, age 32. An NSP official said on Thursday Yi fled the country in April 1990 soon after he was placed on a wanted list on swindle charges. Later in September 1991 he joined the "Asia Sharon," a criminal organization, based in Dacca, Bangladesh, and worked for North Korea while at the criminal ring, the official said. Yi is suspected of having entered North Korea six times from April 1992 through November 1993 to receive espionage training and instructions. The official said he was first picked up by North Korea in April 1992 when he called at the Pyongyang Embassy in Bangkok to solicit its help in giving shooting training to "Asia Sharon" gangsters. The instructions he received from North Korea were to assassinate anti-Pyongyang Koreans abroad and win over bosses of organized criminal rings in South Korea. The NSP official said Yi gave 1.5 million dollars to North Korea for giving military training to "Asia Sharon" members and also supplied some espionage items such as forged passports, visa cards and traveler's checks to Pyongyang. He is further alleged to have arranged a contract for the sale of 500 million dollars' worth of North Korean weapons to a guerrila organization in a Southeast Asian country. Yi was arrested by public security authorities of China on last March 8, deported to Korea and was carried away by the NSP on arrival at Kimpo Airport.
