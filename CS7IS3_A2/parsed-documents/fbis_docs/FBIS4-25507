An official of the British Ministry of Trade and Industry said in Hong Kong: Many British toy importers have suffered losses since the EU ministerial meeting in last February decided to impose import quotas on China's toy products, and some of them have come close to bankruptcy. Similar situations also have arisen in other European countries. The "European Toy Manufacturers' Association" pointed out: The EU quota imposed on toys from China already has limited the amount of this kind of imports to 1.8 billion ECUs this year, which is merely half of the originally expected import volume. This will drive at least 500 people in the European region out of employment, whereas many European toy manufacturers importing finished toy products and spares from China will be hit by a drop in profits and sales. According to the British Ministry of Trade and Industry, this kind of all-round import quota restriction, which encompasses the whole European region, is really unnecessary since it is Spain alone that has opposed the import of toys from China and has sought protection for its own toy industry. At present, with the exception of Britain, some other European countries also have pointed out that these sanctions are unjustifiable. These European countries, which are suffering losses, already have started working through legal channels to urge the EU to change its decision and lift the sanctions.
