A statement released to ZNBC [Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation] today by the government says the WEEKLY POST illegally obtained and published a memorandum from the president to Foreign Affairs Minister Dr. Remmy Mushota without authorization. The memo was published with intent to mislead the nation. According to the statement, the first part of the memo was the president's comment on General Miyanda's performance in a television program. The second part was referring to an unnamed individual in the media who was making it difficult for the government to disseminate information.
