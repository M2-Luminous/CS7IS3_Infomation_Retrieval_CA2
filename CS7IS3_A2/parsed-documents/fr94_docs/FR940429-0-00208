FR940429-0-00208 FR940429-0-00015 Discussion: The proposed regulation was intended to allow the Secretary to consider evidence of problems in administering Title IV, HEA programs, as documented not only in reports and determinations issued by the Secretary but by other agencies, identified in proposed ยง668.16(p)(1), in determining of administrative capability. The Secretary understands the commenters' concern that this was not clearly stated in the proposed regulation and agrees to clarify that the Secretary intends to take into account evidence of significant problems that have a bearing on the administration of the Title IV, HEA programs. As stated in the February 28, 1994 NPRM, the Secretary plans to use problems identified in final reports and determinations in evaluating an institution's administrative capability. However, the Secretary cannot accede to commenters' urging that only findings for which institutions have exhausted all appeal procedures be considered. If, for example, the Office of Inspector General, a guarantee agency, and an institution's accrediting agency all issued final reports identifying major Title IV, HEA compliance problems, including failure to make appropriate refunds, and a $1 million liability, it would be unconscionable for the Secretary to fully certify the institution because the institution had not had time to exhaust the appeal opportunities of the various oversight agencies. Changes: Section 668.16(j) has been amended to specify that the significant problems identified must relate to problems that affect, as determined by the Secretary, the institution's ability to administer a Title IV, HEA program. Comments: Some commenters supported the proposed requirement that an institution comply with any standards established by the State in which the institution is located or, if no such standards exist, standards developed by the Secretary regarding completion rates, placements rates and pass rates on required State examinations. Many other commenters requested that the Secretary either clarify in final regulations that institutions would be expected to comply with SPRE standards or explain what other State standards should be adhered to. Most of these commenters also asked the Secretary to clarify what Federal standards institutions would be expected to comply with if there were no State standards. The majority of commenters were opposed to the proposed regulation and recommended that it be removed from the final regulations. Most of these commenters argued that assessment of completion, placement, and licensure pass rates is within the purview of accrediting agencies and States. Some of these commenters stated that review of such rates, as proposed, has no bearing on the capability of an institution to administer Title IV, HEA programs. Many commenters asserted that if the Secretary were to promulgate this regulation, the Secretary would violate the Department of Education Organization Act as implementation of the regulation would involve the Secretary in assessing the effectiveness of an institution's academic programs. Discussion: The Secretary notes that in commenting on other sections, such as proposed ยง668.16(s), which deals with default rates, commenters urged the Secretary to pay more attention to results indicators, such as completion rates, placement rates, and the pass rate on State licensure examinations, and give relatively less credence to input indicators. Further, both the HEA and the Student Right-to-Know Act prescribe the development and use of completion and placement rates under certain circumstances. Nevertheless, the Secretary believes that at this juncture, it is important for the SPREs to develop standards in these areas without reference to the establishment of standards by the Secretary. Changes: Proposed ยง668.16(r) has been removed from these final regulations. Comments: Many commenters argued that the proposal to use a one-year Federal Stafford Loan and Federal SLS programs default rate of 20 percent as a criterion of administrative capability went beyond the statute and Congressional intent. Other commenters asserted that use of a single year's default rate would be unfair to institutions with small numbers of students, and institutions with graduates who default in unusually high numbers in any given year, and recommended use of two or three consecutive year figures to obtain a more accurate picture of an institution's loan program experience. Another group of commenters was concerned that use of 20 percent, rather than 25 percent, as a criterion was inconsistent not only with the statute, but at variance with other provisions for addressing defaults under the Federal Stafford Loan and Federal SLS programs. Of those individuals and organizations that expressed concern with the use of a one-year, 20 percent figure, many recommended using 25 percent and three years of default rate data instead. A large number of commenters stated that an institution's default rates are not indicative of an institution's administrative capability. A majority of these commenters expressed their belief that default rates are more reflective of the characteristics of the student body served by the institution than of the institution's administrative capability and recommended that, at the least, the final regulations provide an exemption for institutions that serve a large number of low-income students. Other commenters argued that default rates are influenced by many factors beyond the control of institutions, including: erroneous data, errors in calculating rates, collection practices of lenders, inadequate servicing, regional differences, and borrowers' failure to accept responsibility. Some commenters recommended that the ratio of borrowers to total student enrollment be taken into consideration. A few others expressed concern that there are delays in resolution of challenges to default rates and wanted to have it clear that only final default rates would be used. A few commenters acknowledged that default rates may be one indication of lack of administrative capability, but argued that many other factors can and do affect administrative capability.
