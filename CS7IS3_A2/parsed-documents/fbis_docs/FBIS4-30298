Rallies took place in Kaesong adjacent to the Military Demarcation Line and Sariwon, the seat of North Hwanghae Province, on June 22 and 23. The speakers at the rallies denounced the recent raid on the office of the Kyoto prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon by Japanese police and its search of 27 places including houses of Chongnyon officials on charges of "violation of the national land utilization law" as a brigandish fascist outrage and political suppression which was committed in broad daylight on no reasonable ground. They strongly demanded the Japanese authorities ponder over the grave consequences that might arise from their anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon campaign, immediately stop such barbaric acts, sincerely apologize for all their crimes and punish the criminals. They urged the Japanese authorities to ensure the Chongnyon officials and Koreans in Japan all legitimate rights and treatment as foreigners and fully guarantee their human rights according to the principles of international law and international usage.
