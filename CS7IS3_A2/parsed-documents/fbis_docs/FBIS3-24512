V. Kistovich and Yu. D. Chashechkin, Mechanical Problems Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences; UDC 551.466] [Abstract] A theoretical investigation was made of two-dimensional harmonic packets of internal waves (IW) in an ideal exponentially stratified fluid. With the neglecting of the Boussinesq approximation a study was made of the reflection of monochromatic packets of internal waves from a rigid plane surface. The problem is solved in a Cartesian coordinate system with application of the phase portraits method. The phase portraits for different cases are examined in detail. Neglecting of the Boussinesq approximation results in the appearance of new effects, especially with glancing angles of incidence on the plane. If the plane is situated beneath an incident packet, in addition to an ordinary reflected packet a packet appears which transports energy in a direction opposite that of the incident packet. However, if the plane is situated beneath an incident packet a packet appears which transports energy in the same direction as the incident packet, which results in a change in the configuration of the incident packet. The envelopes of incident and reflected packets are illustrated and discussed. Figures 4; references 8: 3 Russian, 5 Western.
