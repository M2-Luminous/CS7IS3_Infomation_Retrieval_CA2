This was confirmed today to AFP by JCE spokespersons. The Dominican Republic held presidential, parliamentary, and municipal elections 15 days ago, nevertheless a winner has not been declared yet due to uncountable charges of fraud. This has led the JCE to recount the votes. The opposition parties' main charge is that approximately 200,000 persons -- allegedly opposed to the official Social Christian Reformist Party of President Joaquin Balaguer -- were excluded from the voter lists used on election day. The opposition parties demand the JCE show them the lists used in the elections to compare them with the ones the board delivered to them a few days before the elections. This request has just been granted. The JCE decision came about after, in an independent manner, the electoral boards of the Puerto Plata and the National District [Santo Domingo and its surroundings] declared their willingness to turn over their voter lists to the parties that requested them. Nevertheless, a JCE spokesperson told AFP that the printing and delivery of the voter lists to the political parties will take five to six days. According to the count, Balaguer, 87 and almost blind, who is running for his seventh presidential term, garnered a 1 percent lead (30,000 votes) over Jose Francisco Gomez, social democrat from the Dominican Revolutionary Party [PRD]. The PRD, which charged alleged fraud, insists that the sole solution to the post electoral crisis is a partial or total repetition of the elections. International observers who watched over the Dominican elections have declared the need to verify the number of persons who were not able to vote to establish if it was a significant enough number that could have altered the results.
