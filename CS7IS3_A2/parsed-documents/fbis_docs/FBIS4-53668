"Both sides felt that it would be important to meet this afternoon to further clarify and address the issues on the table," said a spokeswoman for U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor. At stake is the prospect of the so-called "framework" trade talks, which ruptured in February and have since badly soured bilateral trade relations. Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. President Bill Clinton have said they are eager to find a common "basis" for resuming the framework talks when they meet at the Group of Seven summit in Naples in early July. But the prospects of an early agreement remained elusive after three days of on-and-off negotiations. When the officials emerged from another hourlong face-to-face encounter Saturday afternoon, they refused to say whether there was progress in their latest round of talks. "I can only say the talks are ongoing," said Japan's Deputy Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi. Japanese officials said the two sides will meet again Monday. Saturday's session was a surprise. Both the Japanese embassy and Kantor's office told reporters earlier Saturday that the two sides have called off the day's session. "The Americans later called us up and told us they need certain clarifications," a Japanese official said later in explaining why the two sides decided to hold a meeting Saturday. While both Japanese and U.S. officials have declined to comment on what transpired across the negotiating table, Kantor underscored the importance Washington attaches to this week's talks by personally participating in part of the negotiations between sub- cabinet officials. The trade talks, which are closely watched on financial markets as a barometer in the state of relationship between the world's two largest economies, broke down at the Feb. 11 meeting in Washington between Clinton and then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. One major sticking point in the framework talks -- and the primary cause for the three-month deadlock in the negotiations -- is the idea of setting "objective criteria" to measure imports to Japan. In what is known as a "results-oriented" approach, the U.S. has insisted on using "numerical indicators" to ensure that a trade agreement with Japan translates into increased foreign sales in the Japanese market. Tokyo has vehemently objected to the idea, saying it amounts to government-managed trade. Among the industry sectors covered under the framework accord concluded last July are Japanese Government procurement for medical and telecommunications products, trade in autos and auto parts, and Japanese insurance market. The U.S. wants Japan to open its market wider in these "priority" market areas and stimulate domestic demands in order to reduce its vast and growing trade surplus. The U.S.-Japan trade imbalance was underscored by fresh U.S. Government data Thursday that showed the U.S. trade deficit with Japan jumped 25 percent in March to 5.8 billion dollars. The U.S. trade gap with Japan came to 15 billion dollars in the first three months this year, well ahead of the comparable period last year which stood at 13.3 billion dollars.
