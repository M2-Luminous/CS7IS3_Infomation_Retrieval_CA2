He recalled one thesis from the CIS Charter confirmed by heads of states January 22, 1993 in Minsk. The document stipulates that "those sponsor states which adopt commitments according to the present Charter within a year after its adoption by the Council of Heads of States are member-states of the Commonwealth." At the same time Korotchenya stressed that "the Charter is brought into force for all sponsor-states, from the moment they hand over instruments of ratification for storage or for sponsor-states which will hand over their instruments of ratification in a year following adoption of this Charter." According to Korotchenya, as of today only six states have ratified the CIS Charter, namely Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Korotchenya said that they expected ratification from Azerbaijan and Georgia in the near future. Russia, Kazakhstan, and Tajikistan have already forwarded their instruments of ratification to Belarus' governmental archives, to the country-depository of the CIS. At the Ashgabat summit leaders of the Commonwealth countries have prolonged the term of ratification of the CIS Charter for Moldova for three months more, said Korotchenya. The session of the Belarussian parliament is to resume its work in Minsk on January 18. Korotchenya, a people's deputy of this representative body, believes that the issue on ratification of the Commonwealth Charter "must be considered without any delay during the first day of the session's work."
