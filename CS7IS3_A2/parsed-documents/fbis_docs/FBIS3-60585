This is envisaged in its military doctrine which has proclaimed the nuclear deterrence to be the backbone of its military policy and the means of deterring not only nuclear but conventional wars as well. At the same time Russia pledges not to use nuclear weapons first," said Professor Sergey Rogov, deputy director of the Institute for the U.S. and Canada Studies and president of the Centre of National Security and International Relations at a news conference held in the Russo- American information centre on Monday. Rogov said that the document reflects a more open approach to problems of national security than the one earlier practiced by the soviet political and military leadership. Rogov described such an approach as "a tangible step in declarative nuclear strategy."
