FR940921-0-00159 FR940921-0-00017 This final rule addresses covered subjects under paragraph (B) above and, therefore, preempts State, local, or Indian tribe requirements not meeting the ``substantively the same'' standard. Section 5125(b)(7) of Title 49 U.S.C. provides that if DOT issues a regulation concerning any of the covered subjects, after November 16, 1990, DOT must determine and publish in the Federal Register the effective date of Federal preemption. The effective date may not be earlier than the 90th day following the date of issuance of the final rule and not later than two years after the date of issuance. RSPA has determined that the effective date of Federal preemption for these requirements will be December 21, 1994. Thus, RSPA lacks discretion in this area, and preparation of a federalism assessment is not warranted. C. Regulatory Flexibility Act This final rule corrects two errors and clarifies an existing requirement in the Hazardous Materials Regulations concerning operational requirements for rail carriers. I certify this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. D. Paperwork Reduction Act There are no new information collection requirements in this final rule. E. Regulation Identifier Number (RIN) A regulation identifier number (RIN) is assigned to each regulatory action listed in the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations. The Regulatory Information Service Center publishes the Unified Agenda in April and October of each year. The RIN number contained in the heading of this document can be used to cross-reference this action with the Unified Agenda.
