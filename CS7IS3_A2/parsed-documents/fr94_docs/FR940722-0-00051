FR940722-0-00051 FR940722-0-00013 3. Listing of Actions, Failures, and Refusals That Subject Individuals to Penalties Finally, OSM, in the November 12, 1993, letter, notified North Dakota that, unlike section 518(f) of SMCRA, proposed NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08 does not explicitly include failure of refusal to comply with orders of the Commission as cause to subject individuals to penalties. In addition, OSM noted that the North Dakota coal exploration program does not explicitly address the issuance of orders by the Commission and that the program was approved by OSM on the basis of North Dakota's agreement to issue each coal exploration permit with a specific condition subjecting it to the requirements of 30 CFR 840, 842, 843, 845, and 43 CFR part 4 (see 45 FR 82214, 82226; December 15, 1980) Section 518(f) of SMCRA subjects individuals to penalties when corporate permittees fail or refuse to comply with enforcement orders or any order (with minor exceptions) incorporated in a final decision of the regulatory authority. In the December 3, 1993, letter, North Dakota responded by acknowledging that its provisions at NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08 regarding liability and penalties for failure to comply with orders of the Industrial Commission should be clearer, and expressed its willingness to approach the North Dakota Legislature in 1995 to request an amendment to NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08 to include civil and criminal penalties for violations such orders. The Director agrees that North Dakota must amend NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08. Therefore, the Director is not approving proposed NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08 and is requiring North Dakota to amend its program to require that, in addition to violations, failure or refusal to comply with such orders, as listed in section 518(f) of SMCRA and issued by the North Dakota Industrial Commission, serves as an additional basis for imposing individual civil and criminal penalties upon corporate officers, directors, and agents. The required program amendment placed on North Dakota's program at 30 CFR 934.16(y), as a result of a January 9, 1992, rulemaking action (57 FR 807, 823&hyph;24) will be modified to reflect this decision. IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments 1. Public Comments The Director solicited public comments and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the proposed amendment. No public comments were received, and because no one requested an opportunity to testify at a public hearing, no hearing was held. 2. Federal Agency Comments Pursuant to section 503(b) of SMCRA and the implementing regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM solicited comments from the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Secretary of Agriculture, and various other Federal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the North Dakota program. By letter dated May 19, 1993 (administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;8), the Soil Conservation Service responded that it had no comment on the proposed amendment. By letter dated May 25, 1993 (administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;9), the U.S. Bureau of Mines responded that it had no specific comments on the proposed amendment. By letter dated May 26, 1993 (administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;10), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service responded that it had no substantive comments on the proposed amendment. By letter dated June 28, 1993 (administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;12), the Mine Safety and Health Administration responded that it had no comments on the proposed amendment. 3. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Concurrence and Comments Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), OSM is required to obtain the written concurrence of the Administrator of EPA with respect to those aspects of a State program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq. ) and the Clean Air Act, as amended, (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq. ). EPA gave its written concurrence with the proposed amendment by letter dated October 25, 1993 (administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;13). 4. State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(4), OSM is required to solicit comments from the SHPO and ACHP for all amendments that may have an effect on historic properties. By letter dated May 7, 1993, OSM solicited comments from these offices (administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;6). Neither the SHPO nor the ACHP commented on the proposed amendment. V.
