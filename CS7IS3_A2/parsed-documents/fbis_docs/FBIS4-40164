He managed to have an interview with Georgiy Kondratyev just before take-off. According to the deputy defense minister, the beginning of the peacekeeping operation is divided into two stages. The first stage will take place on 16-19 June. During this stage the engineer subunits will be deployed to carry out mine clearance operations in the region of the conflict. Communications equipment will also be installed and headquarters set up for the peacekeeping forces. There will be two such headquarters -- in Gali and Zugdidi. During the first stage three battalions of the Russian Transcaucasian troops and the 345th Airborne Assault Regiment stationed in Gudauta are to be deployed. The peacekeeping forces' subunits will occupy disengagement lines along the Inguri riverbank. The second stage will take place during 21-24 June. During this stage the number of peacekeeping troops in the conflict zone will be increased by two more battalions. The full-scale peacekeeping operation in Abkhazia will begin on 26 June. Colonel General Kondratyev noted that the Russian Federation Defense Ministry will have to bear all the costs of the peacekeeping operation, which will be about 2 billion rubles. He also noted that in 1993 the Russian Defense Ministry spent more than 26 billion rubles out of its own budget on peacekeeping operations. To the question on the composition of the peacekeeping forces, Georgiy Kondratyev replied that only the Russian subunits will be involved. The CIS countries will be represented only by observers from Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine. To our correspondent's question on who will be appointed commander of the CIS peacekeeping forces in Abkhazia, Kondratyev replied that this decision will be made on site.
