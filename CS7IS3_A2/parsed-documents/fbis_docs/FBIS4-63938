Despite differences in the positions of various political forces, the basic principles shaping the country's future which are shared by a large proportion of the citizens of Georgia are to be laid down. A single state mentality, civic patriotism, and striving for a common goal must become the foundation for national consolidation. We agree to the main principles in order to establish national accord and unity in the country. Our unswerving and undeviating principles are the following: 1. [word indistinct] the independence and territorial integrity of Georgia. 2. Adherence to democratic ideals, efforts to build a civic society, and strict observance of human rights. 3. Tolerance, compassion, and protection of the rights of ethnic minorities. 4. Implementation of economic reforms. 5. Establishment of law and order, uncompromising struggle against corruption, terrorism, and illegal drugs business, and support for the law-enforcement bodies. 6. Securing Georgia's rightful place in the world and the Caucasus region. 7. State and military construction. 8. Refusal to resort to violence or to forging alliance with special services of foreign countries, and shunning social and other forms of destabilization in order to achieve political and other goals. 9. Solving all state issues constitutionally, and deciding the issue of power through elections or, if necessary, pre-term elections. By achieving national consensus we will clearly demonstrate that the building of an independent and democratic state in Georgia is the unswerving will of the Georgian people, which they are capable of implementing. Our aim is an independent, strong, single, and democratic Georgia, which we all must build in unity, accord, and respect for one another.
