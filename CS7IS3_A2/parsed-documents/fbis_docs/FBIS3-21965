In Kassel, criminal officers seized over 8 kg of heroin with a street value of between 10 and 20 million German marks and arrested three suspects. In Friedberg in Hesse and in Arhus in Denmark, a six-member drug ring was smashed that smuggled about one-half tonne of hashish to Denmark. As the police announced in Kassel, the heroin was discovered after the arrest of a Belgian drug courier in a tire that had been thrown away. In the man's car, the police first found 1.1 kg of drugs. It is believed that an accomplice of the Belgian wanted to take the tire, but threw it away while trying to escape. The arrest of the German-Danish drug gang, which took place as early as on 9 March, was preceded by month-long investigations. Those detained included a 50-year-old Danish woman who traveled to her home country from Friedberg every two weeks since the middle of 1993, smuggling 25 kg of hashish during every trip, the police announced. The recipients were serious criminals in the rocker scene.
