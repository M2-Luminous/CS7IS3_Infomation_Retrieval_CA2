Optical pickups are used to read digital signals for optical disks. The Osaka-based consumer electronics company will raise overall production in Japan and overseas for its business year ending in November to 24.9 million pickups. Optical pickups are in strong demand due to wider use of minidiscs and compact disc read-only memories (CD-ROMs). Sanyo is churning out the high value-added electronic component in Japan, China and South Korea, with combined output coming to 14.7 million in the year which ended last November. Currently, the company holds a 25 percent share in the global market, in which Sony Corp. commands the lion's share of about 60 percent, according to industry analysts. They say total sales are expected to gain 20 percent to 72 million pickups in the world marketplace.
