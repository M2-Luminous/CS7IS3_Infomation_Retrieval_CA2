First of all, the "number of shadow budgets linked with German unity must be combined under one budget" so that the overall cost is clear to the citizens, SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping stated at a meeting of the "Frankfurt Circle," a left-wing forum within the SPD, in Oer-Erkenschwick. He mentioned the sum of 750 billion German marks [DM]. To raise this sum, he mainly wants to focus on the owners of large assets. "Everybody will have to make a reasonable contribution." The SPD's candidate for chancellor left it open whether a levy on property should be introduced, whether the assessed value for land should be adapted, or whether government bonds should be issued. Scharping stated that all planned financial and economic measures that are currently being drafted for the SPD government program are serving two goals: Taxes and fees must not be increased beyond the level planned for 1995. "The same applies to state indebtedness." Within this framework, however, numerous adjustments are required. Scharping's statements met with criticism among the left-leaning SPD members. Several speakers pointed out that such a strict financial framework does not leave enough leeway for reducing mass unemployment. However, Scharping clearly rejected efforts to concentrate primarily on employment programs financed by the state in the fight against unemployment. What is needed is an intelligent combination of various possibilities. "We must make the productive forces of society visible to a greater extent and not simply rely on the state," he stressed. Scharping emphatically pleaded in favor of a "very reserved" use of promises during the election campaign. "I will not support anything that cannot be realized between 1994 and 1998," he pointed out. "Otherwise we will have to face the consequences in 1998, and the whole democratic system will be discredited." Yet it is certain that the SPD wants to withdraw the abolition of the bad weather allowance. Moreover, developments in eastern Germany must be assessed realistically. Currently, about DM150 billion annually are being transferred from eastern to western Germany. "If this does not change, eastern Germany will reach 70 percent of western economic strength in 15 years," the party chairman pointed out. According to Scharping, the "intelligent combination" of measures in the fight against unemployment includes "environmentally friendly economic growth" and the promotion of new technologies. Scharping called for a more far-reaching European cooperation concerning communications and environmental technologies, genetic engineering, and the transportation systems. Generally, he advocated the promotion of investments and the reduction of consumptive expenditure. Thus, it is necessary to abolish numerous bureaucratic regulations preventing investments -- including high standards in the sphere of construction, for example. State activities must be modernized. In the discussion about the privatization of public tasks, Scharping called for an "examination without any taboos," while taking into consideration costs, quality, and social consequences. "Those who ignore that do not pursue a responsible policy." There are also considerations to deduct social benefits like family allowance from the tax liability instead of having them paid by special authorities.
