Arriving in Vietnam, National Assembly Chairman Chea Sim and the distinguished Cambodian guests have brought to our people the relationship of fraternity and friendship of the Cambodian people, who are living in a country with an historic Angkor civilization. This visit also marks a new developing step in the friendship and cooperation relations between the two countries and their national assemblies. During its stay in Vietnam, the KOC National Assembly delegation held talks with the Vietnamese National Assembly delegation led by Chairman Nong Duc Manh in an atmosphere of friendship and mutual understanding. Party General Secretary Do Muoi, State President Le Duc Anh, and Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet held cordial talks with the visiting delegation. The delegation visited the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum and laid a wreath there. It also visited Ho Chi Minh's living and working quarters and many economic and cultural establishments in different localities. Being neighbors of Cambodia, we are very happy at the important achievements recorded by the Cambodian people under the leadership of King Norodom Sihanouk in building a Cambodian state of independence, peace, and non-alignment, and one which is friendly to all nations. We also express our joy at the relations of traditional unity and cooperation between the two close, neighboring countries of Vietnam and Cambodia. The relations, after experiencing challenges, have been continuously strengthened and developed. Regarding their national construction and development, as well as their efforts to develop their friendship relations, especially in the present circumstances, Vietnam and Cambodia share a common concern to strengthen and broaden the relations of good neighborliness and multilateral cooperation for mutual benefit. That relationship is based on the principles set forth in the January 1992 Vietnam-Cambodia Joint Communique. The principles were also repeated in the August 1993 Vietnam-Cambodia Joint Communique. The joy of the two peoples is further multiplied when the relations have been continuously strengthened and developed. That is prominently manifested by this official friendship to Vietnam by the KOC National Assembly delegation. In the cordial talks with Party General Secretary Do Muoi, State President Le Duc Anh, and Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, Samdech Chea Sim expressed his fine impressions of the quick improvement in the Vietnamese socioeconomy and the important achievements recorded by the Vietnamese people in their renovation undertaking. He confirmed that as a great encouragement for the Cambodian people in their current undertaking of national protection and construction. He affirmed the Cambodian people's determination to overcome all difficulties and challenges in order to take their revolutionary undertaking to a situation of stability and development. The KOC National Assembly, government, and people will do their best to preserve and develop the Cambodia-Vietnam fraternal friendship and the comprehensive cooperation for peace and prosperity in each country and for peace, stability, and cooperation in the region and the world. Samdech Chea Sim thanked the Vietnamese Government and people for their previous great assistance to the Cambodian revolution as well as their present active contribution to the process for peace and national concord in Cambodia. In their talks with the distinguished Cambodian guests, Party General Secretary Do Muoi, State President Le Duc Anh, and Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet heartily welcomed the Vietnam visit by the high-ranking delegation of the Cambodian National Assembly at the Vietnamese new year. They considered this as a significant event and a good sign of Vietnam-Cambodia friendship, unity, and cooperative relations. The Vietnamese leaders confirmed that as ever, Vietnam wishes -- and in reality, Vietnam has done its best -- to build and strengthen the time-honored friendship and the close, friendly relations between the peoples in the two countries. And Vietnam always supports the Cambodian people's efforts to build a Cambodia of independence, peace, non-alignment, which is friendly to all countries, especially to neighboring countries. The Vietnamese leaders stated that this Vietnam visit by the Cambodian National Assembly delegation ushered in a new era for the Vietnam-Cambodia relations of friendship and cooperation. Heartily welcoming the official friendship Vietnam visit by the KOC National Assembly delegation led by Chairman Chea Sim, we hope that the delegation will record fine achievements in its visit and we trust that the Vietnam-Cambodia relations of friendship and cooperation will be continuously consolidated and strengthened.
