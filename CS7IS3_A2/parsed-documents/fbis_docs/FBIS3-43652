The Afrikaans right-wing radio station went on the air at 6 O'clock [0400 GMT] this morning. According to a source close to the station, trenches and other defensive positions which have been dug around the Donkerhoek broadcasting site east of Pretoria have been manned by the station's supporters in anticipation of a police raid. Radio Pretoria mainly broadcasts traditional Afrikaans music, as well as talk shows, interviews and news bulletins with a distinct right-wing anti-government feeling.
