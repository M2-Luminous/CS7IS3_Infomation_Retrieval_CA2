K.: "Latvia Has Just Barely Been Joined to the CIS"] [Text] On Monday paramilitary formations subordinated to the Latvian Ministry of Internal Affairs undertook provocative actions against Russian military installations, the embassy, and certain representatives in Riga. As we have learned from reliable sources, had the situation exacerbated, the airborne and military transport aviation forces which were put on alert could have accomplished the combined employment of paratroopers in Riga. In accordance with plans worked out in the last years of the USSR's existence (under which the 1991 military actions in the Baltic region were held), the troops arriving from Russia would have unblocked and taken our installations under guard. All of this would have been strongly reminiscent of the evacuation of the Soviet Embassy in Afghanistan. The initiator of the military option was Minister Kozyrev, who asked General Grachev to take the requisite measures. According to competent sources in the Foreign Affairs Ministry, the provocation could be linked to the new round of bilateral negotiations on the fate of Russian military installations in Latvia as well as to President Clinton's European tour. If everything were quiet, then, according to Mr. Prikhodko, head of the Baltic Division at the Second European Department, one could "hope for a breakthrough." After apologies by the Latvian side the talks, scheduled for two to three days, went ahead, although later than planned. The Foreign Affairs Ministry is still expecting explanations on a higher level with a mandatory indication of the organizers and perpetrators of the provocation, the punishment meted out to them, and so forth. The incident was discussed at a night emergency session of the Latvian Government. A couple of minor officials were dismissed.
