The pursuit of foreign managers is intended to enhance light industry's production and exports, said the official, who works in the China National Council of Light Industry but wished not to be identified. This year, light industry is expected to export $34.5 billion worth of products. The official said big export-oriented enterprises will be the first to be designated for foreigners to manage under contract. The move is expected to bring in advanced technology from overseas that will help modernize these enterprises and expand their exports,the official explained. Besides the contract management system, he said, overseas companies can also pour in money to convert State enterprises into joint ventures. The China National Council of Light Industry is also planning management and technical training programmes in Sweden, Finland and other countries, the official said. Besides managers, China will bring in technicians from these countries to help renovate enterprises' technology. China is also ready to extend its policies on investment and co-operation to overseas enterprises, the official said. The official said overseas investment is expected in capital- and technology-intensive industries but those that pollute heavily should be prohibited. This year, the light industry council will seek more overseas capital, technology and skills for China's inland areas, the official said. Last year inland areas used 180 percent more overseas investment than the previous year, while the growth rate in the thriving coastal regions was 52 percent. The official said that besides direct overseas management, joint ventures in light industry are still a major force in exports, accounting for about 20 percent of the industry's total. The council is co-operating more closely with big overseas companies, the official said. Early this year, for example, it signed a $350 million investment agreement with PepsiCo Inc, the American food and beverage giant. This followed the signing last year of a $150 million agreement with Coca-Cola Co. Loans from international organizations and foreign governments will also be important in promoting light industry's co-operation, the official said.
