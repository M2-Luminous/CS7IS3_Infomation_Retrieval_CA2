Kalmykia, Crimea, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia Have Joined the `North Caucasus' Association"] [Text] "The past does not divide us, it merely reminds us that the future of Russia and the Caucasus are entwined.... Recognizing that the Caucasian war was a tragedy for all the peoples of the Caucasus, we must strive for cooperation, mutual understanding, and peace in the region." These were the words of Nikolay Yegorov, speaking for the first time as Russian minister for nationalities affairs, at a rally in Nalchik. It is well known that in Krasnodar Kray, whose administration he used to head, he actually managed to prove that such mutual understanding is possible: Interethnic conflicts were avoided in this area where representatives of various peoples live. It is no accident that it was Yegorov's idea to assemble the political leaders of the North Caucasus at a major council which would enable them to pool their resources in order to tackle common tasks more effectively. The next step on this road was the conference of the "North Caucasus" Social and Economic Cooperation Association held just the other day in Krasnodar; this was attended by official delegations from the region's republics, krays, and oblasts, as well as representatives from Volgograd Oblast, Kalmykia, Crimea, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia. Association Chairman Nikolay Pivovarov announced that at the conference Kalmykia was granted permanent membership of the "North Caucasus" Association, and Crimea, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia were granted associate membership. Vladislav Ardzinba, chairman of the Abkhazian Supreme Council, announced that "the Abkhazian leadership opposes the division of the Caucasian peoples by new state borders" and supports "the restoration of comprehensive ties that have been broken off." Consequently, he expressed his satisfaction that Abkhazia has been granted associate membership of the "North Caucasus" Social and Economic Cooperation Association. For its part, Crimea too needs effective contacts with neighboring regions of the Black Sea coast. There are plenty of reasons for this, one of which is the problem of the Crimean Tatars which has flared up recently. Suffice it to recall the recent speech delivered in Simferopol by Mustafa Dzhamilev, chairman of the Crimean Tatar People's Assembly. At the present time, he stated, thousands of Tatars returning to Crimea "find themselves in a tragic and frightening situation." At the same time, in his opinion, certain difficulties are being artificially created by forces "which advocate the idea that Crimea belongs to Russia." Bearing in mind that, according to some reports, the Crimean Tatars are starting to receive weapons illegally from Turkey, it is clear that the unpredictable "Tatar factor" could become the catalyst for a major conflict on the peninsula. And the position of the North Caucasus republics, united as they are in a social and economic cooperation association, could serve as a stabilizing lever of equilibrium in Crimea given their religious affiliation.
