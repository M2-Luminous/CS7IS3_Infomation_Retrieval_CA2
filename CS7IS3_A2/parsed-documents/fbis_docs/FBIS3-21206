Microminiaturization and the increased scale of integration necessary to deal with this are gradually increasing the importance of wiring technology. This is because the wiring process has become the process determining the yield and reliability of devices. The recent trend is that the wiring structure itself is complex, in addition to microminiaturization and the attendant increase in the number of layers of wiring. This is apparent specifically with plugging technology for filling fine contact holes and the stacking with high melting point materials to assure the reliability of Al wiring. Sputtering has played an important role in the fabrication of Al wiring. Although CVD is gradually penetrating the domain of metal film fabrication, sputtering technology may remain necessary as long as Al wiring is used because Al is a very active material and sputtering is beneficial for obtaining good film quality from such a material. Since sputtering equipment supplanted deposition equipment in metal film fabrication, it has experienced various technical innovations including wafer-level processing and the use of multiple chambers. After composite processing with CVD or annealing has almost reached a practical level, almost all of the present sputtering equipment is being made with cluster tools. This report describes the configuration and functions of the sputtering equipment required for manufacturing 256M DRAM-class devices, but in this changing environment it is difficult to present the total picture. The report first describes the dissatisfaction of users concerning existing sputtering equipment, then considers some of the functions required for future sputtering equipment. Problems in Equipment Configuration First, let us consider the equipment configuration. To assure uniformity in film thickness, sputtering needs a target with 1.5 to 2 times the diameter of the wafer. For example, as shown in Figure 1, a target with a diameter of 300 to 360mm is used with an 8-inch diameter wafer. This necessitates a larger process chamber than CVD equipment. Following the use of multiple chambers and wafer size increase, the equipment now has a very large footprint, making it almost impossible to install adjacent to other process equipment. Apparently, equipment manufacturers are unaware of this problem. Users need equipment with a body depth of less than two meters. It is also desirable to reduce the size of auxiliary equipment such as the power supply unit, or to stack it to reduce its footprint. Figure 1. Positioning of Sputtering Target for 8-Inch Since layered wiring started to be fabricated using multi-chamber equipment, throughput has halved compared to conventional film fabrication using Al alone. What is worse, the complexity of multi-layer wiring and layered wiring has increased the number of sputtering processes. This drives the urgent need for multi-chamber sputtering equipment with high throughput. To increase throughput, it may also be necessary to review the semi-independent chamber system using plate transfer, without continuing the use of arm transport systems. Problems in Basic Functions Next, consider some of the basic functions of the equipment. Up to the present, the performance of process equipment has often been evaluated under simplified conditions that differ from actual operating conditions. The simplified conditions do not emulate controlling the actual device manufacturing process. This evaluation method for controlling or monitoring the status of actual film fabrication itself needs evaluation. Particle reduction is the most important topic in sputtering equipment for the 256M DRAM generation. While clean-room technology is advancing, the reduction of other factors causing particles in manufacturing equipment is not sufficient. Especially, following the microminiaturization and multiple layers of Al wiring, particles from the sputtering equipment have become the main factor degrading yield. In general, particles attached to wafers have been evaluated by simply examining the transport operation. However, since it was found that particles are also produced during film fabrication, evaluation covering the film fabrication process has become essential. Measuring particles had been difficult because metal films have high reflectivity and large surface coarseness but, as shown in Figure 2, measurement is possible even when metal films are used. Of course, equipment which can guarantee a low particle count even with film is desirable. Figure 2. Examples of Measurements of Particles With Metal Major sources of particles in sputtering equipment are the wafer transportation system and the targets and anti-deposition plate in the process chamber. With regard to the wafer transportation system, it has been proposed to apply vertical or face-down transportation, but the correct method to reduce particles may be to simplify the wafer transportation system rather than to rely on wafer orientation. With regard to particles from the target, they can be reduced greatly by using full-face eroded cathodes.[.sup]1[/] Dust from the anti-deposition plate or clamping mechanism is also a source of worry. In-situ cleaning is used in practice with CVD equipment but practical use of in-situ cleaning with sputtering is deemed difficult. Problems include attaching of the film over a wide area of the anti-deposition plate and the adverse influence of reactive gas on the fabricated film quality. Improving the bonding force by plasma conditioning or reducing thermal stress by maintaining the anti-deposition plate heating temperature have been proposed, but a more essential improvement is desirable. Figure 3 shows the results of composition analysis of particles detected after film fabrication with Ti and TiON. SUS and SiO[.sup]2[/] particles are derived from the transport system and Al and TiON particles are believed to be produced in the process chambers, though the specific positions cannot be identified. Figure 3. Example of Result of Particle Analysis of With wafer heating, much sputtering equipment is now capable of heating the stage up to 600�C, and temperature distribution is also being improved. The technology can be considered to have reached the practical level when application in high-temperature sputtering, which plugs contact holes by flowing Al, is taken into account.[.sup]2[/] However, while the temperature during film fabrication and its distribution are most important, they are not controlled completely for the present because of the difficulty in temperature measurement during film fabrication. It is desirable to monitor the temperature during film fabrication, control it within 10�C from the target temperature, and control the temperature distribution over the wafer within 10�C. Gas heating by flowing gas between the wafer back-side and stage is advantageous for preventing an excessive temperature rise during film fabrication. To improve temperature uniformity it may be necessary to divide the stage into several areas and apply independent temperature control to each. With the degree of vacuum, a base pressure of the order of 10[.sup]-9[/] Torr is now available in mass-production machines thanks to their ultrahigh vacuum capability. An ultrahigh vacuum is necessary for fabricating high-reliability Al wiring with a large grain diameter and good orientation, and to stabilize the process of high-temperature sputtering. Nevertheless, with substrate heating of around 500�C required for high-temperature sputtering, for example, a vacuum of the order of 10[.sup]-9[/] Torr has not been achieved due to increased degassing from the chamber. It is desirable that equipment achieve a base pressure of the order of 10[.sup]-9[/] Torr, even used for heated film fabrication at 600�C. However low the base pressure, it is still meaningless if there is any degassing from the target and its surroundings. Figure 4 shows that the peak of H[.sup]2[/] rises when Al film fabrication is started. This is because moisture is emitted from the target surroundings; this reacts with Al and H[.sup]2[/] is left as a result. Such degassing should also be reduced. Figure 4. Analysis of Gases in Al Film Fabrication (with Additionally, film fabrication rate monitoring, which has been possible with batch-type systems, is not possible when a wafer-level method is used. Considering the increasing necessity of fabricating thin films such as reflection prevention film with high controllability, the revival of this function is desirable. Desirable New Functions The following describes the new functions desirable for sputtering equipment. The first desirable function is the improvement of coverage. In the age of 256M DRAMs, contact holes will have diameters of 0.3 �m and the aspect ratio will be around 3. In such a case, ordinary sputtering may be able to achieve only a small percentage of coverage, which is insufficient even for bonded layers of blanket tungsten. Coverage can be improved by increasing the vertically incident component. A solution for this is collimated sputtering, but this method is difficult to use due to collimator blocking and particle production problems. Another possible method is to reduce the scattering of sputtered particles by decreasing sputtering gas pressure. As ECR sputtering[.sup]3[/] has been proposed as a specific method, the announcement of a practical machine is awaited. It is also effective to decrease oblique incident components from the target surroundings by decreasing the target diameter or by increasing the distance between the target and wafer. But, this is a trade-off with the film thickness distribution in the wafer. Another attractive new function is combining with CVD or annealing. It is estimated that microminiaturization of the contact holes would lead to the necessity of continuous processing to avoid oxidation due to atmospheric exposure in order to secure the ohmic contact. Specific merits of this method have already been reported[.sup]4[/] but further study may be required on the inevitability of using it on a manufacturing line. Conclusion In the manufacturing of semiconductor devices, sputtering is increasing in importance as a process determining yield and reliability. However, existing sputtering equipment in which the use of cluster tools is advanced poses problems in terms of footprint and throughput. Since particles will be a more important problem following a microminiaturization, reducing them will be the most important topic in the device manufacturing of 256M generation DRAMs. The advantages of composite processes which are attracting attention require further study.
