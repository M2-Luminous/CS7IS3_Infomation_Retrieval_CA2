ACTION: Notice of Proposed Procedures to Implement Section 2929 of the 1994 National Defense Authorization Act (National Defense Authorization Act, Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;160, 107 Stat. 1547, 1935 (1993)). SUMMARY: The Western Area Power Administration (Western), a Federal power marketing agency of the Department of Energy (DOE), has developed proposed procedures to fulfill the requirements of section 2929 of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1994 (National Defense Authorization Act, Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;160, 107 Stat. 1547, 1935 (1993)) (NDA Act). Under the proposed procedures to implement the requirements of the NDA Act, Western would allocate up to 119.223 megawatts (MW) of Power from the Central Valley Project (CVP), which represents the amount of CVP Power provided as of November 30, 1993, to military installations. The NDA Act was signed into public law on November 30, 1993. Section 2929 of the NDA Act provides that, for a 10-year period beginning on November 30, 1993, the electric power allocations provided as of November 30, 1993, by Western from the CVP to military installations in the State of California which have been closed or approved for closure pursuant to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (part A, Title XXIX, Pub. L. 101&hyph;510; 10 U.S.C. 2687 note) (1990 Act) shall be reserved for sale through Long-Term Contracts to Preference Entities which agree to use such Power to promote economic development at a military installation that is closed or approved for closure pursuant to the 1990 Act. To the extent Power reserved by the NDA Act is not disposed of through Long-Term Contracts, it shall be made available on a temporary basis during such 10-year period to military installations in the State of California through Short-Term Contracts. By implementing these Procedures, Western will establish the criteria to allocate the Power made available as a result of the NDA Act. The procedures set forth in this Federal Register will explain in detail how Western intends to implement the NDA Act. Under the proposed NDA Act Procedures, Western has identified the Power that will be classified as NDA Act Power and the types of services and contracts that will be offered. Also set forth under the proposed NDA Act Procedures are the general eligibility criteria that Western will apply to all applicants requesting an Allocation of NDA Act Power, and the procedures to be used by applicants when applying for NDA Act Power, which include demonstration that certain economic development criteria are being met. Lastly, Western has set forth the procedures that will be used in allocating NDA Act Power to eligible applicants, including a priority list developed by Western for allocating NDA Act Power. In general, the proposed Procedures provide that the allocation of CVP Power as of November 30, 1993, at a military installation that is closed or approved for closure under the 1990 Act will be classified as NDA Act Power and will be reserved through November 30, 2003, for use at that military installation. Until the NDA Act Power is fully utilized at that military installation, the NDA Act Power will be made available on a temporary basis as described in Section G.1. of the NDA Act Procedures.
