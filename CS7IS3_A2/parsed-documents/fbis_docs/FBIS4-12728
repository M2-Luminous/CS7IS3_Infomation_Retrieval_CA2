FBIS4-12728 "drnes071__a94013" FBIS-NES-94-071-A Daily Report 25 Mar 1994 ANNEX Israel South Lebanon Security Zone Detailed South Lebanon Security Zone Detailed TA0204140994 Tel Aviv MA'ARIV (PESAH supplement) in Hebrew 25 Mar 94 pp 6, 7, 8, 9 TA0204140994 Tel Aviv MA'ARIV (PESAH supplement) Hebrew BFN [Report by Yosi Walter] [Text] The fear sneaks in at the border crossing near Misgav 'Am. A kind of a chill that creeps to the chest and settles in the lower part of the stomach. The feeling has many names, which change shape in one's inflamed imagination: Hizballah, Sagger missiles, road-side charges, and car bombs. A look at the faces of IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers preparing to enter the security zone in southern Lebanon reveals that I am not alone in this. They, too, are nervous, they too are tense. The troops have been long waiting for an axis to open; their entry is made impossible by the heavy fog in the area. And the fog and dark are the best friends of the enemy, of Hizballah. This name will accompany us during the long hours we will spend with IDF troops. Everyone knows what this fanatic organization is capable of. Moreover, it has been dictating new rules of the game in recent months, and a new term has entered the terror vocabulary of south Lebanon. They call it "counterfire." They attack IDF targets, mainly convoys, from a distance. This time they use Sagger missiles. That way the terrorists avoid direct contact with our troops while reaching the same, or even better, results. The counterfire has already claimed victims. And Hizballah's precision firing is improving as time goes on. The force is preparing to enter. The objective is an IDF outpost near a Shiite village, and the question whether its residents are sympathetic to Israel sounds very irrelevant in this context. In the background, we listen to a transistor radio where Qol Yisra'el reports at length on yesterday's incident in which two IDF soldiers were killed a few kilometers east of the outpost as the crow flies. We enter the danger zone, and in the danger zone, everything changes: behavior, thinking, and talk. An interim balance of terrorist activities in south Lebanon since the beginning of March: five instances of gunfire at IDF and SLA [South Lebanese Army] outposts; the discovery of six powerful explosive devices; an attack on an SLA unit, in which two terrorists were killed, one was wounded, and one was taken captive; an attack on civilian vehicles, in which four Lebanese civilians were killed, an SLA soldiers was killed, and another soldier was kidnaped; gunfire at an IDF convoy, no casualties; the killing of three terrorists on their way to an attack and hostage taking in Israel; and the last two incidents -- a powerful explosive device which killed two IDF soldiers and katyushas at western Galilee. Brigadier General G., the sector commander, has lived with this data for many years. As an officer and a fighter who has accumulated thousands of Lebanon hours in various capacities in the area, he dismisses the matter as "that's life." And if there was no security zone, all this fire would have descended on the Galilee. The security zone is not the objective, it is a means for protecting the home front. For him, this means one thing: The Lebanon War is not over, it simply goes on in different ways everyday, every hour. And even though the events have diverted the limelights to Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza, to the Cave of the Patriarchs and Qiryat Arba', Lebanon has remained the same Lebanon, and a war is under way in the security zone in which IDF troops confront a determined, ruthless, fanatical, and uncompromising enemy whose methods are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, and as much as we dislike the thought, whose performance has been improving as well. The fog disperses, and the soldiers are still there, bundled in their flak jackets, their helmets pushed low on their heads, their guns loaded, and their senses keen. After receiving brief instructions, they start moving. A finger on the trigger, eyes scanning each crevice, each wadi, each roadside stone. G., the sector intelligence officer, is familiar with each curve and stone. Each place has its own story. Here, he says, is where an Islamic Jihad squad fired at a unit which was moving on the axis. Five soldiers were wounded. The Beaufort looms in the background. As in the past, it is still the source of serious trouble. Not long ago, terrorists fired Sagger missiles at an IDF convoy. Fortunately, they missed. And there have been infiltration attempts. This sector abuts on Misgav 'Am and Margaliyyot, both of which had been marked by terrorists as favorite targets. Since Operation Accountability, however, the terrorists moved their operations into the security zone. The operation generated an odd understanding between Israel and Hizballah, namely that they can play with fire only inside the security zone. And that zone is Hizballah's home field. Hizballah personnel are intimately acquainted with the terrain, they enjoy the support of large sectors of the Lebanese population. They get their weapons and money from Iran, and they have learned how to work, too: They gather intelligence, keep observation posts, acquire experience in routine tasks, and hit where it hurts. The peace process and the new reality of the recent months have created a convenient ground for Hizballah's operations in that south Lebanon residents have become uncertain whether Israel would withdraw in the wake of the peace agreement. The resident's confusion grew in the wake of the understanding between Israel and Syria and Hizballah at the conclusion of Operation Accountability. They felt that by tolerating terrorist activities in the security zone -- provided Hizballah refrain from attacking Israel's north -- Israel was disowning them. Because of this, cracks opened in Israel's hold on the local population. The cracks have been filled by Hizballah. It has commands in villages, its fighters blend in with the population, and it uses these villages as launching pads for its operations. The availability of Saggers permits them long-distance operations. They concentrate in villages beyond the security zone, in an area which has been termed "the gray zone." From there, they fire and launch attacks on SLA outposts. They direct their activities mainly against the SLA, attacking and trying to take outposts, firing at convoys, killing, and kidnapping. Population centers -- mainly Christian -- are another target for the terrorists' katyushas, mortars, and Saggers. Hizballah makes an effort to abide by its understandings with Israel. Brig. Gen. G. says that when katyushas landed in the Galilee Panhandle about a month ago, the organization took the trouble to convey a message to the IDF that it had had no part in the event. Yet their activity against Israel has been replaced by attacks in south Lebanon, which are dealt with a vengeance. Brig. Gen. G. arrives at an IDF outpost to speak to soldiers and officers of a Golani Brigade company. In fact, he is here to check whether the soldiers are prepared for the activities awaiting them, are aware of their importance, and have adopted all the measures to protect themselves. "As you march forward," Brig. Gen. G. tells them, "look back at Misgav 'Am and Margaliyot, and you will understand what you are defending." These guys, however, need no instigation. They truly believe they are doing an important job. They have been in Lebanon before and have paid a heavy price. Seven of their colleagues were killed in a clash with terrorists a few months ago. The image of their dead friends haunt all of them whenever they go out on an operation. They know Hizballah well. Sergeant Menashe Rajwan, a veteran fighter, knows that they attack at dawn. To avoid surprises he wakens his soldiers early in the morning and urges them to take positions "so they are not caught with their pants down." Activities in the outpost include patrols, lookouts, and other initiated operations that cannot be detailed. The young soldiers proudly bear this heavy load. According to them, their activities are not meant to totally prevent terrorist attacks, since absolute success does not exist, but their presence is definitely a deterrent. "Every time we go out on patrol," says Menashe, "we look for mines, explosive charges, and terrorists about to attack us. Many dangers loom here. The bombs they plant can blow you to pieces." Menashe, just like the rest of his colleagues, treats Hizballah with respect. As far as he is concerned, Hizballah is not just a gang of terrorists but a real army, well-trained and organized. "I fight soldiers, although it is easier to define them as terrorists. My mother thinks I fight kaffiyeh-clad men who shout Allahu Akbar [Allah Is Great]. That is not correct, they are soldiers. And it is my duty as a soldier to kill any soldier or terrorist who is my enemy," Menashe asserts. A sign hangs in the room of the company commander, Lieutenant Ofeq Bukharis: "The Goal -- Security to the Northern Settlements." So that these settlements may enjoy security, says G., we must live here with insecurity and cope with a long series of threats. Ofeq has such a list, a list of terror. However, he trusts his soldiers and the IDF's firepower. As far as he is concerned, the terrorists are a threat that must be tackled but they do not threaten Israel's physical existence and, consequently, there is no sense in getting all worked up about them. "The sacrifice we made, seven of our soldiers-friends killed, is a pain we carry in our hearts. It follows us everywhere. However, it does not discourage the guys who do their work well and professionally." We asked Ofeq whether he agrees with the chief of staff, who described the situation in south Lebanon as a war. Ofeq is used to being asked this question, and he promptly shoots back an answer: "In Lebanon, everything is quiet until something happens. It is a miniature war, a local war. When something happens there is a big to-do, but when it is all over calm prevails again." Nevertheless, Ofeq also knows that this calm is illusionary and that events in the field get the soldiers' adrenaline racing. The talk stops abruptly when Ofeq is urgently summoned to the war room. Katyushas have just landed in the western Galilee. The company goes into high alert, and everybody takes positions. Radios click away. The sound of rifles being bolted can be heard in the lookout positions. Small talk and joking stop at once. Everybody tenses up. Menashe Rajwan tells us: "We are Israel's feet. Without the IDF in the security zone, Israel could not walk. The northern settlements would not live in peace and everybody's life would be disrupted. Although soldiers get killed, the bottom line is there have been no infiltrations into our territory for a long time and I know that I am doing an important job." [Walter] "Did the loss of seven colleagues not affect the performance of the soldiers?" [Rajwan] "We have all changed our perception since then. Guys who once itched to encounter terrorists no longer want it. They say they are afraid of losing friends. They do not fear what will happen to them. After all, everybody feel immortal. What they fear is what will happen to their friends, that they might lose them." Activity in the outpost returns to normal after it turns out that the katyushas caused no damage. The guys persistently continue to ask when the supply convoy is due to arrive. All staples were removed from the kitchen in anticipation of Passover, and they are now waiting for kosher food. Meanwhile, G. gathers the soldiers and asks them to offer suggestions on what needs improvement. Reservists join the meeting. Most of them are married and have children and, as a result, fear plays a bigger role with them. They are afraid of mortar shells and katyushas falling on their living quarters and ask for additional protection. The greatest fear is posed by the Sagger missiles. "We heard on the radio that two soldiers were killed, and that is frightening," Norberto Gruenstadt, a mechanical engineer from Karmi'el tells me. "It is scarier here at night. We are scared to go out, we are scared of Saggers and katyushas. The terrorists have learned to use Saggers, and they are extremely accurate. They see a light, aim, and shoot. What can we do? We dim the lights. We are careful and watch our step. Beyond that, we can only hope they will miss. To me, this is a new feeling. I have served in the territories so far, and the feeling there is different. However tough it may get, you are in control. Here, you just sit and wait." Roni Merom from Haifa describes days of fear, as he puts it. He is mainly talking about rainy days, when everything is dark and the clouds seem to hang over one's head. "Vision is limited, you sit with a magazine in the barrel of your rifle and feel scared. On the other hand, I know that if there is an attack people will act properly. Although there is that certainty, you do not forget for a moment that you are in Lebanon, and Lebanon is not Gaza." Meanwhile, the supply convoy arrives. At long last they will be able to get a hot meal. More than satisfying the immediate need to quash their hunger, the convoy brings the soldiers smells from home. They will most probably spend the Passover dinner in this outpost, and the sweet wine somehow brings their homes here. Amir Nisan from Petah Tiqva constantly thinks about home and about ways to calm his worried parents. Whenever an incident is reported on the radio, he rushes to phone home to assure his parents that he is all right. The families, he says, pay the highest price. They are consumed by worry. Many soldiers here cannot phone home, which kills their parents. I know guys who do not tell their parents where they are stationed. They say they are somewhere in Israel, and on their way home on leave they hide their flak jackets and steel helmets so that mom and dad will not find out their secret. Things look different from there. When you are part of it, the business somehow looks less awful. The danger exists, but it is not all that tangible. The surrounding quiet gives you an artificial sense of security, and the knots you felt in your stomach on the way here gradually disappear. Something in this outpost and in the SLA outposts along the front lines gives you the feeling that the terrorists will not fail to penetrate this defense line. However, the reality is that the SLA soldiers are the first to be hit by the fire. The guys call them the IDF's flak jacket. Indeed, the SLA is nothing more than a flak jacket. It can curb, but it cannot prevent attacks. Moreover, the guys know that the SLA was conceived as a necessary evil. Lebanese men join its ranks because it is clear to them that if they do not keep the terrorists away their lives will become intolerable. IDF commanders praise them, say that they do a good job. Nevertheless, they are just a flak jacket, not the chief weapon. The main factor is the IDF, which shoulders most of the responsibility. Without the IDF's backing, the SLA would not survive. First Lieutenant Sha'ul, commander of a tank company, tells us the story of how he rushed to help SLA troops in the Shomriyot [placename as published] area when they were attacked by waves of Hizballah men. The SLA soldiers stood up to them like men, but they still needed the IDF's help. Sha'ul arrived and opened fire. Many terrorists were killed, and those who were not hit escaped. "Only here you feel that you are defending your country. When you see the lights of Misgav 'Am at night, you sense how important it is." Brig. Gen. G. again gathers the soldiers for a final talk. He tells them about thousands of hikers who will be swarming the north during the Passover holiday, as if they did not know. "You are an excellent response to the threats," the senior officer praises them and wishes them a happy holiday. Here and now, in an outpost crisscrossed by communications canals, overlooking the horizon beyond which the terrorists are hiding, with the Beaufort Castle in the north and Misgav 'Am in the back, his blessing sounds very significant. Commander of the Northern Command: It Is A Fight, Not A War Major General Yitzhaq Mordekhay, commander of the Northern Command, rushed back and forth that day between the landing site of the katyushas and the funeral of a soldier who was killed in an incident in south Lebanon the previous day. The complexity of the activities and the intensity of the events take up almost his entire day. He works around the clock. Ever since he took the job, about three years ago, he has only taken four days leave. And even then he had no choice, he had to move to a new house. He describes the situation in Lebanon as a "fight," not a war. A continuous fight that may never end. The IDF, he says, operates in a harsh terrain opposite terrorist organizations that will stop at nothing. This state of affairs gives the terrorists an edge over a regular army. The IDF -- and this is no secret -- has a hard time obtaining intelligence information about these organizations, but nevertheless it manages to impair and thwart a large part of their activities. This exacts its toll in blood. The price is painful and steep, but this is a reality that has been forced on us, Mordekhay says. [Walter] "Do you hold Syria responsible for these activities?" [Mordekhay] "There is no doubt that if the Syrians so wanted, they could significantly decrease the activities of Hizballah and the rejectionist organizations. The fact is that ever since the understandings attained in the wake of Operation Accountability there have hardly been any katyusha attacks on the Galilee." Later in the evening, the general receives a report about an incident in which two IDF soldiers were wounded, presumably by our own soldiers. Units drill safety regulations every day but accidents happen, which are apparently part of the price such complex activities exact. The general found some solace in a bar mitzvah party in Qiryat Shemona. A boy whose father was killed by a katyusha during Operation Accountability turned 13, and Gen. Mordekhay organized a party for him. The boy's family is poor, and the general took it under his wing. Although keeping in contact with the northern settlements is part of his duties, Gen. Mordekhay does not conceal the fact that this is one duty he loves very much.
