Landouald Ndasingwa, the minister of social affairs, was absent although he was supposed to be present. There must be a good reason for this. There are many reasons for the visit. Reports say that President Habyarimana may have gone to Uganda to ask Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, to help him make the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] accept the decisions of the interparty meeting that President Habyarimana chaired. It has been said that, after his visit to Uganda, President Habyarimana will go to Tanzania with the same message. The decisions that he wants the RPF to accept are known to you. The parties rejected them but later accepted them after being terrorized and after becoming afraid of experiencing what happened to their friend [Felicien Gatabazi] who had just been killed. To us, it is clear that Habyarimana and his henchmen want to maintain the status quo. They are doing everything possible to torpedo the Arusha agreement. [passage omitted] Terrorism forced the parties to agree to the plans. Even the Liberal Party accepted to sacrifice the rights of deputies who had been elected by the people so that President Habyarimana could give them peace at last. Now it is said that the purpose of his visit is to ask the Ugandan president to help him convince the RPF. This is a hard job for him because the terrorism he has been using on other parties will have no effect on the RPF. It is clear now in our country that there are two opposing groups of parties. On one side, there is President Habyarimana's bloc comprising the Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development [MRND] and others who want to keep the status quo and want to forcefully obtain laws that give them advantages while those who have the interests of the country at heart are thrown aside. On the other side, there is the RPF and other parties, which want to have democracy in Rwanda and laws that benefit the entire country. That is why they want the Arusha agreement be respected fully, so that people's rights are respected such as the right of being elected. [passage omitted]
