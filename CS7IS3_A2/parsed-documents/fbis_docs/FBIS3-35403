Muslim Infighting in Afghanistan 7. Islamic States and Bosnia-Herzegovina GRAND IMAM ON DIALOGUE IN ISLAM In its 15 February, the state-owned weekly 'AQIDATI publishes on page 3 an 800-word article by Grand Imam of al-Azhar His Eminence Shaykh Jad-al-Haqq 'Ali Jad-al-Haqq, in which he writes about the ethics of dialogue in Islam. Citing the Koranic verse " Invite all to the way of thy Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching and argue with them in ways that are best and most gracious," he explains that preaching is meant for those who are already bound by the right principles, while arguing is usually used with those who disagree with one's ideas and tend to use rough or aggressive language in voicing their differences. Imam Jad-al-Haqq remarks that "violent language is unnecessary and fruitless, because it hurts the feelings and spoils amity." He notes that choosing the right word or expression can sometimes solve problems. ENDING THE BOYCOTT WITH ISRAEL A 100-word report on page 3 cites the grand imam as he emphasizes that "it is inevitable to maintain all types and forms of Arab economic and trade boycott of Israel until full withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories, primarily Jerusalem and al-Aqsa Mosque, is achieved." Citing Imam Jad-al-Haqq's interview with AL-ITTIHAD newspaper of the United Arab Emirates, the report adds that the imam pointed out that "Israel's history shows that it has not honored a pledge or respected a promise. Therefore, calling for or demanding the abolition of economic and trade boycotts with it before full withdrawal from all the lands it occupies is impermissible and improper, and also a grave mistake." SOCIAL SOLIDARITY IN ISLAM A 2,500-word report on page 4 gives an account of a seminar 'AQIDATI held in the Anas Ibn-Malik Mosque in the city of Suez under the banner of "Fasting and Social Solidarity." After discussing social solidarity in Islam, particularly in the fasting month of Ramadan, speakers answer the audience' questions. Asked if there is hope to extend social solidarity to Muslims around the world, particularly in Bosnia-Herzegovina, al-Azhar Professor Fathi Mihriz replies that all Muslims should hasten to give a hand to brothers in Bosnia-Herzegovina if they get the chance. Chief editor al-Sayyid 'Abd-al-Ra'uf blames all Muslims for what is happening in the Muslim world today, because "they have deviated from the correct understanding of Islam, lived in a trance and in superstitions that have no link with or root in religion, and let Europe advance in science and take the reins of the world." Asked what 'AQIDATI does to confront the communists and secularists who attack Islam from within, 'Abd-al-Ra'uf says: "We are being subjected to a fierce campaign from the secularists and communists to whom the doors of some newspapers and magazines, some of which belong to the government, were opened." He reiterates that 'AQIDATI has a clear and obvious role in fighting ignorance and superstitions, as well as those who fight Islam. ON THE KORAN AND HOSTILE CURRENTS Page 10 features a 1,500-word report on remarks Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali made at "The Opera Cultural Salon" on 14 February regarding anti-Islamic currents and their possible impact on Koran and tradition. At the beginning, al-Ghazali stressed that "there is no fear for Koran and tradition from the anti-Islamic currents, because the Almighty will guard His message against corruption." He affirms that "the Koran and tradition will stay in spite of the secularists." Al-Ghazali attributes the Islamic nation's weakness and its political, economic, and social defeats to many causes, including "the misunderstanding of the Koran and tradition and the failure to observe and examine narrations thoroughly." The problem is how to promote your Islam since you did not adhere to it or apply it accurately, he said. He added that Muslims are fighting two battles: One against the terrorist movements that have wrongly been attributed to Islam and the second against the allegations of the "secular enlighteners" who refuse to see that "Islam is an enlightened intellectual movement that urges the people to learn their religion correctly and draw evidence from the universe." He stressed that the nation can never accept the view that the revelation is an obsolete concept, that the Koran is an Arabic literary text, or that the Prophet's tradition is inapplicable. Dr. Ahmad Kamal Abu-al-Majd remarked that the nation is experiencing discord and disagreement and that some groups belittle thought and make their own rulings that forbid everything. He asks al-Ghazali why such groups appeared and how their thought can be rectified. He answers that the cause lies in the fact that Islamic culture is being presented in a fake image that is full of contradictions. This has led to differences that have affected the thought of the religious youth. Therefore, he stresses the need for cleansing the Islamic culture of all the old delusions and germs implanted in it. RELIGIOUS VERSUS ENLIGHTENING BOOKS In a 200-word article on page 18, columnist Mamduh al-'Ashri criticizes Dr. Samir Sarahn, chairman of the Public Book Authority, for expressing his view on a television program that "Islamic books discount the brainpower of youth and their low prices adversely affected other books on display in the fair." The columnist wonders how such a statement can get past the censor, as it casts doubt on facts stated in the Koran. Al-'Ashri is surprised that Sarhan says this while "licentious books and pornographic magazines fill the fair's corridors." These books not only contradict Islam, but also the Egyptian people's customs and tradition, he remarks. He notes that religious books were the most expensive at the fair, while the other so-called enlightening books were the cheapest. Nonetheless, he adds, more than 15 million Egyptian pounds worth of religious books were sold at the fair. Wondering what "those people" have against the honorable al-Azhar, which represents pure Islam which is the official religion of the country, al-'Ashri notes that the Vatican, "Rome's pride," banned Madonna's book and no one dared to object because the Vatican is a symbol of religion. How can we allow ourselves to talk against al-Azhar, which stands for Islam, he asks. Touching on the same subject, Ibrahim Nasr writes a 150-word article on page 23 in which he talks about "the high voices that express concern over the numerous booklets that talk about torture in the grave and bliss in paradise--which they call after-death imaginings--and claim that these booklets discount the brainpower of youth." Nasr is surprised that it is these same voices that demand freedom of expression and of the press and are responsible for publishing the "impolite" books which were confiscated and banned from circulation by the law. He asks: What freedom do they want: Freedom of thought or of disbelief? MUSLIM INFIGHTING IN AFGHANISTAN Chairman of the Board Samir Rajab writes in his 350-words column on page 1 that the warring factions in Afghanistan broke the Ramadan cease-fire agreement in just a few days. He remarks that the mujahidin who filled the world with talk about their jihad are proving day after day that all they ever thought of was their personal interests and their lust for power. Rajab regrets that "the communist rule in Afghanistan was more stable and secure and more protective of people's lives." It is true that it had many shortcomings and gaps, but, on the other hand, it did not allow that infinite bloodletting, he says. He argues that that was the cat and mouse game between America and the former Soviet Union. The two came out intact, letting the naive Afghan fall into a bottomless pit, he says, adding: Russia has cashed in its chips, letting America take all the loot, not only in that region but in the whole world. Meanwhile, the miserable mujahidin are finishing themselves off with their own hands, he says. In conclusion, Rajab expresses his surprise that "other people have sealed their minds off, refusing to learn from the Afghan experience. The result is more blood, more destruction, and ruin." It is true that one man's poison is another's meat, he remarks. ISLAMIC STATES AND BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA A 150-word report by Jamal Salim, page 20, says that the World Islamic Council for Call and Relief has issued a statement "condemning the massacres to which Sarajevo Muslims were subjected. The statement appeals to Arab and Islamic governments and people to adopt strict measures, particularly the severance of diplomatic and cultural ties with Serbia and the states that support it, primarily Russia and Greece, and the expulsion of these states' ambassadors from Islamic capitals." The report adds that the council called on Islamic people, political and party institutions, trade unions, and other economic, trade, cultural, and tourist centers "to boycott the Yugoslav companies and freeze all dealings with them." The statement also called on the Islamic states to adopt a political and military plan to lift the ban on arming Bosnia-Herzegovina, set up a world popular court to punish the Serbian criminals, and collect donations for Bosnian Muslims. The statement finally calls on Islamic states "not to recognize the geographic and demographic changes imposed by the brutal Serbian power." Basyuni al-Halwani's 500-word column on page 6 criticizes Islamic states that content themselves with statements of denunciation and condemnation and watch the "Serbian criminals" as they demonstrate their malice for Islam and Muslims, desecrate the sanctities, and destroy lives. He says that the international community has proved that it protects the law of the jungle when it closed its eyes to the Serbian crimes for over two years and encouraged them with its inaction and negligence to liquidate the Islamic identity of Bosnia-Herzegovina. He regrets that despite the hideousness of the Serbian crimes, states like Russia uncovered their ugly faces, started to encourage the Serbians in their aggression, and hampered every attempt to restore peace to the region.
