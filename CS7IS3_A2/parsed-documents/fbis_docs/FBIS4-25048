Tian Fengshan, acting governor, and Ma Guoliang, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, were also present at the meeting. Yue Qifeng said: Harbin is our country's [words indistinct] city with a brilliant history. In the present reform and opening up, it is still very highly renown. Harbin has conditions for building itself into an international economic and trade city. However, it should also relatively make readjustments. First of all, it should emancipate the thinking and change the irrational industrial structure; second, it should be determined to readjust the production set-up and exert strenuous efforts to develop tertiary industry. Yue Qifeng stressed: Changing the city functions needs the enthusiasm from various sectors. In addition to boosting the enthusiasm of large and medium-sized enterprises, it is also necessary to give full play to the enthusiasm of small enterprises and let them enter the market. In this aspect, we should expand the functions of all districts and enable them to realistically become first-level organizations in an effort to promote the economic development of districts and neighborhoods. He said: The greater the hinterland a city has the more advantages it will have for its future development. So, Harbin must have good plans for developing what it intends to develop and so do its neighboring areas. Yue Qifeng pointed out: The future development lies in trained personnel and trained personnel lies in education. Harbin is a scientific, technological, educational, and cultural center, which should give play to the advantages of trained personnel and decontrol scientific research units and trained personnel. It must not be afraid of letting the knowledgeable people become prosperous ahead of others. It is necessary to formulate policies and actively develop nongovernmental scientific research organs in an effort to form new economic growing points. Yue Qifeng stressed at the end of this speech: Harbin has quite a number of large and medium-sized enterprises. The local government should support and serve large and medium-sized enterprises, and use their advantages to bring along the development of regional economy.
