Yegor Gaydar Tells Journalist Leonid Radzikhovskiy Why He Resigned"] [Text] [Radzikhovskiy] Yegor Timurovich, what do you feel? Relief? Disappointment? Concern? [Gaydar] You know, all those things together, everything at once. It was not a spontaneous decision, certainly not an "outburst of emotion." It was a considered political decision. At the same time I naturally had doubts until the final second. [Radzikhovskiy] You mentioned as reasons or, to be more accurate, grounds the decision on financial union with Belarus and the decision to allocate $500 million to construct the new parliament building. Was this the final straw? [Gaydar] No, this was not the reason nor even the grounds, it was more an example or sample of the grounds, of which a great many had accumulated. But, of course, the problem which we were discussing... [Radzikhovskiy] Discussing where? [Gaydar] In the bureau of the "Russia's Choice" faction in the Duma.... That problem is far more serious. In general, the alternative was this: Either I could stay on, using the opportunities provided by the post of first vice premier but at the same time increasingly serving as a screen for a policy with which I disagree, or I could ensure total political clarity at the price of losing my post. In recent weeks my real political scope within the cabinet had shrunk drastically. [Radzikhovskiy] To what do you attribute that? [Gaydar] Now we are coming to the most important question. Ultimately the isolated resignation of a minister or group of ministers is what is known as a "ministerial crisis" and is generally of interest only to a specific group of people -- the political elite, diplomats, bankers, and so on. But in our case the situation is different. This resignation is not an episode of "infighting behind the scenes." I see it as a manifestation of very important, very serious political and, if you like, historical trends. Social strata in our country are now in a powerful state of flux. And this resignation is an outward manifestation of this flux. There is a perfectly clear logic here. [Radzikhovskiy] Did it begin with your return to the government in September of last year? [Gaydar] No, I would say that it all began earlier, last summer. That was when we -- a group of reformers, people with a clear democratic orientation -- announced the creation of the "Russia's Choice" movement. Strategically several things were clear: The authorities are experiencing an extremely grave crisis that they cannot resolve "from within," they need powerful external support and an external fillip; the ideology of reform is losing support among the people and it is not proving possible to create a really broad socioeconomic stratum of "reform people"; we are on the threshold of another "stagnation of reform" with its most dangerous features -- inflation, a collapse in production, and so on. All this provides a breeding ground and forms a "culture" for real plague bacteria -- for fascism in Russia. Without whipping up passions, I can say that it is now impossible to imagine anything more terrible than this. So my main aim and the aim of my colleagues throughout this time has been the same: to do everything possible to halt the process. [Radzikhovskiy] Did you cope successfully with this task? [Gaydar] We sought various methods of solving the problem. It was obvious that the power crisis was mounting far faster than we could build our movement. Think back: Summer and then the early fall of last year were a period of a real leap in inflation and paralysis of power. The president-Supreme Soviet parallelism reached its zenith. The authorities began simply to skid on the spot like a car, and all that the "motor" did was fuel inflation. [Radzikhovskiy] All we were missing for total disaster was a mass fascist party.... [Gaydar] Yes, correct. Had there been such a popular party, it could easily have infiltrated itself into the gap between the president and the Supreme Soviet and could easily have steamrollered the Supreme Soviet (which was absolutely morally prepared for this) and seized power "legitimately" or otherwise. [Radzikhovskiy] And at this moment you received an offer to join the government. [Gaydar] I could not refuse. As you know, I was perfectly well aware of the role of "fireman for hopeless causes" that lay in store for me. I was perfectly well aware of how difficult it would be to curb inflation -- the economic mother of fascism. It was obvious that once I had done my job... [Radzikhovskiy] "The Moor can go"? [Gaydar] At any rate that there would be forces in the government that would want this. But at the time I thought in the following terms: Urgent measures must be taken simply to bring about an immediate improvement in the situation. Only once the political process had been somehow stabilized, a degree of controllability at least had been created in the country, and the spreading blaze of inflation had been extinguished would it be at all possible to hold elections and prepare and accumulate the forces for progress. [Radzikhovskiy] Which elements of this plan succeeded and which did not? [Gaydar] Everyone can plainly see the events, and everyone assesses them in their own way. In my view, it did nevertheless prove possible to smash the dyarchy, albeit at terrible cost (unfortunately it was smashed rather than rectified). One danger disappeared. The president played the main role here, of course. We, my colleagues (especially B. Fedorov) and myself, succeeded in breaking the trends in the inflationary process. On this the figures speak for themselves: In August inflation was running at 26 percent, in September 23 percent, in October 20 percent, in November 16 percent, and in December 13 percent. [Radzikhovskiy] Fedorov said that if this trend continued, it would be possible to bring inflation down to 5 percent by March or April. [Gaydar] Yes, I think this would have been entirely possible. [Radzikhovskiy] How did you manage this? [Gaydar] There is no secret here, nor any universal prescription. In September we immediately decided to halt the provision of soft loans. The mechanism is well known: Commercial banks and other structures receive huge sums from the state at low rates of interest and then either resell this money themselves at immeasurably higher rates or do something else with the "free" money and turn it to their own advantage. That is, thanks to soft loans billions and tens of billions of rubles are conjured up out of thin air, or to be more accurate out of the exchequer. Incidentally, this does not just do economic harm. This is also an extremely powerful source of corruption (after all, these "loans" are often granted in exchange for providing similar "interest-free loans" to the functionary who has "extracted" the loans). It is also a terrible source of "commercial depravity." This is often ignored -- to no avail. When money is made "out of nothing" -- whether by playing the casino or "playing the exchequer" -- this corrupts business itself. The "honest sweat" of business is devalued. What is the point in engaging in really difficult, tricky, and creative commercial activity (including finance) if it is all so simple? Get a soft loan and you have already achieved commercial results. There is a dangerous fusion of the financial and bureaucratic elites here. In addition, we got import subsidies ended. These subsidies were introduced when the ruble's exchange rate against the dollar was drastically understated. At the time this was justified. But since then the exchange rate had changed sharply; the purchasing power of the dollar in our market is now dozens of times lower than it was in 1991. Yet the import subsidies remained. Here the problems were the same as with the soft loans, there was the same "radioactive source" of corruption. The same ruining of the exchequer and provoking of inflation. [Radzikhovskiy] Are these the kind of measures that are described as "monetarism"? [Gaydar] If this is "monetarism," then what is "common sense"? I have long since realized that you cannot carry "political water" only in an "economic sieve." The elementary sensible, self-evident measures I have listed (and there were a whole series of others) are capable of halting and changing the process. But nevertheless they will not produce a radical change. There is a need for a powerful social, political will. If this is applied, if this bolsters a sensible economic policy, you get a regrouping of fundamental political forces, and then the crisis is soluble. But if this political will is lacking... [Radzikhovskiy] Then what happens is what is happening? [Gaydar] But political will is not the arbitrariness of an individual person. Under a democratic system the political will of the leader and government is the product of the political process, the product of voters' political will. No matter how imperfect the mechanism of universal and equal elections may be, it is the only method for the nonviolent resolution of social contradictions. In September 1993, when I joined the government, the plan was approximately as follows: To eliminate the most acute phase of the crisis through sensible economic and political moves; then to win the elections; to acquire powerful new political impetus on the basis of the elections; and, relying on this, to begin a new, decisively important stage in the reforms. I think we succeeded in carrying out the first part of the task. But we lost the elections. And the subsequent stages are stymied. Now we must pay for this. After the elections we lost a considerable proportion of our influence in the government. The government's policy began to change: First, many people think that the most acute stage of the crisis is over.... [Radzikhovskiy] And that means there is no further need for Gaydar? [Gaydar] And that means that I have no further unconditional moral need at any rate to remain in the government. But there is one more element of decisive importance. Our influence has declined largely under the influence of the voters' verdict. We are that part of the cabinet which has put itself and its policy before the voters' court. Our relative failure at the elections largely predetermined our withdrawal. I would say it predetermined the rationality and expediency of our withdrawal. And another thing. I know that there is a category of voters, perhaps not excessively versed in political subtleties, who argue more or less as follows: Yes, there is a danger of hyperinflation and of power moving toward imperial nationalism and so forth but as long as Gaydar is in the government that will not happen. I am far from exaggerating my own role, but there is that feeling among a certain part of the population. Gaydar in the government is a reassuring factor suggesting that "everything is within normal limits." So there is no longer this reassuring awareness. Let someone's brain start sounding alarm bells, that is far better than complacency. [Radzikhovskiy] How do you explain the failure at the elections? [Gaydar] I see the main reasons in the fact that so far we have not managed to create a powerful social class which consciously supports the reformist course. Enormous masses of people, the majority of the population, have adapted to the reforms, but they do not comprise the political aktiv of reformist policy. Enormous masses (up to 20-25 percent of the adult population, I believe) have started to live better and have been able to use the reforms, but they have not made up the political aktiv of a party of aware reformers. It is not only a matter of the living standard. People often ascribe their successes to themselves personally (and rightly so!) and their defeats to the system, for instance excessively high taxes on medium and small entrepreneurs. In other words: Today a new, powerful integrating political idea is needed. A political idea from the liberal and democratic camp and not Zhirinovskiy's so-called Liberal Democratic Party. [Radzikhovskiy] What new idea are you talking about? [Gaydar] I do not know how it should sound at the semantic level. I see its meaning approximately as follows. Economically, a stable society with low inflation and freedom and safety for economic activity. Purposeful efforts are needed to form a healthy middle class rooted in this land and proud of its country, its business, its prosperity, and its healthy Russian bourgeois nature. A bourgeois nature does after all include qualities like honesty, precision, responsibility, sobriety, and thrift. Economically we have done far from everything that is needed for that. There are means of really reducing taxes without creating enormous holes in the budget. The new democratic idea also has another side. At present our state cannot be considered democratic. Once again the ossification of bureaucracy is taking place. Once again the alienation of the state and its apparatus from the people has been intensified. The production of new "partymobiles" and 500 million on the construction of a palace for the Duma and so forth are only the tip of the iceberg, the small visible part of this process. And people, who are in fact democratically inclined, "took their revenge" for this at the elections. [Radzikhovskiy] They took their revenge on "Russia's Choice"? [Gaydar] Yes. I hope they were choosing the wrong target for their vengeance. But while we were in government, while we acted as the leaders of the "democratic nomenklatura," the voters were indeed unable to understand. In reality the "democratic nomenklatura" is to a tremendous extent a myth. The nomenklatura does not need to recruit the "broad masses" of democratic politicians and even demagogues. The nomenklatura largely remains as it was before. It has drawn back very slightly and swallowed up the "best" democratic cadres, absorbed them, and returned to its initial position. "The Neva was clothed in granite." There is an ethical and a political aspect here. If everything is clear ethically -- the "stone fundament of bureaucracy" is again outweighing the head of democracy -- then this does after all lead to political consequences. [Radzikhovskiy] The alliance of bureaucracy and corrupt capital under cover of fascist demagogy? [Gaydar] Absolutely right. That is the closed, rotten, truly "Weimar" atmosphere in which the terrible homunculi of fascism are born. If democrats today have no powerful new idea, those people always have an idea ready -- the idea of national grievance, national arrogance, a national inferiority complex reaching hysterical imperial proportions. [Radzikhovskiy] An ever-living and ever youthful idea. [Gaydar] But how to draw a clear boundary between national dignity and national hysteria? That is the question. I believe we must be the party of Russian national dignity -- the dignity of the Russian man's intelligence. A new state purge is a purge of bureaucratic arrogance, of bureaucratic cruelty and corruption, free enterprise, the opportunity for honest, dignified life and labor -- that is what a Russian resurrection is. We must explain that the resurrection of hatred is the resurrection of scoundrels, adventurists, and aggressors. That is the "Russophobia" they seek everywhere except in the mirror. [Radzikhovskiy] And you need a free hand to build such a party? [Gaydar] Unless the democratic movement is consolidated, the slide toward fascism about which we were speaking will become reality. Palace intrigues, corruption, populism, and saber-rattling combine here. A terrible cocktail! If it is used to poison the people there will be a real catastrophe which all the horror which Russia has experienced will pale beside. I know that this cannot be stopped either by bureaucratic methods or by purely economic edicts or by parliamentary fighting. We must use all these methods but the main thing nonetheless is a mass-based democratic movement. A party. [Radzikhovskiy] And this party's attitude toward the president? [Gaydar] We support the president. We must return the president's link with the people, return Yeltsin to Yeltsin, if you like. The president has been strong through his openness to the broad masses of society. That must be restored. [Radzikhovskiy] Yegor Timurovich, but do you see yourself as a "pure" politician and as a leader and creator of a party? The squabbling, the minor and petty ambitions, the empty talk -- will you withstand all this inevitable prosaic aspect of party life? [Gaydar] We are only beginning and you are already frightening me.... As long as I have a sensible goal and understand that we are not wasting our efforts, that we are doing what I believe in, albeit slowly, albeit in zigzags, then, of course, I shall pull this cart as best I can.
