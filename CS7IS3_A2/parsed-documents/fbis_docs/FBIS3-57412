As you know, Fedorov refused to join the reorganized government on 20 January, saying he would only stay on as Finance Minister if Vice Premier Zaveryukha and the head of the Central Bank, Viktor Gerashchenko, left the Cabinet of Ministers. Boris Fedorov declined the invitation to stay on as Minister of Finance in the reorganized government, justifying his refusal on the grounds that Boris Yeltsin's offer to him was made without regard for the conditions which Fedorov put forward. Boris Yeltsin has accepted Boris Fedorov's resignation.
