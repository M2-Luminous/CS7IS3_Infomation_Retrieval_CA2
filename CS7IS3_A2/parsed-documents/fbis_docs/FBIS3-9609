The demonstration of power of the enemy artillery on the Brcko plain in the absence of any attempts of infantry breakthroughs over the last few days reveals another chronic problem of the aggressor -- lack of manpower and low morale. According to our reliable sources, the chetnik soldiers on temporarily occupied Brcko territory, who have long been refusing to go to the front lines or into attacks, are now demanding that their commanders walk in front of them, because their commanders, infected with a feverish desire for military rank and prestige, have been marching them across minefields to satisfy their own ambitions.
