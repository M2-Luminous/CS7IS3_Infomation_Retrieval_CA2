The Kidnapped Chief of the Rukh Secretariat Has Not Been Found Yet"] [Excerpts] The election campaign in Ukraine, with the abundance of aspirants for deputy seats, could not do without manifestations of extremism. And its first victim has been one of the most powerful political parties -- the Ukrainian People's Rukh with a fixed membership of more than 50,000, which has fielded candidates in practically all constituencies. The Rukh Secretariat's press department reported that overnight from 15 to 16 January an armed attack was launched on the secretariat building. [passage omitted] The central event of that night was the disappearance of Mikhail Boychishin, 43, head of the Rukh Secretariat, deputy of the Lvov Oblast Council and Rukh's parliament deputy candidate, who left three hours before the attack but never got home. [passage omitted] Rukh leader and parliament deputy Vyacheslav Chornovil told NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent that "we are dealing here with a system of political provocations and political terror with the only aim being the disruption of the normal conduct of the election campaign and the intimidation of Rukh members and voters." [passage omitted] The actions by the authorities were glaringly passive. It was not until Vyacheslav Chornovil's energetic intervention that the police, prosecution, and security service bodies started an investigation into Boychishin's disappearance. [passage omitted] Ivan Makar, a Rukh critic, former human rights activist and currently an independent member of parliament, holds a different opinion on what has happened. In his view, there has been a political provocation. "In all likelihood, Rukh itself has organized this in order to gain extra points in the elections. Whoever needed to seize Boychishin in the Rukh building when he could have been easily captured near his home?" Ivan Makar said. It should be noted that his view is apparently shared by representatives of other Ukrainian political parties which are in no hurry to issue statements in support of Rukh activists.
