The village of Bohetaikeli in Shufu county has been known far and wide since 1952 when Chairman Mao responded to a letter from its peasants. In January 1994 General Secretary Jiang Zemin wrote another letter in reply to the peasants there. Abulaidi Amudurexiti and Amudun Niyaz made a special trip to the village to read out General Secretary Zemin 's response, making the village a focal hot spot. In recent years, endless streams of people have gone there to visit, travel, or do business. To accelerate the economic growth of the entire village, in 1993 the peasants there collected funds to repair a rural road which requires a total of 680,000 yuan. Beyond the 400,000 yuan which the peasants collected, another 280,000 yuan is needed. During this people's congress, Abulaidi Amudurexiti will take the village peasants' reply letter to the communications office of the autonomous region for the chairman. After the leadership of the office studies it and comes to a decision, it will disburse to the village 280,000 yuan to help the peasants repair the road as soon as possible.
