FBIS4-19758 "drweu078_o_94002" FBIS-WEU-94-078 Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 CYPRUS Denktas Seeks Correction Denktas Seeks Correction TA2104185294 Nicosia Bayrak Radio in Turkish 1530 GMT 21 Apr 94 TA2104185294 Nicosia Bayrak Radio Turkish BFN [Text] President Rauf Denktas has stated that the Turkish Cypriot side is in favor of the continuation of the negotiations and added: Nevertheless, the Turkish Cypriot side is constantly accused of proposing new ideas. Denktas indicated that the issue would have been solved a long time ago if the essentials submitted by the Turkish side in the letters of 20 and 28 January had not been changed. Denktas met with Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's assistant special representative in Cyprus, once more today. Ozker Ozgur, state minister and deputy prime minister; Ahmet Atay Rasit, foreign affairs minister and defense minister; Ministerial Under Secretary Ozer Koray; and presidential advisers Necati Munir Ertekun and Ergun Olgun participated in the meetings. During the meeting Gustave Feissel was accompanied by John Paul Cavanaugh. In statements he issued prior to and after the meetings, Denktas said that the difficulties encountered in the negotiations stem from the changes that were made in the confidence-building measures and that the Turkish side, who wants these changes to be rectified, is being accused of constantly proposing new ideas. Explaining that the issues that need to be changed -- Maras [Varosha] and the Lefkosa [Nicosia] International Airport -- are vital issues for the Turkish side, Denktas said that it is unacceptable that a first-degree military area like Maras should be demilitarized. Denktas said: We want satisfaction regarding equality and coexistence. Denktas said that the compromises to the Turkish side should not be in word but in action. Answering reporters' questions after the meeting, Feissel said that they had discussed the recent week's developments with Denktas and that they would meet once again on Wednesday. Feissel said that, together with special representative Joe Clark, he would hold contacts in Athens and Ankara and that they would return to Cyprus next week. In answer to a question, Feissel reiterated the view that an agreement may be reached by the end of April, but that positive answers both from Kliridhis and Denktas were needed to achieve this.
