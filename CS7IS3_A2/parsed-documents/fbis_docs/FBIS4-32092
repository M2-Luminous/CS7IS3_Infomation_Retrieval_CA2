Three "generals" of the present Slovak Army were presented to the public there, two of whom are women! The first is ZUZANA [Slovak form of "Susanne"], the second DANA, and the third is Rocket Launcher--Model 70. It is self-evident that we are talking about arms systems in our Army's arsenal, among which "Sue," a self-propelled cannon howitzer, is the absolute hit. A lot of praise has been heaped on it at all international exhibitions at which it has been presented lately. The 155-mm caliber, the very caliber that is also used by NATO armies, and the range of 40 kilometers, a distance for which air reconnaissance is required, place this weapon among the leading ranks in the world at present. This is also confirmed by the preliminary price of 30 million korunas [Sk], or $1 million (for potential foreign customers), per unit. Of course, this price is based on the assumption that we will be able to produce at least 100 pieces a year and that production starts immediately! Waiting in this area means waiting for bankruptcy. India alone has shown interest in 400 of these howitzers.... And other interested parties are legion. The second "general" is ZUZANA's predecessor, a 152-mm self-propelled cannon howitzer, model 77, code named "DANA." Its range is "only" 20 kilometers, but, during its presentation, one's ears, though plugged, were ringing handsomely. The assertion seems to be true that it may be enough to erect 10 to 20 of these monsters at the battlefield to deafen the enemy troops. They cost about Sk10 million apiece. The 122-mm rocket launcher, model 70, is mounted on a Tatra 813 chassis and equipped with 40 rockets (known as improved "katushas" [World War II Soviet-made rocket launchers]). Its range is also approximately 20 kilometers, but its price is a mere Sk7.5 million. However, a single shot costs up to Sk20,000! [passage omitted] As is to be seen, Slovak arms manufacturers are beginning to recover from the woeful heritage of conversion imposed by Havel and to return to markets from which they had been pushed out by the so-called humanitarian ethics of federal policy, which pharisaically applied only to Slovakia.... [Bratislava SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA in Slovak on 18 June on page 3 carries a 150-word "r"-attributed report entitled "Targeted on Howitzers." According to the report, in a statement provided to SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA, Colonel Tomas Svec, chief of the Public Relations Department at the Army Command of the Slovak Republic, corrected the information contained in the above report as follows: "The Zuzana self-propelled cannon howitzer is not in the arsenal of the Army of the Slovak Republic. The Army intends, however, to introduce it into its arsenal, as was also stated at Jelsava by the commander of the Army of the Slovak Republic. The information about Zuzana's price (Sk30 million) is also incorrect. This price is a very rough estimate from January 1993, when there was no experience with the development and production of such a high-quality combat system. The actual price is quite different."]
