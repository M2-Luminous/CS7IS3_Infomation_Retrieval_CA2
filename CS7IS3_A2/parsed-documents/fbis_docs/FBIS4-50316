In a statement issued at the end of the 30th African Development Bank (ADB) and 21st African Development Fund (ADF) annual meetings in Nairobi, temporary governor for the People's Bank of China Yin Jieyan said that Africa's development relies on the unremitting endeavours by the governments and peoples of African states, but the international community also bears a significant responsibility for this. Yin Jieyan, who is also the head of the Chinese delegation attending the meetings which started officially on Wednesday [11 May], said the founding of the ADB embodies the aspirations of the African people in pursuing economic independence. Yin Jieyan said ADB in the past 30 years has surmounted various difficulties in her efforts to promote the industrial and agricultural development on the African Continent, to improve the living standard of the African people, and to enhance the close cooperation among its member countries. He noted that for promoting the economic development in Africa, the ADB had adopted positive policies, including forest development and population control. Referring to difficulties the African countries are facing in economic development, Yin Jieyan said Africa has been developing at a low speed for several years, the balance of payments has shown a sustained deficit, the terms of trade have been deteriorating further, the debt service ratio has exceeded 25 percent in several consecutive years. Other difficulties include the natural disasters and trade protectionism of the Western countries, he said. On China's commitment to the African Continent, the head of Chinese delegation said while developing her domestic economy, China has never forgotten her duty to support Africa's economic development. "China is ready to continue making due contributions to Africa's economic development through the ADB and ADF, which we consider the most important financial institutions in Africa," he added.
