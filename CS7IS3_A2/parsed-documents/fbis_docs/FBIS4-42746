Are you still as committed a supporter of membership as you were? [Carlsson] The answer is yes. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] Was the package that emerged from the membership negotiations largely as you expected? [Carlsson] Yes. It was more or less what I had been expecting. I think that the government handled the negotiations well. On the decisive issues we were in close contact. But it did end up a little expansive. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] It could be you who has to find the money -- around 20 billion a year. How is this to be done? [Carlsson] It is a lot of money, but put it in the perspective of what unemployment costs. More than 40 billion a year in cash support alone! Twice as much as the EU membership fee. Since I view membership as a major opportunity to combat unemployment, it is my assessment that if we pursue sensible policies we will more than get our money back. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] But the membership fee has to be financed out of a budget that already has a deficit of 200 billion. Will you make savings or will you raise taxes? [Carlsson] It is our view that production should chiefly bear the cost since it is production that will chiefly benefit from membership, but we have not discussed this fully. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] The money we get back goes to farmers among others, and there seems to be a Social Democratic idea of increasing real estate taxes for farmers. [Carlsson] I do not want to say anything other than that production must meet the cost. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] If we were to summarize your approach it is an unreserved yes to membership in the European Union? [Carlsson] Yes. Now we know the terms, and my recommendation to the congress will be that we should say yes to the package that emerged from the negotiations. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] And it is you assessment that the congress will say yes? [Carlsson] That is my assessment and it is of course important for me that that is the outcome. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] You have two major tasks as party leader: regaining government power and getting a yes in the referendum. Do you see any link between the two? [Carlsson] I myself will push the yes line whether we win or lose the election. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] But surely it would be a position of strength to be able to push that line in government? [Carlsson] Yes, it is probable that people will listen more to me as prime minister than as leader of the opposition and as a loser. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] Do you believe that a continuation of a nonsocialist government will benefit the no side in the referendum? [Carlsson] If I may be allowed to engage in some polemic, I would say that first Bildt frightened off the supporters of the EU in the Social Democratic Party by linking the EU issue with Moderate policies. Now he is frightening off his own people as a result of the thoroughly foolish treatment of Bjorn von der Esch [Moderate Riksdag deputy removed from party list for his opposition to the EU], which I think is damaging the yes side. If we were having the referendum in two weeks, as Bildt suggested, I would be very worried. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] How should those Social Democrats who want a no to the EU vote in the Riksdag elections? Can they vote for you? [Carlsson] Of course. I have committed myself to voting no in the Riksdag if there is a no in the referendum. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] You have just said that your chances of winning sympathy for a yes vote would increase if you became prime minister. Then surely a Social Democratic opponent of the EU should vote for Carl Bildt? [Carlsson] As Social Democrats people must make up their minds about whether or not Social Democratic policies are to be pursued, either inside or outside the EU. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] If you win the Riksdag election and there is a yes in the referendum you will be the man who speaks for Sweden when the EU considers reforms in 1996. There are two approaches. One wants to deepen the EU with greater integration and more majority decisions. The other approach wants to water down the EU and strengthen the right of veto. Where do you stand in this debate? [Carlsson] I am not on the British side, which wants to water down the EU. The British Conservatives want as little politics as possible in the EU. This is a neoliberal position. I want to join Europe because I want to be involved in shaping European policy. Whether on unemployment, environmental policy, or the social dimension. If you want to achieve anything, political decisiveness is needed in Europe. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] So you do not want to strengthen the right of veto? [Carlsson] No, I do not think so. On the contrary, we should give consideration to extending majority decisions in the fields of environmental policy and social issues, for example. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] So a Sweden ruled by the Social Democrats will not help to water down the EU? [Carlsson] No, I do not think so. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] In 1996 the EU will reach a decision on joint defenses. What position will you adopt then? [Carlsson] We are in favor of joint security. As was Olof Palme in his day. But we draw the line when it comes to military nonalignment. That is something that we are not prepared to give up. We cannot abandon one security policy stance without knowing what the next one means. And we do not intend to seek NATO membership. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] What is your position on the plans for economic and monetary union (EMU) and the transition to a common currency? [Carlsson] I think that we have to strengthen currency cooperation, which means that countries can support each other. I cannot say today what form this should take, but a strong counterbalance to the market's speculators is needed. A more intense discussion of this question is needed. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] Do you want Sweden to abandon the floating exchange rate and enter into a currency community? [Carlsson] We will have to do this sooner or later, whether we join the EU or not. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] There is a concern that crime and drugs will flood in across the borders if border controls are removed. How are we to prevent this? [Carlsson] The problem is that we are beginning to have global crime, arising in part from the collapse of the old Soviet Union and from the drug dealers. This is extremely serious for the whole of Europe, but I think that we will never be able to solve the problems of controls within Europe; the important thing is how we organize customs and police cooperation throughout Europe. We will never come to grips with this problem on our own if we stay outside the EU. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] Do we not give away more power if we join the EU? [Carlsson] We also win more power. The no side wants more power over what is a growing powerlessness. If you want power over the issues that are normally decided by the Riksdag and government, you have to meet the threats where they are to be found. And today that is at a level above national boundaries. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] If we are to believe the opinion polls half of Social Democratic voters say no to the EU. What is the explanation? [Carlsson] There are four reasons. The Maastricht procedure harmed the EU. The referendums in Denmark and France created further uncertainty. Then the nonsocialist government declared that the lower taxes and the razing of social welfare benefits were adjustments to the EU. The fourth is the recession and unemployment. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] Have not you and the party leadership failed to win a sympathetic hearing? Are you out of step with the movement? [Carlsson] That is something we cannot judge until we arrive at the referendum. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] What will be your arguments for EU membership? [Carlsson] I will ask the fundamental question that every Social Democrat must ask himself: Do you think that we can best realize our ideas about the welfare society if we are members or if we are not? This is the simple and the difficult question. My response is that I am absolutely convinced that we have a better chance if we are members. And this covers everything from peace in Europe to how I am to be able to earn a living from my own work. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] Do you believe then that a no would threaten social welfare ideals? [Carlsson] I believe at least that it would be more difficult to achieve those goals -- employment, for example. In addition we believe that we have a contribution to make. Social democracy is not just Sweden. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] You have made a rational calculation, but the problem is that the debate is emotionally charged. [Carlsson] Yes, but as a politician one has a duty to present one's rational arguments. Over and above this I will speak with feeling and involvement about Europe. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] Could it not be the case that the opposition to the EU has its roots in mistrust of you and other politicians? [Carlsson] It is possible that people incorporate me in the mistrust of Maastricht that I mentioned. I believe that in the final analysis it is a question of credibility. Who do you trust? And I hope that those who trust me in other respects will also do so on this issue. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] But if it is a question of credibility it looks today as if [the Green Ecology Party's] Per Gahrton and [Left Party leader] Gudrun Schyman have greater credibility than Ingvar Carlsson and Carl Bildt. [Carlsson] I would have been very nervous if we were to have had the referendum in two weeks. We would then have to resort to emergency measures to tackle this problem. Now people have an opportunity to think over the issues and then we will see who has most credibility. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] Are you willing to put all your credibility on the line? [Carlsson] Not in the sense that I am threatening to resign. It is a bad strategy to threaten. Our approach is positive faith. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] If the result in November is a no, will there then be renegotiation and a new referendum? [Carlsson] No, the referendum will decide the matter for a long time to come. There is no chance of any renegotiation. A new referendum in a year's time is completely out of the question. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] So we would then have to make do with the EEA [European Economic Area] agreement? [Carlsson] It is lucky that we have it, but it does not give us any political influence. If I was head of the Export Council I might perhaps say that it was enough, but it is not enough for me as Social Democratic Party chairman.
