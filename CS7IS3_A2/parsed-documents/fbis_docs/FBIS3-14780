Unfortunately, at that time, the Central Electoral Commission did not have any information on the number of participants in the elections. [passage omitted] Insofar as the east rayons of the Republic of Moldova are concerned, up until yesterday 3,910 out of 400,000 possible voters had crossed the Dniester River to cast their vote. A total of 2,278,959 citizens were registered in the list and confirmed; this number, however, does not include the voters in the south rayons; nothing was known about them either. So far, Raisa Botezatu told us, 163 foreign observers and more than 5,000 local observers have been accredited. On the other hand, local special envoys and correspondents of the national radio broadcasting station of the Republic of Moldova report that control at the Dniester River crossing in both directions was particularly strict this morning. All those people who wanted to cross the river were registered. According to the same sources, the number of people who wanted to cast their vote in the course of the week was much higher than today, when local authorities made it difficult to cross the Dniester River. We also want to inform you that this morning at 0745 [0545 GMT], Mircea Snegur, president of the Republic of Moldova, cast his vote at the Russian-Polish School. According to the national television station, on this occasion he reiterated his hopes that the elections will yield a parliamentary majority. Yesterday, a completely unforeseen incident occurred. Following yesterday's visit by the international observers, the illegal authorities in Tiraspol confiscated the automobile in which Romanian Senator Adrian Paunescu was traveling and the driver of the automobile was detained. The vehicle is the property of Romania's Senate. Diplomatic sources we contacted told us that the real reasons for this incident are not known. [passage omitted]
