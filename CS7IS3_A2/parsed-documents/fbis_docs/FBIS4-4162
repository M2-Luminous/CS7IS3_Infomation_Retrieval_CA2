Ames' wife, Rosario, pleaded guilty to lesser charges of espionage and tax evasion conspiracy, but her sentencing was delayed until August 28th, reports said. In a brief statement released after his sentencing in Alexandria, Virginia, Ames said "I bitterly regret the catastrophe which my betrayal of trust has brought upon my wife and son." Ames, who had been chief to CIA counter-intelligence center's Soviet section, said his wife knew of his spying activities seven- and-a-half years after the beginning of his "criminal activity." He said his wife had "pleaded with me to break off the relationship with the Russians." Before today's sentencing, the Ames signed an agreement with the federal government under which both would plead guilty and thereby avoid a trial. Although Ames' wife Rosario's sentencing is delayed until August, reports said she would serve some five years in prison, after which she would be able to take care of her five-year-old son, Paul. Paul is now staying with relatives of Ames' wife in her native Colombia. Under the agreement, Ames also agreed to cooperate with the government in assessing the damage done to the U.S. during his years spying for the Soviet Union and then Russia from 1985 until 1993. Prosecutors accused Ames of selling intelligence about CIA personnel and operations to the Soviets and later the Russians in return for as much as 2.7 million dollars.
