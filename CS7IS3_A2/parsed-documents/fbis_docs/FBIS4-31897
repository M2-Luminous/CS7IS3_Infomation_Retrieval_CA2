The reorganization of ROMPRES is required by the need for a clearer definition of its objectives and for the improvement of its activities; for the need to provide it with the necessary juridical status and functional pattern in tune with the importance of a public institution of national interest. The government resolution spells the importance of the role and duties the national news agency ROMPRES has in ensuring a prompt and objective conveyance of information to both the Romanian and foreign press, and its provisions pursue to stimulate the agency's participation in the information flow in Romania and to enhance its cooperation with the national and international press agencies. The resolution defines the national news agency ROMPRES as a public institution of national interest, financed by the state budget and operating at the legal and financial standards valid for all budget-subsidized institutions. ROMPRES carries out its attributions free from any ideological, political, or economic influences or partiality likely to impair the accuracy of the information it releases. In order to adequately fulfill its attributions, ROMPRES is authorized to request press information from state institutions, ministries, and other bodies of the central and local public authorities. ROMPRES staff are entitled, in the exerting of their duties, to legal protection, in similar conditions with any civil servant. The specialized staff engaged in activities specific for the press have the rights and duties as devolving upon them from the profession of journalist, and, as such, are entitled to the protection of the law. The general director of the national news agency ROMPRES is appointed by the prime minister, his position being equivalent to that of a secretary of state.
