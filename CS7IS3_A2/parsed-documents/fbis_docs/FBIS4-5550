The meeting reviewed the activities of the ARIJI after its sixth board meeting and discussed future tasks. ARIJI Secretary General Govind Narain Srivastava made a report titled "Let Us More Energetically Study and Disseminate the Chuche Idea To Achieve Asian Independence". The reporter said the achievements in the institute activities in the period of review are that it has been proved through realities that the confidence in socialism of chuche has rooted in the minds of the Asian followers of the chuche idea as a strong ideological pillar unshaken in any trial and the study and dissemination of this idea have been conducted in various forms and ways in close combination with the specific conditions. "Those brilliant achievements are a precious fruition of the wise guidance and deep solicitude of the great leader His Excellency President Kim Il-song and the dear leader His Excellency Kim Chong- il," he added, and said: "We are facing an honorable task at present to consolidate and develop these achievements and make a positive contribution to bringing about a turn in the consciousness of the popular masses who have risen up in accomplishing the noble cause of building an independent, new world. Outlining the task, he said: "If the study and dissemination of the chuche idea are to be developed in conformity with the requirement of the realities, greater efforts should be directed to the study and dissemination of the ideas and theories of the dear leader His Excellency Kim Chong-il. "In recent years His Excellency Kim Chong-il has developed and enriched the chuche idea and published many monumental works giving profound answers to the urgent problems raised by the present era. "We should conduct brisk activities for the publication and dissemination of these works, study and disseminate the chuche idea with them as the basic textbooks, and study, analyse and solve the practical problems on the basis of the profound ideas expounded in the works. We should expand the ranks of the followers of the chuche idea and, on this basis, broaden our organizations and strengthen ideological and moral unity and cohesion of their members, thus making our organizations a model for the collectives of socio-political life which serve the people's cause of independence. "Clearly conscious that defending Korean socialism is immediately to defend our own idea, we should lift up louder voices exposing and denouncing the imperialists' anti-socialist moves and closely rally all the socialist forces under the banner of the Pyongyang declaration. And we should wage a vigorous movement against a nuclear war in Korea, solidarizing with anti-war, peace organizations and make a positive contribution to an early realization of the proposal for founding the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo, mindful of the important position of the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea in achieving the independence and peace of our continent.
