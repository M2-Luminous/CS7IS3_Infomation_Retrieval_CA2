We were in Ciudad de Hidalgo, the last town in Chiapas, and crossed into Tecun Uman, the first town in Guatemala. During our visit, the Televisa news team assigned to this area was able to learn that people have no problem in crossing illegally into Mexico from Guatemala. It is believed that approximately 200 people can enter Mexico every day just through Ciudad de Hidalgo en route to the center of the country or the interior of Chiapas. Different immigration officials have confirmed this information. They have said surveillance in the area between Guatemala and Mexico is low, meaning that a large number of people is easily entering Chiapas, coming from Central America or even South America. We also visited the highways around the border area, linking Tapachulas. We were able to see that there is little surveillance, but in the major areas of Tapachula--such as the airport, a Mexican Petroleum station, and a large park or zoo--the Mexican Army has strong security. Also participating in that operation are members of the state and municipal police and the Attorney General's Office. In addition to soldiers and Federal Judicial Police, state, and municipal police agents, Federal Highway Police agents are deployed at the airport; they are not letting cars go near the airport's gate. One has to walk 150 to 200 meters from where cars are parked to be able to enter the airport. [Unidentified anchorman] Going back to your visit along the border, did you see Guatemalan soldiers on the Guatemalan side? [Campos] The military presence on the Guatemala side is even smaller than on the Mexican side. On the Mexican side, we saw three immigration officials on the ground; two others are conducting an inspection in a patrol car. On the Guatemalan side, we only saw two people manning this border area. We specifically asked Mr. Freddy Chicago, who is on the Mexican side, if the flow of people entering Mexico or Chiapas, more precisely, has gone up. He replied that it has risen considerably. On the Suchiate River side, which is where people cross illegally, the number has also risen considerably. Crossing the Suchiate River right now.... [pauses] Because the river between Ciudad de Hidalgo and Tecun Uman is merely 50 centimeters deep, many people walk across, and many others use rafts consisting of boards tied to inner tubes. They make it across the border without problems.
