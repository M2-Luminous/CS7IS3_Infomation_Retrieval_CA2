This is a program on the Chinese mainland aimed to help drop-outs in poor areas resume their school studies. Together with Vice-Premier Li Lanqing, more than 10,000 people watched the performance at the Great Hall of the People, which was relayed live by China Central Television all over the country. China has about a million children who drop out from school each year because of poverty. Since the "Hope Project" was launched by the China Youth Development Foundation in 1989, it has received more than 200 million yuan in donations from home and abroad and helped 540,000 drop-outs return to school. In the benefit show, artists presented songs, dances and other forms of art to express people's concerns about drop-outs and China's primary education. All the performers gave their services free, and each of them also donated money to help at least one drop-out return to school. Sponsored jointly by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League, Ministry of Culture and Ministry of Radio, Film and Television, the benefit performance was expected to further publicize the "Hope Project" and enlarge its funds so as to help more drop-outs resume their schooling, said the organizers.
