De Vargas disclosed that he held a meeting with Interior Minister Carlos Podesta on 11 March to ask him for an explanation, but that the minister told him he knew nothing about it. Now, in view of this unusual "espionage," the deputies will form a special commission to carry out an investigation designed to establish who is responsible for this practice. In view of the discovery of a small espionage cell discreetly established by the police in Congress, according to confirmed data, the president of the Chamber of Deputies yesterday announced that tomorrow a commission formed by three deputies will be established to investigate the reports on espionage made some days ago. Yesterday De Vargas confirmed that some days ago legislators were warned that their steps and visits were being closely followed by the police who guard the Congress building. Tomorrow the legislators will start questioning the police posted in Congress to find out why the National Police were asking for documents from Congress. De Vargas explained that "as far as I know, people arriving at the Chamber of Deputies were checked for safety reasons. But on Friday afternoon I learned that the police officers made lists, which were then classified in a list of those who visited me, those who visited the president of the Senate (Evelio Fernandez), and another with those who visited the vice presidents." "According to the information I obtained, the lists were then sent, separately or together, to the office of the chief of police," said de Vargas. "Once I learned about this I tried to get in touch with National Chief of Police (Mario Sapriza) to ask him that this practice be suspended immediately, if it was in effect being used. I was not able to find him. I phoned the interior minister (Carlos Podesta), and told him I had just learned that the legislators were under surveillance, in the sense that the names and identity card numbers of our visitors were being supplied to the chief of police." De Vargas ended: "I told the minister that if the police were willing to continue to guard Congress they should do just that, but if not they should leave and we would hire private security services."
