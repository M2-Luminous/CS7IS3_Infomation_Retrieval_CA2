Yeltsin Makes an Inspection Tour of the Country"] [Text] Blagoveshchensk -- On 14 June President B. Yeltsin once again set out on a tour of the country. This time he has come to the city of Blagoveshchensk, situated at the confluence of the Zeya and Amur Rivers, where Russian soil ends. Economic matters constitute the chief reason why Yeltsin has made the many-hour flight from Moscow. More accurately, he intends to familiarize himself on the spot with the painful problems which get on the nerves of the population of Amur Kray, while adopted government decisions are still not being implemented. In other words, Yeltsin, freed from the grueling confrontation with the representative power in the form of the soviets, is returning once again to the practice of inspection tours and live contact with people. The priority issues which the local leaders intend to discuss with the president include border trade, the creation of a free economic zone, and the kray's electricity supply. Each of these has had noticeable repercussions on a Russia-wide scale. Therefore, before the president left Moscow, Blagoveshchensk was visited by Vice Premier A. Shokhin; Yu. Shafranik, leader of the Ministry of Fuel and Energy; and representatives of the Ministry of Finance and other departments. To all appearances, the president does not intend to get away with promises to investigate everything but to adopt some decisions on the spot. According to A. Korabelshchikov, his aide, Yeltsin is interested in the reaction of the regions' leaders to his recent economic edicts, particularly as another block of documents is being prepared in this field. He intends to speak about the progress of the economic reform at the final conference in Blagoveshchensk. In addition, Amur Oblast is one of the few producers of soybeans in the country. The oblast's people produce this crop with difficulty, but things are extremely bad with regard to reorganizing the matter. Therefore, local agrarian specialists have invited the president to a collective farm, that is to say, to the "Partizan" Limited Partnership. After familiarizing himself with the problems of Amur Oblast, it is in Yeltsin's plans to fly to the Tuva Republic. Although this invitation is linked with a jubilee, the 50th anniversary of the former Tuva's joining Russia, the president will not merely attend a demonstration concert by local dancers who wish to show their art on a mountain pasture to the accompaniment of the guttural sounds of national instruments. Problems of developing national culture and museum work and the position of the intelligentsia will be discussed with the republic's leadership. In parallel, just as in Amur Oblast, the president plans to investigate why a whole number of programs approved in Moscow with assurances of financial support -- particularly those aimed at developing the road network in the republic, creating an air bridge between Kyzyl and Moscow, and also constructing a plant for the processing of hides -- have come to a standstill or have not been started up at all. It was explained to IZVESTIYA's correspondent in the presidential apparatus, however, that the president will not take an aircraft full of money to Kyzyl, as was formerly the case at Barnaul. There will be a discussion of executive discipline -- which seems sensible.
