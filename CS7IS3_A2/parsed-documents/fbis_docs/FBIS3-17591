It is no accident that the most "drastic" congresses of people's deputies have been in the spring. But there are no congresses, no Supreme Soviet. But some people constantly want to play at political crises. I admit that when I read the now renowned "scenario no. 1" document reminiscent of an amateurish parody of "information to consider" from "Seventeen Moments of Spring" [television series from the sixties, set during World War II), I was surprised that anyone was still attaching serious importance to it. At any Moscow get-together there will unfailingly by a former teacher of scientific communism who now calls himself a political scientist. And he will buttonhole us and unfailingly start to expand on his predictions regarding the struggle in the Kremlin corridors and the prospects of political development in Russia. These predictions were once so popular and well paid that everyone from journalists to theatrical producers set about producing them. But it emerged very soon that for all the subtlety of some constructs they suffered a very important shortcoming: They had only a very indirect bearing on reality. And for that reason they are failing to come true. To make at least some real forecast you must know at least something. In economics, social psychology, sociology, it doesn't matter. The press cuttings which our political scientists employ are useful but not enough. The forecasters' market has begun to empty. And suddenly passions are being heated over the most commonplace political fantasy. Statements and counterstatements, the start of an investigation, the expectation of new and even more scandalous "scenarios," there can be no doubt that they will appear. On the basis of the principle: If you like it, I will draw another one. So that what is interesting is not the document itself but the utterly inappropriate reaction to it by some of our political elite. And in my view the present situation in Russia was reflected to a far greater degree in that reaction than in the document itself. This situation is very complex. Primarily in the economy, where the decline of production is continuing and the crisis of nonpayments is growing, followed by a wave of strikes. The government and the president are faced with an extraordinarily difficult task: selectively financing sectors of vital importance to the state and at the same time not starting to print unsupported money, not sliding into hyperinflation. But for all that it is a case of complexities of a different order from those which existed a few months ago. There is social tension in Russia but no serious political tension can be discerned. One very high-ranking German politician admitted to me that, when he set off for Moscow recently, he expected to see a city overexcited by plot rumors. In reality he was struck by the existing stability. People do not want to go to meetings or even to elections. And if they do nonetheless elect someone they give their preference not to those who promise the "delights of paradise" but to those who intend to ensure the streets are cleaned. Which, actually, is what a sizeable proportion of Russian politicians seem to be trying to do in their daily practical deeds. Chernomyrdin and Chubays, Kozyrev and Shakhray, Luzhkov and Zaveryukha are different people who adhere to different views. But they are united by one thing: They have to resolve specific problems of the state's life. They are putting together the budget and determining the priority of particular tasks. Sometimes they make mistakes. But sometimes they also achieve success. Success like the talks with IMF executive director Michel Camdessus. The point here is by no means the possibility of obtaining $1.5 billion in systemic credit. The point is that Western financiers, who take nothing on trust, having studied the draft budget and analyzed the economic situation in Russia, have reached the conclusion that the government's plans to lead the country out of the crisis are realistic. But nor can we fail to see something else: In this situation the politicians who are geared toward a struggle with someone or something, the "Storm und Drang" politicians, remain unwanted. They were irreplaceable when the old system had to be destroyed. But because of their lack of specific knowledge they are utterly useless in building the Russian state. And it was they who needed the stories about plots. Because in a situation of mutual suspicion and intrigue they are like fish in water. I am more than convinced that playing at plots or countering them is an effective means of struggling against unemployment. It is true that this is the unemployment of a quite narrow circle of underqualified politicians and just as underqualified experts. It was they who organized a festival for themselves this week -- a small coup. It is merely a pity that yet again they have taken serious people away from their work. And not only in Russia but also beyond. But on the other hand this type of escapism, that is a departure from reality, is no bad thing for Russia. Of course, it costs society a lot to maintain such politicians but they are better off playing with their "scenarios." God forbid they try to do something for real. On two occasions already this has been tried by people who were threatened with idleness. Everyone is well aware what came of it.
