It was acknowledged that not everything is going smoothly and within the framework of the Constitution, and so the president was asked to take steps "to eliminate the breaches of citizens' electoral rights and the rights of local self-government committed in the legal acts of Russian Federation components." What is at issue here? An explanatory note circulated among deputies says in particular that "on the whole the elections in the regions are rapidly gaining momentum." However, I would remind you that each region has set the date of its ballot autonomously. According to the president's edict of 26 October 1993, June is the deadline for the elections, and 64 regions have decided to hold their elections in March. Karelia, Sverdlovsk Oblast, and Chukotka are voting in April, while Dagestan, Chelyabinsk and Saratov Oblasts, and Krasnodar Kray are doing so in July [month as published]. And several regions (Adygea, Bashkortostan, Buryatia, Kalmykia, Komi, Tatarstan, and Khakassia) have still not made up their mind about elections. But the range of dates is not the most terrible sin committed by the Federation components. Parliamentary lawyers have observed constitutional violations with regard to citizens' rights to equal representation in organs of state power (in Krasnodar Kray and Tver and Perm Oblasts), the restriction of the electoral rights of certain groups of citizens in St. Petersburg, the removal of elections from public control (in most regions), and other unofficial constitutional "amendments." As expected, there have been doubts in some areas as to the advisability of servicemen on compulsory service voting (in St. Petersburg and Murmansk Oblast). The logic here is as follows: Why should someone temporarily living in our area interfere in local affairs? And there is also the unvoiced but real idea that in certain circumstances the disciplined military electorate will be able to supply a sizable influx of votes to the candidate who appeals to...the command. The desire to exclude as many servicemen as possible from the elections is due also to democrat leaders' fear that the Army will vote for representatives of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia and the Communists. The well known saying that "one-third of the Armed Forces voted for Zhirinovskiy" -- although repeatedly debunked by specialists who have specific figures at their disposal and, most importantly, study the Army on a professional basis -- still features in publications, surfaces at political rallies, and alarms the timid section of the Russian public. Leaving aside the citizen's unconditional right to hold any beliefs and express them in elections, let us not nonetheless denigrate the Army by reducing its natural diversity of thinking to a common denominator. The processes of analyzing and reanalyzing reality are just as complex in the Armed Forces today as they are throughout society. Attempts to "bar" the Army from the ballot box only reveal the frailty of the local authorities, who rely not on the might of their prestige among the people, but solely on the force of administrative levers. And, finally, one last point: Since we have decided to love the Constitution this time, let us remember Article 32, which speaks without any reservation about the Russian citizen's right to elect and be elected to organs of state power. As for draft service, there may in the future be grounds for studying the experience of certain countries where a servicemen taken away from home for a year or two is sent a ballot paper from his native city (village) and thus participates in creating local self-government bodies. The following question is a rhetorical one: Does the Army have its own interest in these elections? Any commander today will confirm that his subordinates' lives and living conditions depend to a considerable extent on how aware the local authority is of army problems. Rayon-scale politics can mean that the local population sees these "warriors" as spongers who also occupy the best land. And the whole life support system of the regiment, the division, etc., is obstructed with red tape, chicanery, and demagoguery. Needless to say, the worst-case scenarios come to mind. But even run-of-the-mill "misunderstandings" between the command and the local authorities over housing questions can completely ruin the lives of the defenders of the Fatherland. Admittedly, to be fair, I must point out that there are still more examples of the military and the authorities living in harmony in the localities than the opposite. It cannot be denied that ideally the military should deal with strictly military business, while the civilian authorities should do all they can to ensure that the military lead a normal life. And there would be no need for a regiment commander to besiege self-government organs and keep vigil to see whether they are not about to violate the interests of the several hundred men in his charge. But things are not ideal at the moment. And so a local citizen who is a true friend of the Army, if not a military man, will invariably have servicemen's vote. They have their own interests, they should have their own man. I repeat, he can be a man of any profession at all, but essentially someone who necessarily possesses one quality -- awareness of how much Russia needs a strong, determined, self-confident Army today. And a stubborn organ of self-government afflicted with primitive pacifism will quite easily develop in a troop unit a cadging complex, a feeling of being a poor relation. We must take care to ensure that this does not happen now, when elections are taking place.
