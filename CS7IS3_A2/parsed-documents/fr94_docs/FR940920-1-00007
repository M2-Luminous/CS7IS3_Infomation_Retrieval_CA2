SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission is requesting comment on proposed amendments to Form U&hyph;13&hyph;60 [17 CFR Part 259] under the Act [15 U.S.C. 79 et seq .]. The Annual Report for Mutual and Subsidiary Service Companies on Form U&hyph;13&hyph;60 was adopted December 29, 1939 and last revised on February 22, 1980 (Holding Co. Act Release No. 21447). I. Introduction Service company subsidiaries of registered holding companies serve the needs of associate companies by providing managerial, administrative, technical and other services. Section 13(b) of the Act requires that contracts by which service companies perform services or construction work for, or sell goods to, associate companies must be performed at cost, fairly and equitably allocated among such companies. 1 1 ``Service company'' is not a defined term under the Act. Rather, a service company is a subsidiary company of a registered holding company that the Commission has found, pursuant to rule 88, to be ``so organized and conducted .␣.␣. as to meet the requirements of section 13(b) of the Act with respect to reasonable assurance of efficient and economical performance of services or construction or sale of goods for the benefit of associate companies, at cost fairly and equitable allocated among them (or as permitted by [rule] 90).'' Under rule 90, these transactions are generally conducted at cost. Rule 92, however, applies a lower-of-cost-or market standard to transfers of seller-produced goods. Commission rules set forth accounting and reporting requirements with respect to these intrasystem transactions. Under rule 93, the accounts and records of a service company subsidiary of a registered holding company must be consistent with the accounts required by the Uniform System of Accounts for Mutual and Subsidiary Service Companies (``Uniform System of Accounts''). 2 Rule 94 requires the filing of an annual report on Form U&hyph;13&hyph;60 by every service company. 3 2 The Uniform System of Accounts [17 CFR 256] was adopted May 12, 1936 and amended February 2, 1979 (Holding Co. Act Release No. 20910). See also 17 CFR 250.93, 250.94. 3 See Holding Co. Act Release No. 1858 (Dec. 29, 1939) (adopting Form U&hyph;13&hyph;60); Holding Co. Act Release No. 21447 (Feb. 22, 1980) (amendment). On November 4, 1992, the Commission, as part of its efforts to update and streamline regulation under the Act, proposed certain amendments to Form U&hyph;13&hyph;60. 4 The proposed amendment was intended to provide the service companies with the flexibility to use accounts from the Uniform System of Accounts of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (``FERC System of Accounts'') in preparing the Form U&hyph;13&hyph;60. 5 4 See Holding Co. Act Release No. 25668, 57 FR 54025 (Nov. 16, 1992). 5 The FERC System of Accounts prescribes a system of accounting for electric-utility companies under the Federal Power Act and natural gas companies under the Natural Gas Act. The Commission's Uniform System of Accounts prescribes a system of accounting specifically for service companies in order to, among other things, track reimbursable costs and charges to customers and account for compensation for use of capital. The Commission received six comment letters addressing the proposed form amendment. 6 Several commenters noted with approval the purpose of the amendment to provide additional flexibility. The commenters observed that because the Uniform System of Accounts does not always contain accounts needed to classify properly charges incurred, the service companies are obliged to use accounts from the FERC System of Accounts or classify certain categories of costs improperly. 7 One commenter stated that, at present, service companies are effectively required to maintain two sets of books, one using the Uniform System of Accounts, the other using the FERC System of Accounts. 8 The commenter stated that the proposed amendments would greatly simplify the accounting system and permit service companies to classify costs more accurately. 6 The six commenters were five registered holding companies, American Electric Power Company (``AEP''), The Columbia Gas System, Inc. (``Columbia''), Consolidated Natural Gas Company (``CNG''), Northeast Utilities (``Northeast''), and New England Electric System (``NEES''), and one service company subsidiary of a registered holding company, EUA Service Corporation (``EUA''). 7 See , e.g. , EUA. 8 See NEES at 2&hyph;3. Other commenters, however, were concerned as to how the Commission's proposal would harmonize the FERC System of Accounts with the Commission's Uniform System of Accounts. These commenters asked that the Commission clarify its proposal. In view of these comments, the Commission is today resubmitting the proposal for public comment.
