The enemy has been launching heavy attacks along the entire defense line. However, our men are not giving in and they have inflicted heavy losses on the enemy in the operational zones of all their six brigades. This enemy offensive is by far the strongest in intensity and it is also the most extensive so far. The aggressor has deployed eight brigades with over 15,000 men, six of which are local and two from elsewhere, consisting of soldiers from Banja Luka, Prnjavor, Mt. Romanija, Pale, Sokolac -- in other words, from the Sarajevo front -- and from Serbia and Montenegro. Every day the enemy is using over 100 artillery pieces of over 82-mm caliber, tanks, and armored personnel carriers. These, the heaviest artillery pieces of the occupying forces, are being accompanied by unprecedented psychological propaganda activities, particularly via local radio stations. [words indistinct] propaganda during the first days of the offensive that started on 17 January was aimed at the Croats, that is, at the 110th Glorious HVO Usora Brigade, which was constantly being urged to join the Serb aggressor. That failed, and then the Chetniks launched fierce attacks on Croatian villages and the entire defense line of the 110th Brigade. The attacks are continuing. There have been questions as to what will change here in view of the NATO ultimatum, but no one expects the Sarajevo model to be applied in this region, even though Maglaj has been mentioned as an option but only as a protected area. The Serb aggressor now has four strategic aims: The conquest of the free territory under the control of the 7th South Operative Group, attacks in the direction of Posavina, the linking of Banja Luka via Bihac with Knin and its railroad line, and the linking of Chetnik territories via Olovo. Therefore the target of the heaviest aggressor's attacks will still be the operational zone of the 7th South Operative Group. According to reliable assessments, these attacks will take the following course: The enemy will again try to cut the Doboj-Teslic route, and occupy the valley of the Usora River. There it will launch a massive offensive on the (links) of the 110th Glorious HVO Usora Brigade and other units, with renewed calls for Croatian betrayal. [Words indistinct] of besieging Tesanj by capturing the dominant hills around it and gradually destroying it. The aggressor's next step will be to cut off the Maglaj-Tesanj route and thus close the circle around Maglaj, which is at the moment under heavy attack. All this would create the conditions for the complete occupation of the Tesanj and Maglaj territories. However, to judge by the military results achieved so far by the army units from the 7th South Operative Group and their outstandingly high morale, it is certain that the enemy offensive will end in complete collapse, and -- according to Mustafa Cerovac, commander of the 7th South Operative Group -- the siege of this area could even be lifted with the cooperation of other army units.
