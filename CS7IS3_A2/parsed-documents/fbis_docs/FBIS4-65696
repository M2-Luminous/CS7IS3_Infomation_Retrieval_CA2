[Northern League ideologue] Miglio's attitude has not changed. Perhaps for a while he may not be part of the Northern League's Senate group." Speroni, like other "veteran" League members, feels that something has changed. His relations with Miglio are based not only on allegiance to the same flag, but also on friendship and affection. Friday evening [13 May] the new minister went to Como, to Miglio's home, accompanied by Senator Marcello Staglieno, Miglio's "disciple." They constituted a special League "delegation" sent to sound out Miglio's thinking and to try to mend a rift that has become apparent more from Miglio's pregnant silences than from his public statements. [Da Rold] Do you think that Professor Miglio could vote against this government? [Speroni] He could also abstain. I do not know exactly. My understanding is that Miglio's attitude is not due to his exclusion from the government. He seems to think that we have abandoned, relinquished federalism. But this is not true. And I am sorry that the professor could believe such a thing. He thinks that in the final stage of the negotiations we sacrificed federalism on the altar of governability and gained only a Pyrrhic victory. [Da Rold] The other day you announced that you will be forming a committee, a study group, to examine a new draft constitution that will set out the path to a federal Italy. Will Professor Miglio contribute to this project? [Speroni] I personally went to offer him this opportunity. But he seems to have no intention of taking part, of helping. And I regret this even more. [Speroni ends] Speroni refused to discuss the matter further. He too is waiting for the news conference that Gianfranco Miglio will give in Rome on Tuesday after Silvio Berlusconi has presented his program to the Senate. Then the professor will speak in parliament. [Da Rold] Pardon me, Minister, but the first incident seems to have taken place within the government already. Perhaps it is because the 13th fell on a Friday this month. You were criticized in a communique from Berlusconi's spokesman, Antonio Tajani, for having said in a radio interview that you want to split the Interior Ministry. [Speroni] There was no incident. Perhaps I was misunderstood, or I did not express myself well. It was a radio interview conducted very hurriedly. But I was certainly misunderstood on the subject of collegiality; I spoke not personally but on behalf of the League. Nobody wants to split the Interior Ministry. We have already said that we want the establishment of a Ministry of Local Government, and we have seen, among other things, that a number of responsibilities are divided among several different ministries, not only the Interior Ministry. We have already talked about this. I did not take part in the government negotiations, which is why this morning I spoke with [League Secretary] Bossi and [Interior Minister] Maroni, who confirmed to me that the League is putting forward the proposal of a local government ministry. We will not do everything at once. We will propose the separation of responsibilities for the Interior Ministry in an ordinary law. [Da Rold] Let us return to the subject of the committee, the study group: Who will it include? [Speroni] I do not know yet. It will include experts, constitutionalists; I shall see. I have come to a ministry where there is nothing. Only typists and secretaries, and a constitutional adviser. There is not even a computer, and there is no money. This too shows how keen previous majorities were to carry out reforms. [Da Rold] You will be guided by federalism. Will you also be guided by the so-called Assago constitution, which set out the republics, or cantons, or macro-regions? [Speroni] Definitely by the Assago document, but also by the document drawn up by the Bicameral Committee. We are open to everyone. Personally, I identify more with the Assago document. [Da Rold] How long will it take you to draw up a final draft? [Speroni] If I have the means available and I make my staff work hard, I think we will have a draft in three months. [Da Rold] Do you think you will encounter resistance from within the majority over the federalist inspiration of a new constitution? [Speroni] I have listened to their arguments and have talked with many of our allies' representatives. If they are in good faith, I do not think there will be any resistance. [Da Rold] Does the same apply to the National Alliance? Even allowing for what has been called the "counterbalance" of presidentialism? [Speroni] That is a technical constitutional matter. It is enough to consider the experience of other countries. Is the United States not a federal and presidential republic? [Da Rold] Then there is the idea of the macroregions. It will be more difficult to reach an agreement in this regard. [Speroni] It seems to me to be the most sensible idea. I see that even the Agnelli Foundation is now thinking in terms of seven large regions. [Da Rold] The left-wing federalist, Massimo Cacciari, however, has in mind a federalism based rather on the major cities, on Italy's big municipalities. [Speroni] What, then, do you do about Gallarate? No, I think that the macroregions are the right approach, the best starting point. [Da Rold] Do the reform plans include bodies of constitutional importance? What is your opinion concerning the Higher Magistrates Council? [Speroni] I think it should be removed completely from political influence. I am talking about the members of the Council elected by parliament on the basis of political vested interests. Furthermore, I would rather await whatever suggestions emerge from the Justice Ministry. I have my own personal opinions in this regard. For instance, I would like district attorneys to be elected by the people, as in America. However, I repeat, these are my personal opinions.
