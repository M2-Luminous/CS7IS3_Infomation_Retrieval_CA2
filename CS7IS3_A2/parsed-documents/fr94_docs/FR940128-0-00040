ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: On November 26, 1993, EPA published the notice of proposed rulemaking to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Colorado for the purpose of establishing a Small Business Assistance Program (PROGRAM) in the State. The implementation plan was submitted by the State to satisfy the Federal mandate, found in section 507 of the Clean Air Act (Act), to ensure that small businesses have access to the technical assistance and regulatory information necessary to comply with the Act. The rationale for the approval was set forth in the proposal. No comments were received pursuant to this proposed action. Therefore, EPA is proceeding with its approval of the revision to the Colorado SIP for establishing a PROGRAM in the State. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule will become effective on February 28, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Laura Farris, Mail Code&hyph;8ART-AP, USEPA Region VIII, 999 18th Street, Suite 500, Denver, Colorado 80202&hyph;2405, (303) 294&hyph;7539. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Implementation of the provisions of the Clean Air Act (Act), as amended in 1990, will require regulation of many small businesses so that areas may attain and maintain the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the emission of air toxics. Small businesses frequently lack the technical expertise and financial resources necessary to evaluate such regulations and to determine the appropriate mechanisms for compliance. In anticipation of the impact of these requirements on small businesses, the Act requires that states adopt a PROGRAM, and submit this PROGRAM as a revision to the federally approved SIP. In addition, the Act directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to oversee these PROGRAMS and report to Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing a PROGRAM are set out in section 507 of title V of the Act. In February 1992, EPA issued Guidelines for the Implementation of Section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments , in order to delineate the Federal and state roles in meeting the new statutory provisions and as a tool to provide further guidance to the states on submitting acceptable SIP revisions. The State of Colorado has submitted a SIP revision to EPA in order to satisfy the requirements of section 507. In order to gain full approval, the State submittal must provide for each of the following PROGRAM elements: (1) The establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide technical and compliance assistance to small businesses; (2) The establishment of a State Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory process; and (3) The creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP. II. Summary of Submittal The State of Colorado has met all of the requirements of section 507 by submitting a SIP revision that implements all required PROGRAM elements. At a public hearing held before the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission (Commission) on October 15, 1992, the plan for the PROGRAM was approved. A notice of approval dated October 30, 1992, was issued by the Technical Secretary of the Commission adopting the PROGRAM plan. Legal authority to implement the PROGRAM was obtained through Senate Bill 105 and is contained in the Colorado Act (ACT) Section 25&hyph;7&hyph;109.2. The collection of fees to cover the cost of implementing the PROGRAM is contained in the ACT Section 25&hyph;7&hyph;114.7. The Colorado PROGRAM was submitted to EPA by the Governor of Colorado on November 18, 1992, and was initially reviewed for administrative and technical completeness. In a letter dated December 23, 1992, EPA requested additional information from the State in order to make a positive determination on the submittal. After receiving the additional information on January 7, 1993, EPA notified the State in a letter dated January 26, 1993, that the submittal was administratively and technically complete. The submittal then underwent review by EPA headquarters, and received a concurrence from all reviewers. The State has met the first PROGRAM element by committing in its PROGRAM plan pages 6 through 9 to meet the six requirements set forth in section 507(a)(3) for the Small Business Assistance Program. Additionally, a task force has been established to examine options for implementation of these six requirements, and prepare a report containing its recommendations. The State has met the second PROGRAM element by locating the position of the Small Business Ombudsman in the Office of Regulatory Reform, as specified in Section 25&hyph;7&hyph;109.2(5) of the ACT, and by outlining the powers and duties of the Ombudsman on pages 4 and 5 of its PROGRAM plan. The State has met the third PROGRAM element by establishing a Small Business Compliance Advisory Panel in the State of Colorado, as specified in Section 25&hyph;7&hyph;109.2(2) of the ACT, and by outlining in its PROGRAM plan on pages 5 and 6 the functions of the CAP and how the members will be determined, which is consistent with section 507(e). Additionally, the State of Colorado has established a mechanism for ascertaining the eligibility of a source to receive assistance under the PROGRAM, including an evaluation of a source's eligibility using the criteria in section 507(c)(1) of the Act. This mechanism is located on pages 2 and 3 of the State's PROGRAM plan. III. Final Action EPA is approving the SIP revision submitted by the State of Colorado. The revision was made to satisfy the requirements of section 507 of the Act. This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Acting Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq. , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. By this action, EPA is approving a State program created for the purpose of assisting small businesses in complying with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. This program does not impose any new regulatory burdens on small businesses; it is a program under which small businesses may elect to take advantage of assistance provided by the State. Therefore, because the EPA's approval of this program does not impose any new regulatory requirements on small businesses, I certify that it does not have a significant economic impact on any small entities affected.
