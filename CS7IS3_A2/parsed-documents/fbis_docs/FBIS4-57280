He then became the "great confiscator" from the Somoza family and their allies with the promulgation of the now internationally famous Decrees 3 and 38. He will never regret having applied them vigorously. He is the father of eight, one of whom--Ernesto Castillo Salaverry--died during the September 1978 uprising, fighting the National Guard with the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] guerrillas. He was a member of the old Sandinist Assembly that was dissolved at the end of the first FSLN Congress in July 1991. Ernesto Castillo, who for five years (1985-90) served as the Sandinist government's ambassador to the USSR, now teaches at the UCA [Central American University] Law School, as he did from 1960 to 1970. In the library of his home he answered our questions, one by one. [Lacayo Guerra] You signed the document "For a Sandinism Restored to the Masses." Is not that faction a sort of Sandinist intellectuals' movement? [Castillo] Not so. Both documents, ours and the one released by the Democratic Left, were prepared by intellectuals. Julio Lopez Campos, for example, is an intellectual who is a member of the Democratic Left, just as Sergio Ramirez is an intellectual. It is by no means correct to say this is a movement of intellectuals. These are people with different views on the Front's leadership. Now, of course, to discuss and draft a document, you have to know how to read, write, and think. So in that sense, every document is prepared by intellectuals. [Lacayo Guerra] Your faction represents social democracy in the FSLN? [Castillo] I believe such labels are a source of ridiculous embarrassment. Some people are now embarrassed to be reminded that they were Marxist-Leninists or communists, when in the past they shouted that with great pride. Those are only terms that become fashionable and then suddenly people are stigmatized with those labels. We should see who will be more offended, a person called a Marxist-Leninist or a social democrat. Those purely formal terms should not concern anyone. [Lacayo Guerra] It has been said that your faction was born with an electoral goal in mind: to launch Sergio Ramirez as a presidential candidate, and the other supporters want to be candidates for deputies and municipal officials. [Castillo] That all seems ridiculous to me. A person simply has to read the document to realize that it represents a large number of revolutionaries who are questioning internal situations in the Sandinist Front. At no time do they support the candidacy of Sergio or anybody else, even though they have that right, for we all have the right to make decisions about candidacies. But that is not what we are concerned with now. [Lacayo Guerra] So what are you concerned with? [Castillo] The internal situation of an FSLN that is paralyzed. And I would not call the document a platform. For me and all of us who signed it, it is a way to force a logical review of the FSLN, to adapt it to today's circumstances, independently of candidacies and whether or not the concepts and contents of our document, like the Democratic Left document, may be revised. These are not absolute proposals at all. Instead, this is a way of questioning a party that does not want to change. [Lacayo Guerra] What were your motivations for signing that document? [Castillo] Well, I saw it as an opportunity to force the FSLN to review its internal situation and try to find among all of us, including the Democratic Left and any other sector of the Front, a party that can respond to the people and to the ideals for which we fought and got involved in this Sandinist Front. [Lacayo Guerra] We are on the eve of an Extraordinary Congress of the Sandinist Front. What do you expect from that Congress? [Castillo] I expect very little. Very little. The documents I have read and the way the process is being carried out give me the impression that there is going to be very little space for people to try to rediscover the Sandinist identity and to find an FSLN restored to its values. I believe we are not going to have much of an opportunity, since the congress is being organized by those who are trying to keep the Sandinist Front from changing. [Lacayo Guerra] Are you pessimistic? [Castillo] It is not a matter of being pessimistic. It is rather that I have no confidence that from this congress, arranged in a hasty and forced manner, there may emerge what we really want from the Sandinist Front. There has been little time, or rather, they have left little space where the FSLN could be in charge of a group of people who truly want to open up the party, both to face new challenges and also to recover the honesty and morality of the true FSLN of the past. [Lacayo Guerra] The Extraordinary Congress is going to reform the statutes and prepare a new program. If the results are as you say you believe, will this mean something like "an election defeat announced in advance"? [Castillo] I do not think the congress is going to deal with the 1996 elections, nor do I think the Sandinist Front should consider the next elections. The 1996 elections are a deadline for which we must be prepared, but not a goal. Sandinism needs to seek in this congress, as it should always do, more universal aims than elections, even though elections do have a great deal of importance. [Lacayo Guerra] What specific situations make you have doubts about this Extraordinary Congress? [Castillo] The essential thing is to recover the moral authority of the FSLN. Even though the document that I signed is called, "For a Sandinism Restored to the Masses," that will not happen if we do not start by restoring moral authority. I can say that if we are unable to overcome this moral decline, a more or less moderate FSLN may arise, but it will not be the true FSLN, but instead a political party just like any other political party. [Lacayo Guerra] What is your reason for saying the FSLN has lost its historic morality? [Castillo] What I am saying is that some people in the Sandinist Front are presenting the face of an FSLN that no longer has the moral authority it used to have. I say that essentially because of the abuses committed after 1990. There was enrichment, some people became businessmen, which is not bad in itself. What is bad is being a crooked businessman who expands his capital with other people's money. The mansions and property that those people now control--which they obtained illegally--the revolution had intended these properties to benefit the people, and not to benefit certain individuals. [Lacayo Guerra] What if the Congress does not define a party that identifies itself with what you consider the Sandinist Front should be? Would you resign your membership? [Castillo] In my case, what motivates me in political action is a revolutionary concept that always remains when one really is a revolutionary. Being in one party or another is a question of whether that party responds to revolutionary interests. From its origin up to the present, the FSLN has unfailingly provided the most opportunity to develop revolutionary ideas and do revolutionary work. But if one day the FSLN is no longer revolutionary, then logically a person must go his own way. Something else will arise where that work may be pursued. [Lacayo Guerra] Do you describe yourself as on the left? [Castillo] Intellectually, I think the left has not exhausted its potential. The next generation must continue to seek a more collective, more just society. And not only because I am on the left, but also because that is more consistent with revolutionary beliefs. Even with Christian beliefs for those who have them. Those hopes for a less egotistical, less individualistic society must not be lost. [Lacayo Guerra] There is so much social inequality, unemployment, poverty.... What is the role of a revolutionary party in these circumstances? [Castillo] Its role is to learn how to interpret correctly those circumstances and work so that, wherever possible, it can stop the savage and voracious advance of economic policies that do not respect any system of ethics, do not consider human dignity, and also use the right tools to regain power and from there make the changes that are needed. [Lacayo Guerra] Should the party lead the people's struggles? [Castillo] The Sandinist Front should be at the head of the popular struggle. This needs to be understood. If people ask me about violence, I say that I support the violence we used in 1979. If I am asked about confiscations, I support our confiscations in 1979, for we wanted a change and we made the utmost use of that opportunity. Did we know how to organize and make that permanent? That is something else. Now, in these circumstances in which the historic situation tells us that we can only reach the government through elections, we must use this opportunity to bring about change. But that does not mean we are no longer revolutionary. [Lacayo Guerra] What is your opinion of violent methods of struggle? [Castillo] That depends. Let us suppose that in 1996 the elections are won by a political sector that defends the interests of the masses, and the present government says: "I will not turn over the government." Then it would be legitimate to take up arms to recover power that was won in clean elections. There should be no scruple about taking up arms. But, of course, taking up arms unnecessarily does not make sense when we have a system that should be used first. [Lacayo Guerra] The issue of relations between the Sandinist Front and U.S. administrations is fairly controversial. What do you think? [Castillo] There must be honorable and respectful relations on both sides. The United States has been responsible for injustice, for poverty; it still is, and so we have to see. But that does not mean we should break off relations or be in a state of permanent confrontation. Instead, there must be a flexible response to its positions. If those positions are logical, then there should be logical responses. If they are positions of violence or abuses of our sovereignty, we must defend ourselves with all our dignity and with firmness, no matter what great power it may have. [Lacayo Guerra] Is the concept of anti-imperialism still valid? [Castillo] That concept is now a little out of date, for empires themselves are out of date. Instead, it is the concept of sovereignty that should be understood and clarified. Our decline has been so great that now, even our relations with Costa Rica, which is not an empire, are not relations of equal to equal, especially with this government. The meaning of sovereignty is that it must prevail against any country. [Lacayo Guerra] What are your ideas about revising the FSLN statutes? [Castillo] The principal axis of the FSLN should not be so much the statutes, for the FSLN is still in a phase of structural search and programmatic adjustment. Instead, it needs to change its internal mindset and way of thinking. The essential is a change in leadership; first of all, it has to decide to break with this clinging to power.... [Lacayo Guerra] Are you talking about a change in mentality of the present leaders or a change in leaders? [Castillo] I am talking about a change in the leaders in the top leadership and at intermediate levels that are clinging to a structure without any reason, rather than to power for the sake of power. I think that is more important than the program itself. It is the same with constitutions. You can have a wonderful constitution, and if it is poorly used, people can do whatever they want with it. [Lacayo Guerra] What do you think about the National Directorate as an organization? Should its name be changed? Should it be expanded? [Castillo] It should cease to exist as a structure and all the members of the National Directorate should be removed. New people have to take over the leadership. Hierarchy has been a serious problem in the Front, as we have still not lost our concept of vanguard. We needed a vanguard at one time. In a political and military leadership a vanguard was necessary, but now it is not, for that concept brings with it a mistaken hierarchy. We need to set Sandinist forces free to seek their own leadership, and the discussion we are now having about methods of struggle, about the program, should be left to the free workings of the people who need that change. For in essence, these become discussions of the inner circle. [Lacayo Guerra] On a personal level, do you have any aspirations to belong to a leadership organization of the Sandinist Front? [Castillo] No, no, absolutely not. I am terrified of that type of thing because it is the easiest way to get entangled and caught up in complications. Other people can do that, people who have a type of discipline that I do not have. I think there is more freedom to question when you are on the bottom, especially in a phase of search and renewal.
