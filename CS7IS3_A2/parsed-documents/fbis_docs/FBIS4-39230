Our correspondent spoke to Colonel Boris Bolshakov, deputy head of the Personnel Directorate, about the specific nature of the FCS and its problems. [Dolinin] Boris Terentyevich, how is reform of your service going and has its cadre potential been preserved? [Bolshakov] The FCS is not living in a vacuum, it is experiencing the effect of social development trends. There have been fundamental structural changes in the course of reorganization but no dramatic replacement of cadres; the professionals have been retained. We are improving management organization, we are being relieved of functions that do not properly belong to us and duplication of functions and are seeking out internal reserves. We are trying to preserve the best traditions in line with the Constitution and the laws. [Dolinin] How far have your organization's functions changed? Who works in the FCS today? [Bolshakov] The Border Troops have been assigned to an autonomous structure, investigation subunits have been wound up, and we have also been relieved of a number of functions belonging to internal affairs organs, and there have been considerable cuts in managerial structures. But in connection with growing international exchange, there is more work in ensuring economic security and preventing terrorism, sabotage, smuggling operations, and the narcotics business. We have embarked in earnest on improving information and analysis activity. Consequently, there can be no talk of a sizable cut in operational personnel. People who have completed their prescribed period of service have been discharged. We have no qualms about their future -- former counterintelligence personnel are rated highly on the job market. The counterintelligence service has 75,000 personnel today, while the management apparatus numbers around 1,500. Forces and funds will continue to be redeployed. For instance, the cuts in the Armed Forces make it necessary to reorganize military counterintelligence organs. Our operational personnel have higher education and most receive thorough special training. Many speak foreign languages. Rigorous selection and training are carried out at FCS training establishments and individual training is provided on the job. [Dolinin] How does one get to serve in counterintelligence? [Bolshakov] You will not find advertisements on the street or in the newspapers regarding employment in counterintelligence organs. Young people (Russian citizens) may be advised to apply to territorial counterintelligence organs. Personal voluntary recruitment can be as a servicemen or as a civilian. A contract is concluded with the former. Candidates are carefully vetted regarding their suitability for specific counterintelligence work. Morals, honesty, decency, and ability to resist negative influences go without saying. Health and physical fitness requirements are also high. [Dolinin] Are women employed in counterintelligence? [Bolshakov] We have plenty of women working for us, including officers and warrant officers. The range of these posts will clearly expand. [Dolinin] You mentioned incentives for cadres... [Bolshakov] The work of personnel in the most "challenging" areas attracts additional recognition; an "Honored Counterintelligence Officer" badge has recently been introduced. The officers who caught representatives of the British and German special services red-handed and who stopped an attempt by North Korean Embassy staffers to illegally buy state-of-the-art Russian technologies were the first to receive it. [Dolinin] Has the FCS become more open? [Bolshakov] Counterintelligence leaders have begun to speak out in the mass media more frequently. I consider it useful to issue official reports on collegium sessions and FCS leadership conferences. We give taxpayers information about the way their money is spent. Studying public opinion helps make the necessary adjustments to our work. There are also plenty of fabrications about our work which give rise to various rumors, conjecture, and suspicions regarding counterintelligence. People try to blame it for things that it has nothing to do with. How can disinformation be countered? For instance, on the initiative of the FCS director the stamp "For Official Use Only" was removed from the document announcing the statute on our service. It has been published in the open press. [Dolinin] Boris Terentyevich, what is your service's attitude to KRASNAYA ZVEZDA? [Bolshakov] We consider your newspaper to be our own. Most of our personnel subscribe to it. I would like us to have regular businesslike ties.
