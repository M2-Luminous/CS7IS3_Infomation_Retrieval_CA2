Environment Under HUD regulations (24 CFR 50.20(k)), this rule is exempt from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act as set forth in 24 CFR Part 50. The rule relates to internal administrative procedures, the content of which does not involve development decisions, and does not affect the physical condition of project areas or building sites but only relates to the amount and manner of payment of FHA insurance claims and distributive shares. Executive Order 12612, Federalism The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive order 12612, Federalism, has determined that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political subdivisions, or the relationship between the federal government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. As a result, the rule is not subject to review under the Order. The rule will not affect the basic availability of FHA insured single family mortgage financing assistance_merely the methods under which such financing can be secured. No programmatic or policy changes would result from this rule's promulgation which affect existing relationships between the federal government and state and local governments. Executive Order 12606, the Family The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and, thus, is not subject to review under the order. The rule is limited to terminating a specific means for delivery of FHA insurance which has proved to be unworkable and a drain on the FHA staff resources. Other single family programs of HUD, specifically the direct endorsement program, will be improved upon and reemphasized in conjunction with this rule.
