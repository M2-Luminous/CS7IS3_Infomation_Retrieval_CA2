After reviewing achievements in the introduction of foreign funds in recent years, Zheng Shouyi, vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party (Public Interest Party), said in a speech that attention should be paid to the solution of problems in the introduction of foreign funds. "Governments at all levels should draw up long-term plans for the introduction and use of foreign funds in a bid to improve their macro-management in this regard," he told a meeting of the current session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference today. They should also formulate policies and principles concerning the use of foreign funds, in line with specific economic conditions of their respective regions, he said. It is also necessary to formulate regulations and policies to encourage foreign investors, and examine both annual and long-term plans for the introduction of foreign funds, he added. He proposed setting up managerial departments to coordinate efforts to solve major problems in using such funds. In the future, it is necessary to attract investments from multi- national corporations and international consortiums, and encourage them to invest in energy, transportation and other infrastructure projects, he said. They should also be encouraged to undertake major projects to upgrade technology in existing large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, he added. "At present, the amount of foreign investment in public health, education and culture is very small. I think we should make breakthroughs in these areas," he said. Zheng Shouyi called for efforts to perfect China's legal system, noting that legislative measures must be compatible with internationally accepted practices. Foreign-funded enterprises inside China must be treated as Chinese legal entities, he said, adding that both Chinese- and foreign-funded enterprises should be treated equally. Furthermore, it is imperative to tighten supervision over tax payments by foreign-funded companies, accurately evaluate foreign assets and protect the legitimate rights and interests of workers in these companies, he said.
