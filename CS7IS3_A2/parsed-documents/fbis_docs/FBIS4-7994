Prime Minister Nikica Valentic, who announced the evacuation order, dubbed the blasts in the depot in Sesvete, about 12 kilometres (seven miles) outside Zagreb, a "disaster." He said he had no information on casualties but that the government was without news of some of the staff working at the depot. Valentic, who also announced that a special crisis cabinet had been set up to deal with the emergency, gave no details on the cause of the blast but dismissed the possibility of sabotage. An AFP reporter at the scene some five hours after the blasts began at 2:00 p.m. said three fires were blazing, sending plumes of smoke into the sky, while shells continued to explode at the depot. Earlier, shells exploded every few seconds, according to eyewitnesses near the depot and nearby residents were told to take refuge in their cellars and not to panic. A radio appeal was broadcast calling on the capital's emergency fire service personnel to help deal with the blaze. Sesvete police told AFP they expected people had been injured. Traffic was stopped in the whole of the surrounding region, and schoolchildren and their teachers abandoned classes to flee the area.
