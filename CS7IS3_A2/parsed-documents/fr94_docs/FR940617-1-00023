ACTION: Notice of public meeting. SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency is announcing a public meeting prior to proposing effluent guidelines and standards for the Coastal Oil and Gas subcategory of the Oil and Gas Extraction category. EPA intends to propose a rule in January 1995, and this is the only public meeting that the Agency plans to sponsor prior to proposal. The meeting is intended to be a forum in which EPA can report on the status of regulatory development and in which interested parties can provide information and ideas to the Agency on key technical, scientific, and other issues. DATES: The meeting will be held on July 19, 1994 from 9:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. ADDRESSES: The meeting will be held in Conference Room 111 at the Minerals Management Service (MMS), Gulf of Mexico/Outer Continental Shelf Regional Office, 1201 Elmwood Park Blvd., New Orleans, LA. Seating will be available for approximately 100 attendees. MMS is located approximately five miles from New Orleans International Airport. To reach MMS, go East on U.S. Route 61 (Airline Highway).

Telephone (202) 260&hyph;7179, fax (202) 260&hyph;7185. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA is developing effluent limitations guidelines and standards for the Coastal Oil and Gas subcategory under authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.). The Coastal subcategory includes operations involved in drilling for and production of oil and gas in the coastal areas of the United States. Such coastal areas include states bordering the Gulf of Mexico, the coast of California, and both the North Slope and Cook Inlet in Alaska. The public meeting will include discussions of the effluent guidelines regulatory development process, applicability of the forthcoming rule, regulatory approach (i.e. treatment technologies considered for effluent limits and their costs), affected population estimates, and general coastal oil and gas issues. The meeting will not be recorded by a reporter or transcribed for inclusion in the record for the Coastal Oil and Gas industry rule. Documents relating to the topics mentioned above and a more detailed agenda will be available at the meeting. Tudor T. Davies, Director, Office of Science and Technology.
