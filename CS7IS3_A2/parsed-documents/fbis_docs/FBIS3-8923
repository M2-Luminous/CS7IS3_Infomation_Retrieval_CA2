According to reports from Skopje, the law contains discriminating articles and restrains the Albanians from full access to education. One of the articles states that only translated text books will be used in those schools where classes are taught in Albanian. Most of the draft's articles run counter to statements by Macedonian authorities for equality among all the citizens in Macedonia. Sources from Skopje say that Albanians will not have the right to prepare original text books with a content to be outlined by they themselves in case the draft law is approved as proposed. According to the draft law, one of the requirements for a professor to teach in these schools is that he should be a Macedonian citizen and should have a full command of the Macedonian standard language.
