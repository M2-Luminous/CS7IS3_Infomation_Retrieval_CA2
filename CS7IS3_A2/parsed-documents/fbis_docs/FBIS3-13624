Bassam Abu-Sharif, political adviser to PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, said the settlers in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip "are an integral part of the Israeli occupation, and that is why it is necessary to set a timetable for their evacuation in parallel with the withdrawal of regular forces." If the Israeli Government really wanted peace, Abu-Sharif said, "it must go ahead with such an evacuation." The PLO demanded the dismantling of certain flashpoint settlements in the occupied territories following the February 25 massacre of Arab worshippers in a Hebron mosque by a Jewish settler, Barukh Goldstein. Abu-Sharif said the United States financed the construction of the Jewish settlements, and should "finance their evacuation as they did for the settlements in the Sinai desert," which was returned to Egypt. He reiterated the PLO's refusal to resume peace talks with Israel until the United Nations "assumes its total responsibility for protecting the Palestinian people in the occupied territories." The UN Security Council is due to vote Friday on a draft resolution on the occupied territories. The PLO has called for the deployment of an international protection force in the territories.
