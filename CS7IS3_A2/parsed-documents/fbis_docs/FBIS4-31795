Czech authorities paid compensation to the soldier after a long-term investigation of his individual complaints, before the U.S. Senate published a report saying that there existed unchallengeable proofs of the use of chemical and maybe even biological substances in the war against Iraq, the paper writes. Doctors had found out in him the so-called hepatitis positive Australian antigen, and concluded that his condition was related to his participation in the war. The officer of the Czechoslovak anti-chemical unit has no longer been a career soldier. Fifteen or so soldiers have turned to the Army's Health Administration, complaining of various health problems. "The connection between their complaints and the Gulf fighting is still being investigated," the paper says.
