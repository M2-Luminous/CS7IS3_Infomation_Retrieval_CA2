In his message, Karamanlis notes that experience, both old and new, has taught us that social tranquility and national unity are necessary for security and progress in a country. He noted that we have been unable to implement these truths because political life is usually conducted in a tense climate due to intense political passions. [passage omitted] The president said that bringing our economy nearer the economies of the other European Union member states should be a national priority. He also stressed that Cyprus' long suffering is continuing and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] continues to be provocative. Karamanlis added that if the international community does not have the courage to make FYROM comply, then with the careless policy that it is following, FYROM may cause instability in the wider region. [passage omitted] In his message on Greek Independence Day, Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou referred to the current foreign policy issues. He stressed that the Cyprus issue continues to be the major national issue -- an issue of invasion and occupation by the Turkish forces, an issue of violation of the international law. Papandreou said: With its decisive stance on FYROM, Greek foreign policy made the entire international community realize that Greece is the one that has specific proposals on how to resolve the problem, contrary to the FYROM Government's continuing intransigence. Papandreou added that a firm and fundamental goal of our foreign policy is respect for the human rights of the Greek minority in Albania. Papandreou concluded by stressing: With its stance, our country is continuously demonstrating its particular interest in peace, stability, and security in the broader region. [passage omitted]
