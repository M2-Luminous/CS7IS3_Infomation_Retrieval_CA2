[Begin Bishop recording] [Word indistinct] the sectors that disagree with the position held by the vast majority of the workers are precisely the managers who are also businessmen. I even challenge them.... [pauses, changes thought] We represent the workers of the military bases. We are answering for those workers, and 85 to 90 percent of them support the candidacy of Professor Ruben Dario Carles, not only because his political campaign is based on protecting jobs on the military bases but also because he is inclined to protect the positive economic revenues that enter our country due to those bases. [end recording] Bishop said that the individuals who oppose these two issues want to divide the reverted areas among themselves and continue with the ongoing negligent attitude after the year 2000. [Begin Bishop recording] This is the end of the line. Here, Panamanians as a whole must demand that the government that will take the helm of our country in 1994 effectively legislate in favor and to the benefit of the majority of Panamanians, not just a small group of businessmen and politicians. [end recording] Bishop's recent statements in this same vein prompted several sectors to state that Local 907 cannot speak for all workers of the reverted areas. Bishop says, however, that those who oppose his views have never been interested in the needs of the Panamanian people. [Begin Bishop recording] Together, let's try to restructure our country as Panamanians and, those who are elected in 1994, as public employees. [sentence as heard] [end recording]
