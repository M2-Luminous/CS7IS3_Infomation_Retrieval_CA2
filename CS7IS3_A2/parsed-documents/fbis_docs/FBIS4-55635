FBIS4-55635 "dreeu095__a94019" FBIS-EEU-94-095-A Daily Report 11 May 1994 ANNEX Hungary Trade Account With Russia Examined Trade Account With Russia Examined AU1105174094 Budapest MTI in English 0716 GMT 11 May 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1105174094 Budapest MTI English BFN [Text] Budapest, 11 May (MTI) -- The visit of the Russian prime minister to Budapest at the end of March, and the six agreements signed, could promote Hungarian-Russian trade and capital transfers already taking place between the two countries. Hungarian exports to Russia were valued at $945 million in 1993, imports from there $1.7 billion. This was compensated for by the delivery of 28 MiG-29 fighter jets, to a value of $713 million, as the first tranche of Russian, ex-Soviet, state debt owed to Hungary. Russia is Hungary's second largest foreign trade partner, after Germany, while Hungary is seventh among Russia's partners. In 1991, Russian-Hungarian turnover fell by some 70 percent when the trade switched to U.S. dollar accounting. In 1992, turnover rose by 17 percent, mainly due to Hungarian grain deliveries of 3 million tons. Last year, total turnover was valued at $3.35 billion, 6 percent less than in 1992. Hungarian imports remained at the same level, but exports to Russia declined by 17 percent. In 1993, three-quarters of Hungarian imports were petroleum (6 million tons), natural gas (5.3 billion cubic meters), and electric energy; 15 percent was other raw materials, semi-finished products, and components. The proportion of imported consumer goods rose slightly, to 6 percent. The structure of Hungarian exports shows a major change. In 1992, food accounted for about 50 percent, and the proportion of machines and equipment did not even reach 20 percent. Last year, the proportion of agricultural and food products declined to 30 percent, while that of machinery rose to 30 percent, and consumer products stood at around 20 percent. Compared to 1992, the Russians purchased 40 percent more machinery, vehicles, and medicine. The decline in Hungarian exports in 1993 was wholly due to the drop in agricultural exports. Hungary has independent economic agreements with 20 territories within Russia, also helping trade. In 1994, Hungary made such agreements with the Komi and the Udmurt Republics, Bashkiria, and the Ivanovo territory. Exports to Russia accounted for 10.6 percent of Hungary's total exports in 1993, imports from there for 14.3 percent of total imports. The Hungarian Ministry of International Economic Relations prepared a development program to promote trade and investment with the former Soviet successor states, mainly with Russia. The program provided some $1 million to Hungarian exporters in 1993. Prime Ministers Peter Boross of Hungary and Viktor Chernomyrdin of Russia signed an agreement in Budapest at the end of March on avoiding double taxation. The sides are negotiating an investment protection agreement. Both aim at increasing mutual investment, currently at a low level. At present, 1,000 Hungarian firms trade with Russia, where 900 Hungarian-Russian joint ventures also operate, mainly engaged in trade. There are 50 Hungarian-Russian joint ventures in Hungary. The products of several major Hungarian joint ventures -- Orion telecommunications plant, the Petroleum Equipment Factory of Nagykanizsa (southwest Hungary), and the Ikarus Bus Factory of Szekesfehervar (west Hungary) -- have Russian buyers. A government agreement of outstanding importance concerned the settlement of the remaining, some $900 million worth, of debt owed by the former Soviet Union. The agreement on repayment designates five areas: military technology, civil transport, Hungarian participation in Russian privatization, Russian participation in Hungarian privatization, and the expansion of tourism links. The Hungarian side would like to participate in Russian privatization to a value of at least $200 million. Hungarian entrepreneurs would invest in Russian petroleum or natural gas firms, or possibly in railway vehicle reconstruction, as a form of debt repayment. Talks are in progress on setting up trading houses. The Russian side is considering the delivery of iron structures for the Budapest World Expo, and participation as sub-contractor extending the Budapest underground. In civil transport, the Hungarian side would mainly welcome ships, machinery and chemical products. The ministers in charge signed cooperation memorandums covering telecommunications and post, and a supplementary protocol was signed to the 1966 agreement on setting up the Paks Nuclear Power Plant in Hungary. The most important parts of the latter agreement are that Russia will take back the burnt-out fuel rods from the power plant, for which Hungary will pay some $40 million, and it will deliver nuclear fuel to the Hungarian plant for an additional annual $45 million. The foreign trade ministers signed a protocol on mutual deliveries in 1994, which, unlike earlier agreements, no longer contains quantitative stipulations, merely recommendations for each product group. The Hungarian side wishes to match 1993's trade volume in 1994, and believes Hungarian exports could go up by 10 percent with deliveries of agricultural products, food, medicine, and buses.
