FR941110-0-00048 FR941110-0-00016 At §488.212, we proposed that, if the facility is found, at the time of the survey, to have deficiencies that do not pose an immediate and serious threat to resident health and safety, HCFA or the State may allow the facility to continue to participate for up to 6 months from the date of the survey if_ •The State finds that it is more appropriate to impose alternative remedies than to terminate the facility; •The State survey agency has submitted a plan of correction approved by HCFA; and •The facility (in the case of a Medicare SNF or the State in the case of a Medicaid NF) agrees to repay to the Federal government payments received if corrective action is not taken in accordance with the approved plan of correction. We said that, if a facility does not meet these eligibility criteria for continuation of payment, HCFA would and the State must terminate the facility's provider agreement. If any deficiency at any severity or scope level remained uncorrected within 90 calendar days after the last day of survey, HCFA would and the State must deny payment for new admissions. We proposed that HCFA terminate provider agreements for SNFs and NFs, and stop FFP for NFs for which participation was continued, if cited deficiencies were not corrected within 6 months of the last day of the survey. In the proposed rule, we also set forth specific rules on how to apply both low severity and scope levels and all other severity and scope levels as follows: •Low severity and scope levels _If both the severity level and the scope level are 1, a deficiency still exists, but no alternative remedies are imposed or plan of correction required as long as correction is achieved within 90 calendar days from the last day of survey. _The survey agency would be required to give the facility a summary of the deficiencies. _If the survey agency identifies a recurrence of these deficiencies at the next standard survey, HCFA or the State would be required to impose one or more remedies specified at §488.206 (Available remedies) due to the persistence of the deficiencies over time.
