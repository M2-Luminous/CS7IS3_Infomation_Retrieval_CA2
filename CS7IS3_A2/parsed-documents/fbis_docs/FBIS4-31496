I hope that both sides' politics will not spoil the friendship, exhibited at the cycling Tour of Italy, between the two peoples. We are waiting to understand the Italian Government's real thinking; Slovenia's positions and behavior will depend solely on this. President Milan Kucan of the Slovene Republic is cautious but chilly. [Paracchini] President Kucan, from your tone one would say that relations with Italy have considerably worsened. Can you explain this to us? [Kucan] I am thinking of Italy's understanding and friendship during our march toward independence, and in particular during the war against Yugoslavia. Understanding and friendship which were particularly significant in Friuli Region. [Paracchini] And what has changed nowadays? [Kucan] I am concerned at certain declarations which, even if made on a personal basis, are far from that climate of cooperation. But apart from the concerns, there are worrying facts. [Paracchini] For example? [Kucan] I am thinking of the East-West meeting in Warsaw where Slovenia was not accepted as a full member, precisely at Italy's insistence. And I am thinking of the Paris summit where again our country was not mentioned among those with a future European potential. And who insisted that this be so. Italy yet again. [Paracchini] If Italy officially asked you to review the Osimo Treaty, what would you reply? Would Slovenia concede anything? [Kucan] The Osimo Treaty settles a whole series of questions, and as long as the treaty is valid we ought to stick to it. We are fully entitled to benefit from it as we are Yugoslavia's legal successors. Osimo did not solve the problems in an ideal fashion, but if something has to be changed, we need first of all to find common bases. And these changes need to safeguard our mutual interests in a just fashion. [Paracchini] And borders? [Kucan] Borders should not be a problem in Europe. Rather than change them we should eliminate them from our consciousness.
