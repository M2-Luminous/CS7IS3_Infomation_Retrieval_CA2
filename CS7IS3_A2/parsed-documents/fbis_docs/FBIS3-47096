Meanwhile, other ethnic groups have been holding peace talks with the Burmese Government and the Karenni are in danger of becoming the only group left fighting the Burmese Government. Karenni is a branch of the Karen ethnic group -- the biggest ethnic group in Burma. There are reports that Karens are on the threshold of ending its 45-year hostility against the Burmese Government. In a letter to the Prime Minister's Office in London's Downing Street, the Karenni provisional government based in northern Thailand, has appealed to the British Government to play a leading role in supervising their peace talks with Rangoon. The letter of appeal also said that the Karenni State would have been given protection by the British Government had the Conservative government been in power when Burma gained independence from Britain in 1948. The letter also cited documents which stated that the Karenni State was a British protectorate during the colonial era and was never a part of the Indian Empire or Burma. Britain's official view is that the official representatives of the Karenni State, which now has a population of over 300,000, chose the path of independence and to jointly work with Burma at the time of independence. In an interview with the BBC, the Karenni foreign minister, Abel Tweed, said he wanted Britain to mediate in the peace talks. He said Britain has growing sympathy for the Karenni, and that it could still do a lot for the Karenni's goal. The Karenni has appealed in the past to Britain, India, and Australia to recognize them as an independent state. Abel Tweed also said that although the low-level preliminary peace talks are being held with the Burmese Government at a secret venue inside Karenni territory, full-scale peace talks could not be held as long as the Burmese troops are not withdrawn from Karenni territory and the forceful recruitment of porters and interrogation and imprisonment of people continue.
