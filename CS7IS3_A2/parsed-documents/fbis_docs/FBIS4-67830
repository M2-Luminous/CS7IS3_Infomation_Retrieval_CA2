The document, in particular, concerns the obligatory terms under which the United States will consider it possible to establish mutual relations between the two states in the above-mentioned sphere: Ukraine's accession to the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), to the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and its refusal to manufacture offensive missile systems according to MTCR categories and classifications. Stressing that the United States ``will not assist and will not engage in trade if such activity contributes to the development of systems in the MTCR category and even space carrier rockets,'' the U.S. side noted Ukraine's interest to accede to the MTCR which has recently been established and is ready to assist Ukraine in this. During William Perry's visit, a preliminary agreement was also reached about the fact that the U.S. side would, at the end of April, conduct further talks with Ukraine on these issues. On 12 April, during a news conference on the occasion of World Aviation and Cosmonaut Day, in reply to a question from a UNIAN correspondent whether such talks would take place, Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov said that work in this area was underway. Ukraine in particular is ``attempting to convince the U.S. to be somewhat more considered in its attitudes to the realities that Ukraine finds itself in.'' The deputy prime minister stressed, in particular, that directness and unambiguity in the talks could lead to Ukraine losing its rocket technology and personnel, and it is not known where Ukraine would end up tomorrow. In Valeriy Shmarov's words, in the last few days, a letter was received by him from William Perry in which the ``U.S. side agreed with us on many things,'' and undoubtedly by the end of April there would be consultations and an exchange of views on this matter. Based on the course of the talks and development of events in Ukraine itself, Valeriy Shmarov expressed certainty that Ukraine would accede to the MTCR and will become the founder of a new Cocom regime. According to information received by UNIAN on the same day, as a political step toward Ukraine's full membership of MTCR, the United States has proposed the conclusion of a bilateral U.S.-Ukrainian agreement with the aim of acceding to the main principles of MTCR.
