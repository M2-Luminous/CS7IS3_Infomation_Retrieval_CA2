"I am sure things will move in a favorable direction," the premier said at the Japan National Press Club, referring to the prospects for the bilateral "framework" trade talks to be resumed Wednesday after a three-month stalemate. Hata, who became premier in April, said he and U.S. President Bill Clinton agree their countries can better understand each other through in-depth talks. Tokyo and Washington announced last week they have reached a compromise to reopen the protracted trade talks to set up a new framework for bilateral trade. The trade negotiations, which are aimed at widening U.S. access to Japanese markets, ruptured in February after Tokyo rejected U.S. proposals to use numerical targets in gauging progress in Japanese imports. In resuming the framework talks, the two countries agreed to use two or more "objective criteria" in measuring progress in opening Japanese markets and paring down Japan's massive trade surplus. On North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development program, the 58-year-old Hata said Tokyo is not sure whether the communist state already possesses nuclear warheads. He also expressed hope Pyongyang will "truly open up its heart to the international community" and dispel allegations that it is developing a nuclear weapons capability. As Japan's colonial rule over the Korean peninsula caused unbearable suffering and sorrow for the people living in both North and South Korea, the premier said, Tokyo is ready to cooperate with Pyongyang in promoting public welfare in the country. If North Korea keeps on refusing full international checks at its nuclear sites, it will result in a catastrophic situation, he warned. While saying Japan will act in step with the United Nations in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue, Hata reiterated it will do so within the bounds of the Constitution that bans the use of force in settling international disputes.
