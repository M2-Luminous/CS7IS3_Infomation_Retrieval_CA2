Following the incident with two Russian generals on January 10, the command of the Northwestern Army Group authorized servicemen to shoot to kill to rebuff attempts to seize any army facility. Briefing newsmen on January 17, Ulmanis described the decision as an uncivilized response to the civilized moves he made on January 10. He reminded newsmen that action had been taken immediately on his orders for the release of the Russian generals, subsequent investigation and punishment of those responsible. Ulmanis saw the decision as provocative and a show of force. He hoped it would have no far-reaching repercussions. He also saw it as a signal for the Latvian authorities to show more caution in what they choose to say or do.
