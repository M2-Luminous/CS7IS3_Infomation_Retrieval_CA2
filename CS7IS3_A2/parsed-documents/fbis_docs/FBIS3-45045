She held it with the participation of first secretaries from the party committee of various military subdistricts across the province and responsible persons from the armed forces committees at all levels. In his speech Sun Weiben stressed: Party committees at all levels, particularly the first secretary of military subdistrict party committees, should foster, under the new situation, the concept of enhancing the party's control over the armed forces and never weakening the party's control in this regard. They should also concentrate on the concept of achieving harmonious development between the construction of national defense reserve forces and economic construction. The construction of militia and reserve forces should be put on the daily schedule of local party committees as well as into the overall construction plan at the prefecture-city level and into the system in which the first secretary holds responsibility for the construction in this regard during his tenure. Party committees at all levels should ensure the assignment of various duties of the armed forces work to responsible personnel and exercise strong leadership over the work. Attending the meeting were leading personnel from the party, government, and Army organs, including Shao Qihui, Tian Fengshan, Shan Rongfan, Chen Yunlin, Yu Jingchang, and Wang Guiqin. Party committees at all levels throughout the province and armed forces departments have enhanced the party's leadership over the armed forces in the past two years. They have done this by closely following the center of economic construction. Thus, the province's construction of national defense reserve forces has developed overall and the sense of national defense for the broad masses of cadres and the personnel of militia and reserve forces has been obviously improved. The armed forces units at grass-roots levels have remained stable thanks to conducting reforms among the systems. The construction of leading bodies for the people's armed forces departments and that of cadres' contingents have been strengthened. The average age of cadres in charge of the armed forces work has shown a four-year decrease over the past and their structure of specialized knowledge has been greater improved. The organizational construction of militia and reserve forces among key localities has been further implemented. The quality of military training and administrative work undertaken by the militia and reserve forces throughout the province has been upgraded. 90 percent of counties, county-level cities, and districts have realized their training of reserve forces in their neighboring military bases. The qualified rate of trainees has reached more than 98 percent. Meanwhile, various localities have upheld the principle of using the armed forces and training armed forces in the course of reform and construction and having the personnel of militia and reserve forces play an important role in building the two civilizations. Since the campaign of "scientific and technological winter", one million personnel of militia and reserve forces throughout the province have attended the training classes on technologies suitable to rural areas. These classes have turned out 200,000 graduates, talented personnel who have done a lot in developing the commodity economy in rural areas. During the campaign of "supporting the poor and helping the difficult", 70 percent of poor households under the support and assistance of militiamen, and farms run by the people's liberation army units stationed in the province, have dealt with the problems of dressing warmly and eating their well. 32 percent of them have gotten on the road to riches. Various localities have the militia and reserve forces in the activities of combating floods and dealing with emergencies, taming large rivers, building water conservancy works, and fulfilling tasks for building the state key projects in the province. These localities have also pioneered a new road: Integrating the development of productive forces with the upgrade of fighting capability. While safeguarding social peace, the personnel of militia and reserve forces across the province coordinated with the public security departments in cracking down on 213 serious and appalling criminal cases and capturing 4,365 criminal elements this year. In his speech Sun Weiben also emphatically pointed out: Efforts should be made to enhance the party's control over the armed forces and to have the first secretary assume the important responsibility in the work. A good job must be done in carrying out political construction among the militia and reserve forces and persistently applying the socialist theory of Comrade Deng Xiaoping with regard to building socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm the minds of these armed forces. Efforts should be made to have education on missions, and fine tradition among the personnel of militia and reserve forces; to maintain the correct work orientation of militia and reserve forces; and to ensure that these forces are always under the absolute leadership of the party. Meanwhile, party committees at all levels, in particular the first secretary, should continuously enhance their self study; go deep into reality in order to carry out investigation and study; explore the characteristics and laws of the armed forces under the new situation. Attention should be paid to the role of the armed forces departments in being a "staff organ", being good at coordinating with departments concerned, to commonly and jointly managing, persistently implementing the regulations and systems that have been proven effective in enforcement, and realistically upgrading the capability and level of leadership over the armed forces work. During the meeting Yu Jingchang, member of the provincial party standing committee and political commissar of the provincial military district, delivered a report entitled "By Meeting the New Situation of `Two Changes', We Should Improve the Quality of the Province's Work in Building Militia and Reserve Forces to a New Level".
