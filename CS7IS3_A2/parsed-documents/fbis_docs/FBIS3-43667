A statement issued today by USP representatives in Cairo notes that the USP and a number of Somali forces have pressed for such a move for more than two years. The statement says that the move will help curb the power of certain irresponsible groups that made financial gains and got media attention due to their blackmail of UN organizations. In their statement, Somali forces express support for the UN decision to deploy about 16,000 soldiers to protect public facilities, convoys, and refugees. The decision, chosen from among three options submitted by UN Secretary General Dr. Buturs Ghali to the UN Security Council, is reasonable and correct, the statement says.
