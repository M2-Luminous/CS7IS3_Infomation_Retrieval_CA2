According to those present, the prime minister stressed that he intended to proceed with his idea of forming a unified parliamentary group among the ruling coalition parties. He said: "Unless the ruling coalition parties become unified, we cannot compete with the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]." The prime minister instructed JNP leaders to form a new organization such as a policy study group, which would include LDP members who were willing to act in concert with the ruling coalition on such issues as tax system reform and deregulation. Touching on "conditions for partnership," the prime minister mentioned the following four points: 1) promotion of tax system reform to prepare for an aging society; 2) maintenance of the Uruguay Round structure; 3) implementation of deregulation and administrative reform that produces practical results; and 4) cooperation in coming elections. The prime minister stressed: "We need to get together under a united aim and increase group members." On the current state of the ruling coalition, the prime minister said: "Although I intend to accept the views (of various parties), harmony within the overall coalition is important. It would be inappropriate for one of the coalition parties to expand." He added: "Some LDP members have not yet made up their minds to join Sakigake [Harbinger], Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] or JNP. As dozens of LDP members share with the JNP a similar sense of values, it would be best for them to join our study group." With the upper house election set for summer next year, and the next general election also in mind, the prime minister said: "Our aim is to sweep out political corruption. I intend to achieve it." His comments restated his intention to place emphasis on the task of dealing with political corruption involving the general contractor scandal. Secretary General Matsuoka, who was elected on 8 March, held a news conference prior to the talks with Prime Minister Hosokawa, and touched on relations with Sakigake, with which the JNP has promised to merge. Matsuoka clarified an intention to strengthen the cooperative relationship with the party in the future, saying: "We would like to cooperate with Sakigake as the core of the coalition administration." On the prime minister's idea of forming a unified parliamentary group, Matsuoka said: "If we are to win elections, this is a natural idea. At present, though, is it appropriate to discuss the possibility the coalition will be divided into two or three groups?" His remarks raised a question about the policies of Sakigake and other parties, and indicated a cautious stance toward an early merger with Sakigake. It is also reported the prime minister did not issue any concrete instructions on the issue of merging with Sakigake at a general meeting of JNP lower and upper house members on the same day. The reality is that differences between the two parties have not been narrowed.
