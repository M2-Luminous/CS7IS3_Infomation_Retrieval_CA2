FR940513-0-00126 FR940513-0-00034 Friday May 13, 1994 Part III Federal Trade Commission 16 CFR Part 305 Rules Concerning Disclosures of Information About Energy Consumption and Water Use for Certain Home Appliances and Other Products Required Under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act; Final Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 92␣/␣Friday, May 13, 1994␣/␣Rules and Regulations FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION 16 CFR Part 305 RIN 3084&hyph;AA26 Rules Concerning Disclosures of Information About Energy Consumption and Water Use for Certain Home Appliances and Other Products Required Under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act AGENCY: Federal Trade Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') issues final rules that add general service fluorescent lamps, medium base (integrally ballasted) compact fluorescent lamps, and general service incandescent lamps (both reflector and nonreflector) to the list of products subject to provisions of the above referenced rule, commonly referred to as the Appliance Labeling Rule (``Rule''). Lamps often are referred to as ``light bulbs'' or ``electric lights.'' This action is taken pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (``EPA 92''), which directed the Commission to prescribe, by April 25, 1994, rules requiring such lamp products to be labeled with disclosures that will enable purchasers to select the most energy efficient lamps that meet their requirements. At the same time, the Commission temporarily stays §305.8(a)(3) of the Rule, which requires manufacturers to file annual reports, until the U.S. Department of Energy adopts test procedures for lamps under EPA 92. The Commission also exempts from the requirements of §§305.11(e) and 305.14(d) of the Rule, which require disclosures on labels and in catalogs, those lamp products that will be eliminated from the market as of October 31, 1995, by minimum efficiency standards specified in EPA 92. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 15, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kent C. Howerton, James G. Mills, or Terrence J. Boyle, Attorneys, Federal Trade Commission, Bureau of Consumer Protection, Division of Enforcement, Room S&hyph;4631, 601 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20580, telephone numbers 202&hyph;326&hyph;3013, 202&hyph;326&hyph;3035, and 202&hyph;326&hyph;3016, respectively. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Introduction EPA 92 1 amends in several respects the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (``EPCA''), which requires the Commission to prescribe labeling rules for certain major household appliances and other products. 2 The EPA 92 amendments to EPCA direct the Commission, within 18 months of the statute's enactment, to prescribe rules requiring that certain types of lamp products be labeled with ``such information as the Commission deems necessary to enable consumers to select the most energy efficient lamps which meet their requirements.'' 3 Pursuant to this statutory directive, the Commission published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (``NPR'') on November 15, 1993, soliciting written public comments on proposed amendments to the Appliance Labeling Rule (``Rule''), 16 CFR part 305 (1993), to include these categories of lamp products. 4 The Commission also conducted a Public Workshop-Conference (``Workshop'') on January 19, 1994, to discuss the proposed amendments, and accepted supplemental written comments from the Workshop participants following the completion of the Workshop. 1 Public Law 102&hyph;486, 106 Stat. 2776, 2817&hyph;2832 (Oct. 24, 1992) (codified in 42 U.S.C. 6201, 6291&hyph;6309). 2 42 U.S.C. 6291 et seq. EPCA also has been amended by the National Energy Conservation Policy Act of 1978 (``NECPA''), Public Law 95&hyph;619, 92 Stat. 3258 (1978); the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987 (``NAECA 87''), Public Law 100&hyph;12, 101 Stat. 103 (1987); and the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988 (``NAECA 88''), Public Law 100&hyph;357, 102 Stat. 671 (1988). 3 42 U.S.C.A. 6294(a)(2)(C)(i) (West Supp. 1993). Pursuant to other EPA 92 amendments to EPCA, the Commission also amended the Rule to require the disclosure of water usage rates for certain plumbing products. 58 FR 54955 (1993). 4 58 FR 60147 (1993). After evaluating the written comments, the transcript of the Workshop, and the supplemental comments, the Commission is amending the rule to impose labeling and other disclosure requirements for the lamp products referenced in EPA 92. The amendments are discussed in detail in part IV, below. The amendments appear in ``Text of Amendments,'' below. The Commission also has determined that the final rules announced today overlap certain provisions of the Commission's pre-existing Light Bulb Rule pertaining to the required disclosure format for wattage, light output, and laboratory life ratings and to the voltage level at which those ratings are to be tested. 5 Following this proceeding, the Commission will consider whether any additional action is necessary concerning the Light Bulb Rule. 5 Prior to EPA 92, the Commission issued a rule, known as the ``Light Bulb Rule,'' governing the most common types of incandescent lamps. Trade Regulation Rule for the Incandescent Lamp (Light Bulb) Industry, 16 CFR part 409 (1993); see 35 FR 11784 (1970). The labeling rules announced in this notice duplicate certain disclosures required by the Light Bulb Rule.
