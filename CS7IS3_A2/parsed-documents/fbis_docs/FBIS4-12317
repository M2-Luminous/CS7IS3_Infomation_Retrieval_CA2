An Israeli military official said that so far nine Israelis had died and 50 others had been injured, most of them seriously. The official added that the explosion was the result of a suicide attack. News reports said that a massive fire engulfed the scene of the explosion. Another Israeli official described the scene as a horrible sight. News reports have also indicated that, after this explosion, which shook the Israeli settlement, Israeli enemy forces surrounded the area, sealed off all roads from and to the occupied West Bank, and began a series of arrests among the Palestinians. Thus, the illusion of peace which is being promoted has been exposed. It has now been confirmed that real peace could be achieved only with the return of the occupying invaders, who have colonized Palestine, to their original homelands, the return of the Palestinian people to their homeland, and the establishment of a democratic state of Palestine where Palestinians, Muslims, Christians, and Jews can live together. If this is not achieved, there can only be more massacres, more killings, and more bloodshed. What happened today confirms an obvious reality -- namely, that there will be no stability for the invaders, whatever means of repression they use and however much blood they shed. The only road of escape for the occupiers is to return immediately to the countries from which they have come as invaders.
