The leaders of the military departments, before answering the questions of journalists, briefly related the essence of the meeting. General of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy Radetskyy indicated in particular that "I had a planned working meeting today with the Minister of Defense of Belarus. We are very thankful that the Lviv area has received us with pleasant, sunny weather. That fostered a good discussion. We discussed questions of the building development of our armed forces, how technical and medical support will be organized and how the `Partnership for Peace' will be implemented. We also touched on questions of regional security. We have many common personnel problems. It is well known that many Ukrainians are serving in Belarus, and many Belarusians in Ukraine. Some of them want to return home, and we must devise mechanisms to solve that problem. A series of proposals were thus put forward, and our experts will study these problems and prepare certain documents. We will meet again in April and make concrete decisions." Colonel-General Pavlo Kozlovskyy also expressed his impressions of the meeting: "The Lviv weather really did seem to incline us toward the fruitful resolution of everything that was discussed in today's conversations. We are working today on the creation of national armies, and we see that without each other's help we will not be able to manage it. Military-technical issues are simply not resolved without outside help. We agreed on close collaboration back in Ashkhabad, and now have met here with our colleagues. I would like to add that we do not have sufficient funds in our state for the normal development of our armed forces. We want to collaborate with our neighbors, with you, in order to ease this problem. The concept of barter exists. We have many military repair enterprises in Belarus that are of interest to the Ukrainian armed forces. You, on the other hand, have things of interest to our specialists. We can and should agree to advantageous collaboration on the basis of fair transactions." The leaders of the military agencies answered the questions of journalists. Question: A representative of the military department of Russia, Colonel-General Samsonov, was recently saying that combined armed forces of the CIS will possibly be appearing before long. Do you share that assertion? The Minister of Defense of Ukraine answered that question: "Colonel-General Samsonov can think whatever he likes. It is a matter for us to agree with him or not. We cannot take part in any military blocs whatsoever, in accordance with our Military Doctrine. Much has been written about this in the press. If the decision is made by the Supreme Soviet or the President of Ukraine on some other type of relations with the armies of other countries, we the military will submit to such a decision. We still have close collaboration with the armies of our neighbors, both near and far. Collaboration such as with Belarus." Colonel-General Pavlo Kozlovskyy added to what was said by the Minister of Defense of Ukraine: "I asked General Samsonov where he got the grounds to make such a statement. The idea of combined armed forces was not very promising from the very beginning, in my opinion. So another idea has appeared--the creation of a staff to coordinate military collaboration, if only to assist each other in building national armed forces and ease as much as possible the performance of that task. Question: New, Temporary Regulations and other official documents are already being developed and taking effect in the Ukrainian armed forces. Is anything of the sort being planned in the army of Belarus? "I have seen your Temporary Regulations," said Colonel-General Pavlo Kozlovskyy. "We have also developed our own and submitted them for the consideration of the Council of Ministers of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. I think that they will take effect very soon and be translated into the Belarusian language." Question: Could you elaborate more concretely on the collaboration of our two ministries and armies? "We have a series of projects that have been proposed by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and our specialists," indicated the Minister of Defense of Belarus. "There is, for example, a draft program for the training of cadets at higher military educational institutions. I think that we will be able to speak more concretely about bringing that plan to life in April. We also have agreements on the exchange of attendees at military educational institutions with Poland, with the military-medicine academy in particular. Question: How do you regard the agreement on the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine, and what stage is that process in? "I think," said Colonel-General Pavlo Kozlovskyy, "that the decision on how and when to withdraw nuclear weapons from Ukraine is an internal matter for the country's leaders. I cannot comment on that. We are accomplishing analogous tasks ourselves today. Frankly speaking, General of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy Radetskyy and I did not touch on that problem." "This is my second meeting now with Pavlo Kozlovskyy," added the Minister of Defense of Ukraine, "and I would like to say that I have never asked what Belarus is doing with regard to nuclear weapons, and he in turn has not inquired into what Ukraine is doing. "What stage do I think this problem is at? If we want to become a non-nuclear state, then everything that is being done now is a normal and natural process. And it is being done in accordance with an existing document. There is a schedule, agreed on with Russia, and we are fulfilling it. It cannot be stated concretely yet when the withdrawal of nuclear weapons will begin and when it will end. One must understand that it is not just simple freight being shipped. The utmost assurance of safety is required here, and that requires painstaking preparations of transport, railroad tracks, the appropriate documents and the like. The work is proceeding, however."
