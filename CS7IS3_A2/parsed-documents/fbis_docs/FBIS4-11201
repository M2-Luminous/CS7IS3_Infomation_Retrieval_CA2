De Leon told the media that the temporary suspension of the elections by a Supreme Court of Justice resolution is "temporary," and that the Constitutional Court will be the one to resolve the case definitively once it is submitted. De Leon did not make any comments on whether or not the Supreme Court of Justice decision to protect Solidarity Action Movement deputy Carlos Humberto Arroyave was a political one. "I respect the autonomy of government branches," De Leon replied. De Leon added that from an electoral viewpoint, the amparo Arroyave filed charging that the Supreme Electoral Tribunal violated his rights by convening legislative elections on 14 August has political overtones since he is a congressional deputy. De Leon indicated that those actions are allowed within a system of legality and a de jure regime and that the Court resolution shows that legal and democratic systems are at work in Guatemala. De Leon expressed his confidence in the integrity of Court magistrates, who convened elections based on legal considerations and in accordance with constitutional reforms. Political leaders, including retired General Efrain Rios Montt, former head of the de facto government, and Francisco Reyes, both of whom are members of the Guatemalan Republican Front, maintain that the Court resolution was political because the magistrates do not want to leave their posts either. Following the election of a new legislative assembly, new Court magistrates will be appointed.
