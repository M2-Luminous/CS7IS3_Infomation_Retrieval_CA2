"S" has nothing left to do but put pressure on the authorities. According to him, the president should try to achieve successes that would also be the successes of the union; however, at the same time he did not say that the union would support Walesa in the forthcoming presidential elections. More Demonstrations On 16 April Krzaklewski was a guest at the 9th General Congress of the Mazowsze Region Delegates. He told the delegates that he could see two possibilities of fighting for "S" demands. The first consists of political possibilities. He said that the openness of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] would be a chance; however, "this party most clearly does not want to take advantage of this chance." He added that in the PSL the old nomenklatura is gaining an upper hand. According to Krzaklewski, another political solution might be cooperation with the president. However, according to the "S" chairman, the president did not take advantage of the chance to "improve the dialogue with the union" before signing the budget. He should have held talks with "S" and, before signing the budget, he should have submitted conditions to the coalition; the conditions could have made it possible to satisfy at least some demands. Later on, asked bluntly by one of the delegates whether "S" might back Lech Walesa in the presidential elections, Krzaklewski said that "as a result of such alliances, the union may become dependent and it will depend first of all on the president's activities whether the unionists will support him." "I personally cannot see the possibility of a political alliance; however, this will be decided by the congress," added Krzaklewski. Thus, in the present situation the union should count first of all on itself in the fight for its demands. The "S" leader announced that there would be further pressure exerted on authorities; however, there would be fewer strikes, more demonstrations and information campaigns. Wrzodak Attacks Jankowski Zygmunt Wrzodak, radical activist of the Mazovian "S," criticized at the congress the activities of the Region's Chairman Maciej Jankowski. He said that the strikes, manifestations, and pickets were not very successful in the region. He asked Jankowski what he had done since the beginning of his term and what he was going to do this year. [passage omitted]
