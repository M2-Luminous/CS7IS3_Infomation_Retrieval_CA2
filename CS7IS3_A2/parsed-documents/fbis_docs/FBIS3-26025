Over the past year, Chinese Customs has sternly attacked smuggling activities, recovering over 2.346 billion yuan of smuggled goods and turning over 1.777 billion yuan of penalties and confiscated money, an increase of 78 percent and 83 percent, respectively over the previous year. In view of the characteristics of smuggling activities under the conditions of reform, opening up, and a socialist market economy this year, Qian Guanlin said, the investigation bureau of the Customs Administration will directly organize and take part in the investigation and handling of complicated major cases, which involve a huge value and which transcend regions. To adopt forceful measures against the illegal activities of smuggling, Qian said, we should gradually set up a highly centralized sea-land-air national headquarters against smuggling and establish a national customs information system within Customs, which is connected with law enforcement organs and information departments. We should strengthen the antismuggling functions of Customs, closely follow marine and border smuggling activities, and resolutely crack down on smuggling. On the supervision over import and export commodities restricted by the state, Qian Guanlin said, dutiable commodities without license should be returned or confiscated according to law or sold at current prices strictly in light of regulations. It is necessary to strengthen supervision over the rare species and controlled commodities, punish the illegal transfer of textiles, strictly enforce regulations, and safeguard the state's interests.
