"We were on the border when they came in," General Houl Savoan of the 5th Military Region said. The general said a 40 strong group of Khmer Rouge, backed by a tank, attacked his men Monday. "But the Khmer Rouge were repelled back into Thai territory," he said. The general, however, later admitted that the government forces had pulled back from the area and said journalists could not visit a former Khmer Rouge radio station because the area was "insecure." A group of some 120 Khmer Rouge attacked government troops occupying Sala Krau, a former guerrilla jungle base around 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) north of Pailin, Saturday, he said. The Khmer Rouge lost six men in the ensuing firefight while the government had one soldier dead and three wounded, he said. Khmer Rouge radio, broadcasting from a new clandestine location, claimed their fighters killed 42 government soldiers Saturday in clashes in Sala Krau and adjacent areas. Worn-out looking government soldiers, returning from jungle around Sala Krau, said there was relentless fighting every day. But despite these ongoing clashes, government officers rebutted Khmer Rouge claims that they had walked into a trap by seizing Pailin. They claimed the guerrillas' hit and run attacks did not jeopardise the government's hold on the resource rich region. An AFP photographer saw soldiers stacking some of what Hul Savoan estimated to be around 100 tonnes of Khmer Rouge ammunition recently discovered by the government forces.
