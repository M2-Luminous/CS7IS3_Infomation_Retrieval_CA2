FR940105-2-00078 FR940105-2-00037 [TA&hyph;W&hyph;28,968] Plains Petroleum Operating Co. Midland, TX; Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration On November 19, 1993, after being granted a filing extension, one of the former workers requested administrative reconsideration of the Department of Labor's Notice of Negative Determination Regarding Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance for workers at the subject firm. The Department's Negative Determination was issued on September 27, 1993 and was published in the Federal Register on October 21, 1993 (58 FR 54736). The former worker submitted additional information showing that the Midland facility had decreased sales and production in 1993. Conclusion After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claim is of sufficient weight to justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted. Signed at Washington, DC, this 22nd day of December, 1993. Mary Ann Wyrsch, Director, Unemployment Insurance Service.
