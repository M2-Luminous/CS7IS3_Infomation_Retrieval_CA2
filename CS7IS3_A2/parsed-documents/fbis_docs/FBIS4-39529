"Though the political situation of Gagauzia and Dniester differ, we will maintain the relations with this region and with all countries that support us. While the major states promote a large policy, we, Gagauzians, accept the foreign support and have the chance to develop strongly in the next 5-10 years. To prosper, Gagauzians need a sociopolitical stability in the region, which we hope will be achieved in the near future with the adoption by the Moldovan Parliament of the spectral juridical status." Referring to the $35 million credit offered by Turkey to Moldova, Topal said that there already exist concrete projects for its utilization. It is stipulated that $32 million will be allocated for water supply to the southern districts of Moldova, and the remaining $3 million for the creation of the respective infrastructure. Referring to Suleyman Demirel's opinion on the Gagauz problem, Stepan Topal stated that: "The President of Turkey has emphasized that this is a Moldovan internal affair. Suleyman Demirel is satisfied with the fact that his visit to Moldova laid the foundation to the settlement of this problem." According to Topal, Comrat is absolutely sure of the fact that "Turkey considers Gagauzia a means of penetrating the markets of Moldova, the Ukraine and Russia."
