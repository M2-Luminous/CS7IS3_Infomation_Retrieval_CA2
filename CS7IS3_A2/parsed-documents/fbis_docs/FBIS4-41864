A categorical "no" rang out from public platforms, was uttered into journalists' microphones, and was heard in statements made, above all, by the Federation Council chairman. "Yes" rang out immediately the budget just passed by the State Duma reached the Federation Council. Let us recall that the members of the Federation Council were going to back to the bitter end defense expenditure of 55 trillion and an increase in expenditure items for the regions. Commenting on the upper chamber's decision, Vladimir Shumeyko assured people that a compromise had been reached between the sides. What does this amount to as regards expenditure on national defense? Let us study carefully the results of the second and third readings: In both cases you have the figure of 40.6 trillion. Indeed, there could be no other outcome. Had the Federation Council started to wage a struggle over the budget, it would have become obvious to everyone that the senators had assumed total responsibility for the country's extrabudgetary existence. Naturally, they had no wish to shoulder this burden. Moreover, President Yeltsin made it perfectly clear two weeks ago that all the key budget figures had been agreed with Viktor Chernomyrdinn, Ivan Rybkin, and Vladimir Shumeyko. It is pointless to bewail the sickly defense budget now. The most important thing is to flesh out the intention of the president, government, and parliamentarians to eliminate the defense budget deficit by means of extrabudgetary appropriations. You are prompted to draw the conclusion that there are few statesmen in our time capable of resisting the temptation to demonstrate their concern over defense problems. But when it comes to making a decision, quite different interests prevail. To be honest, the stance of those who opposed 55 trillion from the very outset is far more understandable and attractive. But such people, those who did not break into "defense rhetoric," were few in number.
