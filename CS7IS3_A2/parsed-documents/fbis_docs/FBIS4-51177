Wu returned to Taiwan by air today. Wu Yan-kun began his activities in the mainland in 1989, and he often visited Shanghai, Beijing, Nanjing, and Xian, where he distributed his own books, "Great Prediction" and "Full Collection of Savior's Messages," and tapes like "Truth of the Cross" and "The Revelation" to propagate "God's prediction" that "the world's doomsday will be in the year of 2018." He spread such heresy as "our days are numbered, so we should commemorate the creator in the declining days in order to move onto the path leading to paradise." The Shanghai police said that Wu's activities had endangered social security and had disrupted the order of normal religious activities and had produced certain evil effects.
