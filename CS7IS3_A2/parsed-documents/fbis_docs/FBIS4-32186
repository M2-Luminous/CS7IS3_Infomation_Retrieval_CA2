According to information received by the Slovak press, the reason for the cancellation of what had been scheduled originally as "a friendly tourist visit" was the situation that had developed in Russia. Zhirnovskiy and his associates regard that situation as too dangerous for the party leader to be absent for four or five days abroad. Meanwhile, very significant confidence-building documents have been produced at the expert level, as a result of which a Deportation Treaty will be signed between Hungary and Slovakia in May (or at least the Slovak side so expects), and at least one border-crossing point will be opened. It has not yet been decided which of the three border-crossing points will be the one to be opened while the Boross government is still in office, but the signing of the Deportation Treaty has been decided, at least by the Slovak side. A dispute arose between the two countries due to Slovakia's other deportation treaties, because they anticipated that Hungary would become the "reception center" for refugees. As a result of talks between experts, held in Budapest on 11 May, the contracting parties agreed to take back their own citizens in the normal way and to classify arrivals from third countries into three categories. It was already indisputable earlier that when citizens of a third country held residence permits or visas, the contracting parties were willing to proceed in accordance with international norms. In the case of persons staying illegally in the other country's territory, a refugee from a third country will be accepted back within 48 hours, even it can be proved that he had arrived from the contracting party's country, where he had likewise been staying illegally. This provision of the treaty goes beyond the customary treaties and presupposes an agreement that suggests good relations between the two countries. In the Slovak side's opinion, it is not necessary to wait with the signing of the treaty until a new government has been formed. That would be an unnecessary delay during the summer tourist season.
