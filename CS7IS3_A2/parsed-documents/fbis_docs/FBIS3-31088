He said that, in the event of endangerment, the entire peacekeeping forces would be pulled out, and not just the units of individual states. He refused, however, to assess the political situation and decisions by the UNPROFOR commander in the Balkan conflict. He said that our UNPROFOR members have been operating in Sarajevo for nine months and stressed that "they want to serve there and do not even want to be replaced." Their "general security" in the Bosnian capital is guaranteed, he said. In reply to our question about his view of the stand adopted by Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev, who, according to a TA SR report, rejected the possibility of UN military intervention in the area of the Bosnian conflict, Slovak Minister of Defense Imrich Andrejcak said that the Russian Government had not officially issued any such statement. "I do not know the statement to which you refer, and, therefore, I am not going to comment on it. As for the operation of our battalion, with the deadline mentioned [in the NATO Council ultimatum] approaching, the UNPROFOR command will adopt measures to protect its own units. We need not worry." According to Minister Andrejcak, at present there is no reason to withdraw Slovak UNPROFOR units from former Yugoslavia. "Measures will be adopted so that they are not in the endangered zone," he added. According to information provided by the Ministry of Defense of the Slovak Republic, the engineering battalion of the Army of the Slovak Republic on the territory of former Yugoslavia is deployed in Croatia and is subordinated to the UNPROFOR command.
