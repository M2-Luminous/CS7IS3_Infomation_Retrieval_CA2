FR940902-0-00083 FR940902-0-00010 Comments generally addressed two issues: Interfacing with the Employment Service (ES), and the preference of older individuals for immediate job placement. With regard to the Employment Service, many questioned the ability of the local ES office to provide adequate services to JTPA participants. They were concerned that ES may lack in-house expertise to provide sufficient assistance for groups with special needs. Citing the provisions in the Act governing the determination of duplicative services, several commenters believed that the ability of the ES office to provide assistance to special needs groups should be a criterion for this determination. Others pointed out that, since job search activities are a critical part of any ISS, and service providers have already established successful networks of employer contacts, ES offices should not be the presumptive deliverer for providing adequate job search activities for all participants. These commenters suggested that §628.535(d) be either deleted or revised to permit SDA's to determine whether to use the ES to provide job search services. On the other hand, several commenters stated that allowing SDA's to determine unilaterally whether adequate job search assistance is available through the local ES office (§628.535(c)(2)) defeats one of the basic goals of the Amendments: To focus JTPA on providing more training and less stand-alone job placement. Unless there is a mechanism for ES input into the determination as to whether job search services are available, the concern is that an SDA could simply assert that services are not available to avoid coordinating with the ES, leading to duplication. One suggestion was that the Governor decide the criteria for the availability of job search assistance. Another commenter stated that any requirement to document that job search services are unavailable from the ES for each participant or training program should be done only once per program year or Job Training Plan cycle. Another commenter pointed out that because job search assistance was defined as a service ``designed to give a participant skills in acquiring full-time employment,'' and the local job service office was considered the appropriate purveyor of these skills (§628.535(d)), this provision should be removed because ES offices may not always be able to provide such services. The Department decided not to remove §628.535(d) because it interprets section 204(c)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act to accord the employment service a special status in terms of providing job search. Also, this provision of the Act is not substantially different from the provisions of sections 107 and 141 of the Act which prohibit duplication of services. It remains to be determined whether job search assistance is universally available within each community from the Employment Service. The SDA may look at whether local employment service resources are sufficient to provide the job search assistance for all potential JTPA referrals. The final rule, at §628.535(d), is amended to indicate that a determination is to be made by the SDA in active consultation with the employment service and other public agencies. These determinations must be documented in the SDA's job training plan since the employment service is on the PIC and coordination with the employment service is among the topics to be included in the plan. Standardized inquiries regarding local job search assistance availability from the employment service may be developed by the Governor in consultation with the State ES Director. A number of commenters representing older workers recommended either a waiver of the stand-alone job search limitations for this population or a provision allowing the Governor to request a waiver when sufficient evidence demonstrates that the interests of older workers would not be well served by these limitations. These commenters recognized the priority placed on training for younger individuals but expressed doubts that career training was a realistic and relevant goal for older workers who, generally are not attracted to long-term assistance that mandates skills training, who do not thrive in classroom training designed for youth and young adults, and who do not tend to seek assistance from the ES or other public agency environments. For these reasons, several commenters asked that older workers, or the older worker set-aside program, be exempted from this section altogether and that job search assistance be a service strategy for this population without justification in the ISS. The Department considered these comments carefully and has decided that, like all title II&hyph;A participants, older worker participants require assessment and need a justification in the ISS for stand-alone job search activities. However, a new §628.535(e) is added in the final regulations to recognize the preference of older individuals for immediate job placement and to provide some flexibility in recognition of the special characteristics of older workers. The Department's view is that this provision should not establish a routine practice to avoid the provision of needed training services. The intent of the JTPA program remains to provide needed services to the hard to serve, including older workers.
