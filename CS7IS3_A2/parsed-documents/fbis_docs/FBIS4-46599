Legend has it that it got its name from Peter I. One day when the young sovereign was sailing completed ships north along the Don he weighed anchor at the mouth of an unnamed stream. Strong drinks were poured into goblets, but there proved to be one goblet too many. "This goblet is for god [Bogu charka siya]," Petr said in jest, knocking it back. From that day the stream became the Bogucharka and the town got its name from it. Now the once quiet rayon center in the very south of the oblast is experiencing a rebirth. "Life in Boguchar is changing drastically," the rayon newspaper SELSKAYA NOV wrote in a May issue. "And as we know the foundation to this change was laid by the transfer of an armored division from Germany. Some 7,000 people will come to us, as many as live in the rayon center now...." I do not know how it is for the Boguchar inhabitants but for the servicemen of the 10th Ural-Lvov Volunteer Armored Division which has come here from Germany life in a new place has indeed changed drastically. For the worse, unfortunately. Before the armored troops arrived it was planned to construct at a preferential rate at least the main establishments -- barracks, headquarters, storehouses, shelters for equipment, as was done for other troops arriving on the territory of the Moscow Military District. I shall note that construction was still being carried out 12-18 months ago when there were funds. Now only ferroconcrete posts rise up alone in place of barracks. All the heavy vehicles -- and that includes modern T-80 tanks and 152mm self-propelled artillery mount vehicles -- are in the open air. There are not even any fences or roads -- after each rainfall you can neither walk nor drive across the black earth. "In fact the division has been put out of action for the time being," Major General Yevgeniy Vorobyev, a task force leader from Voronezh, agrees with me. "But we are not to blame -- the corps too is only being created and the Moscow Military District has given us what it can. There is no one in the division to service the vehicles -- soldiers under contract (almost all tank crews in the regiments consisted of volunteers) have not extended their contracts and have gone home. The majority of officers and ensigns are on leave and we do not know which of them will serve in this `hinterland.'" Indeed, the armored troops have been unlucky, so to speak, in their new stationing. The country is wonderful here, but the infrastructure is very underdeveloped. It is 65 km to the nearest railroad station, Kantemirovka. Fuel is delivered from Voronezh, 250km away. Even water is brought in. It was not only strategic aims which were being pursued in the early nineties when the venue for the 10th division's withdrawal was determined. I was told at the corps headquarters that the deciding factor was that Bogucharskiy Rayon agreed to take in the armored troops, counting on the city being built up and on the railroad being extended to the rayon center.... "Why are there so few people in the fields?" I asked Colonel Vladimir Skokov, the division's deputy commander, a Muscovite, incidentally, who says he does not want to return to the capital. "After all the formation's withdrawal is virtually coming to an end?" "But where are people to go?" Vladimir Viktorovich answers one question with another. "There is no housing, even containers with their personal belongings are a problem to accommodate. In addition many have children at school. So they have gone their separate ways. Some have taken their families to their parents, some are still in Germany. But in a month or two the main backbone of the division will be here...." One wants to hope that is how it will be. People will come to a new place but how will they serve here if there is just a small flag where the future headquarters should stand? "When do you think you will construct the barracks?" I asked a group of obviously bored construction workers. "No one knows," work superintendent Vladimir Pecherskiy spoke for them all." "If we had the funds we would complete construction in a few months. But we have not been paid wages for April yet and there is no money for construction materials. So we sit idle for weeks yet we are no less interested in work than the armored troops -- our families have nothing to live on." It has turned out that the local construction workers consist of Russian refugees who have come to Boguchar from Tajikistan. There are now several thousand of them in the city and they live where they can, half starving. To give them work the city administration has created the "Bogucharstroy" enterprise to erect the barracks and the division's vehicle pool facilities. They reckoned that the military department had the necessary funds and it would be possible to earn money. While Colonel Skokov and I were walking across the field where the construction should be I thought: This is where we should bring the State Duma and government politicians who, despite it all, try to put the Army on financial starvation rations! After all it is the uncertainty over the military budget and the lack of money which above all have struck a pitiless blow to the units withdrawn from remote and nearby foreign parts. In Boguchar, Yelnya, Vyazma, and other regions of the Moscow Military District. And not just in the Moscow Military District.... It is shameful to write but the armored troops are in fact living on the city's charity. They receive bread, food, and coal on credit. They do not even have the money to wash or to clean their clothes. Never mind combat readiness -- just surviving is enough! At the vehicle parking area of one regiment I met an officer with an armband -- the pool duty officer. He was Senior Lieutenant Dmitriy Slyusarenko, commander of a repair platoon. In rubber boots and dirty overalls he differed little from the construction workers. I do not write this to criticize him. It is hard to observe uniform regulations if you are in mud up to your knees and there are just a few officers for a tank regiment. They go on duty every other day. They have been living in a site hut without their families for over six months now. Slyusarenko, for instance, sent his wife to her parents in Tomsk. He has not received his wages for several months. He has already sold his videorecorder, his television set is next. He needs something to live on. All the division's officers and ensigns and their families are in this unenviable position. And under these conditions when, as one officer put it, the state has left them to look after themselves, the officers are continuing to serve. They are continue, I may add, on enthusiasm alone -- those who are not indifferent to the fate of the Russian Army and its future. From dawn until dusk the task forces from the regiment take in vehicles with freight, unload them by hand, and stack the munitions and food. They work without counting the time, without sparing their strength. But there is a limit to everything. They cannot pay for the construction of barracks out of their own pockets. And neither more nor less than 102 billion rubles must be paid to the rayon for the allocation of land for a testing range. "That price is fair, in strict accordance with the law on the land," I was told by Nikolay Zhmykhov, head of the Bogucharskiy Rayon administration. "We realize that the military department now has no money from the budget -- let them give us vehicles for the countryside, equipment for processing agricultural products in exchange. After all, we must seek a way out of the situation -- every summer day counts. Otherwise the division will spend the winter in tents...." The people who are not losing an hour, never mind a day, are the construction workers from Turkey. For German marks they will erect a whole town for the armored troops in Boguchar. Here there will be over 40 high-rise apartment blocks, a school with a pool and a greenhouse, two kindergartens, a sports center, a savings bank, and stores.... The cost of the contract is 153 million deutschemarks. The deadline for commissioning is August this year. According to Mr. Akhmad Sarvash [name as transliterated], the construction chief, they are also 4-6 weeks behind the construction schedule. It is for that reason that over 2,000 workers are now working on constructing the city in three shifts -- day and night. Let me add that all work here is automated and with that pace the construction will probably be completed on time. The first new apartments for the armored troops are planned for early August. ....I would like to end these far from gratifying notes with that impressive fact. But I cannot. Before my eyes is a peg with a little flag on the site of the future headquarters and a senior lieutenant in rubber boots standing along next to the tanks. How wet will they get under the rain and snow?
