A. Armand and K. I. Palatov, Radio Engineering and Electronics Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences] [Abstract] The last summary of research activity of the Radio Engineering and Electronics Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, covered the years 1983-1984. This review covers the years 1984-1992 inclusive and the most significant results obtained in each of the fields and subjects listed below are summarized. 1. Planetary radar and space radio physics (mapping of Venus by Venera 15 and Venera 16; study of Halley's comet (Vega project); study of Venusian atmosphere and ionosphere; study of the solar wind; study of physical conditions on Mars in connection with the "Fobos" project; radar observation of planets for checking accuracy of the relativistic theory of motion of planets; study of near space using artificial earth satellites). 2. Remote sensing of atmosphere and surface (study of electromagnetic emissions of different surface cover types in microwave range; active (radar) methods for remote sensing of atmosphere and surface; ecological and climatological aspects of remote sensing of land surfaces; remote sensing of ocean floor). 3. Radio wave propagation (propagation of radio waves in millimeter range; propagation of optical waves in atmosphere; study of atmosphere as medium for radio wave propagation). 4. Statistical radio physics (study of ULF and UHF electromagnetic noise (study of natural ULF and UHF electromagnetic fields; research on stochastic electromagnetic processes; study of complex signals and conditions for their discrimination from noise; development of analyzers of natural fields and weak signals and instruments for detecting earthquake precursors). 5. Electrodynamics of artificial media and structure in microwave range (electrodynamics of microwave antennas, resonators and waveguide elements; materials for microwave range (highly absorbing and with small losses; diffraction problems in microwave range).
