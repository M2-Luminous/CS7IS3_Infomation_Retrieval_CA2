This is the philosophy with which President Glavkos Kliridhis approaches the discussion of the confidence-building measures, which he has explained to various political officials. The president estimates that international circles are determined to press for the implementation of the confidence-building measures, considering them the beginning of the solution of the Cyprus issue. In the meantime, political circles make the following assessment: If there is no agreement on the "most important" issues and aspects of the problem this time, the Cyprus issue will remain unsettled in the long run and there will be gradual legalization of the current situation through the recognition of the pseudostate. The same political circles stressed that in a period when the international community has recognized almost 20 new states and ministates, it will not be particularly sensitive about recognizing one more.
