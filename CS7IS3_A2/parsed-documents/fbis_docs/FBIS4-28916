FBIS4-28916 "dreas115_j_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-115 Daily Report 4 Jun 1994 Indonesia House Criticizes New Investment Policy House Criticizes New Investment Policy BK1506110394 Jakarta THE INDONESIA TIMES in English 4 Jun 94 p 1 BK1506110394 Jakarta THE INDONESIA TIMES English BFN [Text] DPR [House of Representatives] criticizes the government's decision to let foreign investors enter the local mass media business as it violates the existing press law (UU No. 21/1984), hampering national unity and the Pancasila state ideology. The government issued the Regulation Number 20/1994 on Tuesday allowing foreign investors to have more than 50 percent shares in various businesses, including local mass media. On the other hand, foreign investors and executives are allowed to enter the local mass media. Chairperson of the Commission I [in charge of foreign affairs, defense, security, and information] Aisyah Amini of the United Development Party (PPP) urged government to review its decision and reminded that mass media is still strategic in the national development. She said that the foreign investment on mass media will hamper national unity and against the press law. National press in the developing countries has strategic role like informing public opinion and channelling people's aspiration. She suspected that foreign investors will not merely cope with commercial matters but also with political [ones], and this will influence the national ideology. "It ruins national press idealism," she added. MP Zamhari of the Golkar [Functional Group] group said that government should reconsider the decision and reminded that this regulation is against the press law. He said that press law should not be "defeated" by such government's regulation and any policy must be based on constitutional ground. Any deviation from this should be handled in the frame of constitution, he said. "Don't let ambition to attract foreign investment hamper our national unity," he stressed. Any expansion of investment must not endanger our ideology, politics, and sociocultural systems, the MP added seriously. Aminullah Ibrahim of the Armed Forces Group expressed his concern over the regulation. He said there is no reason to implement the policy and he reminded that foreign investments in mass media will surrender our sensitive communication and information system to the foreigners. "They can suppress us to accept their ideas, and this is dangerous," he said. "Don't let foreign powers intervening our strategic sectors," Aminullah added. MP Sabam Sirait of the Indonesian Democratic Party Group in the House told reporters here on Friday that government's decision is premature and it crushes Law Number 21/1984 on the national press. In the other word, Sabam added further, the Regulation Number 20/1994 is invalid.
