Sun Weiben successively travelled to some war industrial enterprises with difficulties of varying degrees in their current production and operation, including the Songjiang Electric Machinery Plant, Dongguang Machinery Plant, and Jiancheng Machinery Plant to understand, in details, their production and their workers' living, jointly explored measures to help them extricate from predicaments along with cadres and workers, and helped them solve some practical problems. Sun Weiben said: War industrial enterprises have excellent factory buildings and equipment and fairly high quality workers and cadres. Many experts and talents are concentrated there. The war industrial enterprises are worthy of esteem because they can maintain unity at the higher and the lower level, work hard, advance despite difficulties and make big strides to guarantee the transfer of servicemen to civilian jobs under an extremely difficult situation. This spirit is the first light leading the war industrial enterprises towards extrication from their predicament. Whenever he travelled to an enterprise, he stressed that cadres at all levels should change work styles, go deeply to the grass roots, support and help the poor, and ensure that the broad masses of workers have a peaceful Spring Festival. At Dongguang Machinery Plant, Sun Weiben went to a dormitory for single workers, and asked about the lives of workers. [passage omitted] At the workshop of a war industrial enterprise, Sun Weiben conscientiously examined the production lines of military and civilian products, and asked detailed questions about the development orientation of civilian products, the product property, and technological content. Sun Weiben said: The fundamental way out for war industrial enterprises is to switch to production of civilian products, and the crucial issue that remains is the selection of products for production. At present, the astronautics industrial enterprises have changed their production line and achieved fairly good results. Owing to various historical and practical reasons, the arms industry's enterprises face fairly great difficulties. However, as long as they persist in serving the market, give play to advantages, and adjust product orientation, they will see the first light of dawn. After affirming these enterprises' plans of developing civilian products, Sun Weiben said: It is necessary to give play to the advantage war industrial enterprises possess of having equipment, technology and trained personnel, and develop technology and value-added products that can have a big market, and enable them to reach a fair scale. In carrying out new construction and transformation projects, we should break with common practice, start construction quickly, and put them into production rapidly. We may let relevant provincial departments take the lead, organize specialists of scientific research institutes with achievements to visit some war industrial enterprises, and introduce some new items to war industrial enterprises in an effort to help them switch production to civilian products. We will serve as "match-makers" in this regard. During his investigtion and studies, Sun Weiben repeatedly stressed: If war industrial enterprises fail to thoroughly emancipate the minds, it will be very difficult for them to change their production to civilian products, to start the second pioneering program, and to extricate themselves from their predicament. He said: War industrial enterprises have long been shackled by the planned economic structure, and some still do not dare to move one step in the minefield or jump out from a definite circle. If they "stick to this rule," when will they be able to switch production to civilian products? Sun Weiben said: The "three criteria" is a major principle and proceeding from reality is a major policy. So long as things are conducive for war industrial enterprises to extricate themselves from the predicament, we may try whatever methods we have. We will be good examples so long as we can solve our problems. [passage omitted] On hearing that Songjiang Electrical Machinery Plant has prepared to introduce foreign capital to raise the production capacity and quality of beer, Sun Weiben said: War industrial enterprises should dare to break through the forbidden zone. They may produce civilian products under the name of other brands, introduce foreign capital for grafting and transformation, or may even sell part of their idle assets and land. Sun Weiben fully affirmed the measures of these war industrial enterprises that set up small accounting units for independent operation. He said: Setting up small accounting units and allowing workshops and sub-plants to operate independently is good for mobilizing the enthusiasm of the grass roots and urging them to follow the path of supporting themselves through their own labor and assuming sole responsibility for their profits and losses. One plant may adopt two or even three systems, and should strive to vitalize each and every workshop if possible. [passage omitted] Sun Weiben expressed that the provincial authorities will do everything possible to create conditions for war industrial enterprises to overcome difficulties. As for those problems which cannot be solved, the provincial authorities will report them to the state with the coordination of competent departments of war industrial enterprises. Governor Yang Zhihai, and responsible comrades of the General Office of the provincial party committee, the Policy Research Office of the provincial party committee, the General Office of the provincial government, and the provincial National Defense Work Office also participated in the investigation and studies.
