"The IMF reduces our salaries," "the moral revolution is killing the people," and "the rooster is screwing us up from early on," were slogans chanted by demonstrators, who criticized the administration of Carlos Roberto Reina. Reina, who took office on 27 January, used "moral revolution" as his campaign slogan to stop corruption as well as a "red rooster" as a symbol to convey his idea of "a new dawn" for the people with a "new government style." Reina stated that his government's "hands are tied" by such problems inherited from the previous administration as the 11.2-percent fiscal deficit, the $3.6-billion foreign debt, and $450-million annual foreign debt payments. The demonstrators asked for a 100-percent general wage increase, inflation control, a decrease in the price of staples and housing, as well as comprehensive agrarian and forest reform programs to preserve the environment. The day before the demonstration the government approved a 30-percent average increase in inter city collective transportation fees. Repeated unofficial reports indicate that there will be a devaluation of the lempira, the national currency, as well as new hikes in fuel and electricity prices. These rumors have raised further concern among grass-roots sectors. Experts said that over 5,000 demonstrators demanded jail sentences for officials and former officials of the National Enterprise for Electric Power because they believe these officials' mistakes have caused electricity rationing of 35 hours per week throughout the country. The government faces negotiations with teachers who demand a salary increase. The government must also deal with a conflict concerning salary payments between the owners of the almost defunct company Honduran Air Services, Incorporated, and over 400 workers of this company. The demonstrators asked people to unite and to support their demands, and they announced new and larger demonstrations in the coming days. The government of former President Rafael Leonardo Callejas began in 1990 a rigorous economic adjustment program with the support of such financial organizations as the IMF and the World Bank. The grass-roots sectors repeatedly rejected that program and, according to analysts, it caused the electoral defeat of the conservative National Party of Honduras.
