Members of the inter-party group of eight Japanese legislators said Li made the remarks in a 45-minute meeting with them. The group arrived in Taipei on Tuesday to discuss the issue of some 452.4 million yen of unsettled debts, including postal savings deposited by Taiwanese before and during World War II. Their talks on the issue Wednesday with 18 Taiwan legislators headed by Liu Sung-pan, head of the National Assembly, ended inconclusively. Li was quoted as thanking the Japanese parliamentarians for facing the tough issue head-on, despite tough remarks directed at them by the Taiwanese side. Such remarks, he said, probably stem from dissatisfaction with the Japanese Government's "cool" stance towards Taiwan after Taiwan severed relations with Japan in 1972. He noted that Taiwan, unlike other former Japanese colonial possessions, has not brought up with Japan the issue of compensation for women who were forced to provide sex for frontline Japanese soldiers during the war.
