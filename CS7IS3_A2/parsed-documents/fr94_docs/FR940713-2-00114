FR940713-2-00114 FR940713-2-00064 We note that section 1006(c) of the Copyright Code states that the allocation of the Sound Recordings Fund shall be made according to the extent sound recordings were distributed, and that the allocation of the Musical Works Fund shall be made according to the extent musical works were distributed or disseminated to the public in transmissions. We should like, therefore, to know: (a) Do industry data exist, or can industry data be produced, that will demonstrate validly the distribution of sound recordings in the United States? (b) Do industry data exist, or can industry data be produced, that will demonstrate validly the dissemination of musical works to the public in transmissions in the United States? (c) How should ``distributed'' be defined given the practice of allowable returns? Should the arbitrators employ the rule adopted by the Copyright Office with respect to section 115? 5 5 With respect to the 17 U.S.C. 115 mechanical license, ``distributed'' is defined as occurring when ``the person exercising the compulsory license has voluntarily and permanently parted'' with possession of the phonorecord. The Copyright Office has taken the position that permanent distribution of phonorecords occurs one year from the date that the compulsory licensee parts with possession, or at the time when a sale of the phonorecord is recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or according to the IRS' practices, whichever of these events comes earlier. 42 FR 64889, 64892 (Dec. 29, 1977). (d) If methodologies exist for the production of data relating to (a) and (b), what are the drawbacks of such methodologies? (e) If methodologies exist for the production of data relating to (a) and (b), would the data cover all distributions and all public disseminations so that even the smallest or most specialized claimant can be compared mathematically to the larger claimants? (f) If the methodologies cannot cover the smaller claimants, what measurements can be proposed to cover them? (g) If conflicting methodologies exist, how do the parties propose to resolve the conflicts? We emphasize that we are not asking these questions to decide distribution issues. Distribution issues are properly for the CARP arbitrators. But if we can in any way help to focus and sharpen the proceedings, the savings in time and expense before a CARP panel will far outweigh the cost of this one public meeting. The public meeting will give the parties an opportunity to explore the positions of each claimant, facilitate concentrating on solving the evidentiary problems, and reveal what further steps need to be taken. A public record of the meeting will be made for those who do not attend, and for the benefit of the CARP panel, if one is ultimately convened. VI. The Nonfeatured Musicians and the Nonfeatured Vocalists Subfunds A. Background_1993 The Audio Home Recording Act established two funds: the Sound Recordings Fund and the Musical Works Fund. Within the Sound Recordings Fund, the Act further established four subfunds: the Copyright Owners Subfund, the Featured Artists Subfund, the Nonfeatured Musicians Subfund, and the Nonfeatured Vocalists Subfund. With regard to the Nonfeatured Musicians Subfund and the Nonfeatured Vocalists Subfund, the Act outlined certain specific procedures. It required that ``25/8 percent of the royalty payments allocated to the Sound Recordings Fund shall be placed in an escrow account managed by an independent administrator jointly appointed by the interested copyright parties described in section 1001(7)(A) and the American Federation of Musicians (or any successor entity) to be distributed to nonfeatured musicians (whether or not members of the American Federation of Musicians or any successor entity) who have performed on sound recordings distributed in the United States.'' Similarly,``13/8 percent of the royalty payments allocated to the Sound Recordings Fund shall be placed in an escrow account managed by an independent administrator jointly appointed by the interested copyright parties described in section 1001(7)(A) and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (or any successor entity) to be distributed to nonfeatured vocalists (whether or not members of the American Federation [of] Television and Radio Artists or any successor entity) who have performed on sound recordings distributed in the United States.'' 17 U.S.C. 1006. In 1993, the Copyright Royalty Tribunal adopted a regulation, ultimately reissued by the Library of Congress and the Copyright Office when the Tribunal was abolished, that required the independent administrator to give notice to the government of his or her selection by March 31 of each year. 37 C.F.R. 311.4; 58 FR 53822 (1993).
