The partner states of the European Union [EU] adopted the Maastricht Treaty with great noise and much ado. The treaty continues to create controversy to this day. Yet in the next few weeks, the Community of Twelve is preparing to change its face even more: almost beyond recognition, some fear. Nevertheless, this is taking place without much fuss. By the end of the month the enlargement negotiations with Finland, Norway, Austria, and Sweden should -- or have to -- be concluded, so that these four EFTA [European Free Trade Association] countries can join the EU at the beginning of next year. The Community will thus not only grow to 16 members but rather follow a guiding star into the future. The Community of the six founding states was still characterized by the war, which taught them that political thinking free of illusions must lead to integration, the common base for national sovereignty if the danger of war is to be banned once and for all. The current Club of Twelve is dominated by romantic solidarity thinking: All for one, especially the North for the South. It is France and the Mediterranean countries that are keeping up the flag of integration, and it would be unfair to surmise that they were only interested in political or economic net balances. "Deepening (the Community) before (its) enlargement," is the motto, with which Commission President Jacques Delors wanted to prevent new members from throttling the pace on the path "toward an ever closer union." Yet, this is exactly what cannot be avoided. In theory, the character of the Community must not be significantly changed by the fact that it becomes larger. Apart from a few restrictions, the governments of the four membership candidates have readily accepted the treaty, on the basis of which the Community functions, even including the future project of joint foreign, security, and defense policy. It would be naive, however, to assume that the mentality of the current Twelve would remain unaffected by the arrival of such self-willed nations as the Nordic ones. The Swedes and Norwegians are more than capable of doing what the Danes could, who initially rejected the Maastricht Treaty. In a union of 15 or 16, a new -- at least relative -- majority will emerge, which, despite all loyalty to the Community, will instinctively try to prevent any more powers being shifted to Brussels. Minimum of Consensus In doing so, it will not even have to try very hard, because, one thing is, that the enlargement of the Union is providing the ground for its extension to the East. One can bet that the Poles, Hungary, and the two successor states to Czechoslovakia will join the Union earlier than the Germans are hoping and the French would like. In a Community of 20 or even more highly differing sovereign states, the federalists will probably have to forget their ideas of a European federal state for another generation. Edmund Stoiber does not even have to try so hard. Even in the Community of the Twelve the minimum consensus is hardly ever achieved. The other thing is that one must not forget that all has gotten into a phase of economic decline. The times in which a generous America provided security cheaply and the standard of living increased as if by a natural law are over for the moment. In such times, loyalty to the European idea quickly changes into concern for one's pocket. From the negotiators of the Nordic entry candidates one can easily gather anyway that what makes the Union attractive for them is the single market, while they accept the remaining "achievements" of the work of European unification, specifically its agricultural policy and the subsidy fund, rather as ballast. After all, Finland has lost parts of its vital markets in the East. Unworthy Game The four membership candidates thus, consistently argue that the difference between membership in the Union and the "European Economic Area" (EEA), to which they already belong, is that it is not important to have the single market but to sit at the table of the Council of Ministers in Brussels and to have a say in how this market is created and shaped. Only Norway -- because of its rich fishing grounds and energy resources -- does not really need it, which makes Union immediately look less attractive. Even the Austrians might be deterred if they have to vote on it in a referendum in June, perhaps tired of the really unworthy game to which it has been subjected by Brussels? Its application for membership reached Brussels five years ago, when it was denigrated as an attempt at a new "Anschluss" via Europe's front door. Because of this long waiting time alone, which is a disgrace for the EU, it is necessary to conclude the entry negotiations in the next few rounds. Failure to do so would not be proof of big problems of substance but of the fact that a strong faction within the Twelve continues to believe that it can preserve a Europe as deeply integrated as possible, in which the center of gravity would still lie in Paris and Germany would remain a border country. So one has to say that 28 February will necessarily have to be the deadline, since some candidates will otherwise be unable to ratify their accession in time. In Sweden, for example, Parliament must hold two votes, with the second one having to take place at least six months after the first and with a new election of Parliament in the meantime. Not forgetting the European Parliament, which should be asked for support before it is dissolved in late spring for reelection. The candidates are pressing for accession on 1 January 1995, when the process of revising the Maastricht Treaty will start, in which they quite rightly want to participate. Such pressure of time is, of course, enticing for the opponents of enlargement, which is why they are tightening this screw. Asking the four candidates to reduce the prices for their agricultural prices overnight to Community level, that is to say by up to 40 percent, instead of granting them the traditional transition periods looks like a nasty trick. This is how one can paralyze the talks and nourish the hope that, in the referendum, the scales will here and there tend toward a no. Yet, these obstructionists will ultimately not gain the upper hand. The Community needs the economically strong EFTA countries if it wants to shoulder the burden that is approaching from the East. This is, at the same time, Germany's special cause, and France knows that it has to put aside its idea of an integrated Europe for the time being and give priority to these interests to prevent Germany from feeling left in the lurch. After all, the partners in Bonn and Paris are in agreement that Europe must not be divided again on the fine-selection for EU membership. A lot can be achieved on the basis of this agreement.
