The respectability of the Albanian rights constitutes an important element of stability in the whole region. Firstly, in this framework Albania is interested in achievement in conformity to the international laws as soon as possible of the population census and the demands of the Albanians should be taken seriously by the census law. At the same time was stressed the good will of the Albanian side to offer its territorial advantages for the passing of goods, because Macedonia suffers from Greek embargo. Not only for this reason but also foreseeing the future development of economical and commercial relationship with Macedonia, Albanian authorities pointed out the readiness for the further intensification of the relations, making concrete proposals to specific fields.
