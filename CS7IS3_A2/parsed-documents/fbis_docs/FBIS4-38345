Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and Turkish President Suleyman Demirel signed a joint statement that confirms the two countries' mutual desire to develop friendly relations, aim their political moves at strengthening stability in the Black Sea region, and intensify cooperation for the good of both nations. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko and his Turkish counterpart signed a protocol on exchange of ratification instruments to the treaty on friendship and cooperation between Ukraine and Turkey, as well as an interstate agreement on cooperation in the sphere of tourism. An intergovernmental agreement on international road transport was signed by Ukraine's Transport Minister Oprest Klympush. After signing the Ukrainian-Turkish documents, Demirel and Kravchuk answered questions from journalists. [Begin Demirel recording in Turkish with superimposed Russian translation] Turkey and Ukraine are the region's two largest countries, and they feel a responsibility for friendship and peace in the region. Therefore, their cooperation benefits the maintaining of peace in the region and in the world, benefits their people. During Mr. Kravchuk's visit to Turkey in 1992 we signed an agreement on friendship and cooperation in the trade sphere. There are no political problems between Turkey and Ukraine. Turkey is against any conquest of territories by force, against interference in any country's internal affairs. Like the rest of the countries, we support Ukraine in the defense of its territorial integrity. Crimea is Ukraine's internal affair. [end recording] [Begin Kravchuk recording] Indeed, Crimea is Ukraine's internal problem, but since it affects many problems in the Black Sea region, we support the principle stipulated by the Black Sea Parliamentary Assembly and the treaty that this region is a region of peace and cooperation, and that it should be strengthened by confidence-building among the states existing and working in this region. It means that the problem of Crimea here is a Ukrainian problem, but we would not like Crimea to upset the balance, the cooperation, and the relations that have been and will be established in the region. As far as our Crimean problems are concerned, these can be discussed separately, especially since the Supreme Council will address the problem again the day after tomorrow [1 June], and everyone interested can find out the details.
