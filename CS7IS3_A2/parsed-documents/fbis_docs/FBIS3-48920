Parliament passed an act regulating bad credits, while the cabinet and the IMF forged a third agreement which will in all likelihood be initialed early next year. Production slump continued throughout the year. GDP fell short of the 1993-projected 350 thousand million leva. GDP will total 270 thousand million leva, the National Statistical Institute says. The projected 27 thousand million leva budget deficit, or 8 percent of GDP, was exceeded and parliament updated the budget at the end of the year raising the deficit by 5.5 thousand million leva. Trade in 1993 was much lower as compared to 1992 which was a successful year for Bulgarian exports, statistics show. The Agency for Economic Coordination and Development's annual report indicates a $100-150 million export decrease every three months. Agricultural exports were half the 1992 level at the end of September. There are no major changes in the country's trade geography. Bulgaria's trade has three main trends. Nearly 30 percent is effected with the European Union (EU), another 30 percent of trade is done with the former Soviet Union and the ex-socialist countries with the rest covering other countries. The delay in the trade agreement with the EU and the Yugoembargo consequences entailed a livening up of trade with Greece, Turkey and Macedonia. Economists do not expect miracles from the trade agreement with the EU which took effect in December. The Privatization Agency, the Ministries of Trade, Industry, Agriculture and Construction sold 56 state enterprises throughout the year. The Ministry of Trade concluded 30 deals, the Ministry of Industry sold six light industry enterprises while the Ministry of Construction sold seven construction companies. The Sofia Municipal Privatization Agency announced 55 privatization procedures, held 127 auctions and two tenders. Just 40 percent of the other municipalities have started privatization. Council of Ministers Privatization Agency's Executive Director Mrs. Reneta Indzhova said too many institutions had been authorized to sell state property. The Privatization Agency sold a total of seven enterprises and payment is forthcoming on four of them. The state collected 2.8 thousand million leva in revenue. Five groups united 53 commercial banks of majority state holding throughout the year. The ambitious project of the Bank Consolidation Company on a restructuring of Bulgaria's banks remained halfway done. The institutionalization of new private banks was initiated. Three private projects were granted authorization by the National Bank of Bulgaria (BNB), while another four are waiting for a bank license. Big private business was united throughout the outgoing year. In late September, 12 private businessmen met with the intention of uniting and have since been known as the G-13. Two months later they formally founded the Confederation of Industrialists. Soon afterwards, in mid-December, big state business established an organization of their own. A total of 21 state-run companies instituted the association of Bulgarian state industry. Foreign trade companies, among which arms manufacturers like Kintex and Teraton, are the most important members. The national energy system functioned without electricity blackouts. Electric power cost was raised on two occasions. It went up 15 percent early in the year and another 50 percent in May. The cabinet is planning a third 67 percent rise at the beginning of 1994. In the credit accord with the World Bank, the cabinet pledged to raise the cost to 3.5 cents per kw/h in June, 1994, the current price being around 2 cents.
