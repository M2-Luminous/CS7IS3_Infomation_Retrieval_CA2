R15 Billion for Defense Enterprises: Rust Will Fly No More"] [Text] Today every child knows that there are certain protective rings around Moscow, but what are these rings? M. Rust's flight along the route FRG-Red Square is well remembered. There were no rings protecting the city. What kind of defense system is this? Our correspondent discusses this with the commander of the Moscow Air Defense District, Colonel-General Anatoliy Kornukov. [Kornukov] Rings around the capital--this is too simplistic an idea of the air defense structure. Troops of the Moscow Air Defense District are deployed over a territory of 24 oblasts of Russia and they monitor the air space over an area of 1.3 million square kilometers. Large and small units of the district protect 141 facilities, including 59 military ones, 14--with radiation and nuclear hazards, 17--of high level state administration, and 11 large cities and industrial centers. As for the immediate defense of Moscow, I would not call this system rings. It is simply that at the beginning of the Cold War, when missiles for delivering nuclear weapons were created in the West, we began to deploy our air defense missile units around the city in two echelons. Incidentally, L. Beria was the first to work on the new defense system. At that time we began to arm ourselves with S-25 air defense missile systems. For those times this was a high class (the technical equipment served us for 30 years after that). Regiments equipped with these systems were deployed in such a way that Moscow was practically invulnerable. The defense included one external ring and one internal one. The former was located 100-120 kilometers from Moscow, and the latter--50-70 kilometers. That is the way it was after that as well. [Buldakov] But what changes have taken place? [Kornukov] By the end of the eighties a decision was made to create a new system. Now we can wage a controlled air defense missile battle with all flight equipment attacking both from the air and from space. Therefore the air defense system itself will soon be called an air-space system. The basis of this system is the S-300 air defense missile complex with various modifications. We have practically finished rearming ourselves. Field trials were held in 1993: More than 100 aircraft were "launched" over Moscow and all of them entered the capital zone at the same time. The air defense battle lasted a couple of minutes, and all the targets were conventionally fired on and destroyed. The new air defense missile complex can engage in combat with air attack equipment created under the Stealth program, that is, with the so-called "Stealth aircraft," for example, the familiar F-117 fighter-bombers. Using Moscow's air defense defense system it is possible to fire on 500 aircraft of various classes at the same time and destroy them simultaneously with one volley. These weapons are every bit as good, and in terms of many parameters (for example, the target location system) they surpass the renowned American Patriot complex, which proved itself so well in Desert Storm operations. [Buldakov] Are there still systems in the world for defense of large metropolitan areas like the Moscow system? [Kornukov] Like that--no. That is the only system of its kind. Without false modesty, it is the pride of our scientists. So many billions were invested in it...but it was worth it. One can say that nothing of the kind has been created around St. Petersburg. As for other large cities of Russia and also important facilities, they are protected in the overall air defense defense system. It is somewhat different from, say, the American one. The United States regards the entire territory of its country as an especially important object. Washington, for example, has no special protection systems. The states place their hopes in the Air Force and Navy in remote regions. Russia has a territory almost three times as large as that of the United States and we do not have the forces or money to arrange defense this way... [Buldakov] What is the main thing state money is spent on in your department? [Kornukov] In keeping with the new military doctrine, we are relying not on the quantity but on the quality of new military equipment. For example, we are replacing the obsolete MiG-23, SU-15, and MiG-25 aircraft which cannot successfully resist cruise missiles. And the SU-27 and MiG-31 are quite excellent at this. At the present time 95 percent of the air defense missile forces are equipped with various modifications of the S-300 arms system. New equipment requires colossal expenditures. In order to guarantee to down one cruise missile it is necessary to launch at least two to four of our own from the S-300 complex. All this plus the work of the people amounts to approximately R320 million. One hour of flight of a modern fighter, waging air combat and destroying three or four targets, costs more than R7 million. In 1993, 40 percent of the missile units went through training with weapons fire and 70 percent of the fighter aircraft regiments went through the testing ground. The marks were high: Of the 62 targets on the testing ground, 59 were destroyed. So I can say with good reason that the skies over Moscow are protected. [Buldakov] From whom? Are the Western countries still considered to be our main potential enemies? How do the Russian air defense defense troops feel about their colleagues from the former Union republics? [Kornukov] As for the West, not all of the missiles that were aimed at Moscow have been aimed somewhere else. Well, we are working successfully with air defense defense forces, for example, of Ukraine and Belarus: We notify one another about aircraft that are coming from our territories. We are very sensitive to aircraft that carelessly come without notification. The Baltic republics are frequently guilty of this. Sometimes we force the aircraft to return to the airfield from which it took off. But we hope that we will never use weapons against our former friends in the Union. It is impossible to allow a free-for-all in the sky. We must agree on "corridors." Soon, when the Western Group of Forces takes its fighters up, we will especially need these corridors. [Buldakov] And, finally, a question inevitably arises as soon as the topic comes around to modern weapons. How safe are they from accidents? Are we sure some untrained soldier will not press the wrong button? [Kornukov] We have never placed ignoramuses in front of the radar screen or behind the wheel of those immense missile transporters. Only trained officers are seated at the "buttons." At the airfields the equipment is again serviced by officers and warrant officers. Basically we do not have enough enlisted men and noncommissioned officers. And in the last fall-winter callup the plan was fulfilled by only 8 percent. But I think that in two or three years we will eliminate such things as having majors stand guard or be in a detachment for loading coal. There are 2,400 military servicemen on duty in the air defense defense system 24 hours a day. More than 10,000 people are serving under contract (more than half of them are women). There are officer teams capable of waging combat without enlisted men and noncommissioned officers. The wages of a fighter pilot (captain, major) are R150,000-160,000 plus 30 percent of the salary for special duty. And food is free. Judge for yourself how much that is when the salary of our district commander when translated into dollars is barely half as much as that of a sergeant in the U.S. Air Force.
