The documents were provoked by the suprise success of Vladimir Zhirinovsky's ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic Party and communists in the Dec. 12 elections in Russia. The Latvian political elite may start restricting democracy in the republic to please Great Russian chauvinists, the statement said. The governments of the free world countries should prevent "restrictions of human rights and freedoms, and repressions against people loyal to the Latvian independence." The statement is distributed to foreign diplomats in Latvia. In the other statement the party urges the Latvian people to actively protest opression and totalitarism. Otherwise, Latvia may fall back into the yoke of the Russian imperialism, the statement said, because Latvia "still has not become part of the free world; it still lacks close links with other former Communist bloc countries; and the Latvian economy is managed by pro-Russian businessmen." The statement advises Latvians to react on any attempts against human rights and freedoms by means of civil resistance, like rallies and demonstrations. In case of Russian military aggression, the Latvian national defense forces should not obey orders to surrender their arms, the statement added. The National Democratic Party also protested its classification as a far right wing grouping. It claimed that, if so, the majority of European countries and the United States should be also viewed as radical rightists.
