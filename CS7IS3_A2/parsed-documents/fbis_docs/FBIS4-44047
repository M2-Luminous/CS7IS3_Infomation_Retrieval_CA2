He met President Glavkos Kliridhis last night and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas today. In a statement, Clark said the agreement that was expected on the confidence-building measures has not been reached, adding that Denktas did not give him the draft agreement on the confidence-building measures his side has prepared. He denied reports that he conveyed any messages in any form to both sides. Denktas said Clark did not give him any document or letter, as he had expected, because the UN secretary general succumbed, to use Denktas' expression, to Kliridhis' blackmail that if something like this happened he would submit his resignation. Denktas added that in his meeting with Clark, he asked why the United Nations has not yet prepared a supplementary report on the events since 31 May, which demonstrate the goodwill of the Turkish Cypriot side. He said that, considering the current facts, during his talks in Corfu Kliridhis will cite the UN secretary general's 31 May report, which puts the Turkish Cypriot side in a bad light, and will accuse it of a lack of political goodwill.
