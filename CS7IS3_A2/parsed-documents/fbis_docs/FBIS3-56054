Citing THE SUNDAY TIMES, Ukrainian television reported a U.S. Christmas present -- $12 billion in compensation for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons from the republic's territory. With this turn of events -- the sums offered previously did not exceed $500 million -- Ukrainian politicians of both the right wing and the left wing have, on the whole, approved of the prospect of signing the agreement. "A document on such a level could play an important role in stabilizing public opinion, but the interests of the three sides will hardly coincide in the details," A. Moroz, head of the Socialist Party of Ukraine, believes. Given such compensation, according to V. Filenko, leader of the democratic opposition, the Ukrainian Supreme Council should not have any complaints against the treaty. "Finances sober up politics," he said. "Economically, we cannot now afford nuclear weapons, and the hryvnya needs a stabilization fund, which can no longer be gotten anywhere." According to some data, there was talk in Washington of a considerably smaller sum, and the agreement of Congress is still needed to issue it. In the opinion of V. Chornovil, leader of the Ukraine People's Movement, President Kravchuk does not have powers to sign international documents on nuclear disarmament. "After the act of full and unconditional disarmament Ukraine would be thrust into the backwoods of the world community, and interest in it would be lost forever," he said. "There is hope, however, that parliament -- the future agreement is subject to compulsory ratification by it -- will not give its consent to this." Kiev regards the change in the original plan of Bill Clinton's European tour as almost the most significant victory for Ukrainian diplomacy over the past year.
