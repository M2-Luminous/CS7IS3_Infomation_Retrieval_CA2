The plan is based on Tibet's reality and follows the principle of carrying out the reform actively, prudently, slowly, orderly, appropriately, flexibly, and in an all-around way. The plan conforms with the basic national guidelines while taking into consideration Tibet's particular situation. The finance and tax system reform consists mainly of a new tax system, a finance management system under the separated taxation system, and an enterprise profits distribution system. While not deviating from the basic framework of the national tax reform, the region's tax system reform has made appropriate adaptations in light of Tibet's particular conditions. Specifically, the region will be somewhat different from the rest of the country in the range of incomes subject to different categories of taxation and in tax deferment, retention and abrogation of tax categories, the amount of expense deduction, applicable tax rates, and tax reduction and exemption. The number of tax categories is cut by half from 18 to nine, reflecting the characteristics of minority regions [ti xian le min zu qu yu de te dian]. Although the plan envisions an increase in taxation targets, it will retain the original preferential policies enjoyed by the region, thereby helping keep the total amount of taxes to be collected from increasing. As a result, the plan enables the masses of peasants and herdsmen to maintain their vested interests without adding even one cent of their tax burden. Regarding the finance management system under the separated taxation system, the region has formulated policies related to management at different levels. The principal guidelines are: The autonomous region and its prefectures and cities will each have well-defined revenues and expenditures based on their jurisdiction over administrative and financial matters; revenues from newly established tax categories will be divided among the autonomous region, prefectures or cities, and counties at a specific ratio; and the financial resources will be redistributed rationally between different areas. The formulated policies also contain provisions concerning the linkage between the past "contracted financial responsibility" system and the finance management system under the separated taxation system. Regarding the enterprise profits distribution system, the region will implement in an all-around way a reform package to separate taxes from profits among state-owned enterprises this year. Under the new system, revenues will be taxed at a proportional rate of 30 percent and the regulatory tax and energy and communications surcharges will be eliminated. With the exception of a few enterprises which generated huge profits, the overwhelming majority of the region's enterprises will be able to retain all their profits in the short run for use by themselves in accordance with the relevant regulations of the finance departments. Financial responsibility contracts signed with enterprises will remain valid until they mature.
