In addition to the strong yen and the stagnant domestic economy, the biggest threat of all is the comeback of the U.S. side. In order for them to be able to extract themselves from this difficult situation, it will be essential for [Japanese automakers] to forget their pride and embark on large-scale restructuring. "It may not be possible to protect the employment of union personnel amid just the framework of one finished car maker and one parts maker alone. The gap between firms is widening, with domestic production of finished car makers like Toyota, Nissan, Honda Motor, Mazda falling significantly. In the future, even our union will have to think about securing employment that transcends the limits of such groups and corporate keiretsu." This statement indicates the unprecedented feeling of crisis executives of Japan's largest union, Confederation of Japan Automobile Workers' Unions, have with respect to the recession. This union has as many as 820,000 members, including workers from finished car makers such as Toyota Motor and Nissan Motor, and parts makers such as Nippondenso and Unisia Jecs, as well as all the nation's dealers under its umbrella. Japanese automakers, which in the 1980's surpassed the leading makers of the world such as GM, Ford, Chrysler in the United States, Germany's Volkswagen (VW), and France's Peugeot and the like, and took their place as number one in the world, are facing a domestic sales slump and strong yen exchange rate that has exceeded expectations. They are experiencing a major crisis that "could sink the ship that had been Japan's key industry," according to Nissan Motor President Yoshifumi Tsuji. The U.S. side, looking askance at the slump of the Japanese makers, has achieved a comeback and even European makers such as VW, Mercedes Benz, are embarking on large scale restructuring. At this rate if the Japanese side stands idle, the possibility of a "U.S.-Japanese reversal" cannot be denied. One question is whether they can ride out this slump just by rationalization measures such as holding down the number personnel and reducing expenses. Another question is whether there is a likelihood of another domestic plant closing like Nissan's Zama plant. If the system of eleven finished car makers, which is rare in the world, were to collapse, could a natural selection or reorganization occur? Currently, at a time when "employment uneasiness" has become an urgent issue, it is natural that the labor leadership would have an elevated level of anxiety about the future of Japan's automotive industry. The Competitiveness Gap Between Japan and U.S. Suddenly Narrows "Isn't Chrysler going to exhibit the Neon?" On 23 October, the Tokyo Motor Show opened at the Makuhari Messe in Chiba. Since this was the thirtieth anniversary of the Motor Show, 352 firms from 15 nations of the world participated. It was the world's largest automobile show with an estimated number of visitors exceeding two million, but on the "Press Day" that was held in advance of general admission, the attention of the mass media was focussed on this one point. That is probably only natural. The Neon, on which Chrysler staked its fortune, is the strategic model developed last year by that company. And Chrysler has realized a miraculous comeback. Although a small car, it has the power of a medium size car class with an engine displacement of 2,000 cc and 132 horsepower. More threatening than anything else to Japanese makers is the fact that the sales price of the standard type equipped with both driver and passenger side airbags is thought to almost certainly be about $9,000, so it is less than the expensive $10,000 level. Unfortunately, exhibition of the Neon was delayed, but even so the topic of discussion was concentrated on U.S. cars. The amount of attention given to the all-important Japanese cars was lower than expected. The thing about the U.S. side that is attracting this much attention from mass media-related people is more than anything the recovery of competitiveness by U.S. cars. Actually, in the past two years, the power relationship between Japan and the U.S. has changed completely. "The idea of U.S. cars being prone to breakdowns has fallen by the wayside long ago. GM, Ford and Chrysler, through joint venture projects with Toyota, Mazda and Mitsubishi, respectively, have steadily improved productivity and quality. On the other had, Japanese cars have too much quality so that U.S. cars are superior in terms of price performance ratio," says an industry source. Particularly remarkable is the drop in price competitiveness [of Japanese cars] in the U.S. market. On the Japanese side, models in the same class are from $2,000 to $2,500 more expensive than their U.S. counterparts--a result of raising prices to deal with the strong yen. In the lower price car market of under $10,000 where the Japanese side was once unrivaled , U.S. cars like GM's Cavalier and Ford's Escort are holding top place. For that reason, the market share (consisting of the total which are produced locally in the U.S. as well as export cars) in the U.S. passenger car market in 1991 and 1992 in excess of 30 percent declined to 1.247 million units in the period from January to June, a 5 percent decrease over the same term of the previous year, and their share has also declined to 29.0 percent. In July to September the share recovered somewhat, but, says our industry source, "that was transitory because beginning in October there was a sale to clear out inventories prior to the introduction of 1994 models," so the probability is high that "it will drop again after October." The Sudden Improvement in Business Results on the U.S. Side Of course, "This doesn't mean that the Japanese makers have lost," says Honda Motor Company President Nobuhiko Kawamoto. "Japanese makers have stepped onto the same playing field as a result of the U.S. side improving quality, marketability and productivity." However, there some question whether there are any firms that have enough power to compete amid a situation where everything is against them in the sense that, according to Mazda President Yoshihiro Wada, "The strong yen slump this time is much more serious than last time. We cannot get a clue as to how to keep afloat in both the domestic and import markets." Actually, the gap in results between Japanese and U.S. has widened further. Chrysler posted a net profit of $720 million in fiscal 1992. Its LH car and Jeep Cherokee are performing favorably, and in the current fiscal 1993 it will renew its record for highest profits. Also, Ford, which was in the red last year is having good sales of the Taurus and F-Series truck, and will convert to a surplus this year. Even GM, which is continuing its tough battle, is embarking on large-scale restructuring, beginning such things as cutting its employees by 100,000, closing 21 plants, among other things. Meanwhile, what about Japanese makers? In fiscal 1992 Nissan Motor and Daihatsu Motor Co. ran their first current deficit since going public at 26.2 billion yen and 4.4 billion yen, respectively. Even in this fiscal year of 1993, there is a very good possibility that Nissan, Mazda, Fuji Heavy Industries, Isuzu Motor and others will post current deficits. Even the balance sheet of Toyota Motor, which is the largest and mightiest in Japan's manufacturing industry, showed wide-margin declines in profits in the June term of 1993 of a current profit of 286.4 billion yen (off 24 percent compared to the previous term). It is certain that even in the June term of 1994, total sales will be 8.7 trillion yen (down 24 percent over the previous term), and a current profit of 200 billion yen (down 30 percent) to give it the first decline in earnings and profits in seven years. In terms of operating profits, the first half will be 10.0 billion yen and the second half 60.0 billion yen, making 70.0 billion yen for the entire period (down 32 percent), and if the exchange rate for first half were to have a strong yen in excess of 110 yen per dollar, there is even a high likelihood that it will post an operating deficit in the intermediate December 1993 term. Even viewed in the middle to long term, the numerical inferiority of the Japanese makers cannot be denied. The export market which had once played a leading role, peaking in 1985 at 6.73 million units, has continued on a decline. In 1993 between January and August, sales numbered 3.195 million units, a 5.1 percent decline compared to the same term of the previous year. It is certain that for the entire year, sales will fall below the 5.5 million unit level for the first time since 1979. In the future as well, says our industry source, it appears that with the strong yen at the nearly 100 yen per dollar level, "it will not be possible to compete with the U.S. and Europe." Hope is not to be found even in the domestic market which had been the motive force in the 1988 to 1990 period. Sales of registered cars which had been a mainstay in March of this year were slightly higher than the previous year's results at 706,000 units, but from April on the decline over previous years will become established once again. Cumulative unit sales from January to September were 3.766 million units, a decline of eight percent compared with the same period of the previous year. If the recession continues even into the October to December period, not only will it be the first three year consecutive negative growth, but it will drop under the five million unit level for the first time since 1987. Even including light automobiles for which demand is relatively firm, unit sales numbers from January to September were 4.967 million units, a seven percent decrease over the same period of the previous year. For the entire year, too, sales stopped at 6.50 million units (down seven percent compared to last year) which is as much as a 16 percent decline compared to the peak in 1990 of 7.776 million units. There are many with the view that a quick recovery cannot be expected even during 1994. In the future as well, since, according to Chairman Kenichiro Ueno of the Japan Automobile Sales Association, "growth is finished, and, as in the United States and Europe, the market has become such that new car sales are influenced by the ups and downs of the economy," there is no way one can expect anything like a replay of the bubble period. Overseas Production Still Cannot Become Independent The only possible way to get themselves out of the slump in domestic sales and exports and their reduced competitiveness in the U.S. and European markets, is to promote overseas production and localization more than has been the case up to now. In fact, all the Japanese makers have clearly been shifting overseas, but in some cases this has a danger of becoming a double edged sword. The first one to take the initiative was Honda Motor Co. This September, it decided to move production of its Civic for export to the U.S. from its Suzuka Plant in Mie Prefecture to Honda of America (HAM) for local production targeted for April of 1994. Further, it has begun studying the prospect of transferring production of its U.S. best-seller Accord from its Sayama Plan in Saitama to HAM by the spring of 1996. Also, at the beginning of October, Fuji Heavy Industries decided to move production of its Legacy for export to the U.S. to its joint venture subsidiary with Isuzu, Subaru Isuzu Automotive (SIA). The idea, according to Fuji Heavy Industries President Isamu Kawai, is that "we will halt export from Japan by the spring of 1994 when we will switch to a new type of Legacy in the US. Next year we will raise the monthly production from the currently declining production at SIA of 3,700 units to 5,000 units." In addition, Toyota decided in mid-October to produce its new 3,000 to 4,000 cc luxury car Avalon at the Toyota Motor Manufacturing USA (TMMU) No. 2 plant. The question, however, is when these shifts to overseas production will become profitable and whether they can achieve independence. In the United States, subsequent to Honda Motor beginning local production at HAM in 1982, Nissan, Toyota, Mazda, Mitsubishi Motors, Fuji Heavy Industries/Isuzu managed to locate overseas one after another.. Currently, the annual capacity of the Japanese makers as a whole totals 2.14 million units, with Honda's HAM at 510,000; Nissan's NMMC at 450,000 units; Toyota's TMMU at 240,000; Toyota's and GM's joint venture subsidiary New United Motor Manufacturing (NUMMI) at 300,000; Mazda's and Ford's joint venture subsidiary Auto Alliance International (AAI) at 240,000; Mitsubishi's Diamond Motors (DSM) at 240,000; and Fuji Heavy Industries/Isuzu's SIA at 160,000 units. Next spring when TMMU's No. 2 plant (annual production capacity 200,000 units) begins operations, that figure will reach 2.34 million units. Moreover, if Canada's Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada (TMMC), Honda Canada, Suzuki and GM joint venture subsidiary CAMI Automotive, Mexico Nissan are included, annual production in North America as a whole would be 2.775 million units. Next spring it will reach 2.975 million units and then 3.0 million units. Meanwhile, in Europe as well, subsequent to Nissan beginning local production in 1986 at Nissan Motors United Kingdom (NMUK), Honda Motor's Honda of UK Manufacturing (HUM), Toyota's Toyota Motor Manufacturing UK (TMUK), Mitsubishi with the establishment of Netherlands Car with Sweden's Volvo, located there. Currently, annual production capacity in Europe is about 500,000 units, including Isuzu and Suzuki's joint venture base. However, this will end up being close to 1.0 million units in 1995 when HUM, TMUK and Netherlands begin full production. The domestic annual production capacity of Japanese automakers with their total of 11 companies is 14.5 million units. Local production capacity in the U.S. alone is 20 percent of the domestic capacity, and in 1995 the U.S. and Europe will total 4.0 million units, reaching nearly 30 percent of domestic capacity. However, according to Mazda President Wada, only "Toyota and Honda in the U.S. can be said to have succeeded in overseas production." The actual situation is that it is difficult to say that Nissan and the other makers have achieved results in accord with initial plans. The Sudden Swell in Interest Bearing Debt In fact, even if one looks at the operation rate, the only ones among the U.S. bases in the past two years that are higher than 90 percent are Toyota's TMMU, NUMMI and TMMC. Last year, because the Accord of Honda Motor's HAM, which had maintained 90 percent operation, had reached the end of its model year, the cumulative January through September total production number was 275,000 units, and its operation rate was down at 77 percent. Earnings-wise an even more serious situation is continuing. The details are sketchy since none of the companies clarifies the results of their U.S. production subsidiaries, but even at Toyota's TMMU, according to our industry source, "since there is a repetition of either deficit or surplus depending on the fiscal year, they cannot be described as having become completely independent." Conversion to a surplus in fiscal year 1991 and the idea of wiping out accumulated debt in fiscal year 1993 which were planned at time of penetration have gotten way off track. Even the earnings of Nissan's NMMC worsened due to investment in Altima production last year. Mitsubishi's DSM, Mazda's and Ford's AAI, as usual, could not be said to have established surplus-generating constitutions. Also, Fuji Heavy Industries' and Isuzu's SIA was able to convert to a surplus in the previous fiscal year, but the deficit of Fuji Heavy Industries' U.S. sales company, Subaru of America (SOA) has expanded due to the sales slump and has become a burden for Fuji Heavy Industries which is in the process of rebuilding. Meanwhile, with regard to European bases, Nissan's Motor Iberia and Suzuki's Santana Motor were also in the red in fiscal year 1992 due to the recession in Spanish markets. Even Nissan's NMUK which had continued full production until this summer, revised downward this year's production plan from 270,000 units to 246,000 units due to the stagnant European market and in November will begin a day shift only system instead of a two shift day and night system. This investment in overseas local plants and worsening of results is inviting a rapid deterioration of their financial constitutions. The interest bearing debt of the five largest companies of Toyota, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Honda Motor and Mazda combined on a consolidated base was 8.9 trillion yen at the end of fiscal 1992. This has grown to as much as three times the amount as compared to the end of fiscal 1986 which was prior to local production getting under full swing in the U.S. and Europe. Further, when Fuji Heavy Industries and Isuzu are included, that figure increases to 10 trillion yen. Noticeably worsening among them are Nissan and Honda Motor. Last year Nissan conducted investment to increase production for Altima at NMMC and Micra (Japanese name Machi) at NMUK, so its amount of interest bearing debt increased sharply from 1.2 trillion yen at the end of fiscal 1986 to 3.79 trillion yen. Honda Motor, which also had a mere 280 billion yen at the end of fiscal 1986 increased by four times due to such things as expansion of its HAM No. 2 plant and sales bases, expanding rapidly to 1.15 trillion yen. Furthermore, Toyota, due to investment in TMMU No. 2 plant, TMMC, and TMUK, sharply increased its debt by sixfold to 2.26 trillion yen compared to the amount in fiscal 1986. When viewed in a consolidated fashion, it has totally lost the image which was once described as "The Bank of Toyota." If overseas production remains unable to become independent, it is certain that recovery of competitiveness in the U.S. market will be difficult. If the desperate battle of overseas projects continues in this way, it could, in fact, become a drag on Japan itself. Restructuring Essential for Revival Japanese automakers are hardly standing by idly faced by these tough conditions domestically and abroad. On the one hand they have been restraining equipment investment from 1991 to 1992 when slow business results became serious and have been making more active requests for price reductions to parts makers. They are also making more cost reductions on cars themselves by cutting the number of parts used, using parts commonly, etc. Meanwhile, there is a rise in activity, says Nissan Motor President Tsuji, in the direction of "mutual OEM in which models are introduced from other companies in areas of one's weakness and for unprofitable models with a view to curtailing development funds." At the end of last year, Honda Motor and Isuzu, the latter of which decided to withdraw from passenger cars, agreed to mutual supply of Honda's passenger car Domani and Isuzu's recreational vehicle (RV) Rodeo and Miu. In October, they decided to expand the range of OEM to include both companies' leading models: Honda's passenger car Accord and Isuzu's RV Big Horn. Further, Nissan and Mazda, also in October formally resolved to conduct mutual OEM of Nissan's commercial vehicle AD van and Mazda's commercial vehicles, the Bongo van and Bongo truck. Also, there are more moves being made toward downsizing by decreasing the number of personnel and such. In February of this year Nissan announced its business structure reform plan that included the closing of its Zama plant, and determined that it would cut its employees by 5,000 by the end of fiscal 1995. Further, Honda and Mazda launched wide-ranging rationalization. By the end of fiscal 1995 Honda Motor, with the aim of creating a constitution that would be profitable with domestic production of 1.0 million units, will compress to a total of 3,000 people its employees at Honda Technological Research Institute (in charge of product development) and Honda Engineering (responsible for production engineering). Mazda targets the end of fiscal 1995 to cut 2,000 people from its indirect divisions and 1,000 people from its direct divisions for a total of 3,000 people. Simultaneous to that, it will reinforce its assistance to sales companies and plants. However, there is some question as to whether these measures alone will provide enough of a recovery of competitiveness to contend with the U.S. manufacturers. Even their cuts in personnel have stopped with natural attrition and reduced hiring and, according to our industry source, there is a danger that "they will get behind in rationalization compared to the U.S. and European sides, who are conducting bold layoffs and plant closings." Even on the production aspect, on the U.S. side GM with its Saturn and Chrysler with the Jefferson plant are successively starting up new and better plants. Meanwhile, many of the plants of the Japanese automakers, with the exception of a few, such as Toyota Motor's Kyushu plant, Nissan's Kyushu No. 2 plant, Mazda's Bofu No. 2 plant and others, were constructed between 1955 to 1965, and they could hardly be described as adequate in terms of productivity. At present, moreover, the domestic annual production capacity of Japanese automakers is around 14.5 million units for the total of 11 companies. Since production this year is certain to fall to 11.5 million units (a decline over the previous year of eight percent), the rate of operation will be 79 percent. The gap in supply and demand between capacity and production will reach as much as 3.0 million units. For Japanese automakers to compete with the U.S. and Europeans, according to Toyota Motors Senior Managing Director Eiichi Kumabe, "it is vital to build an organic system of international division of labor with a more global view in order to know what to build and where to sell it." If automakers continue to carry excess production capacity domestically, it could become a heavy burden to future development overseas. The Focus on Nissan and Mazda Among the automakers, the main focus is on Nissan Group and Mazda whose worsening business results are the most conspicuous. In the case of Nissan Group, it is certain that Nissan itself will have an operating deficit in excess of 40.0 billion yen in fiscal 1993 also, continuing the trend started in fiscal 1992. And although it will depend on profits from the sale of securities, there is even the possibility that it could have a two consecutive year current deficit. Fuji Heavy Industries, which in fiscal 1992 had realized its first conversion to a current surplus in three years, reverted back to a current deficit of approximately 10.0 billion yen in fiscal 1993 due to the strong yen and Nissan Diesel, which had taken on the bus and truck division, posted its first deficit in six years with a current loss of 4.3 billion yen, so there is a strong probability that there will be no dividend payment. Just Nissan alone has an annual production capacity of 2.6 million units domestically and 1.3 million units in the U.S. and Europe for a total of 3.9 million units (3.6 million units in the spring of 1995 after closing the Zama plant). Meanwhile, its domestic sales are 1.126 million units and 1.687 units abroad for a total of 2.817 million units (on a fiscal 1992 consolidated base), so the gap with production capacity is 1.0 million units. That gap will widen further because of the severe recession in the domestic and European markets in fiscal 1993. Currently, Nissan is conducting consignment production (annual production: 60,000 units) of the Pulsar for Fuji Heavy Industries, but the actual situation is that "we don't have the strength to assist any further," says Nissan's President Tsuji. According to our industry source, there is ample possibility that the Nissan Group, which includes Fuji Heavy Industries and Nissan Diesel, will "initiate a major restructuring effort with large margin personnel reductions, plant closings, and the like." On the other hand, Mazda's troubles continue as well. The sales slump in Japan and Europe and strong yen which have greatly exceeded expectations have led to an increase from 13.0 billion yen which was forecast at the start of the term to 32.0 billion yen in the current deficit, so it will not be paying dividends for the first time since going public. Rumors such as "Sumitomo Bank will launch large-scale assistance" and "it will become Ford's plant in Japan" have not gone away despite the desperate denials of Mazda's management. It will attempt to rebuild by its own power by way of personnel cuts, revision of the ratio of direct and indirect [divisions] and making its plants more efficient, but, according to Mazda President Wada, "We understand that these measures alone will not suffice, but there are not enough good ideas for high yen and recession countermeasures. What is clear is that proceeding with rationalization by acceleration" alone is precarious. This is not to suggest that Honda and Toyota have any breathing room. Toyota's annual production capacity, when one adds Toyota Motor Kyushu that started full operation this fall and related manufacturers as well as Toyota Auto Body Co.'s new plant, domestically alone is 4.74 million units, so there is a gap approaching 1.0 million units. Production on the No. 3 line of the Tahara plant in Aichi Prefecture that produced the Celcio was suspended beginning in January of this year. Further, in the three month period from September to December, it will dispatch 175 production personnel of the Motomachi plant to Toyota Auto Body, but it is questionable whether these types of measures alone will be adequate for it to ride out this recession. Honda Motor also began stronger production coordination since the end of last year. In addition to going to a single shift system on its No. 2 line at its Suzuka plant in October, it is also advancing with the transfer of production of its AT Mission from its Kumamoto and Hamamatsu plants. The only Japanese automaker that is doing well is Mitsubishi Motor whose RVs are performing favorably. At the time of the first and second oil crises, Japanese automakers achieved a quick recovery by getting the jump on U.S. and European makers, using exports as a fulcrum. At the time of the previous strong yen downturn, they received the benefits of the bubble economy in which domestic demand grew sharply. This time, however, not only is there no prospect of an export or domestic market, there is also a strong rival in the form of the U.S. side, which has recovered its competitiveness. Osamu Suzuki, president of Suzuki who has developed his own management style by taking the initiative in local production in developing countries like India and China and in its partnership with GM, says, "It is unavoidable that the domestic situation will become devoid of substance in this recession. In order to survive, we will have to throw away face as well as our pride and do whatever it takes." There is a very strong possibility that in the future, there will loom the spectacle of automakers being faced with restructuring and closings of domestic plants or having to withdraw from U.S. and European markets. In order to keep the prosperity of the 1980's from ending as a mere fleeting dream, it will be necessary to discard one's pride.
