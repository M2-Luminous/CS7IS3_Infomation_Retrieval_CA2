He said that Azerbaijan want peace but that the first and foremost condition is that Armenia withdraw from the Azerbaijani territory it has occupied. Pointing out that the Russian proposal for an immediate cease-fire was rejected because this condition had not been met, Aliyev stressed that Azerbaijan definitely wants Turkey to participate in the peacekeeping force Russia intends to station in Karabakh. Recalling that he will be making an official visit to Turkey as the guest of President Suleyman Demirel between 8 and 11 February, Aliyev added that this visit will constitute a stepping stone to further develop the existing bilateral relations. He noted that he will be conducting talks on all issues with Turkey and that the Ceyhan-Baku oil pipeline issue will also be taken up.
