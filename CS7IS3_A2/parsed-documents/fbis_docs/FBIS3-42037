By requesting an in-depth reassessment of ``all financial, legal, and social aspects of the installation,'' opponents are hitting the right target. It no longer is a matter of criticizing security alone. Even the danger posed by the fires caused by leaked sodium, which were very difficult to control, was played down in the expert report. It is now up to the politicians to decide whether or not to continue the development of this technology, which, as everybody agrees, will not be economically viable for several decades. One kW/h produced by the Super-Phoenix prototype is 2.3 times more expensive than 1 kW/h generated by a conventional nuclear power station. This fact, together with the collapse of the uranium market and the freeze in nuclear programs, seems to argue against the construction of a superbreeder reactor network. So, should we halt this program for good? This would cost us a little fortune, both for decommissioning the reactor and for indemnifying France's [foreign] partners. Should we opt, instead, to continue this program and try to make a little profit out of the installation by having it generate kW/h and incinerate small quantities of waste? The latter solution would keep the research teams busy and enable us to keep current of developments in this technology should it one day become econmomically viable. Pending this decision, the reactor operator and the political authorities are working on the financial figures. Super-Phoenix required an investment of 27.7 billion French francs [Fr] (current francs), including Fr7.65 billion in intercalated interests [interets intercalaires]. Moreover, the superbreeder reactor costs more when it is idle (Fr750 to 800 million per year) than when it is operating normally (Fr650 million). However, this has to be weighed against the political pressure emanating from ecological groups, for whom Superphenix has become the symbol of the nuclear danger that has to be eradicated.
