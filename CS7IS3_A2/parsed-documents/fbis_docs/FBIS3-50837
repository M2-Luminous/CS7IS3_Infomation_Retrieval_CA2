Program host Juan Carlos Roque Garcia notes that Sexto gets letters from people at both Radio Rebelde and BOHEMIA, and that certain subjects, such as today's, are too important not to address. Sexto says: "I have just received a letter signed by Dr. Rafael Gonzalez, a veterinarian from Sancti Spiritus Province. This is an excessively respectful letter -- if the adverb `excessively' can ever be fitting in describing the respect one feels toward, or shows, others! It is a letter in which, although he does have a personal problem, what most concerns him is the problem in general; that is, how such a problem could affect the nation. Briefly, the case is as follows: Dr. Gonzalez was the veterinarian at a state agricultural-livestock enterprise. He does not say whether it was a place that raised cattle, or one that grew cane, or a miscellaneous crop enterprise. In any case, the farm where he used to work became a UBPC [Basic Cooperative Production Unit]. So he agreed to become a member of that UBPC; and when the farm formally turned into a UBPC, he was told that the only thing he could do there was be an agricultural laborer, that there was no place there for a veterinarian. "He, of course, refused -- for reasons everyone understood but no one did anything about. Moreover, he argues that he also has physical handicaps that prevent him from, that constitute obstacles to, working in the fields, since agricultural work is so tough. "He writes me because he has visited many people, and the Sancti Spiritus labor agency told him it had no work for him. The Institute of Veterinary Medicine here in Havana told him that that's the way it is, [repeats] that that is just the way it is. The legal directorate of the Ministry of Agriculture also told him that that is just the way it is. And he, who says he is a revolutionary, a 36- year-old veterinarian trained by the Revolution, is not complaining. He is not cursing, or recanting, or regretting anything, or making any reproaches. Although he is having this personal problem, he simply says that he is worried about there existing, in the UBPC's, a tendency to do without professionals in the work force." Sexto continues: "He says that much good has been spoken about the UBPC's; that he has heard many good things about the UBPC's -- even referring to a recent article of mine on the UBPC's that appeared in BOHEMIA -- but that he has heard nothing negative about the UBPC's anywhere, nothing negative that can be foreseen about the UBPC's. And he thinks that what is happening to him might also be happening to other people, and that that could be a negative aspect of the UBPC's that we must intercept, watch out for, follow." Roque and Sexto then explain what the UPBCs are and why they came to be. Sexto says: "The fact is that Dr. Gonzalez is worried that doing without professionals in the work force in the UBPC's could be a negative tendency of this formula for agricultural organization, of this new relationship between the man and the land -- a tendency which might obstruct, or prevent, the UBPCs' developing to their full potential. I think he is right. Unquestionably, no one can achieve profitability, or become efficient in production, without science or technology...nor can anyone defend the UBPCs' doing without, or attempting to do without them. That could be a negative tendency, which must constantly be watched for, put a stop to, and controlled." Roque notes that "the objective is to achieve direct production -- not to have a lot of people in offices, too many people affecting the profitability of a UBPC, of course." Sexto agrees, noting that "agriculture with good yields, good results, that is profitable, that is productive, cannot be achieved through man's labor alone. That is clear. And I think that Dr. Gonzalez is very right to worry about what is worrying him. And I think maybe no one in the country has thought that this might happen, that the UBPC's might have a tendency to try to do without professionals on their work force." "Of course he does not explain to me what kind of an enterprise this was, whether or not it was a cattle-raising enterprise. There cannot not be a place for a veterinarian in a UBPC devoted to raising livestock? Maybe in a miscellaneous crops enterprise! On the other hand, a veterinarian might indeed not be necessary at a miscellaneous crops enterprise, or a cane-growing UBPC. "Now, let's look at another aspect of the problem. If the UBPC is a cattle-raising UPBC...[rephrases] I do think a place for that veterinarian must be found at some other cattle-raising UBPC that needs a veterinarian." Roque adds: "And even if his UBPC is not a cattle-raising UPBC, a place for that veterinarian must be found, because how can we afford to leave a veterinarian without a job?" Sexto agrees: "Exactly! Because certain paradoxical factors come into play here: If the Revolution is concerned with making sure that the medical student who is today in the classroom has a guaranteed job when he graduates, how can we possibly allow a veterinarian with 12 years' experience -- that means 12 additional years of study, in addition to the practice -- to be without a job because no one can find a place for him? "It is possible that it might be difficult, at the present time. But we must begin thinking about a solution.... "I also want to tell you, Juan Carlos, that the responses of the authorities to whom he has gone, whom he has told about his problem, have been pretty indifferent, although they understood the problem. We think he cannot be told: Well, it is unavoidable, Doctor. Just resign yourself. "I think no state organization can be allowed to give such an answer!" Roque notes: That is where the problem of coordination comes in. I think these institutions have to have exchanges with others. The Labor Ministry in Sancti Spiritus, or the enterprises he himself has visited directly, have to begin seeking a solution to his problem, even if the problem is not their own. They too have to begin to make suggestions." The speakers agree that the nation is seeking to make changes and find solutions to problems, but that erroneous interpretations of things do occur; also, not everyone does the right thing. Deficiencies continue to exist. Sexto adds: "This also has to be looked at from another point of view, because if Decree-Law No. 141 permitted that veterinarian to treat privately, as a self-employed person, all the dogs and cats in Sancti Spiritus, it is possible that this man would not be facing the worry, the personal situation he is in today; but Decree-Law does not -- for now -- permit him to exercise his profession as a self-employed person. I think that this has to be kept in mind. I think cases like this could crop up not only in Sancti Spiritus but all over the country. "There could be misinterpretations, and there could be objective situations that prevent there being work for a veterinarian, but formulas must be sought. What cannot be allowed to happen is for a veterinarian to (?remain) in such a situation. The country cannot afford the luxury of doing without such members of the work force!" Roque agrees, saying that a lesson must be learned from this case. Sexto says that in his letter, the veterinarian says he knows of other cases like his own. Sexto adds: "I want to say that this kind of problem is not solved with either a bureaucratic spirit or a bureaucratic mentality. I think a revolutionary, especially if he is an official, has to empathize with a citizen's problem as if it were his own. I think that is basic, in leading this country." Sexto says, further, that he thinks this is a case for the agricultural-livestock workers union. He says: "A recent CTC [Cuban Workers Federation] editorial in the newspaper TRABAJADORES said the unions had to follow such cases very closely, step by step, so as to avoid having injustices, deformations, and misinterpretations occur. And I think the case of Dr. Gonzalez in Sancti Spiritus must be assessed by the province's union. That union has to seek a solution." Roque notes: "There lies the role -- first and foremost -- of the union sections, at the grassroots level. I am talking about the base-level, because many of these problems might be able to be solved at the very bottom." Sexto notes that he wondered what the union's role might be at a UPBC if the workers own the production and if the president can be removed by an assembly of the workers when he messes up. "Now I think that role is, precisely, first of all, for the union to keep watch over the nation's best interests; and also to watch for cases such as this, which are obviously injustices, where people have obviously failed to think." Roque concludes: "This is an alert to the entire country."
