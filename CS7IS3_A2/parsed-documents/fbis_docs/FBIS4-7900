FBIS4-7900 "dreeu067__a94019" FBIS-EEU-94-067-A Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic ODA Policy Summarized Before Conference ODA Policy Summarized Before Conference AU0604194894 Prague CTK in English 1257 GMT 6 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0604194894 Prague CTK English BFN [Excerpt] Prague, April 6 (CTK) -- The seventh national conference of the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), to be held in Brno on April 9 and 10, will deal with local government reform, the preparation of community and senatorial elections, the financing of local budgets and security policy. It will be attended by guests from France, Hungary, Germany, Austria, Russia, Slovakia and Great Britain. The ODA is pressing for thirteen local administrative units -- a relatively low number. At January's meeting of the party's Central Assembly, chairman Jan Kalvoda rejected information that the ODA was considering supporting the abolition of the district level of local administration. "We consider the districts at present to be the only functioning element of the state administration, and their abolition would shake the whole structure," Kalvoda said. At a meeting of the "coalition four" on March 28, Kalvoda was asked to put forward material on local government reform and the decentralization of central government by the end of the week. As regards senatorial elections, the ODA, together with its coalition partners, the Christian Democratic Party (KDS) and the Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL), supports a system of 27 three-mandate constituencies, whereas the Civic Democratic Party (ODS, the fourth coalition party) wants 81 one-mandate constituencies. Under a compromise solution proposed by deputies, this year people would vote for three senators in each of the "large constituencies," of which there would be 27. Each of these constituencies would be made up of three smaller areas, and thus the number of voting areas desired by the ODS would be achieved. In the issue of church property restitution, the ODA has stressed from the start that February 1948 (the date of the communist takeover) is the cut-off point and a barrier which restitution should not cross. It believes that the law on mitigating property wrongs suffered by the churches needs to be tied to the actual needs of the sects. It favors restitution of religious property in the form of a law which lists individual properties to be returned. Kalvoda says the party is a clear supporter of the principle of the separation of church and state, and believes that this question should be solved as soon as possible. However, the ODA believes that the cut-off date of February 25th, 1948 is no good as regards the restitution of property to Jewish communities. [passage omitted] The ODA now has about 2,000 members (in December 1990 it had 100 members), the relatively low number being due to its selective policy in accepting new members. The party is a member of the European Democratic Union. The ODA is a government coalition party. In the 19-member government it has three posts -- Jan Kalvoda is deputy prime minister, Vladimir Dlouhy minister of trade and industry, and Jiri Skalicky privatization minister. Polls conducted by the Institute for Public Opinion Research show that the ODA is the second strongest political party following Klaus's ODS [Civic Democratic Party]. It has occupied the place since February 1993 when nine percent of the population supported it. In August 1993 this was 13 percent (together with the opposition Czech Social Democratic Party of Milos Zeman), in January 1994 ten percent and in February 11 percent of the electorate. Surveys show that Dlouhy has for a long time been the most popular Czech politician, with 62 percent of the population trusting him in February 1993, 76 percent in September and 82 percent in December 1993 and March 1994. Kalvoda ranks among ten most popular Czech politicians.
