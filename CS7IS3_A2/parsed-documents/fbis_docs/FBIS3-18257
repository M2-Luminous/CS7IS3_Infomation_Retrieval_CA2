He said that as the German foreign minister, he cannot resolve the problem alone. The only thing he can do, he said, is support Cyprus in every way and try to help. The German foreign minister said that in every talk he has with the Turkish friends, as he referred to them, he raises the Cyprus issue. He added, however, that he is in no position to dictate a solution to the Turkish side. Referring to the effect that the promotion of Cyprus' European Union membership application will have on a solution, Kinkel said he understands the Cypriot position but said he is reserved and careful. He added that he will raise the issue in Brussels. Mikhailidhis said he was satisfied with his meeting with Kinkel, although no definite answers were given. Mikhailidhis will meet former German Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher today.
