Japanese Ambassador to Ukraine Shoji Suezawa signed the agreement with Ukraine Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko, the ministry said. The committee will include representatives of the Governments of Japan and Ukraine, it said. The accord follows Japan's announcement in April last year at a ministerial meeting of the Group of Seven (G-7) nations that it would extend a grant-in-aid of 100 million dollars for the promotion of nuclear weapons destruction in the former Soviet Union. Ukraine is one of the four former Soviet republics that inherited nuclear weapons when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991. Japan signed a similar accord on cooperation on nuclear nonproliferation with Belarus in November. Japan has yet to sign an agreement with Kazakhstan. In January, U.S. President Bill Clinton, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk agreed to scrap Ukraine's 176 intercontinental ballistic missiles and 1,800 warheads.
