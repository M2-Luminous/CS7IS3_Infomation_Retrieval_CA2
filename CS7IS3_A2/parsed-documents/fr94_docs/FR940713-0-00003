FR940713-0-00003 FR940713-0-00001 Because prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this action are impracticable and contrary to the public interest under these conditions, we find good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effective upon signature. We will consider comments that are received within 60 days of publication of this rule in the Federal Register . After the comment period closes, we will publish another document in the Federal Register . It will include a discussion of any comments we receive and any amendments we are making to the rule as a result of the comments. Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act This interim rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived the review process required by Executive Order 12866. This interim rule affects the interstate movement of regulated articles from the Corona area of Riverside County, CA. There are approximately 93 small entities that could be affected, including 66 fruit sellers, 14 nurseries, 6 growers, 4 vendors, and 3 swapmeets. These small entities comprise less than 1 percent of the total number of similar small entities operating in the State of California. In addition, most of these small entities sell regulated articles primarily for local intrastate, not interstate, movement, and the sale of these articles would not be affected by this interim regulation. Therefore, termination of the quarantine in the Riverside County area should have a minimal economic effect on the few small entities operating there. We anticipate that the economic impact of lifting the quarantine, though positive, will be no more significant than was the minimal impact of its imposition. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
