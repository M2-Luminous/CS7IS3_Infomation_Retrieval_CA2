While meeting with some Chinese and foreign delegates to the 1994 international high-level economic forum in Beijing, China, that opened today, Li Peng stressed: China is willing to resume its status as a GATT contracting member at an early date and to become a founding member of the future World Trade Organization [WTO], and China has made great efforts in this regard. Li Peng said: China will maintain two-way relations with the currently existing GATT and with the future WTO. China needs multilateral trading organizations like GATT, while GATT and the future WTO also need China. He said: If the WTO refuses to admit China -- a country with over 1.1 billion people and a rapidly developing economy and expanding trade volume, it will be very hard to regard the WTO as a wholesome organization. During the meeting, Li Peng also briefed the delegates on the characteristics and contents of China's socialist market economy; on the conditions of China's large and medium state enterprises; on China's efforts in handling relations among reform, development, and stability; and on measures taken to deepen reform and strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control. Li Peng said: After 15 years' practice and exploration, China has proposed the objective of establishing a socialist market economy. In the process, China will pay attention to properly handling the relations among reform, development, and stability. He pointed out: Development is the purpose; reform, the driving force; and stability, the condition. Later, Premier Li Peng hosted a banquet for all forum delegates at the Great Hall of the People. He said in his speech: He was very happy to be with distinguished guests and friends in Beijing at a time of bright sunshine, gentle breezes, and blooming flowers. Li Peng said: China is a peace-cherishing country. Initiated by Deng Xiaoping, chief architect of the reform and opening up, China has formulated, as early as the end of the seventies, the general policy regarding economic construction as the central task and has been implementing policies of reform and opening up. Such efforts have brought tremendous changes to China. He said: Currently, China is enjoying political stability, economic development, unity among its nationalities, and social progress. Full of hope and under the CPC leadership with Jiang Zemin as the core, the Chinese people are moving toward the 21st century and the future. We are full of confidence in our country's future as never before. However, Li Peng added: Owing to its large population and underdeveloped economy, China still has a long way to go. To develop its economy as rapidly as possible, China needs the international community's long-term support and cooperation. He said: "We enthusiastically welcome foreign friends all over the world to cooperate and exchange with China in funds, technology, management, and many other fields." Li Peng said: China is a huge market, open to all countries willing to develop friendly cooperation with it. He said: China is willing to understand the world and the world also needs to understand China. Judging from the forum's speeches, this objective is definitely attainable. Li Peng said: The meeting's agenda concerns not only China's economy, but also the world's economy and its long-term development. That is why we said: "Our common tasks are to attain peace and development." Li Peng believed: Asia, including China and particularly East Asia, is the most active region in the world economy [shi jie jing ji zui wei huo yue de di qu 0013 3954 4842 3444 2584 3634 3172 6460 4104 0966 0575] and has a very bright future. Therefore, he expressed the hope that after the forum ends in Beijing, similar international high-level forums will be held annually or every other year in China, adding that the Chinese Government is willing to provide effective support in this regard. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir delivered an ebullient speech at the banquet. He hailed new changes in Beijing since his last visit to China in 1993. He said these have been the results of efforts made by China's leaders, government, and people. He said: "It is hard to administer a country with more than 10 million people, not to mention one with more than 1.1 billion people." He added: As an Asian, he admires China's achievements. Mahathir said: China's prosperity is sure to bring about prosperity in East Asia and in the whole of Asia. He wished that the Chinese people will accomplish more in their future construction. Attending the meeting and banquet were Helmut Schmidt, former chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany; Ernest Stern, deputy managing director of the World Bank; and Richard McLean, chairman of the INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE. Li Tieying, state councillor and minister in charge of the State Economic Restructuring Commission, also attended the meeting and banquet.
