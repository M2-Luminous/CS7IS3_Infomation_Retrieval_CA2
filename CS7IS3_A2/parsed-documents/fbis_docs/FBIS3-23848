Spirin, senior scientific associate of the All-Russian Mechanization Institute, doctor of Agricultural Sciences, professor, written down by I. Kalashnikov: "We Have Conquered Erosion"] [Text] This marks the 40th year since the start of developing virgin and fallow lands. Whatever the evaluations of this major national economic program, there is undoubtedly one: putting into circulation vast, formerly unused, arable land made a weighty addition of grain in the country's food product balance. The approaching anniversary, therefore, deserves to be noted on a broad scale. Our newspaper, too, proposes to publish a number of items on this subject. Today A.P. Spirin, senior scientific associate of the All-Russian Mechanization Institute, doctor of Agricultural Sciences, professor, tells us about the solution to one of the very important problems--developing anti-erosion equipment, without which all the efforts of the virgin soil subjugators might have lost their value. Anatoliy Petrovich noted: At the beginning of the 1950's, our country had vast areas of arable land, unused for a number of reasons. This land was not only in Kazakhstan, where there were many million hectares of virgin land (it was thought to be mainly low-efficiency saline soil, and therefore was not plowed). There were quite a few unplowed territories in Western and Eastern Siberia, in Altay and in the Volga area, even on the Kuban and in Rostov Oblast. Calculations and estimates showed that these lands were over 20 million hectares in area. If an average of at least ten quintals of grain per hectare were harvested, this promised an addition of 20 million tonnes of grain a year. This would, of course, be a major reserve for the production of grain, the shortage of which we were already beginning to feel. The country's government therefore devoted major attention to accelerated development of the virgin land. A great deal of agricultural equipment was sent to Kazakhstan and to the eastern regions, and thousands of machine operators went there. The epic being lived through by the entire country began. As far back as on the eve of developing these lands, expert agrarian scientists gave notice in advance: the virgin land must not be plowed with ordinary equipment -- there was a danger of wind erosion. Here they alluded to the bitter experience of countries such as the United States and Canada, which had experienced the serious consequences of the dust storms of the 1930's. The only way to avoid misfortune was to use non-terracing tilling of the soil in the steppe regions, where strong winds blow. While traditional -- terrace -- plowing deprives the earth of the protective plant covering, non-terracing plowing keeps the stubble plant remnants on the surface, which ensures reliable wind-erosion protection of the soil. World experience attested to this and taught this and also the fact that a subsurface cultivator and other anti-erosion equipment should be used instead of a plow. Unfortunately, we did not have this equipment. We therefore had to till the earth with ordinary machines in the early days. Fortunately, at first we got by without dust storms. They soon made their presence known, however. The scientific institutions of those days, VASKhNIL [All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences imeni V.I. Lenin], including VIM [All-Union Agricultural Mechanization Scientific Research Institute] and, in particular, our Department of Agricultural Soil Protection Mechanization, worked persistently on developing, in the shortest time possible, the machines and implements that the virgin soil tillers needed. We all succeeded in achieving the task successfully. KPG-250, KPG-2-150 and KPP-2-2 type subsurface cultivators were among the first implements built. They were quite simple implements. What are they like? If you make a diagram, it is two blades, placed at an angle (the so-called aperture angle, equal to 110-120 degrees) and a post in the middle. Moreover, the blades are slanted toward the plane of the earth -- this is the crumbling angle or cutting angle. They made it possible to till the soil to a depth of 25-27 centimeters, with a 1.5-2-meter swath width. The special feature of the subsurface cultivator lies in the fact that using them does not turn over the earth, as occurs when plowing with a plow, and causes virtually no destruction to the upper interwoven layer of the root system. This, I repeat, protects the soil from wind erosion. In addition to the subsurface cultivators, a number of other machines were developed, which took into consideration the specific nature and special features of non-terracing technology. These are: the KSh rod weeder, the BI-3 toothed harrow, stubble drills and snow plows. In all, the set of anti-erosion equipment included 11 new descriptions of machines and implements. VIM scientific associates A. Plishkin, V. Trufanov and N. Ivanov did a great deal of fruitful work on developing them in those years. The work was done with the active participation of specialists of the design bureau of the Odessa Agricultural Machine Plant imeni October Revolution. Incidentally, it was at this same plant, which specializes in the production of plows, that subsurface cultivators and other means of mechanization for virgin land workers were developed and produced for the first time. At the same time, of course, foreign experience was taken into consideration. There was no mere copying of foreign equipment here, though. For instance, the American subsurface cultivator was designed for fine tilling of the soil -- only 12-15 centimeters. In our country, considering the specific nature of our soils, we hold the opinion: the deeper, the better. Therefore we developed implements with deep tilling, twice as deep as the American ones. Furthermore, in those years the United States used wheeled tractors, whereas we used mainly caterpillar tractors. Their tractor-mounted implements could not be unitized with our caterpillar tractors, which the designers also took into consideration. What can be said about the first-generation anti-erosion machines? They were quite efficient, workable equipment, which was widely used in various regions of the country. It made it possible to introduce a soil-protection system of farming on an area of over 20 million hectares, that is, on virtually all the virgin land regions, and to stop wind erosion there. Moreover, the use of these implements increased the grain crop yield by an average of two to five quintals per hectare. This is because preserving the plant remnants contributes to snow retention, and consequently to increasing the moisture in the soil. The developers of the equipment were awarded the Lenin Prize in 1972. At the same time, the operation of the first subsurface cultivators and other machines convinced us of the need for their further improvement. As more and more new areas were plowed, more productive and reliable equipment was required. In addition to VIM, associates of the Special Design Bureau for Anti-Erosion Equipment (GSKB PET), created in Tselinograd in 1965, with the participation of specialists from VISKhOM [All-Union Agricultural Machine Building Scientific Research Institute], VNIIZKh [All-Union Grain Farming Scientific Research Institute] and KazNIIMESKh [Agricultural Mechanization and Electrification Scientific Research Institute of the Northwest USSR], were attached to the work. Through their joint efforts, a set of second-generation machines, which included 20 descriptions, was successfully designed. The farms of the virgin land regions began to receive the KPSh-9 and KPSh-11 wide swath subsurface cultivators. Their swath width is respectively 9 and 11 meters, which is several times more than that of their predecessors. The output of harrows, grain erosion drills, snowplow-swath collectors and other machines distinguished by both high reliability and by a wider swath, was also developed. For instance, the BMSh-15 and BMSh-20 type harrow-hoes are capable of tilling a strip of land 15 and 20 meters wide. The fact that, by that time high-power tractors such as the T-150, K-700 and K-701 had been developed and produced, contributed to widescale use of this powerful equipment. There was no longer any need to use clumsy tractor hitches. Labor productivity more than doubled. The main result was that wind erosion was conquered. The volume of soil-protective technology introduced rose considerably. This made it possible to obtain an additional 13-15 million tonnes of grain a year. The group of scientists and specialists -- the creators of the second-generation machines and implements -- were awarded the State Prize in 1988. Among them were L. Kim, A. Buryakov, A. Gribanovskiy, G. Kuzmin, V. Suchkov and others. Work is now continuing on improving the subsurface equipment. The task lies in creating ecologically safe, as specialists say, agrophilic machines and implements. The adverse effect of their working members on the soil should be minimal: they will pulverize it less, better retain the plant remnants and pack it down less.
