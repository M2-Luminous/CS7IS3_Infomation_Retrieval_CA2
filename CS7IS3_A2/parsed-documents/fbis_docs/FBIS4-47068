The Government Is Silent," and it reported the following to the editorial staff. In accordance with the "Temporary Procedure for the Receipt and Expenditure of Resources for State Social Insurance in the Pension Fund of the Kazakh Republic Through the Republic's Budget," which was approved by the Finance Ministry on 1 April 1994, resources for paying pensions and benefits to the unemployed population are being allocated from the republic's budget. According to item No. 3 of the presidential Edict No. 1529 on the republic budget for 1994, dated 27 January 1994, the Finance Ministry will execute financial measures associated with the implementation of functions, particularly the Pension Fund, as resources are received for them, but not more than the maximum scale of expenditures established by this edict. From the time of the inclusion of the Pension Fund in the republic's budget system, that is, from 1 April to 1 June of this year, receipts amounted to 936.7 million tenge. In addition, credits were allocated three times from the republic's budget to the Ministry of Social Protection of the Population for the payment of pensions in May in the sum of 778 million tenge. Considering the acuteness of the question, the Finance Ministry on 8 June additionally formed yet another credit from the republic's budget for the payment of pensions in the sum of 200 million tenge, which already exceeds the budgetary receipt of insurance premiums by 41.3 million tenge. "The Temporary Procedure for the Receipt and Expenditure of Resources...in the Pension Fund..." in effect at the present time is really cumbersome, but it is necessary to consider that this procedure is temporary and was adopted for the period of formation and transfer of files of premium payers from the Pension Funds to the tax inspectorates. As a consequence, it is proposed to simplify it to a maximum and to use the insurance premiums collected at the oblast level, but only the premiums remaining after the payment of pensions will be subject to redistribution. However, to shift at the present time to such a procedure means to leave citizens without pensions who live in the oblast and who for objective reasons--a reduction and halt in production--cannot ensure the collection of insurance premiums. To explain the "confusion" with the payment of pensions simply with the transfer of Pension Fund resources to the republic's budget system, which follows from the article that is being reviewed, would be very simple, and it can be eliminated easily. The reasons lie deeper, they are in the general economic crisis that has stricken our economy. Therefore, the situation would have developed the same way regardless of who at the present time would engage in the collection of insurance premiums--the structures of the Pension Fund or the tax inspectorates. To hope that the structures of the Pension Fund could make it incumbent upon enterprises to transfer premiums is at the very least naive, since this is not within the power even of the tax inspection organs. The Wage Fund, according to data of the Goskomstat [State Committee for Statistics], totaled 4.101 billion tenge just for April of this year. If it is taken into account that in May the Wage Fund would have remained on the same level, although it was really increasing, than the calculated size of payments for April and May should be not less than 2.200 billion tenge. Actually, not more than 43 percent of this sum was received on 1 June. Pensioners are not to blame for the difficulties that the economy is experiencing at the present time. Undoubtedly they are first to need material and social assistance. But, it should not be thought that heartless bureaucrats are sitting in the Finance Ministry and the government. Specific measures are being employed in paying pensions, given the first real, most of all financial, opportunity. The situation is being monitored, and, as soon as circumstances permit, the "Temporary Procedure..." that has aroused so much censure, including in the press, will be simplified to the maximum so that the path that insurance premiums take from enterprises to direct pension payments is shortened. In any case, the special purpose of the insurance premiums that are transferred to the Pension Fund is not violated in any way, even when the latter is in the republic budget system, and the burden of the of republic's budget expenditures is not shifted to the pensioners. * * * KAZAKSTANSKAYA PRAVDA was also informed that the newspaper gave an incorrect interpretation of the explanation of the text of the Cabinet of Ministers Decree on making changes to Decree No. 34 of the Kazakh Cabinet of Ministers of 6 January 1994, which was given by the manager of the department of finance, labor, and social protection of the population. As G.V. Guseva explained, according to the decree, the delivery of pensions and benefits is conducted through organs of the Ministry of Social Protection of the Population by enterprises of the Ministry of Communications and establishments of the People's Bank, which conforms to Article 81 of the law on pension support of citizens in the Kazakh SSR.
