This document seems all the more important because it has emerged at a time when it is becoming increasingly clear that the political struggle in Russia is intensifying. The series of events that occurred last week is graphic confirmation of this. The draft memorandum has dispelled the previously current doubts about the president's political views. In it B. Yeltsin convincingly proved that he is a firm advocate of the democratic model of the state's development and has not abandoned the idea of economic reforms. This was also confirmed by the president's meeting with the leaders of the Duma faction of "Russia's Choice," in the course of which an obvious rapprochement took place, as distinct from the eve of the 12 December elections, when Yeltsin demonstratively distanced himself from the democratic movements. The decision by "Russia's Choice" to allow a number of its deputies to leave the faction so as to enable the "12 December" group to become a faction -- a decision which followed that meeting -- shows that at the meeting in the Kremlin an agreement was reached on strategic cooperation, in the course of which the president is reckoning on securing support for himself in the Duma in the form of three right-wing factions: "12 December," "Russia's Choice," and "Yabloko." At the same time Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin, who on the eve of the December elections, as we recall, followed the president's example and distanced himself from the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, which was sympathetic to him, has promoted S. Shakhray, the party's leader, to the rank of vice premier. This gives grounds to conclude that the premier is also seeking support in the Duma. Ultimately it has to be noted that the president and the premier have recently been becoming increasingly independent. Each of them now possesses not only his own independent apparatus but also his "own" parliamentary factions. This is perfectly natural if you consider that Russia is entering a new stage of the reforms -- a period of mass bankruptcies and growing unemployment. In this situation both the president and the government need the support of political forces in the Duma which would be capable, in particular, of exerting influence when considering the question of the government's resignation. The chief problem here is how far this independence will go and whether it will lead to the rupture of the alliance between the president and the premier. As the experience of recent months shows, the preservation of the alliance between Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin would be the very best option for the country, since it guarantees the monolith of the executive and, ultimately, stability. The natural preconditions for disagreements, however, must also be taken into account. Above all, there is the objective possibility that, in the event of a deterioration in the socioeconomic situation, the president might sacrifice the government. Finally, we should not forget such a serious factor as the rivalry and the acute contradictions that exist between the apparatuses of the president and the government. In this connection informed sources draw attention to the fact that Shakhray's appointment coincided with a weakening of the positions of one of his chief opponents in the president's entourage -- V. Ilyushin -- and in the absence of S. Filatov, another opponent. As far as is known, Shakhray's appointment is viewed in apparatus circles as a victory for the government's apparatus over the president's. Meanwhile the apparatus of the top organs of state power demonstrated its potential as graphically as can be during the scandal that erupted last week over the president's directive on military bases. The fact that, as S. Krasavchenko, deputy leader of the president's administration, reported, a serious investigation has been launched into this incident concerning the president's directive makes it possible to assume that Yeltsin attached greater significance to the incident than to a simple technical error, and maybe he is already fed up with being constantly deceived by his entourage. As we know, this was by no means the first instance when unexpected documents, to put it mildly, have appeared bearing the president's signature. Take, for example, the case of the publication of the presidential edict on the transfer of the "Lefortovo" Detention Center from the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs to the system of the General Prosecutor's Office, as stated by former General Prosecutor A. Kazannik in an interview in TRUD 29 March. This was the edict which resulted in the rapid release of the Lefortovo inmates. It has become known that an investigation was conducted into that fact, during which it was ascertained that the text of the edict was slipped onto the president's desk by one of his closest aides, who was involved in a purely interdepartmental intrigue and did not contemplate that his actions would have such far-reaching political consequences and would strike a painful blow at the president himself. In the case of the Skrunda radar station, if we rely on available information, it really is a question at present of a technical error. It is hard, however, to rid yourself of the impression that the error occurred at the most suitable time for the president's opponents -- on the eve of the signing of the Russian-Latvian agreement, with the result that serious damage was done both to the president's prestige and to Russia's. Opponents today accuse the president of imposing an agreement on them from a position of strength and demanding concessions while not wishing to concede anything himself. It can be assumed that, if the tendency not to want to make compromises continues, then the memorandum of accord will go the same way as the similar decree of the Seventh Congress of People's Deputies. Russia is entering the final and most complex, most dangerous period of the reforms -- the period of mass bankruptcies and unemployment. If it can get through it without losses and without breaking up the alliance between the president and the premier, if it is possible to preserve political stability in the country and not slide into taking over the opposition's slogans -- not to form a new external enemy, not to begin an imperial flexing of muscles -- then Russia might secure what is probably its only real chance to start climbing out of economic depression. In this case the possibility of an opposition victory will be insignificant.
