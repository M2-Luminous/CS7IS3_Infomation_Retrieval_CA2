For the majority commercial credit today is a luxury but they must operate, and to pay off debts is also a luxury. At the regular meeting of the board of the Russian Federation Committee on Metallurgy a curious plan was proposed for distributing credit funds. It was conventionally called resource-target. In the opinion of experts, it will not save the branch from all of its problems but it will help many to complete mutual settlements. The essence of the "scheme" is this. Credit is granted not to one enterprise, which pays off its debts at its own discretion, but to several. The debtors are arranged in a technological chain: for example, the pipe plant is in debt to the metallurgists, the metallurgists--to the miners, the miners--to the energy workers. This way the same credit passes through all links of the chain. As a result, both the sum of repayment and the credit rate are formed through all participants in the plan, and the last link receives money, say, a billion rubles, with minimal interest. At the same time, as the funds move, it is as though each debtor in the chain gives credit to his creditor, thus there is a mutual settlement of debts. Moreover, the entire sum of credit reaches the final recipient in the complete and unaltered amount. In the opinion of the chief of the administration for finance and accounting of the Russian Federation Committee on Metallurgy, Leonid Rakovskiy, such a system will make it possible to reduce the interest rate on credit, ease the burden of the borrowers, increase the repayment of credit and, as a result, it will draw commercial banks into cooperation with metallurgical enterprises. Even today the Menatep Bank and the branch bank of Metallinvestbank are prepared to work according to this plan. True, the banks will carefully verify the solvency of the clients, and the credit, obviously, will be received only by profitable enterprises. In the words of the chairman of the Russian Federation Committee on Metallurgy, Serafim Afonin, even such a clever system will not help an obvious outsider.
