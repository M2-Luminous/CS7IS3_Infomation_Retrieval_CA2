The lawyer started his criminal lawsuit against Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo, City Mayor Sau Bouer and economist Miguel Angel Broda, accusing them of having caused a run on the currency in February, 1991. Also included in the legal action are the head of the State Intelligence (SIDE) and the head of Citibank and other foreign banks, for telephone eavesdropping and conspiring against the market to make the price of the dollar increase. The nine pages of the complaint contain articles cut from books and magazines and newspapers including extracts of the book El Hacedor, a biography of Cavallo written by journalist Daniel Santoro which covers the run on the Central Bank allegedly caused by leaked information that Central Bank allegedly caused by leaked information that Cavallo had authorized then Treasury Secretary Saul Bouer to pay off Treasury bonds with unbacked money if necessary. Bouer is alleged to have commented on this to economist Broda, which caused the foreign banks to buy dollars to the detriment of the Central Bank. The legal action accuses Cavallo of having raised interest rates and increased statutory reserve requirements with the Central Bank to overcome the crisis. Monner Sans also accuses SIDE of finding out via wire-tapping and not reporting the matter to the courts. Bouer is accused of having leaked a state secret and Broda and the banks are charged with having profited from the deed.
