Speaking before reporters at a press conference he declared yesterday that his visit made at the invitation of the National Guard of South Carolina "ended with the preparation of a joint program which envisages assistance for the Albanian Army, in legislation, technical-scientific assistance, and in the engineering field. The program is expected to be approved by the Pentagon now." The second part of this visit to Washington was described by Minister Zhulali as "a new possibility for the increase and further development of cooperation between the Albanian and the U.S. Armies. It envisages a further intensification of contacts, the signing of new agreements, and their quick application and the further elevation of the level of cooperation." In the meetings with senior Pentagon officials, Mr. Zhulali said, they had discussed the tense situation in the region, the conflict in Bosnia, the situation in Kosova and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. They had represented their options for the solution of the conflict in the region, which consist of an open dialogue and an active role in the peace process. With regard to Kosova, the Albanian party had requested the beginning of an open dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina with the intermediation of a third party, which the Albanian Party had proposed to be the United States. The secretary of defense, William Perry, expressed his readiness for support towards Albania and accepted the invitation to visit Albania soon. Asked by a reporter whether the U.S. party will play the role of an intermediator between Pristina and Belgrade, Minister Zhulali responded that "It is not the desire of the United States and Albania, but other states that are for peace demand this. It is important that this dialogue should begin as soon as possible and we hold that the dialogue must be constructive," Mr. Zhulali said.
