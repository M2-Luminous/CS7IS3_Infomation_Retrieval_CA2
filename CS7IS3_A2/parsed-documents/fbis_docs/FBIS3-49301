[Havel] The Czech Republic naturally has its views not only on the "Partnership for Peace" plan, not only on the future of the North Atlantic Alliance, its identity, its position, and its meaning, but also on the overall security situation in Europe. Naturally, we would like to convey this view to the U.S. side. We would be glad if there were a dialogue; we should not just be told things. [Interviewer] No one in the West denies that NATO is going through an identity crisis. How do you think NATO should solve this crisis and, together with it, the question of security in Europe? [Havel] NATO has realized that, in the new situation of the end of the Cold War, its doctrine, its meaning, its position, and its role in Europe have to change, and it has been working on it. It may appear from our viewpoint that it has been working on it far too slowly, that the situation would require greater courage, greater magnanimity, a faster rate. But I think it cannot be disputed that this alliance, as the strongest and the only functioning one, should be a kind of a stabilizing core of all European security. There are differences in the ideas as to what technique to use, what speed and so on. [end recording]
