Here is Alexandre Garcia's live report from Brasilia: [Garcia] After a 150-minute cabinet meeting to evaluate the situation, President Franco decided to order the Army troops to return to barracks wherever this is possible. In writing, however, he left a warning. He said that whenever and wherever abusive attitudes by striking movements take place, the government will use all the instruments at its disposal to maintain order, although it recognizes citizens' right to strike. Planalto Palace reported the governmental decision to the president of the Chamber of Deputies Defense Committee a few moments ago. He reported the news to the strike command, which has been holding a meeting with the National Defense Committee at the Chamber of Deputies. The committee president said that during the evaluation meeting, it was established that the president of the Republic acted firmly and openly, and that today he used his common sense when he realized that the troops could be withdrawn. A few minutes ago, the president of the National Federation of Federal Policemen -- Francisco Garisto -- said that during the 52 days of the strike several abuses had been committed, and that this brought about the military intervention. He added that from now on such abuses will be avoided, to show the president of the Republic that the strike is seeking purely to ensure better salaries for the PF. As a result of today's detente, he said, negotiations can be resumed. Garisto also asserted to the president of the National Defense Committee that beginning tomorrow, 30 percent of the PF contingents will perform essential services, without again upsetting the people. They will resume control of airports; border posts, including Foz do Iguacu; passports issuance; control of penitentiaries; and drug enforcement operations.
