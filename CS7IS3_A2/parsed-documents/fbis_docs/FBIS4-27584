When the UN Security Council adopted a presidential statement on 30 May, China promptly kept step with other Standing Committee member states and openly stated that its position is the same as that of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. This has not been observed in the past. The current Chinese position on the North Korean nuclear problem is to support the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and to resolve the problem through dialogue between the parties concerned. China has not retreated even a step from these two principles since North Korea declared its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. This being the case, the fact that China agreed, "without any hesitation," with the presidential statement of the Security Council containing a warning message against North Korea clearly shocked North Korea, which claims to be an ally with blood ties. In a statement by its representative to the United Nations, China called for prompt resumption of negotiations with the IAEA and clearly expressed its official position for the first time that China is opposed to any act counter to the NPT. Thus, this can be interpreted as "direct pressure" on North Korea. In the wake of the adoption of the presidential statement by the Security Council, China contacted the North Korean side many times and informed it of the view of the Standing Committee member states on the nuclear issue. In addition, diplomatic sources in Beijing revealed that China urged North Korea to allow future measurement of fuel rods by stressing that sanctions would be inevitable in the event that North Korea does not accept the demand of the Security Council. Such changes in the Chinese attitude was prompted by the fact that China's basic perception of the North Korean nuclear problem has changed. When the first presidential statement of the Security Council was adopted on 31 March calling on North Korea to allow IAEA additional inspections, China expressed its firm conviction that North Korea does not possess nuclear weapons. Because of North Korea's doubtful attitude, including the abrupt independent replacement of fuel rods in the five-megawatt reactor, China began to suspect that North Korea may be attempting to conceal its nuclear weapons development. Nevertheless, it is too early to believe that China will join the UN Security Council when its adopts sanctions against North Korea. This is because Chinese participation in sanctions against North Korea will not only shake its relations with North Korea by their roots, but will also cause a great change in the balance of power in Northeast Asia. This being the case, China must consider its relations with Western countries, including the United States, which extended China's most-favored-nation status. In particular, if China, an NPT member state, supports North Korea, which violates the NPT regulations, China will not only be inconsistent, but also will have to suffer serious confrontation with the United States, which is regarded as the "eldest brother" in the NPT system.
