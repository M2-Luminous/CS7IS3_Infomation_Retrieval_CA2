Ever since several political parties have been functioning in Macedonian political life, some of the parties have been constantly obsessed with the police. The parties try to interpret in their own way any significant action by the police. The national parties in the Macedonian bloc, especially VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party of Macedonian National Unity], are "diligent" in this regard, as well as the Albanians' parties, the PDP [Party for Democratic Prosperity] and the NDP [National Democratic Party]. In the past they have frequently demanded the resignation of the minister of internal affairs. Is it just because Macedonia is in a period of transition, because of the incomplete transformation of the police, or because of the stance of the parties which represent "their people" that we have so many incidents, and scandals, behind us? Or, to put it more simply, are political circles trying to clarify police actions that have already been carried out? Radolista, the Bit Market, the "All-Albanian Army," then Djordje Petrov, Kuklis, the Veles trial, Blue Bird, Duvlo, and finally, Kuceviste, and so forth, are cases of action by the police that were interpreted differently by the parties, and after which there were demands that the head of the police be held accountable. The issue of exceeding authority was always raised. When One Has the Same Standard... When 860 policemen entered the village of Radoliste in 1992, on the basis of previous indications about the possible organization of paramilitary formations, the police were fired upon from several directions and from several houses. Even before this operation, the police had discovered in the same village, in one development in Struga, as well as in Feriste, eight rifles (four automatic rifles and one sniper rifle), 12 pistols, ammunition, 1.6 kilograms of explosives, capsules and slow-burning fuses, 12 gas masks, five pairs of binoculars, and two camouflage uniforms, and 33 people were arrested, three of whom were Albanian citizens. The police thus had grounds for suspicion. The PDP, however, is speaking out in connection with the case, demanding information about the incident, and noting that the increased police presence is unjustified; the entire course of events is being focused on what has already been heard--that the police are conducting operations to intimidate and put pressure on the Albanians, and trying to portray them as terrorists, and in this context, they are allegedly trying to portray the PDP that way as well. Precisely these words were uttered recently when the police arrested several Albanians who were found to be in illegal possession of weapons. The charges filed refer to article 218 of the Criminal Code--the illegal possession of weapons and explosives. That in itself indicates that the latest arrests do not have any connection (at least not according to the statements made to date) with the arrest of the people accused of Albanian paramilitary organization and of the creation of an All-Albanian Army in Macedonia. The PDP and NDP, however, are insisting precisely on that connection, and they are trying to politicize the trial and portray it as a political one. The Albanian deputies in the Tetovo Assembly are even putting the latest case on the agenda (!), demanding that the people arrested be released! Is this a matter of hasty conclusions, pressure upon the Interior Ministry for more selective actions, or even an attempt to persuade international factors that the Albanians in Macedonia are, allegedly, in danger? In the past, however, other citizens have also been held accountable under that same article 218, and not just Albanians. In that same year, 1992, Krum Cuskov and his son Goce Cuskov, as well as Djordji Kalauzarov and Petre Konevski (all from Titov Veles) and Zarko Petrusev and Stojce Delevski from Tetovo, were jailed because of grounds to suspect that they had committed a crime under the same article 218. The defendants from Titov Veles were charged with nine explosions that took place in the city from 1989 to April 1992. The two defendants from Tetovo, along with the Veles group, were planning to blow up the PDP and NDP headquarters in Tetovo. It was precisely in order to prevent that planned bombing that the police stopped pretending that they were "naive," in order to "close the net" around other "bombers" who were possibly involved. (Two more people were later arrested, however.) The court later sentenced them to prison. The "bombers" were members of VMRO-DPMNE, and Kalauzarov was even secretary of the municipal committee. The party disassociated itself from the defendants, while nevertheless not neglecting to say that it was an action at the wrong time and in the wrong place. Then, however, "chief" Nikola Veljanovski from Ohrid was to say that the people involved in the Veles trial were members of VMRO's Defense Committee, which had also issued a death sentence against VMRO-DPMNE leader Ljupco Georgievski. A few months ago, an individual who had "several weapons" was arrested at the Tetovo bus station. The defendant was a Serb by nationality. That time the PDP and NDP kept quiet. Should the Police "Boast"? The police can also "boast" of their actions in the Bit Market, when there was an armed conflict with a large number of Albanian citizens; of their supervision of a number of suspects in the Albanians' rally in the Skopje square, when a map of "the political and territorial autonomy of Albanians in Macedonia" was presented, and when the propaganda material that several citizens, who turned out to be relatives of deputy Mersim Polozani, brought with them to Skopje, was controlled without the use of force. The police can likewise boast of the better-known actions in Kuklis, when the VMRO-DPMNE went into the field with its prominent representatives, or in Djorce Petrov, when "the people" came out again, and the police utilized repression, a case which was likewise politicized by the Macedonian national parties. Skopje's Montenegro, or more precisely the village of Kuceviste, is a place where there have been incidents with the police several times to date, in which the participants were citizens who were Serbs by nationality. The Democratic Party of Serbs in Macedonia was the political factor which politicized the incidents and spread ideas about the Serbophobia of the Interior Ministry and the police's alleged ethnic selectivity along those lines. The "Blue Bird" scandal considerably disturbed the public two years ago. VMRO-DPMNE responded that "The SDB [State Security Service] is using the perfidious insinuations of members of the party in order to discredit it and compromise it in the eyes of the public," and that "The members' ethnic identity is being misused." The resignations of state President Kiro Gligorov and Minister Ljubomir Frckovski were demanded, and it was also demanded that the government be held responsible. It actually had to do with a decision by VMRO-DPMNE's External Commission to form an ethnic army (the MNG [Macedonian National Guard] or guard), whose representatives were received at a high level in the Republic of Bulgaria, where assistance in the form of a 10,000-strong army and special forces was promised. VMRO-DPMNE was informed, and the "guardsmen" swore their oaths in a church in Kuklis. The MNG's statute specified action only in the event of foreign aggression against Macedonia. The period of the MNG's creation coincided with the time of the withdrawal by the JNA [Yugoslav People's Army] from Macedonia (15 April 1992) and the establishment of the ARM [Army of the Republic of Macedonia]. Then contacts with the SDB and the ARM took place. There was no criminal prosecution of the "paramilitary troops," since, as Interior Ministry Under Secretary Slobodan Bogoevski stated then, "the guardsmen have resigned, they did not commit a crime, there is no basis for criminal charges," and "The SDB was obligated to accept the contacts that were offered." Perhaps the unclear and "semi-informative" scandal will go down in the young state's history as a good-faith attempt by a "group of patriots" to fight for its independent, but the case has been profoundly politicized by VMRO-DPMNE. The fact that its closure happened from the moment of the ARM's formation cannot give the incident the same dimensions as the case of the "All-Albanian Army," which is just being clarified. According to the indictment, this has to do with actions that continued even after the JNA's departure from Macedonia, while possible actions during the JNA's presence are, in general, a mitigating circumstance. The statements by local national leaders from Bitola and Ohrid about the alleged "thousands of armed patriots" (paramilitary ones) are nothing more than advertising, at least according to official statements. What is surely the essential thing, and a disturbing one at the same time, is that the idea that the police are against the people, or against the people "represented by" certain parties, is still being encouraged. If one goes by the reactions of the political parties, it turns out that the Interior Ministry authorities exist only for themselves, but are also against all citizens (depending on ethnic identity) in Macedonia. Nevertheless, it is that way throughout the world--when public law and order is threatened security measures are taken, when necessary by means of repression as well. The illegal possession of weapons and explosives is punished, and everywhere terrorist actions have the same name and require sanctions. Different views are discussed, and any abuse of power is determined by the competent authorities.
