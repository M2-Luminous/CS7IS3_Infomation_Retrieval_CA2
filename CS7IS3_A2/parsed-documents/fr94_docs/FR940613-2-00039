Take notice that on June 2, 1994, Pacific Interstate Transmission Co., (PITCO) tendered for filing its notice of intention to recover from its sole customer Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas) on or immediately following August 15, 1994, pursuant to PITCO's cost-of-service tariff, $192 million in payments made to Northwest Alaska Pipeline Company's (Northwest Alaskan) supplier, Pan-Alberta Gas Ltd. (Pan-Alberta) as consideration for revisions to the terms of gas purchase agreements among PITCO and Northwest Alaskan, Northwest Alaskan and Pan-Alberta. PITCO states that the revised gas purchase agreement's pricing mechanism is designed to assure that PITCO's sales to SoCalGas will be at a market sensitive rate. PITCO further states that the term of the agreement will be reduced by ten years, from a termination date of October 31, 2012 to October 31, 2003. PITCO states that recovery by PITCO of its payment to Pan-Alberta shall be achieved by a single payment from SoCalGas. SoCalGas, with the prior approval of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) will raise the necessary funds and pursuant to CPCU authorization will recover a portion of its payment to PITCO from its customers over a five-year period. PITCO states that Northwest Alaskan shall make the necessary tariff filings to reflect the new pricing provisions and terms of the sale agreements. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NW., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with 18 CFR 385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before June 14, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room.
