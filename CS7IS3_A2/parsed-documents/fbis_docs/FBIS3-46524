FBIS3-46524 "dreas001__a94022" FBIS-EAS-94-001-A Document Type:Daily Report 3 January 1994 ANNEX Japan DA To Move Up Review of Buildup Guidelines OW0201073094 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 27 Dec 93 Morning Edition p 2 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0201073094 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] The Defense Agency [DA] has decided to move up the time of reviewing the "Japan Defense Buildup Plan Guideline," the basic guideline for the defense buildup in Japan, to firm up the outline of a new guideline by the end of 1994. The DA has decided to do so in response to Prime Minister Hosokawa's strong intention of attaching great importance to changes taken place in the international situation since the end of the Cold War. The review's results will be reflected in the 1995 budget. The DA plans to make a speedy full-fledged review of the current guideline by setting up a deliberation council consisting of security and foreign affairs experts next spring. In the new proposal for replacing the "Strengthening Defense Capability Plan," which is based on the current guideline, cuts in the fixed number of Ground Self-Defense Force [GSDF] personnel and redefining Japan's participation in the UN Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) are likely to be focal points. The Cabinet decided on the "Japan Defense Buildup Plan Guideline" in 1976 and the prime minister has shown enthusiasm for an early review of it, saying, "The guideline was shaped under the Cold War structure and it has become necessary to review whether it is compatible with the needs of the present day." On 24 December, the prime minister told Yamakuchi, House of Representatives Budget Committee chairman, that "I have already directed the DA to review the guideline and I intend to have the review results reflected in the 1995 budget." What the DA has thus far planned is that it will set the new guideline's outline in March 1995 and make a final decision on it by the end of 1995. However, the DA has decided to move up the review time of the current guideline after concluding that it will be unable to have the results of the review ready in time for the compilation of the 1995 budget. As the situation has continued wherein the number of GSDF personnel falls below its fixed number of 180,000, which is set in the current guideline's "attached list," the DA is likely to shrink the fixed number of GSDF personnel to the current level of 150,000 when it reviews the guideline. The DA also plans to include the use of SDF reserves in the new guideline. In the new guideline, the DA intends to stress the posture of vigorously participating in the PKO. Regarding the theater missile defense that the United States is promoting, meanwhile, the DA is expected to refer to it in one way or another in the new guideline. In the new guideline, the DA is likely to forward a new defense policy by sweepingly changing the conventional way of analyzing the international situation on the premise of confrontation between two superpowers, the United States and Soviet Union. In late 1994, however, a preliminary budget request for fiscal 1995 will be decided and it is hard to predict to what extent the new guideline will be reflected in a budget bill for fiscal 1995. The deliberation council is likely to begin a full-fledged review after a budget bill for fiscal 1994 is enacted. Any delay in the budget bill's enactment is expected to force the deliberation council to draw a conclusion on the new guideline by the end of 1994 after six months of review. DA officials are voicing doubts about the prime minister's posture, saying, "The prime minister is in too much of a hurry," (says a senior DA official). Some DA officials think that the prime minister probably aims to appease the ruling Social Democratic Party of Japan, which has insisted on cutting defense spending.
