Two cousins, 'Amr and Raja' Abu-Sittah, are accused by Israel of murdering a Gaza settler on March 8, 1993. "We appeal to the Palestinian authority to release those who our enemies want to kill," said the Abu-al-Rish group, named in memory of a guerrilla killed by the Israelis after he laid down his weapons for autonomy. The small group is made up of fighters from the Hawks of Fatah, the mainstream PLO movement, who decided to pursue the armed struggle. "Even though none of our men has carried out any acts or crimes against the peace process, the Palestinian police has arrested 'Amr and Raja' Abu-Sitta without reason, as well as 'Ali Al-Dali et 'Abda-al-Salam Al-Qasaf," the group said in a statement. "It is a crime to arrest any one who gave his life for the homeland, who resisted occupation with all his strength. We demand their release." The Abu-Sittas enlisted in the new police force in May but walked out before the end of the month claiming they were not protected against Israeli agents who wanted to kill them.
