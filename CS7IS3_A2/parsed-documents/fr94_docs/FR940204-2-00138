SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public Reference Branch. Applicant's Representations 1. Heber J. Grant & Company, a Utah corporation, was organized in 1888 by its founder, Heber J. Grant, to consolidate his various business interests into a single enterprise. Applicant operates as an insurance agency, engaged in both wholesale activities as a general agent and as a retail agent selling directly to the public, through an 83.5 percent-owned subsidiary. Applicant proposes to dispose of its insurance subsidiary, after which applicant's principal asset would be investment securities. 2. Currently, there are 148,856 shares of applicant's common stock ($1.00 par value) outstanding, held by approximately 250 shareholders. During his lifetime, applicant's founder transferred or donated shares of applicant's stock to family members, and to other parties. Applicant's stock has never been offered or sold to the public, and applicant has not sold its shares to any person since before 1920. Of the issued and outstanding stock, 60.4 percent is held by direct descendants of Heber J. Grant, their spouses, and 32 family trusts and one partnership for the exclusive benefit of direct descendants of Heber J. Grant or their spouses and in which such persons collectively exercise sole voting and dispositive power; 16.5 percent is owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (the ``LDS Church''), for which Heber J. Grant served as president between 1919 and 1945; 13.7 percent is held by 66 present or former executive employees of applicant, and the remaining 9.4 percent is held by 53 descendants of donees of Heber J. Grant. To the best of applicant's knowledge, its stock has not been quoted in any active trading market, and no stock has been sold through securities broker-dealers. 3. Applicant's transfer records for the past twelve years indicate that transfers of applicant's stock were made as part of the estate planning of living shareholders, and as a result of the death of other shareholders and the transfer of stock to descendants. Applicant believes that all of such transfers were made to family members of applicant's founder, Heber J. Grant. In addition, all purchases and sales of applicant's stock noted in such transfer records were executed among existing shareholders.
