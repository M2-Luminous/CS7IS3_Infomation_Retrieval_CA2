The exports, if achieved, would give Taiwan a 12-percent share of the world market of IDF-type fighters, Lin, formerly commander-in-chief of the Air Force, said. He said that it is the goal of the AIDC to export the locally made aircraft. "Although it's surely the way the AIDC has to go, an export license from the United States and permit from the government are still necessary." The AIDC, with technological assistance from the United States, is producing two IDFs monthly. The cooperative relationship calls for Taiwan to get American approval before it can sell the aircraft abroad. He said that a squadron of 24 IDFs will be delivered to the Air Force as scheduled by the end of this year, greatly beefing up Taiwan's air defense capability. Each IDF costs US$24 million to make, but Lin said that could be lowered to US$22 million in the future with accumulated experience and improved operations of the AIDC. Lin said the AIDC is responsible for designing and producing the bodies of the IDFs, 50 percent of its generators and less than [word indistinct] percent of its electronic equipment, with the remaining parts being supplied by the United States. He said that although the local content rate could be raised further in the long run, that goal would be difficult to achieve anytime soon under the agreement reached with the United States. He said that several foreign aircraft producers, including McDonnell Douglas and Boeing of the U.S., British Aerospace plc and Dassault of France, have approached the AIDC about the possibility of joint production of commercial planes even though the AIDC at the moment is incapable of making such planes. Lin said, however, that the AIDC will aggressively seek to sell components and parts or establish relationships with foreign airplane makers to jointly develop commercial aircraft. The AIDC, formerly controlled by the Cheng-shan Institute of Science and Technology, will soon become the first state-run company under the Defense Ministry.
