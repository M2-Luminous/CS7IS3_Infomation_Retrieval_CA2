Stimulated by an unusually good agricultural season, growth for 1994 should be close to 10 percent. But much remains to be done to overcome poverty, which has declined only slightly in recent years... Casablanca--A largely agricultural country, Morocco is highly dependent on the weather, which has not been kind to the country recently, with severe drought two years in a row. By contrast, 1994 shows signs of being an exceptionally good year, with a cereal harvest that could approach 100 million quintals, compared to less than 30 million the previous year. The entire economy will get a shot in the arm from the "harvest of the century." With a bit of luck, the country's growth rate--depressingly negative for the last two years--could exceed 10 percent in 1994, according to unofficial projections. Such good news could not come at a better time for Morocco, which after defaulting on its international payments in 1983 ended up spending 10 years implementing a structural adjustment plan under the aegis of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). To judge by macroeconomic indicators, the austerity cure has borne fruit. The budget deficit is small (less than 2 percent of GDP in 1994 versus 13 percent in 1986), inflation is moderate, debt service absorbs a smaller and smaller share of export earnings, hard-currency reserves are up, and the national currency, the dirham, is well on its way to complete convertibility. One sign of the international community's newfound confidence in Morocco: The country is beginning to attract foreign capital. The sums involved are still relatively modest: $500 million in investments last year, or about 3 billion [French] francs. But they have been enough to stabilize the balance of payments. More important, the totals are growing rapidly: "Between 1990 and 1994, foreign investment increased fivefold," says Mohammed Sagou, minister of finance. This manna should have a tonic effect on the Casablanca Stock Exchange. The exchange, housed in a splendid colonial edifice in the heart of the nation's economic capital, has never regained the luster of its earliest days, nearly six decades ago. Today, it rouses from its torpor for only one hour a day, in late afternoon, when some twenty stock brokers--one of them a woman--gather around the brokers' enclosure the way friends congregate at a cafe. Accelerate Privatization More than 60 enterprises are listed on the official exchange, but in practice trading is limited to about twenty of them. And such transactions! The banks, which are the primary shareholders, are extremely conservative and can seldom be induced to sell any of their stock, for reasons having to do with the cost of transactions (there are ten offers to purchase for every offer of sale). The dearth of stock fuels a steady increase in share prices. "On average since 1987, the index has risen close to 30 percent per year," says Amyn Alami, a young "golden boy" [preceding words in English] schooled in Paris whose ambition is to start a merchant bank in his native Morocco. Artisanal and speculative, the Casablanca Exchange aspires to expansion and respectability. And it is counting on the privatization of state-owned enterprises to make it happen. In fact, privatization was launched close to four years ago, but progress has been so slow that to date only about a dozen enterprises--a number of them hotels--have been turned over to the private sector and (in some cases) listed on the stock exchange. "We're going to speed things up dramatically," says privatization minister Abderrahmane Saidi. "The law calls for privatizing 112 enterprises between now and the end of 1995. We will go even further. Already we are working on the next list. And every sector of activity will be considered." The next series of privatizations will focus on the banking and financial system, in particular four banks[.sup]1[/] from which the state plans to disengage only partly. Other enterprises to be privatized include National Investment Company (SNI), a ubiquitous holding company involved in everything from agrofood to finance, and BTP [? 4-10 years treasury bonds], which Mr. Saadi does not hesitate to describe as a "pure jewel." SNI's value will be determined, in late June, by an appraisers' council composed of "men completely above suspicion," in hopes of bringing in private shareholders by September, the minister said. As in earlier privatizations, procedures will be modeled on the French practice, with creation of a "hard core" [i.e. long-term, big investors] and mechanisms to facilitate employee stock acquisition. "Over the next two years, the number of firms quoted on the exchange will double," swears its director-general, Abderrazak Laraki. To prepare for the future, new equipment is being acquired--Reuter screens have started springing up around the central enclosure--and there are ambitious plans to relocate the exchange to an ultramodern building. Most important, a suitable juridical environment is being fashioned, with everything from SICAVs [short-term mutual funds] and common money market funds to new accounting standards and an "ethics council" to ensure transparency of transactions. The council has its work cut out for it. Witness the example of CTM [Moroccan Transport Company], the national transport company privatized (successfully) just a year ago. "The company waited until 1994 to publish its 1992 financial position data," notes Jalal Houti, manager of Morocco's leading brokerage firm, Upline Securities. The success of the exchange revitalization will be judged by how attractive it proves to foreign investors. The latter, so far, are not exactly falling over themselves to rush in--but neither are they turning their backs. Two SICAVs specializing in Moroccan securities have made their appearance in France in recent months; this spring, Salomon Brothers (United States) in partnership with ONA [North African Holding Company], Morocco's biggest private group, launched a $100-million fund, a part of which will be invested on the exchange; and financier George Soros has announced he would enter into discussions "with Moroccan governmental authorities on ways to participate in the privatizations." In Morocco, the first privatizations excited more than just polite curiosity. More than 11,000 persons bought shares in CTM, and 15,000 purchased stock in SOFAC-Credit, a consumer loan company. All the same, little is really known about the new shareholders. Are they--as claims Abdelmajid Bouzoubaa, secretary-general of the CDT [Democratic Labor Confederation]--members of the "comprador bourgeoisie"? Or do they belong to that "middle class" that is already becoming an economic reality and someday will be a political force too? Sociological investigation is needed to answer that question.

[box, p 15] World Bank Report Since the mid-1980's, poverty in Morocco has declined. A generation ago, per capita GDP was only $500, and 6.5 million people were classed as "underprivileged." By 1991, the GDP had doubled, and only half as many people were living in poverty. But, as the World Bank is careful to note in a report--"Kingdom of Morocco: Poverty, Adjustment, and Growth"--published early this year, that represents only a "slight improvement," since close to 1.7 million people are living so close to the economic edge that they must be classified as "almost poor." Unsurprisingly, the World Bank attributes Morocco's successes--obtained despite a very high rate of demographic growth and restrictions imposed by the adjustment policy--to a series of governments that were able to "stabilize the economy...undertake far-reaching structural reforms, and...maintain high economic growth." The report highlights the growing disparities between urban and rural areas. "Poverty in Morocco is increasingly a rural phenomenon," the bank observes. According to its calculations, seven out of 10 poor Moroccans live in rural areas. Another cleavage--and Moroccan leaders are well aware of it--is seen in the contrast between rich urban coastal areas, where the poor are no more than 5 percent of the population, and rural areas in north-central, eastern, and south-central Morocco, where poverty afflicts almost one out of every four inhabitants. To ameliorate living conditions among the most disadvantaged, the bank preaches maintaining, to the maximum extent possible, sustained economic growth ("the most effective long-term cure for poverty"), while at the same time implementing specific programs to upgrade rural areas. For example, to slow down the rural exodus, the report suggests reducing the current 50-percent gap between the minimum industrial wage and its agricultural equivalent. To deal with unemployment, a scourge that weakens the country and hits hardest those least able to cope, the bank urges Morocco to follow the example of other countries and expand public works programs "that employ unskilled manpower for below the minimum wage."
