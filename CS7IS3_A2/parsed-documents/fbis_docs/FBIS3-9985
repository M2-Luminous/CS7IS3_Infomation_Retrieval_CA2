In a brief news conference, Hermoza, who is also commander of the Armed Forces Joint Command, rejected allegations by local and foreign observers that Fujimori is "mortgaged" to the Armed Forces. "Military forces have no influence on the government whatsoever, and any statement to the contrary is groundless," Hermoza said. Several publications and commentators have described him as the virtual "power behind the throne" in Peru. Gen. Hermoza added that it is clear to the Armed Forces that "Fujimori is the nation's first citizen based on the people's democratic will," and therefore "he is the supreme chief of the Armed Forces to whom it owes discipline and subordination." Criticism has intensified in Peru and abroad about what many have openly defined as "a civilian-military government" after Congress and the government approved a controversial law giving military courts authority to try a case involving a massacre committed by soldiers. Independent politicians, opposition leaders, observers from various groups, and local and foreign media have said that the government's "secretive attitude" corroborates the presumed submission of civilian authorities to the military forces. Fujimori has repeatedly said that it is not subordination but identification between the government and the military forces on everything concerning the struggle against terrorism and drug trafficking.
