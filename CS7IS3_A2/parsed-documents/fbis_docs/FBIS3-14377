The tension rose when Jum'ah al-Fazzani, secretary of the Libyan General People's Committee for Unity [title as received], announced that his country was thinking of withdrawing from the Arab League because of the latter's failure to solve Arab problems, including the Libyan-Western crisis. The sources said that the desire shown by Ibrahim al-Bishari, Libya's permanent envoy to the Arab League, to head his country's delegation to the Arab League Council meetings was a clear signal that this tension is over. The sources added that Libya is satisfied with the Arab League's stance on the Libyan-Western crisis and that the Libyan permanent envoy expressed his country's appreciation for the role played by the Arab League and the seven-member committee in solving this problem. The sources went on to say that the Arab League secretary general played a vital role in the meeting of the seven-member committee and left his print on the resolution issued on the Libyan-Western crisis issued at the conclusion of the Arab League Council session, which emphasized the League's support for Libyan efforts to find a peaceful solution to this crisis.
