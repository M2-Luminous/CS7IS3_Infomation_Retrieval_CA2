While respecting the decision of his party, the Party for Democracy and Progress, to withdraw from the government, he says that, as a patriot, he is duty bound to pursue the work that he has started with the support of the Malian youth and sports community, in particular, and the Malian people, in general. As a result, Boubacar Karamoko Coulibaly says that, out of respect for the Malian people and as a citizen, he has decided to remain in the government in order to make his modest contribution to the construction of a democratic and prosperous Malian state.
