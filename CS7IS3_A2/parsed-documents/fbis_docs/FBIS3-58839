Rather, the Association proceeds on the assumption that the employment problem will even increase in 1994. The latest economic report substantiates this by the statement that the expected stimulation of foreign demand can only result in a modest growth impulse. With the new increase of the burden of rates and taxes, the economy has been burdened with an additional "field pack for the way out of the economic depression." According to this assumption, it will not be possible to return to a dynamic investment boom and thus to solve the employment problem in 1994, it was stated. The industrial enterprises reacted to the economic deterioration with rationalization and staff cuts. The measures have not failed to be effective. While in the first quarter of 1993, the unit labor costs, which increased by more than 10 percent, almost exploded, they were only about 1.5 percent higher than last year in the past three available months. However, the cost crisis has not yet been overcome. While producer prices continue to decline, the profit situation remains tense. The improvement of the cost situation does not suffice for economic recovery. In addition, relative competitiveness has to be improved and demand has to be developed. At present, however, this is complicated by the increasing tax burden. As early as now, the job reduction caused by rationalization goes far beyond comparable developments of former cycles. A considerable part of it also contains structural adjustments because of deteriorated conditions of business locations, it was stated. Almost all job losses fell to industry in 1993. While in the economy as a whole there were still about 1.3 million employees more than in 1989, in the west German industry there were already 100,000 fewer employees than in the recession year 1983. Here it has been taken into account that the building trade was the only industrial branch to slightly increase its employment once again in 1993. The BDI is convinced that the job reduction will gradually end in eastern Germany. Production expanded in many branches in 1993. This process will broaden and become more dynamic this year. Despite considerable success in the improvement of production, the level of costs in the east is still higher than in western Germany. This is an important reason for the previous small success of east German enterprises in the world market, it was stated. Apart from Great Britain, in the countries of the European Union (EU) the economic situation is still marked by weak economic activity. However, the downward trend slowed perceptibly in the second half of 1993. Meanwhile, the bottom of recession has probably been reached almost everywhere. Private consumption has stagnated. As a result of the increasing surplus capacity and the pessimistic business expectations, the enterprises' investments have decreased considerably. The economic development is still suffering from the sluggish domestic demand. Therefore, industry in the EU countries suffered most from recession in 1993. From June to August, production decreased by 3.8 percent and the production of capital goods by even 6.4 percent, it was stated. At the end of the year, however, there were the first signs of a recovery of the EU economy. The world economic surroundings have improved further. Thus, the export chances of European enterprises have clearly increased. The stimulation of exports will initiate a modest recovery, but without a change in the trend in domestic demand it will not be possible to achieve sufficient dynamism, which is required for the reduction of unemployment. The BDI assesses it positively that, with 3.2 percent, the inflation rate in the European Union has fallen to a new low in November and may decrease further, since the pressure from wage costs will presumably decrease. Then monetary policy will be able to stick to its course, which supports economic activity. The improvement of the economic climate in the European Union itself also points to a further economic stimulation. The latest poll signals decreasing pessimism in industry in nine out of 12 countries. Capacity utilization amounted to 77.5 percent in October, and thus it was slightly higher than in the previous quarter. In the opinion of the BDI, the capacity utilization rate will increase gradually in the next few months.
