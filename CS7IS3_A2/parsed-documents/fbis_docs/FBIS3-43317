After touching on the latest developments in the country, Defense Minister General Raymond Damase Ngollo stated "the Army's present position in the face of the political situation in our country." [Begin recording] "This situation is a challenge to the top army hierarchy who, according to your directives, Mr. President, should have taken control of the (?field) since the early days of the crisis a little over a year ago." But we are prepared today "to assume our responsibilities." However, Mr. President of the Republic, it seems important to face the reality of our army. Three quarters of our army are made up of commissioned and noncommissioned officers. A divided army cannot take control of any situation, and that is deplorable. Since 1983 there has been no (?jurisprudence) within the FAC, and the failure of the compulsory national service has contributed to worsening this situation. In terms of equipment and infrastructure, our army finds itself in (?an uncomfortable situation) in the face of lacking equipment and motivation. "The FAC (?is now passing through) an unprecedented stage. The commissioned and noncommissioned officers and the rank and file are left at the mercy of alliances. This, Mr. President, is the institution we have in hand to cope with our delicate mission which consists in "guaranteeing the security of persons and their property, ensuring security at the borders, and participating in the social and economic development effort." [end recording] In his speech, Prof. Pascal Lissouba, commander in chief of the Armed Forces, declared that the FAC has to be recycled. We listen to him: [Begin recording] Indeed, my general, as I stated a year ago, the Armed Forces are the only organized Congolese institution. Indeed, my general, we were somewhat disappointed. Indeed, my general, our country's social fabric, which disintegrated dangerously, did not spare this institution. This is why, my general, I urge our military attaches to work hard. The fact is simply that we will have to recycle everyone. We will have to review the men of your institution, because as you know it is more than three decades since Congo formed an army. But I do not believe that Congo could think that an army, just like an individual, is a machine. To operate it, you need to feed it from time to time. Surely, you do not only have to feed it with hope and aspiration but also spiritually and psychologically, for we should not forget that technology advances and methods change. Therefore, countrymen, your troops must equally follow the trend. "How do we go about it? Perhaps, we have to hold some talks and discussions with the military attaches of friendly countries so that an effort may be made in order that -- like what occurs at the military academy where many of the attaches carry out their trade -- we may take a look at those of your colleagues who flank you and who also require recycling. This seems crucial when you begin to move forward at a great pace in implementing the ideas which you yourself outlined. Indeed, we did think of embarking on recruitment. But these will not be like those you have been accustomed to in the past. You are going to be in charge of these recruitments. You will do them in a national manner. In other words, you will go to every region of our country. I cannot spot the general in charge of the Gendarmerie. Oh yes, he is there. He has already begun a job which he showed to me, and I think I am expecting that of my general. These recruitments must not be made like the ones we were doing in the past. That is to say, we were making a selection and then finally we were among ourselves. You will have to recruit them from all over the republic." [end recording]
