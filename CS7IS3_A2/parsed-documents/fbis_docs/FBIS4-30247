The Seoul Subway Corp. set in motion an emergency subway operation plan, using 295 non-striking engineers to start train runs at much longer intervals at 5:30 AM, 30 minutes later than usual. The workers, sticking to their demand for a 14.5-percent wage hike, turned down the corporation's offer of a 3-percent raise, an informal guideline set by the government to fight inflation. Railroad engineers also went on strike Thursday, nearly paralyzing railway transportation across the country. In a related development, subway workers in Pusan, the country's second largest city, shelved a plan to strike Friday morning in sympathy with their colleagues in Seoul.
