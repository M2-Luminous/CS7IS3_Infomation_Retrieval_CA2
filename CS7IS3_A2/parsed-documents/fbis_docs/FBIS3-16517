In a letter addressed to parliament Speaker Ulo Nugis, the Council of the Russian Community put forward suggestions concerning the repatriation of ethnic Russians. The letter, signed by Yuri Kotenkov, included the text of the Declaration on Compatriots' Rights adopted Jan. 29 at the second world congress of Russian communities. The declaration defines as "compatriots" all persons who permanently resided on the territory of the Soviet Union and held Soviet citizenship, if they regard Russian as their mother tongue. "Compatriots" have the inalienable right to a united fatherland. The declaration regards as fatherland "the territory that is inherent in the statehood of the Russian nation and that legitimately belonged to the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union, including changes of border effected in accordance with the Constitutions of those states." The document maintains that compatriots cannot be declared to be aliens in any part of the territory; that neither collective nor individual deportation, or other similar measures, may be applied to them; and that compatriots cannot be declared to be stateless persons. The congress of the Russian communities plans to set up a commission on compatriots' rights to check on observance of the declaration. The commission is authorized, among other things, to draw up lists of "officials, organizations and individuals responsible for acts committed against compatriots or Russian communities." Kulbok said Royalists plan tomorrow to ask the interior minister for an explanation as to "how many persons there are in Estonia who disseminate this declaration and what's to become of Kotenkov who sent the declaration to the parliament."
