FR940127-0-00015 FR940127-0-00003 (6) Rules where multiple projects are involved. A reserve account(s) must be maintained for each borrower. When a borrower owns multiple projects, reserve accounts may be established for each project. A single reserve account may also be established by a borrower owning multiple projects, provided the conditions set out in subpart C of part 1930 of this chapter are met. (7) Term. Reserve accounts are expected to be kept for the full term of the loan. (b) Deposits and account activity statements. (1) Deposits. Generally, the FmHA will not require the review or approval of deposits or the use of Forms FmHA 402&hyph;1 or FmHA 402&hyph;2. (2) Account activity statements. Generally, the FmHA will not monitor or reconcile the reserve account activity statements issued periodically by the financial institutions holding the funds. FmHA will monitor reserve account levels through budget reports, audits, and Agency reserve tracking systems. If disputes arise or the borrower is in violation of Agency regulations, the Agency may require account activity statements. When account activity statements are sought, it will normally be sufficient to obtain the statement which reflects balances as of the last activity statement ending period. Form FmHA 402&hyph;2 is not required to be used. §§1902.17&hyph;1902.49 [Added and reserved] 5. Sections 1902.17 thru 1902.49 are added and reserved. 6.

Subpart C_Management and Supervision of Multiple Family Housing Borrowers and Grant Recipients 8. The introductory text of paragraph XIII B 2 c of Exhibit B of subpart C is revised to read as follows: Exhibit B of Subpart C_Multiple Housing Management Handbook * * * * * XIII Accounting and Reporting and Financial Management Analysis: * * * * * B. *␣*␣* 2. *␣*␣* c. Reserve account. The reserve account is a required account subject to the requirements set out in this paragraph. The borrower will initiate monthly deposits in this project account, preferably an interest bearing account, starting the same month the first loan payment is due FmHA. As projects age, the required reserve account level may be adjusted to meet anticipated ``life-cycle'' needs, including equipment and facility replacement costs, by amending the loan agreement/resolution. All RRH, RCH, and LH borrowers operating projects (i.e., all LH borrowers exclusive of those on-farm type LH borrowers) are required to establish a reserve account. Effective as of July 26, 1994, reserve funds will be required to be placed in a supervised account. The provisions of subpart A of part 1902 of this chapter apply. Reserve funds on deposit just prior to this date in instruments which are subject to monetary penalties for early withdrawal may be temporarily held for the time needed to avoid such penalties. * * * * * Dated: October 12, 1993.
