FR941125-0-00018 FR941125-0-00008 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Office of Foreign Assets Control 31 CFR Part 500 Foreign Assets Control Regulations; Unblocking of Cambodian Assets AGENCY: Office of Foreign Assets Control, Treasury. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: Pursuant to the settlement agreement entered into on October 6, 1994, between the Government of the United States and the Royal Cambodian Government, the Office of Foreign Assets Control is unblocking assets in which Cambodia or a national thereof has an interest, blocked pursuant to the Foreign Assets Control Regulations. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Steven I. Pinter, Chief of Licensing (tel.: 202/622&hyph;2480), or William B. Hoffman, Chief Counsel (tel.: 202/622&hyph;2410), Office of Foreign Assets Control, Department of the Treasury, Washington, D.C. 20220. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Electronic Availability This document is available as an electronic file on The Federal Bulletin Board the day of publication in the Federal Register .

Background On January 3, 1992, former President Bush lifted the trade embargo against Cambodia and authorized new financial and other transactions with Cambodia and its nationals. Property blocked as of January 2, 1994, because of an interest therein of Cambodia or its nationals, however, remained blocked pending a settlement agreement between the two countries. On October 6, 1994, a settlement was reached between the United States Government and the Royal Cambodian Government, providing that Cambodian property be unblocked. Accordingly, this rule amends §500.570 of the Foreign Assets Control Regulations, 31 CFR part 500, to unblock assets in which there is an interest of Cambodia or a national thereof effective November 25, 1994, with the exception of funds blocked in the name of the Exchange Support Fund for the Khmer Republic (the ``ESF''). ESF funds, representing contributions of various countries to assist in financing Cambodia's foreign exchange costs of imports and related services, will be unblocked in coordination with the various donor countries. The authorization in §500.570 does not excuse compliance with any applicable provision of law, nor compliance with reporting requirements imposed by general or specific licenses with respect to transactions prior to November 25, 1994. Further, the amendment does not affect penalty or enforcement proceedings with respect to violations of part 500 arising prior to that date. Because the FACR involve a foreign affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay in effective date, are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, does not apply.
