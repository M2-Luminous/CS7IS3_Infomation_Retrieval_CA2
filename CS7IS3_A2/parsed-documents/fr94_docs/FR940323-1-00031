B and II. D, respectively, of the preamble. Our proposed interpretation of the statutory provisions relating to these two areas would have minimal cost effects and will probably save money through better management of high risk pregnancies. At most, the proposed interpretation of the provision relating to continuous eligibility of newborn children would cost $10 million, a very small addition to the statutory costs included in the above tables. However, we believe that most States have already adopted our proposed interpretation as practice. In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866, this proposed regulation was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.
