"Anyone who wants to use the reduction of social services as a means for conducting Social Democratic politics will have the opportunity to present this for consideration at the forthcoming SPD party congress in Halle"--thus the response by deputy parliamentary caucus chairman and sociopolitician Dressler to the minister-president of the Saarland, who, more in passing than anything else, had stated that, in a consolidation of the budget under an SPD government, social services could also be considered for cuts. Not the traditional right-left debates over foreign policy or the relationship with the Greens would characterize the various wings of the party, say Social Democrats from the tradition-bound SPD from the Ruhr District. The position taken relative to social policies and to cutbacks in funding for social services will become the distinguishing feature. Only people with their own swimming pool could do without the public pool, the debate escalates. The triviality of the cause and the efforts being made to clear the matter up indicate that Rudolf Scharping has only succeeded in settling the dispute for the time being, but not in eliminating the more deep-seated differences of opinion. Following a conversation with SPD finance ministers of the laender, Lafontaine had explained the familiar finance policy details of the campaign platform: No increase in the tax rate, budgetary austerity. As long as an economic recovery had not gotten off the ground, there could be no cuts in the federal budget, since jobs would be threatened otherwise. But if there is an upward trend in the economy, one sustained not only by the demand for exports but also by demand at home, "social services" would also be put on the "test stand." There would be "a wailing and a chattering of teeth" if that happened, he indicated. Dressler felt compelled by reactions from within the party and probably also from shop stewards close to the SPD to come up with a clear reply. "The assertion that an SPD-led Federal Government would also resort to a curtailment of social services as a means for consolidating the public finances is not justified by anything." Within the Bundestag caucus, critical questions along this same line were asked. "The consolidation of public finances cannot be achieved through a cut in social services," deputy party chairman Thierse was quoted as saying. Scharping was called upon to mediate. Before making public criticisms, those involved should make use of the telephone, he said. His admonitions were viewed as "elegant" because he had named no names and had thus "damaged" no one. A telephonic conference circuit among Scharping, Dressler, and Lafontaine was intended to settle the dispute. Many are comparing Scharping's efforts with "Geneva" peace negotiations, at the conclusion of which the chairman announced the formula for settlement. The federal deficit threatens to strangulate the state budgets; the share borne by the state cannot be increased. The SPD will keep the increase in Federal spending "below the increase in the GNP." Scharping is trying to do justice to both sides. With respect to Lafontaine, Scharping's text contains the following: "The consequence is obvious: In the course of putting the federal finances back on an even keel, and on the basis of an environmentally compatible growth, the SPD will subject all federal services--including taxation and social--to continuing scrutiny." Meant for Dressler was the assurance that the essential thing now was to establish the "aiming accuracy" of federal services and to avoid "weakening effects." "That is not social dismantlement, but, on the contrary, a component of the urgently needed modernization of activities by the state." Recommendations taken from the SPD's governing program on child allowances and on "doing away with unjust tax exemptions" were appended. All sides were able to affirm afterwards that the dispute was now "settled." Conjectures to the contrary have remained. Dressler's intention had been to counter false signals which might have weakened the will of the party to conduct an active electoral campaign. He may have recalled earlier statements made by Lafontaine. "The second is--that too must be said here--that only massive intervention in consumer spending--I repeat: massive intervention in consumer spending--will be able to slow down the continued dramatic rise in the Federal deficit once the economy has begun to recover again." The applause of the party congress for these clear words by Lafontaine was not effusive at this point of his speech. His election as one of Rudolf Scharping's deputies nevertheless turned into a vote of confidence. He received 381 votes last November in Wiesbaden, 20 more than Scharping received in his election as party chairman, and almost 60 more than Rudolf Dressler got in the election to the party executive. The voters must be told the truth, Lafontaine had called out, as if to affirm anew his campaign of 1990. Despite his success at the party congress, Lafontaine has long been viewed by tradition-bound Social Democrats as representing an individualistic political approach, one which underestimates the importance of societal "solidarity." Representatives of the labor unions and also the socialist left wing of the party join forces here. The fiscal policy of Lafontaine and of deputy parliamentary caucus chairwoman Ingrid Matthaeus-Maier are destroying the foundations of the SPD, critics note--softly, for the time being, so as not to disrupt the campaign. And many are also looking at Scharping, who had made Lafontaine the deputy chairman of the election platform committee, as well as the fiscal and economic policy spokesman of the party leadership. The two of them, they are wont to say, want to form a "strong axis." The turmoil surrounding Lafontaine's statements, which contentwise are nothing but a watered-down version of his announcements of last November, shows how thin the ice that sustains them is in the event of a conflict.
