It is further ordered that AT&T and Alascom SHALL FILE within 60 days of the effective date of this order, requests with the United States Internal Revenue Service (``IRS'') and with the State of Alaska for expedited rulings on whether the transition payment is, in whole or in part, taxable income. 73 73 We delegate to the Chief, Common Carrier Bureau the authority to modify the AT&T transition payment to reflect the IRS and State of Alaska tax rulings as recommended in the Final Recommended Decision, FCC 93J&hyph;2, at para. 128, n. 170. 54.

We require that Alascom file its proposals for treatment of the installments on the dates scheduled for payment by AT&T of the two installments so that Commission staff can review the proposals in a timely fashion. 56 It is further ordered that AT&T must purchase a fixed dollar amount of common carrier services from Alascom for each six month period of the second phase of the transition period according to the methodology adopted in the Final Recommended Decision and modified in this order. 76 76 We delegate to the Chief, Common Carrier Bureau authority to decide issues arising with respect to the calculation of the fixed dollar amount of Alascom services AT&T must purchase for each six month period of the second phase of the transition period. 57. It is further ordered that no later than September 1, 1995, AT&T and Alascom may propose jointly an alternative method for calculating the fixed dollar amount of Alascom's Services AT&T must purchase for the provision of interstate MTS during the second phase of the transition period. 77 77 A deadline was not established in the Final Recommended Decision for AT&T and Alascom to propose an alternative method for calculating AT&T's fixed dollar purchase obligation during the second phase of the transition period.
