But one cannot see any special activity going on at privatized enterprises. In fact, the giants of industry are never on sale, although at this auction the caliber of enterprises varied. Among the 45 enterprises offered for sale are those of the light industry, fuel and gas supplying, and machine-building. As has been expected, the least demand of the approximately 100 funds participating in the auction, was in construction industry enterprises, because their capacity is small, the infrastructure is not there, and the production base is weak. But such enterprises as the Akmolinsk spinning and weaving mill or the Karagandaodezhda joint stock company were objects of serious battles. The outcome of the fourth auction is as follows: 85.3 percent of stock were sold. Of 104 funds that contested the tenders, 83 funds bought shares. The others lost owing to deliberately low starting prices.
