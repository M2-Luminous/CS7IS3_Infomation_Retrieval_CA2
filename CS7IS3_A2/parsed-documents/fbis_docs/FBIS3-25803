At the meeting, State Council Vice Premier Zou Jiahua pointed out: To develop the regional economy, we should formulate an overall and comprehensive plan along the thought of linking up the local economy while opening up a channel to the outside world by capitalizing on geographical, resources, market, and industrial edges of different but economically related provinces and cities in the region. We should exploit the vitality that could be generated through different localities supplementing each other's advantages. Regional economy has become a new pattern in our country's economic development. Leading comrades from provinces and cities including Hebei, Liaoning, Shandong, Shanxi, Beijing, and Tianjin, as well as from the ministries of railways, communications, power industry, coal industry, metallurgical industry, chemical industry, and agriculture, attended the discussion meeting. It was the fourth regional economic planning meeting following those held in 1992 and 1993 for southwest China and part of south China, Chang Jiang Delta and Chang Jiang regions, and northwest China. In his speech, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua summed up the principle of our country's regional economic planning as overall planning; mutual cooperation; supplementing each other's advantages; equality and mutual benefit; gearing toward markets; domestic and international cooperation; rational division of work; and joint development. Zou Jiahua pointed out: The pan-Bo Hai region has superior location advantages. It is the center of the northeast Asian economic sphere and the most convenient access to the sea for our country's north, northeast, and part of northwest regions. The region leads the country in comprehensive scientific and technological advantages, with the number of institutes of higher learning and scientific and technological personnel in the region constituting about one-third of the nation's total. The region holds advantages in its energy and heavy and chemical industries, with coal, oil, and steel production making up 40 percent of the nation's total production. The region is also our country's aviation and communications center, and has the most concentrated network of railways, roads, large ports, and expressways. The Bo Hai region is situated in our country's political center, and is also our country's economic center. Quickening the region's economic development plays a decisive and strategic role in the overall national economic development. Zou Jiahua said: These advantages are not of a specific locality but of the entire region. Therefore, when developing the region's economy, we should not go separate ways and duplicate development efforts. On the contrary, localities should supplement each other's advantages and support one another in their cooperation to create a new productive force. When formulating the regional economic development plan, it is necessary to break down restrictions of administrative divisions. Localities should make joint and long-term plans for development projects of common concern and benefits within the region. We should impose a certain binding force for this type of plan, and require various localities to carry out their duties in cooperation with one another. Meanwhile, we should integrate the plan with national plans and incorporate it into the country's long-term development program. Zou Jiahua also stressed the following key points for the Bo Hai regional development plan: -- Overall consideration should be given to the region's transportation and communications networks, particularly the construction of principal transportation and communications facilities. This is a most urgent matter, and yet unable to be undertaken individually by various localities. We should focus our tasks on building coal, foreign trade, and passenger transportation facilities. It is necessary to develop a comprehensive sea, land, and air transportation network based principally on energy and foreign trade transportation services in the region, as well as a communications network system centered in Beijing and linked to the entire nation. -- Energy resources as well as raw and semifinished material industries within the region should be developed jointly. Based on the overall need of national economic development and regional division of work, it is necessary to continue to strengthen the development of Shanxi's energy resource base. We should actively develop Kengkou power plant and increase the capability of transporting power from west to east. -- The socialist market economic framework should be established. We should replace the divided and closed economic patterns with a regional, comprehensive, and open large market. Resources should mainly be disposed through the market. We must establish product markets and bring into play the region's advantages to establish the scientific and technological market, information market, and financial market. The regional market should be geared toward the country and the international markets of the northeast Asian economic sphere and pan-Pacific regions. -- The problem of water shortage that restricts the region's economic development should be tackled effectively. It is expected that the Bo Hai region will be short of 15 billion cubic meters of water supply by the end of this century. It is necessary to make early preparations and quicken the project of piping water from south to north, so that advance progress may be made in establishing the region's water supply network. Meanwhile, we should strengthen water resources management and promote water conservation. -- The tasks of aiding the rural poor and turning losses of industrial enterprises into profits should be effectively undertaken to drive the region's economy onto the path of sustained, rapid, and healthy development.
