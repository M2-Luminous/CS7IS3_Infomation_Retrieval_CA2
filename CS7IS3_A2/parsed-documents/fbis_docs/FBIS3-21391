This move by the Prime Minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao, would fetch India many friends, he said, adding that the "re-awakening and embarking on a new course" was a welcome move and had "stricken many Singapore businessmen with India fever." Speaking at the India-Singapore Association luncheon meeting held in his honour, Mr Goh said his country also saw the need to invest outside. "We looked towards opportunities emerging in Asia. While India looked towards west, we looked towards east to forge in-depth and lasting relationships." He said relations between the two countries were never bad but they lacked warmth. This visit, he hoped, would now develop into an eternal friendship rather than in terms of dollars and cents." Mr Goh, thanking the Indian Government for inviting him for the Republic Day celebrations, said his visit should augur well for both the countries and the setting up of an information technology park at Bangalore was an indication of his country's participation in India's growth.
