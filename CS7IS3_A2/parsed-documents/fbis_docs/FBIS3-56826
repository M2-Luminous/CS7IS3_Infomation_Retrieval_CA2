Lieutenant Colonel Nukri Gogitidze has been appointed head of the Department for Coordinating Law Enforcement Bodies. [Chachua]Excuse my asking you a not very tactful question: Won't your service become yet one more bureaucratic link in the state structure? [Gogitidze] The nature of the question is clear: There is hunger, destruction, and poverty in the country and here we have one more service, one more parasite. Incidentally, this is not an entirely new structure. Those tasks that are today being entrusted to this service were previously fulfilled by different departments and groups; these have now been concentrated into one. [Chachua]Crime in the republic and the capital have reached a peak. Can one hope that the activities of your department will enable the fast rising "curve" to take a downswing? [Gogitidze] We are called upon to coordinate the work of the Ministry of Internal Affairs [MVD], the Ministry of Security [MB], and the Procurator's Office in the business of the struggle against crime and to restore law and order in the republic. I should point out that the leaders of these power structures, as they are now referred to, are professionals who are devoted to their job and they are sure to achieve success. The first serious steps aimed at strengthening law and order have already been taken. However, much work lies ahead. The wave of violence perpetrated by criminal bands could lead to the "Lebanonization" and "Somalization" of the situation in Georgia and to the establishment on its territory of the rule of the criminal world and the most dreadful tyranny and "bandocracy." [Chachua]A boring question comes to mind here: Do you think that order can be established in Georgia only with the help of Russia? [Gogitidze] I am opposed to someone else establishing order in our country. This is our mess and we have to clean it up ourselves. We have to strengthen the combat structures of the MVD and the MB and I am certain that, with the support of the public, they will cope by themselves. However, I believe that we will not be able to resolve questions of military organizational development, the protection of our borders, and so forth without Russia's help. Moreover, Russia, as the successor to the former Soviet Union and as a neighboring power, which, during the last few centuries, has played and continues to play an important role in the life of Georgian society and the Georgian state, is morally obliged to become the guarantor of the stabilization of the situation in Georgia. It will be very difficult to resolve the problems that have accumulated without recognizing and understanding the role of the Georgian state in the Caucasus and surrounding regions. Georgia is the key to the Caucasus and whoever wishes to acquire economic and political dominance in this region should recognize the value of the role played by Georgia and draw the appropriate conclusions. After all, it is not by chance that the residence of the tsar's governor- general was in Tiflis and that Tbilisi was the administrative center of the Transcaucasus. In connection with Georgia joining the CIS, mutual relations with our northern neighbor are undergoing changes. The presence of Russian military contingents -- air force and naval bases and air defense units -- on the territory of Georgia is essential for Russia. [Chachua]Do you think that we should agree to the temporary deployment of a limited contingent of Russian troops on the territory of Georgia? [Gogitidze] Yes, but under the following conditions. The Russian side should render assistance in the organizational development of the Republic of Georgia Armed Forces. It is essential to restore or create an air defense system that will be used in the joint interests of both states. A start should be made on forming the republic's naval forces with the help of units and subunits of the Black Sea Fleet. The Republic of Georgia Air Force should start to be trained on the Russian Federation Air Force base. Specialists in all branches of the Armed Forces should be trained in military educational institutions in Russia and other CIS countries. The structure and stationing location of Russian troop units should be changed and also the name itself of this contingent; they should be given the appropriate status and all this should be legalized by treaties and so forth. Decisive and severe measures should be taken in the sphere of guaranteeing national security, protecting borders, the struggle against crime, and ensuring law and order. It would be possible to accelerate the implementation of these measures with Russia's help. In order to implement these measures, it is necessary to resolve a number of painful problems in the political sphere, something which is difficult without the active interference of Russia. However, close economic cooperation should not mean the violation of the sovereign rights of an independent state. If Russia wishes to have an equal and reliable ally in the Caucasus region for a long time, with whose help it will be able to exert an influence upon processes taking place in the Near and Middle East, that is to say, if, as a world power, it does not wish to renounce its responsibility for the fate of the world, it should render assistance to Georgia in the aforementioned spheres.
