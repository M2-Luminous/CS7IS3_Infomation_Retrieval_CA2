Lee Hamilton, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told an American Enterprise Institute conference on China here that the United States needs a multi-faceted policy toward China. "With a country as important and complex as China, we cannot allow one interest -- whether it is human rights, commercial ties, or geopolitical strategy -- to dominate," he said. He urged president Clinton "to present to the Congress and the country a China policy that looks towards the future, not the past." Speaking of what the U.S. policy should be on MFN, he noted that whatever leverage MFN conditionality has provided in the past year, its application in this next phase would probably be counterproductive. "It is time to de-link," he stressed. He also disagreed with the argument in favor of imposing selective sanctions. It "is not workable...it would be just as confusing as the present state of affairs," he said. Also speaking at the conference, Senator Max Baucus warned that China is not a country "we can take lightly." The policy of MFN conditions, he pointed out, has proven ineffective in promoting human rights, and revoking MFN is, in fact, the economic equivalent of "dropping a nuclear bomb." "If we continue a conditional, year-by-year renewal policy, sooner or later, the nuclear bomb will go," he added. Baucus described the United States as being isolated in linking human rights and trade with China. "Not one country supports our policy...carrying it out would be a disaster," he remarked. "The time has come to do what we ought to do -- to renew MFN permanently and take it out of politics for good," he said. Most of the other speakers at the one-day conference were also united in calling for unconditional renewal of MFN as the best way to maintain normal economic and trade relations with China.
