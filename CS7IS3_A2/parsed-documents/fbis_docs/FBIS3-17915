Gavrileva, in Kiev and Simferopol; date not given: "I See Three Moves Ahead...."] [Text] Kiev-Simferopol -- The president of Ukraine has not paid an official visit to the Republic of Crimea for quite some time, and it is not often that Crimean journalists are in Kiev, and it is even less often that they are received by the top leader of the state. Half an hour had been allotted for the interview with KRYMSKIYE IZVESTIYA, and not a minute more, but the conversation with the president lasted 45 minutes and was broken off on account of his tight schedule. We regard this as a sign of the Ukrainian leadership's special attention to Crimean problems. [Gavrileva] Several years ago Ukraine opted for the path of the building of its own statehood based on the national idea. But nationalism has always led either to war or to destitution--there is no other way. Ukraine has managed to take the less painful second path. But it is time to extricate ourselves from the destitution also.... [Kravchuk] It is an illusion that things are going badly for Ukraine because it is pursuing some national policy: Things are going badly for everyone, and this is natural; I would like this understood. There has been no instance in history of the collapse of one system and the building of another occurring simultaneously with an increase in production and economic prosperity. It is not a question of Kravchuk's national policy here, but of the difficulty of this transition. I put down to our credit--not that of myself, but of all of us--the fact that with such difficulties, such a structure, and such a character of our state, we are tackling all questions in peace. We must all extricate ourselves from the destitution, this including Russia, which is the point of yearning for Crimea, where the illusion has been created that, should it become a part of Russia, things would immediately be easier for everyone. But we watch Ostankino (even if doctored): Production there is coming to a halt, wages have not been paid for three months, and in the heartland there is simply nothing other than potatoes--what, then, is the issue? Russia is a most wealthy state selling timber, oil, and gas, and we purchase these! So the judgments and the speculation on this basis should not be so superficial. I understand Crimea's gravitation toward Russia, but it is not all of Crimea that aspires to this, which the voting showed, incidentally. Some 1.8 million Russians--it was they, by and large, who voted for such a policy. But others also live in Crimea: 600,000 Ukrainians, 250,000 Crimean Tatars; God willing, this will come to nearly 1 million. Crimea cannot be perceived as uniform and as supporting only the policy that has been proposed by its present leadership. Russia has its interests in Crimea, and it will not renounce them, but let us see how to adjust and mate these interests. If some politicians from Crimea believe that it is possible to cross over to Russia immediately by having learned the opinion of part of the population, this is a profound delusion. This is a subject for discussion by the whole Ukrainian people: When a divorce is under way, it is not only the wishes of one party in a family that are taken into consideration. Somebody holding someone back is not the issue here. Go ahead! The husband, if he is noble, leaves the refrigerator, the bed, the land, the house, and walks away. We do not object. What kind of policy is Russia pursuing today? We in the upper echelons of power, they say, will not interfere but will with the middle strata (the deputies and such) inflame the situation, and then Crimea will itself by the revolutionary path, creating tension within, gradually, given certain political circumstances, come over to Russia. Ukraine's strategy: We say that we will not consent to any negotiations concerning borders, territorial integrity, or sovereignty. And the world is backing us at this time--I say this without exaggeration. The UN Security Council's response to Russia's Sevastopol decision is a clear example of this. In addition, Yeltsin and I signed the corresponding agreement. The Europeans do not understand what is happening here. Surely we understand that it is impossible today to carve up borders--the holy of holies, the pillars of European security! This is why we say: It cannot be done! But considering the special status, history, and population of Crimea, we agree to grant it economic independence just as far as this is possible--but with the political status quo! These are not just words. Yu. Meshkov was sitting next to me, and we reached an agreement: The budget--let us do as you wish, let us balance its revenue and expenditure sides. Everything will now depend on actual work. If Crimea takes care of its revenue side itself, it will look after all its expenditures; we, on the other hand, will help the Crimean Tatar population.... [Gavrileva] In what way? [Kravchuk] We will allocate additional money from the Ukrainian budget. You will have complete economic freedom, complete independence. [Gavrileva] We have a new deputy prime minister.... What is being decided, incidentally, on the question of his citizenship? [Kravchuk] It will be resolved, this is not a problem.... [Gavrileva] What do you think, what that is new will Ye. Saburov bring to the development of Crimea's economy and the relations of Kiev and Simferopol? [Kravchuk] From what I have heard and read, I understand that he is a rational person capable of seeing the goal. He is capable of a great deal and probably understands that he can do nothing without Ukraine. One simple thing needs to be understood: There is in the world one state--Ukraine--and no one knows of such a state as Crimea. Neither the president nor the prime minister of any European state will ever meet either with Meshkov or with Saburov. If problems are to be resolved with the aid of the attraction of foreign capital (and they will not otherwise be resolved today), this can be done only via Ukraine, of which Crimea is a part, and we are prepared for this, and I will do everything to ensure that this be done. But on one condition: Let us get down to business. If there are to be referenda, slogans--to whom does Crimea belong--it will be difficult for us. I do not wish to discuss political questions in respect to Crimea today, therefore, I wish to discuss only economic matters--and here I will even go above and beyond the limit. [Gavrileva] The following question is appropriate here: What is your attitude toward a possible ruble zone in Crimea? [Kravchuk] Only a person who (excuse me, I do not wish to give offense) who has not on these matters made a thorough study of everything or who has been misinformed could talk about this. There cannot be two currency zones in one state. Note the independent state of Belarus (and the leadership of Crimea favors Crimea as an independent state--this is, I believe, the main goal? Drift toward Russia is the second stage). I am an economist by education, and for this reason I say that unless it has its own currency, no state can exist independently, this is precluded. Belarus is moving into the ruble zone, but Russia has set the condition of conversion of the Belorusian bank into a branch of the Russian bank, and we know under whose jurisdiction a branch comes! So why deceive the Crimeans? Very well, let us assume that there is to be the ruble in Crimea. But who will supply it? Russia? The ruble is a material value. How many rubles would Crimea need, add it up? Would Russia supply them? Very well, let us assume even this: Crimea has the ruble. But it is an open border, and the ruble is of greater value than the karbovanets, and tomorrow these rubles would be in Kherson and Nikolayev and would reach Kiev--in any event, they would be laundered from Crimea like lightning. And would Russia agree to Ukraine pumping rubles via Crimea? Would Ukraine here want to convert its state bank into a branch of the Russian bank and to have all political and economic problems decided in Moscow, not in Kiev and Simferopol? People are unaware of these details. It is said that people would come on vacation here and spend rubles. But would there be that many of these rubles? People would immediately come to Crimea from all the adjacent oblasts and sell the vacationers products that are not available in Crimea and would take away these rubles, and Crimea would get nothing. These are elementary axioms. How much is a health center pass? [Gavrileva] A lot. Millions. [Kravchuk] And who would come? Working people? Crimea would become a Mecca for the rich. And what kind of price list would there be in the stores, what kind of exchange rate? This is all based on childish naivete. [Gavrileva] Leonid Makarovich, do you have a strategy for the development of the economy in Ukraine? The title "open economy regime" has at least crystallized out in Crimea (it is not entirely clear what this means, it is true), but Ukraine does not have even this.... [Kravchuk] Stop at the stores on Kreshchatik, look at the choice of items. A year ago, when Mr. Kuchma was in charge, so to speak, the stores were absolutely bare. Now they are full--no money. [Gavrileva] This is abnormal also! [Kravchuk] But this is easier: If there is no money, it has to be earned. [Gavrileva] Excuse me, but we would not get very far: The journalist here and the journalist in the United States receive totally different pay for their work.... [Kravchuk] I would respond that 80 percent of the newspapers in the United States are private. It is the founder who should pay the wages you deserve. [Gavrileva] All right, score one to you. Nonetheless, is there a strategy for development of the Ukrainian economy? [Kravchuk] There is only one path--the path of reforms. [Gavrileva] What is needed for their implementation? [Kravchuk] Work to be done locally. I was talking just yesterday with five oblasts: Why is privatization with you not progressing? They replied: We are thinking, we are considering.... You understand, if I (the state) can supply an enterprise with raw material and wages, I keep it. If I cannot, I let it go. Who today in Crimea, for example, is impeding privatization? Myself? [Gavrileva] We are speaking of the local authorities, hence, it is time to speak about the local councils.... [Kravchuk] ....and the representatives of the president. [Gavrileva] This institution will be abolished in Ukraine following the elections, incidentally, and the Supreme Council of Ukraine has begun to speak once again of its introduction in Crimea.... [Kravchuk] It is not a question of a representative of the president, but of representation of Ukraine in Crimea. This is what the law says! Crimea has its representation in Kiev--and we should have ours in Crimea, and this is all being cranked up specially. [Gavrileva] And N. Bagrov had to explain the situation even in this connection in our newspaper.... And how did you personally evaluate the decision of the Supreme Council of Crimea on the undesirability of elections to the local councils in the summer? Perhaps Crimea has shown all of Ukraine the right way? [Moroz] Are you satisfied with your "team"? How do you select your people? [Meshkov] According to the principle of professionalism and ability to function in an extreme environment. [Moroz] But does not your enlistment of Saburov, an individual "from outside," someone from another country no less--does this not imply that you are experiencing a severe personnel shortage? [Meshkov] No, it does not. Saburov is not "from outside." He is 100 percent Crimean, born in Yalta. But I am not even referring to that. I am not talking about the space defined by the borders of Crimea, but rather the space defined by the borders of Russia. We do not perceive borders as a norm or as a natural condition. Everything not in conformance with objective economic laws, everything that contradicts common sense--is nonviable. On the contrary, we could follow Hegel: Everything rational is real. Everything is standardized and fit into a norm. As far as a shortage of personnel is concerned, the Ukrainian Government might well wish it could boast of specialists in the class, on the level and with the qualifications of Mr. Saburov. [Moroz] Some people see a certain external resemblance between the two of you... [Meshkov] (Laughing) In any case, it was not based on any resemblance to me that I invited him to assume the post of deputy prime minister. That is a fact. [Moroz] What are the main tasks you have set for him? [Meshkov] To do everything that can be done at this time and in this place to improve the economic situation. [Moroz] How do you assess this situation? [Meshkov] It is a catastrophe. A catastrophe colored yellow and blue. [Moroz] (A small illustration of the president's words with respect to the catastrophic situation in the economy. A cleaning lady in a Simferopol hotel, at which a "CIS-er" [Commonwealth of Independent States] is fleeced to the tune of R40,000 per day for an average room, receives less than R9,000 a month. A civil aviation pilot who retires gets R18,000 in pension. The Crimean president himself, I was told by one of his aides, receives a salary of 1,900,000 karbovantsy. Despite the large number of zeros, this comes to just R82,610 as of the moment of my departure from Crimea last Saturday. Today it is reduced still more, since the coupon/ruble rate keeps falling and falling...--O.M.) You have stated that you intend to return Crimea to the ruble zone. [Meshkov] I intend to. For us the ruble is a more acceptable means of payment, since our main flow of tourists--people who spend money in Crimea--are citizens of Russia. To provide them normal services, if you will, is one of the most important tasks of our oblast economy, and we will accomplish this task. [Moroz] But there is no border between Crimea and Ukraine. It would be practically impossible to introduce a currency here different from that used in Ukraine... [Meshkov] What is going on right now is impossible. Our reality of today is impossible. We are striving to return to a normal condition. [Moroz] The way I understand it, to do this you would have to violate the laws of Ukraine? [Meshkov] The laws of Ukraine constitute one of the factors leading to the current economic situation. The results are before you, as they say. [Moroz] What do you see as the primary cause of the catastrophic situation that has arisen in Ukraine and rushed towards you in a wave? [Meshkov] The situation is even more desperate than you think. But the primary cause is encroachment, the way they perceive it, upon the sense of national dignity of some nationalists of Western Ukraine, which has led to a general economic collapse of the gigantic European state Ukraine comprises. This is the price that was paid for the realization of nationalist slogans. And it was effected with the full composure, indifference, and silent encouragement of Europe and the United States. The United States became alarmed only when the nationalists put their finger on the nuclear button. While it was clear from the very beginning that this would happen, but now they are saying a Russian nationalist has come to power in Crimea. From where does such delusion come? The dignified magazine ECONOMIST (Paris) publishes an article entitled "The Second Crimean War." [Moroz] A month and a half has elapsed now since you were elected president. What has this time brought you as leader of the Republic of Crimea? Have there been any unexpected revelations? [Meshkov] Yes. First of all, the attitude of previous state officials; this is open sabotage. It is nothing obscure or secretive, but rather open and defiant. [Moroz] You were hoping for something different? [Meshkov] No, I was not hoping for their assistance, but neither did I expect defiance. I did not expect that it would be so aggressive, clearly antipeople, irrational... and criminal, in the final analysis. That is one thing I did not expect. A second thing was the revelation as to what extent our law enforcement organs are infected with the disease called corruption. [Moroz] Incidentally, you were forced to leave your position as procuracy investigator for attempting to bring charges against members of the party and administration nomenklatura caught in embezzlement. Do you still have this motivating drive to fight for justice? [Meshkov] I still have the drive, and my capacities have grown immeasurably. [Moroz] How do you intend to fight crime? Do you have a specific, precisely defined program? [Meshkov] Implementation of the program to fight crime runs headlong into a personnel problem, unfortunately. There are insufficient personnel capable of carrying on this fight. [Moroz] During your time in office have you managed to establish any personal contacts with the leaders of Ukraine and Russia? [Meshkov] With the leaders of Ukraine--no. Only on the official level. The situation with respect to Russia is directly the reverse. [Moroz] What do you consider yourself--a Russian or a Ukrainian (your father being Russian and your mother Ukrainian)? [Meshkov] (Laughing) I consider myself a Don Cossack. [Moroz] Do you know Ukrainian? [Meshkov] Yes, I understand it. [Moroz] Do you read with a dictionary? [Meshkov] No, I do not need a dictionary. My reading is fluent. But my speaking... I am not about to assert that I speak correct literary language. I speak on the everyday, colloquial level. [Moroz] What place in your plans of presidential activity is occupied by facilitating resolution of the Black Sea Fleet problem? We know that Russia and Ukraine are resolving it. They are trying to resolve it. However, except for the seamen themselves, it is Crimeans who suffer more than anyone else from a failure to resolve this issue. [Meshkov] This problem is essentially resolved. The only question is to what extent conditions of the agreement will be conscientiously observed. A readiness to do so is manifest on Russia's part, as far as I am aware. This is not true with respect to Ukraine. The Black Sea Fleet is a Russian fleet. This is natural. It is economically feasible. All the rest will depend on the rational or irrational actions of the other side. For us, the presence of the Black Sea Fleet is a benefit of which it would be a sin not to take advantage. [Moroz] How is your intention to take Ukrainian armed formations out of Crimea being executed? [Meshkov] I requested the Ukrainian leadership to remove first of all those troops that were introduced in violation of agreement and the existing order (troops may be introduced only with the consent of the Supreme Council of Crimea). The presence of these forces does not contribute toward normalization of relations between Crimea and Ukraine. In addition, they are occupying a fairly large amount of territory which could be used for economic purposes. Finally, they represent a certain threat to the ecology. [Moroz] What is the numerical strength of these troops? [Meshkov] They are fairly large units, unfortunately. [Moroz] KRASNAYA ZVEZDA reported about 60,000. [Meshkov] KRASNAYA ZVEZDA rarely errs in these matters. They have reliable sources. [Moroz] It is apparent that Crimean Tatars followed the appeals of their leaders and voted against you. Many of them do not recognize you as president. Do you hope to be able to shatter their negative attitude toward you? [Meshkov] It is incorrect to assert that the Crimean Tatars do not recognize the president. It would be more accurate to state that the leadership of one wing of the national movement of Crimean Tatars entered into alliance with my political opponent and supported him, and when he lost, they declared they did not agree with the one who won. This is not politics. This is not on the political level. It is on the mundane level. It is simply undignified to resolve political problems on the mundane level. As far as support from ordinary citizens of the Republic of Crimea is concerned, a million or more of their votes is more than sufficient to be able to calmly sit down in this chair. And among that million are a great many citizens of Crimean Tatar nationality. [Moroz] Do you intend to repeal the quota of 14 seats for Crimean Tatars in the parliament, as you promised? [Meshkov] I did not say I intended to repeal the quota. I said that I do not accept the principle of endowment of political rights according to nationality. I opposed this as a deputy and as candidate for president. And I now oppose it as president. It is a flagrant violation of international law and universal standards, but I have no intention of repealing what has already come about. [Moroz] Do you sense any action on the part of the special services? Are they watching you? [Meshkov] (Laughing) Well, beginning from a certain time and at a certain level of political and state activity, this is inevitable. [Moroz] How do you evaluate Khrushchev's unforgettable decision to transfer Crimea to Ukraine? [Meshkov] One in a series of delirious inventions and decisions. It has nothing to do with common sense or with man's treatment of his fellow man. But from the legal and judicial point of view, the issue is decided. The acts of 1954 were declared invalid as of the moment of their adoption. Thus, everything is normal in this aspect. The only thing that remains is to return to common sense and universal concepts.
