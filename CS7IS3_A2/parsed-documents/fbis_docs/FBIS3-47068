The sources said the Japanese industry plans to raise the issue at high-level negotiations in Tokyo in March with its South Korean officials. They said the South Korea's Hyundai group conglomerate plans to complete a new facility for construction of large-sized oil tankers by 1995. Samsung, another industrial giant, reportedly is set to start construction of a large-scale dockyard this month, they said. South Korean shipbuilders apparently are trying to strengthen their position as the world's leading shipbuilding nation by capitalizing on a slump in the Japanese shipbuilding industry resulting from the yen's appreciation, they said. The South Korean shipbuilding industry received a record high of new shipbuilding orders aggregating 9.52 million gross tons in 1993, replacing Japan as the world's leading shipbuilder for the first time. The sources said that Japanese shipbuilders have refrained from expanding their production capacity because of a global surplus.
