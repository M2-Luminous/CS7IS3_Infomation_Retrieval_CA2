What are your views? [Kubo] If the aim of the reshuffle is only to remove certain ministers from the cabinet, we should be told so. Although the arbitrary power to reshuffle the cabinet is given to the prime minister, it does not mean that he can do whatever he wants. If he reshuffles the cabinet for reasons of political strategy, it would become a problem for the ruling parties as a whole. There are no grounds for a reshuffle because the administration is only six months old. I do not think it should be done. [Correspondent] When do you think the move toward political realignment will gain momentum? [Kubo] It may be difficult to hold a general election under the new electoral system this year. A unified local election and an election for the House of Councillors next year are scheduled before the next general election for the House of Representatives is due. I think the way the ruling parties cooperate with each other in the House of Councillors' election will influence the political realignment. [Correspondent] What is the aim of the SDPJ at the next general election, which will be held under the new electoral system? [Kubo] We should prevent the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] from returning to power. The ruling partners should seek thorough electoral collaboration. [Correspondent] Do you mean the ruling parties should merge into one "new party" -- the idea advocated by Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa? [Kubo] When I view Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa's view of the ideal nation, I think it impossible for the ruling parties to merge. Unless the ruling partners share a similar view of Japan's future and how to secure people's rights, it will be impossible to merge the coalition forces into one political party simply to win an election. Furthermore, Mr. Ozawa advocates a two-conservative-party system. One is the party of "new conservatives"; the other the same old LDP. We do not accept this idea. Ozawa's proposed system may change the focus of power, but I don't think it will bring a bright future for Japanese politics. [Correspondent] What kind of a political picture do you think desirable? [Kubo] Political forces that consistently adhere to the principles of the Constitution, peace, democracy, and human rights are necessary in Japanese politics. We need a new era in which "new reformists" stand against "new conservatives." The SDPJ should play an important role in the formation of the "new reformists." [Correspondent] What must the SDPJ do to bring this about? [Kubo] We need to change the party by abandoning the old character of the party. We will establish the common political aims of "new reformists," including those who have been "conservatives," and thus form a new political force. In creating the new political force, it is also possible the SDPJ will dissolve itself for the better without absorbing other parties. If the old LDP continues to exist, Japan will see a "tripolar" political scene with "new conservatives," "new reformists," and the "LDP." If the LDP reforms itself, we might, perhaps, form a coalition government of genuinely "tripolar" structure -- new conservatives, new reformists, and the LDP. [Correspondent] What distinguishes these three political forces? [Kubo] The issue of international cooperation is one factor. We should stress that Japan bases its international contributions on the spirit of the Constitution. Regardless of what sort of international cooperation is proposed, I oppose international contributions under which military troops are sent. My ideal nation and view of the Constitution are different from those of Mr. Ozawa, who says Japan needs to become a "normal nation." Another point is whether political forces adopt a "consumer-oriented" policy or a "producer-oriented" policy. However, when the need to change power is taken into consideration, we must establish a "common basic policy" to stabilize politics. [Correspondent] Who are the potential leaders of the new political forces? [Kubo] In politics, having a competent leader is more important than promoting political arguments. Mr. Takahiro Yokomichi (governor of Hokkaido) is one prospective leader in view of his age and experience. Governor Yokimichi's term of office expires in spring next year. I hope that, Hokkaido citizens and events permitting, he will decide to return to the political arena in Tokyo). [Correspondent] Is the party prepared for the split that may occur in the process of political realignment? [Kubo] Within the party there are members who do not recognize us as a member of the coalition government and act on their own. But most party members are different and take a different view of fulfilling the party's appointed task. A political party can work for the people only when it comes to power. I think it would be fairer to say that any member who acts on his own is a highly questionable member of the party, rather than that their actions may lead to a party split.
