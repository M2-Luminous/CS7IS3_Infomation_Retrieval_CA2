"Every possible means must be utilized to combat the persisting drought and minimize its damage," the ministry spokesman said yesterday. The ministry has urged all local agricultural departments to mobilize any available manpower, materials and funds to reinforce the antidrought campaign. "All agricultural departments in the drought-stricken areas must tap every resource and take effective measures, according to their local conditions, in order to overcome the disaster and win a bumper harvest both in summer and autumn this year," he added. Beijing, suffering from a severe 16-month drought, has answered the call and decided to strengthen its irrigation drive. The city has 2.7 million workers plus millions of machines and other materials fighting the dry spell. And the central government recently allocated 1.5 million yuan ($172,000) to support Beijing's effort. A ministerial report released yesterday said the protracted drought seriously jeopardizes spring ploughing in eight provinces and cities. The shortage, which began last winter and became more severe this spring, has affected more than 4.7 million hectares of farms, mainly in North China. The report said another 9.3 million hectares of farmland, almost one-tenth of the country's total, are under threat. The affected provinces are having difficulty in sowing cotton and spring wheat, and winter wheat and rapeseed have already been damaged. Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei and Shanxi have been hardest hit by the drought, while Liaoning, Jilin, Shaanxi, and northern and western Henan Province are also affected, the spokesman said. Beijing's water supply suffered a sharp drop in nearly all its reservoirs, drying up most of its rivers and pushing down the level of its underground water. As a result, more than 133,000 hectares of its suburban farmland have been damaged. Moreover, about 90,000 people and 11,000 heads of livestock in its suburban counties are faced with a serious water shortage. And in Tianjin, most of the farmland is barren, with more than 115,300 hectares of wheat crop dried up and 280,000 hectares of suburban farmland unsown.
