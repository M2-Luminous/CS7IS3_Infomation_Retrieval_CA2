We are in direct contact with our reporter Boudewijn Van Spilbeeck, who is on a plane that is shuttling between Kigali and Nairobi. So, Boudewijn, you have left the Rwandan capital. Why? Has the situation become too dangerous? [Van Spilbeeck] Well yes, Danny. We have just landed in Nairobi and indeed, the situation in Kigali has become very tense and has made the evacuation gain momentum. This morning around 1030, the Rwandan troups installed two multiple rocket launchers [Stalin orgels] right at the entrance of the airport, some 150 meters from the airport building. They have fired a couple of rounds with these rocket launchers toward a hill a few kilometers away where the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] was located. They are very impressive rounds, up to eight rockets at a time. There was the risk that the RPF would return fire and consequently hit the airport building, the runway, or the planes. The Belgians then warned the Rwandans that they would destroy the position if one more shot was fired by the Rwandans. The Rwandan soldiers did fire one more shot. The Belgians then fired a couple of rounds with a heavy machine gun mounted on a tank. Immediately thereafter the planes that could, left. One Belgian C-130 was ready to leave and took as many people as possible on board; a Spanish C- 130 stood ready and another two C-130s were approaching. I went on the first C-130 that skimmed over the military camp near the airport to avoid antiaircraft missiles and then suddenly went up in the sky. We could then see from the plane that on the way to the east thousands of Rwandan people, packed with their belongings, were fleeing Kigali. [Verstraeten] They are running because the rebel army is in town and the battle with the Rwandan Army can burst out any moment. [Van Spilbeeck] Yes, Danny. The situation in town has become untenable for many people. The RPF continues to close in from the north, along the east side of the town, toward the south. The RPF has already taken positions in the southwest of the old city, by which the Rwandan army in town is becoming more encircled. Also the fact that the lines of the Rwandan army had retreated just up to the airport building is a sign that the rebel army is marching in. [Verstraeten] The Belgian Government, Boudewijn, was in a meeting the past couple of hours on the fate of our Belgian Blue Helmets in Rwanda, but we don't know what the results are. The United Nations in New York seems to be waiting with its decision. How are these people doing in Kigali right now? [Van Spilbeeck] Let me explain that there are actually two kinds of Belgians soldiers, that is the ones wearing a blue helmet, from the UNAMIR peacekeeping force and the Belgians who left recently, our paratroopers. The Belgian paratroopers are trying to evacuate everything on the double. They needed another six flights and it could be completed today. But Colonel Roman from the brigade paratroopers, who is in charge of this operation, has said that he can only leave the airport if it can be secured completely and be controlled by the UN peacekeeping force. Obviously, the airport is the key location in Kigali and he wants to avoid at any price that the airport be taken by either the RPF or the Rwandan army. He said that he will not withdraw his last troops before the Blue Helmets take over control of the airport. The Belgian Blue Helmets detachment has already taken positions all around the runway and the airport buildings, and Bengali Blue Helmets have now arrived as reinforcement. In the next phase, the Bengali and possibly other troops will control the airport, and then the Belgian detachment can start withdrawing, provided the United Nations in New York has made a decision. This morning I have been talking to Colonel Marchal, the commander of the Blue Helmets for the Kigali sector, and he suspected that the withdrawal, once the signal has been given by New York, obviously, could take between two and seven days.
