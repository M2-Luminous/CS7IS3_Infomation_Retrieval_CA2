Addressing a national telephonic conference, Wei, secretary of the party Central Discipline Inspection Commission, also emphasized the need to halt all kinds of malpractices and corruption adversely affecting the progress of reforms, economic growth and stability. According to the commission, 15,216 party and government officials were disciplined for economic offences during the first quarter of 1994. These officials included 450 at county magistrate level, 35 at the prefectural commissioner's level and three at provincial or ministerial level. Of the 15,216 officials, 1,416 were handed over to judicial departments for prosecution on criminal charges. Wei Jianxing, a member of the Political Bureau of the party Central Committee, said that the current anti-corruption campaign should focus on major cases involving economic offences, such as embezzlement, bribery, financial frauds and violation of financial discipline. "Leading departments of the party and government, judicial departments, administrative law-enforcement departments and economic administrative departments remain the main targets," he said. As part of the anti-corruption campaign, he said, it was imperative to halt the malpractices of collecting illicit fees, making government-funded sight-seeing tours overseas and making improper personal material gains by abusing one's power.
