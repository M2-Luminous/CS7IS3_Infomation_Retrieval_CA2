As a result, the national economy has been growing vigorously, social and political stability has continued, and major progress has been made in the modernization drive. Under the leadership of party committees at all levels, procuratorial and judicial departments across the country have safeguarded the stable social environment required for China's reform and development by further improving their work, effectively thwarting the sabotage of hostile forces at home and abroad, dealing appropriately with some emergencies that could have a great impact on their work, ceaselessly carrying out various forms of struggle against crime, concentrating on investigating and handling major economic crimes such as embezzlement and bribery, seriously implementing measures for consolidating public security and order, and improving law enforcement and legal services in the economic sphere. This year is a very important and crucial year for deepening the reform. Many major measures will be comprehensively taken to establish a socialist market economic structure on the basis of the blueprint drawn up by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and our reform will enter a critical stage in which wholesale advances and breakthroughs in major areas will be sought simultaneously. Some new contradictions and problems will emerge along with the deepening of reform and the adjustment of relations of interest. We must remain sober, analyze and judge the situation correctly, be prepared for danger in times of peace, provide for a rainy day, and do a better job of safeguarding social and political stability. The main tasks for the procuratorial and judicial front in 1994 are implementing the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, adhering to the strategic principle of "grasping two links at the same time and paying attention to both," meeting the requirements for establishing a socialist market economic structure, further strengthening and reforming procuratorial and judicial work, enhancing the functions of the people's democratic dictatorship, safeguarding national security, cracking down on criminal activities, improving the handling of major cases in the struggle against corruption, vigorously and comprehensively improving public security and order, and providing better legal protection and legal services for the socialist market economy. 1. Correctly Understand the Dialectical Relationship Between Reform, Opening Up, and Economic Development on the One Hand and Social Stability on the Other -- That Is, Reform and Opening Up, and Economic Development and Social Stability Promote One Another and Form a Single Entity -- and Doing Everything Possible To Maintain Political Stability Deepening the reform, opening wider to the outside world, and accelerating development constitute a solid foundation for consolidating political stability and unity, and the prerequisite for reform and development is to maintain political stability. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has said: "Reform requires a stable political environment. Without this, nothing can succeed." Only by upholding the four cardinal principles, grasping the two links simultaneously, and preserving social and political stability can we effectively guarantee the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and economic construction. In the current situation in which reform and opening to the outside world are being accelerated, there has been a noticeable increase in the number of factors leading to instability for various reasons. Therefore, safeguarding stability has become even more important and urgent. The more we accelerate the pace of establishing the socialist market economy, the more we should strengthen the state apparatus of the people's democratic dictatorship and the more we should pay attention to safeguarding social and political stability. Safeguarding political stability is the important responsibility of party committees, governments, and departments at all levels and of party and government leaders of various units. It is a task of all comrades in the party and of the people of all nationalities across the country, and is also the bounden duty of the procuratorial and judicial departments. Party and government leaders at all levels must adhere to the strategic principle of "grasping the two links at the same time and paying attention to both." While grasping reform and development, they should pay attention to the building of spiritual civilization, strengthen party building, consolidate work on the ideological and cultural front, and carry out effectively their responsibility for safeguarding political stability. They should study, plan, guide, and check, in a timely manner, the work of safeguarding stability, promptly eliminate factors leading to instability, properly handle emergencies, and pay attention to solving the outstanding problems of the masses to ensure social stability. The cadres and workers of various departments and units should also enhance their sense of political responsibility in safeguarding stability, bear in mind that safeguarding stability is everyone's responsibility, plug loopholes in work, improve systems of work, and consciously make contributions to eliminating factors leading to instability. 2. Correctly and Properly Handle the Contradictions Among the People Arising From the New Situation A host of contradictions among the people are bound to surface in the course of deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, and developing a socialist market economy. Party and government leaders at all levels must seriously study the characteristics, forms of expression, aggravating factors, preventive measures, and methods of dealing with the contradictions among the people that emerge under the new situation; take practical steps to change the work style, overcome bureaucracy and formalism; go deep into the midst of the people and help solve their actual difficulties; attach importance to properly attending to their grievances aired through personal visits or letters; make efforts to go to the masses to resolve their contradictions, and take active steps to prevent the contradictions from becoming more acute. At the same time, we must also strive to introduce and perfect a complete set of key measures for implementing the reforms, intensify publicity through the media before introducing the various measures of reform, enhance the tolerance level of the masses, and accelerate the establishment of various mechanisms designed to ensure social security. Party committees and governments in various localities must shoulder leadership responsibility, improve their ability to distinguish and handle the two types of contradictions amid complex situations, and promptly nip in the bud problems at the grass-roots level. 3. Strengthen and Improve Party and State Leadership and Management Over Religious Work Among Nationalities Party committees and governments at all levels, particularly those in minority nationality areas, must consistently hold high the banner of promoting economic development and national unity, earnestly implement the "Law Governing Autonomous Regions of Minority Nationalities," comprehensively carry out the various policies and measures formulated by the party and the state for minority nationality regions, and strive to foster and consolidate national unity while accelerating economic development as well as ideological and cultural construction. We must step up education to publicize the Marxist concepts on nationalities and the legal system so that the minority peoples will learn how to safeguard their own legitimate rights and interests through legal proceedings, thereby gradually bringing the readjustment of relations between various nationalities into line with the legal system. We must take a clear-cut stand, justly and forcefully oppose ethnic splittism, and punish according to law those involved in illegal and criminal activities in creating separatism among nationalities. We must strengthen management over religious affairs according to the law, comprehensively and correctly implement the policy on religion set out by the party and the state, protect the normal religious activates and the legitimate rights and interests of religious circles in accordance with the law, and firmly punish those who take advantage of religion to interfere in political affairs or violate the law and commit crimes. At the same time, we must comprehensively promote among those who follow religions the Marxist concepts on religion, patriotism, and the legal system and rally the broad masses of followers under the banner of economic development and bringing prosperity to the motherland, guiding them in carrying out religious activities in accordance with the Constitution and the law. 4. Actively Participating in the Struggle Against Corruption and Concentrating on Investigating and Hanlding Major Cases of Economic Crime Such As Embezzlement and Bribery Strengthening clean government and combating corruption constitute the necessary condition and important guarantee for establishing the socialist market economic structure and are keys to safeguarding stability. Procuratorial and judicial departments at all levels and the entire police force should conscientiously study and implement the party Central Committee's instructions on launching the struggle against corruption and, under the leadership of party committees and governments, successfully push forward the struggle. It is necessary to rely on education and law to combat corruption and promote honesty. The important thing is that party and government leaders at all levels must enhance their understanding and be determined to work hard to implement policies. Procuratorial and judicial departments should take the initiative in participating in combating corruption, enforce law strictly, be serious in handling cases, concentrate on investigating and handling major cases involving crimes committed by law-enforcement personnel, and strictly carry out their legal responsibility. Party committees at all levels and their political and legal commissions must provide better leadership, seriously supervise the handling of major cases, support procuratorial and judicial departments in strictly enforcing laws, overcome resistance, and eliminate interference in all forms. The leadership of relevant procuratorial and judicial departments should strengthen guidance and supervision over investigation and prosecution of major cases and institute a responsibility system for handling cases to increase work efficiency and law-enforcement quality. Investigations must be pursued to the end no matter who is involved or what resistance is encountered. Anyone who hinders the prosecution of cases and protects corrupt elements must be given severe punishment according to party discipline and state laws. In prosecuting cases, it is necessary to pay attention to the political, economic, and social impact. In combating corruption and promoting honesty, it is important to go to the root of the problem. Education in law and professional ethics, with emphasis on building a clean government as the special topic, should be conducted in party and government offices and other key departments, so as to prevent and reduce, to the greatest extent, economic crimes such as embezzlement and bribery. 5. Adopting Forceful Meassures To Strengthen the Struggle Against Crime and Meting Out Timely Severe Punishment to Criminal Elements Resolutely changing the situation in which insufficient efforts have been made to crack down on crime, effectively upgrading the results of cracking down on crime, and creating a social environment in which people can live and work in peace and contentment constitute the major responsibilities of procuratorial and judicial departments and the requirements for these departments set by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. In 1994, in launching the struggle against crime, it is necessary to concentrate on cracking major cases, dismantling organized crime groups, and going after escaped criminals. To cope with their outstanding problems, various localities should adopt forceful measures and organize people to crack down on crime or tackle special types of crime. They should also strengthen investigation, prosecution, trial, and reform on a regular basis; check the steady rise in the number of major and serious cases; step up the anti-theft struggle; mobilize the masses to strengthen crime-prevention measures; eliminate breeding grounds for crime; resolutely ban prostitution and other related activities; resolutely eliminate social evils; round up all local criminal gangs; and exterminate all organized crime groups once they are discovered, never allowing them to exist. 6. Further Mobilize Social Forces To Implement Various Measures for Comprehensively Improving Public Security and Order Under the New Circumstances Efforts to comprehensively improve public security and order were emphasized many times in the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and in speeches made by Jiang Zemin. In the new situation of developing the socialist market economy, it is necessary to work harder to improve public security and order in an all-round way. Not the slightest slackening of efforts in this respect is permitted. The focus of this work for this year is the following: First, great efforts should be made to introduce a responsibility system for leaders to implement the principle that the "persons in charge shall be responsible." Committees for comprehensive management of public security at all levels should work with relevant departments to draw up, as quickly as possible, rules for implementing "Some Provisions for Introducing the Leaders' Responsibility System for the Comprehensive Management of Public Security," promulgated by the five ministries and commissions of the central government. In the process of changing their operating mechanisms and establishing a modern enterprise system, enterprises and institutions should aggressively take the initiative in "guarding their gates, managing their personnel, and doing their work." It is necessary to conduct education in the legal system among the people, do a good job in spreading legal knowledge, and enhance the people's awareness of the law. It is necessary to strengthen networks for soldiers, the police, and the masses to jointly participate in crime prevention and efforts to improve public security and order. Second, making continued efforts to improve public security and order in key areas. While focusing on the requirements for developing the socialist market economy, it is necessary to take into full account the people's views, determine key areas to be tackled in line with local conditions, improve public security and order, and advance the comprehensive improvement of public security and order by concentrating on key areas. Third, special efforts should be made to resolve the problem of public security and order in rural areas. Agriculture, rural areas, and the peasants constitute the fundemantal issues in China's economic development and modernization drive. Solution of the current serious problem of public security in rural areas remains an urgent task. It is necessary to concentrate on villages and towns and areas adjacent to communication lines where public security is in a state of chaos, focusing on cracking down on hooligans and other serious criminals who undermine agricultural production. It is necessary to conscientiously study ways for the rational and orderly transfer of surplus laborers in rural areas and popularize the experience in governing villages according to law. It is necessary to enhance the role of the basic-level people's mediation committees so as to reduce the number of civil disputes and prevent contradictions from worsening. It is necessary to implement the guidelines of the central conference on rural work and reorganize grassroots party organizations, whose core consists of party branches, and consolidate autonomous mass organizations in stages within three to five years. It is necessary to consolidate and strengthen the number of rural people engaged in joint crime prevention and joint efforts to improve public security. In some localities the masses are willing to voluntarily pay for the hiring of personnel to safeguard public security. This should not be regarded as indiscriminate collection of charges. Fourth, it is necessary to conduct education in the legal system among young people, focusing on systematically educating middle school students in the legal system on a regular basis. It is necessary to strengthen control over the market for cultural products and over places where videos are shown in order to purify the public environment in which young people grow. Fifth, it is necessary to implement measures for resettling and educating convicts who have been released at the end of their prison term, as well as the personnel freed from centers for educating juvenile delinquents through labor. In particular, in dealing with those who refuse to work and give up bad habits and who may commit new crimes, it is necessary to draw up a package of control, management, and education measures. 7. Accelerating Reform of Procuratorial and judical Work So As To Provide Better Service to Development of the Socialist Market Economy The establishment of a socialist market economic structure urgently requires a corresponding reform of procuratorial and judicial work. In accordance with the relevant guidelines of the party Central Committee, procuratorial and judicial departments should implement positive and yet discreet principles; persist in taking "conducive to three causes" -- developing the productive forces of our socialist society, increasing the overall strength of our socialist country, improving living standards -- as their fundamental criterion; and, guided by the correct principle of "perfecting the legal system, guaranteeing democracy, strengthening dictatorship, providing highly efficient service, and improving supervision," accelerate the pace of reform and opening to the outside world. In particular, mature reform measures must be introduced in a timely manner. Procuratorial and judicial departments are urgently required to study a series of reform measures to support the establishment of a socialist market economic structure by the end of this century. For example, reforming and perfecting the judicial system and the administrative law-enforcement mechanism; establishing an integrated people's police structure and judicial structure to upgrade the quality of judicial work and administrative law-enforcement; establishing a sound self-restraint mechanism and law-enforcement supervisory meachanism in procuratorial and judicial departments; in conjunction with major economic reform measures and in accordance with the law governing the operation of the socialist market economy, studying the revision of economic laws and statutes and judicial interpretations, and improving and tightening the administration of economic laws so as to create a favorable legal environment for fair competition; in accordance with the principle of separating government administration and enterprise management, reforming the public security structure and public order management in enterprises and institutions; in accordance with changes in the economic structure in urban and rural areas, reforming the family registration system to bring about a rational transfer of surplus labor; increasing intermediate market organizations such as law and notary offices, reforming their operating mechanisms, and strengthening unified management of legal service organizations; simplifying administrative organs, reforming cadre and personnel administrative systems, and establishing a sound system for handling cases and guaranteeing expenditures; and so on and so forth. Policy decisions on reform should go hand in hand with those on legislation. It is necessary to step up efforts to draft and revise the "Police Law," "Regulations on Judges," "Regulations on Procurators," "Law on Lawyers," "Prison Law," "Notary Law," and "Compensation Law." It is also necessary to accelerate revision of the Criminal Law and the Criminal Procedure Law. These laws should be used to guide, promote, and guarantee the smooth progress of reform in procuratorial and judicial work. 8. Combating Corruption, Promoting Honesty, Tightening Discipline Among Procuratorial and Judicial Personnel, and Improving Their Work Style As the main force and also one of the main sectors in the fight against corruption, procuratorial and judicial departments, while actively participating in the struggle against corruption, should first set an example in combating corruption and promoting honesty, allowing these two activities to promote one another. In combating corruption and promoting honesty, emphasis should be placed on educating the masses of cadres and the police rank and file. We must conscientiously organize them to study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and arm them with the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. All cadres and police rank and file should conscientiously study relevant central documents and regulations, serve as an exemplary servant and defender of the people, and consciously render service to reform, opening up, and economic construction. It is necessary to adopt resolute measures to correct unhealthy practices and strictly investigate cases involving corruption. At the same time, we must commend the advanced, promote healthy practices, and closely integrate combating corruption with promoting honesty. More importantly, it is necessary to learn from experiences and lessons, both past and recent, Chinese and foreign, improve the law-enforcement system, strengthen supervision mechanisms, and institutionalize and standardize strict law enforcement and the struggle to combat corruption and promote honesty. In 1994 we must launch an education and rectification campaign in procuratorial and judicial departments and among the police force and conduct thoroughgoing education in the reasons for serving the people, the importance of being honest and hardworking, and the legal system. At the same, it is necessary to rely on the masses in investigating and strictly handling cases involving violations of discipline and the law. No indulgence toward wrongdoing shall be permitted. We must focus on investigating and handling major cases involving bribes, bending the law for personal gain, extortion, illegal detainment, and extorting confession by torture, and put a stop to chaotic lending, fund-raising, and establishment of financial institutions -- three chaotic phenomena. Cadres and police from public security, procuratorial, and judicial departments must strictly abide by the requirements concerning honesty and self-discipline set by the Central Committee, the circular on the "10 Prohibitions" issued by the Central Commission on Politics and Law, and the rules of discipline for building a clean government drawn up by procuratorial and judicial departments. We must work toward establishing strict discipline and clean workstyle as quickly as possible. 9. Strengthening and Improving Party Leadership Over Political and Legal Work In the period of transition to a socialist market economic system, those who are involved in political and legal work face a new situation, new problems, and more demanding tasks, thus making further enhancement of party leadership over this work all the more necessary. Party committees at all levels are urged to constantly study and resolve major problems in political and legal work, providing guidance, supervision, and support to political and legal departments to remove obstacles and enhance strict law enforcement in line with the requirements of maintaining, stabilizing, and enhancing law and order in a socialist market economic system. Party committees and governments at all levels should attach importance to resolving the practical problems of serious shortages of funds and outdated technology and equipment at political and legal departments, ensuring the normal operation of various undertakings by the state organs of dictatorship. The committees on politics and law under the various levels of party committees are a form of organization that the party uses to enhance its leadership over political and legal work. It is necessary to strengthen these committees under various levels of party committees and give full play to their roles and functions. Committees on politics and law at all levels are called upon to carry out investigation and study in depth, become good advisers to party committees, offer more political guidance to politics and law departments, coordinate and promote closer cooperation among various politics and law departments, work out a system of legal restraints, and give full play their functions and roles. Building socialism with Chinese characteristics and developing a socialist market economy is an unprecedented and great undertaking. Therefore, the tasks confronting political and legal departments are arduous yet glorious. Let us rally closely behind the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core, adhere to the party's basic line, fulfil our duties, make bold explorations, work with one heart and one mind, accomplish various tasks, and make fresh contributions to maintaining stability and promoting reform, opening up, and socialist modernization!
