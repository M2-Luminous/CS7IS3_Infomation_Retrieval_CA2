Subject to the approval of the Bundesrat next Friday, which is considered certain, the law can come into force on 1 January 1995. FRG Labor Minister Norbert Bluem (Christian Democratic Union) said that the implementation of the law will depend on the good will and dedication of many people. A law cannot replace human readiness for help. Rudolf Dressler, the SPD's chief negotiator, pointed out that his party has achieved considerable improvements during the months of the mediation procedure between the Bundestag and the Bundesrat. Now it is the business of the laender to keep the promise of abolishing one public holiday to compensate for the costs arising for the employers. Gisela Babel (Free Democratic Party of Germany) said that it is to her party's credit that the nursing-care insurance did "not" turn out to "be larger, clumsier, and more expensive." The Party of Democratic Socialism and the Alliance 90/Greens, who had come out in favor of a nursing-care insurance finance via taxes, expressed their disappointment.
