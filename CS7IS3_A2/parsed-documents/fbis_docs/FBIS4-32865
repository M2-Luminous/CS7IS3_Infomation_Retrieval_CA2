This warning was made by Constituent Congress President Senator Humberto Lucena. According to Lucena, even if the constitutional reform work continues for eight or 10 more days, the amendment that contemplates reviewing the Constitution every 10 years will have to be voted on in the first round of voting on 31 May: [Begin Lucena recording] The deadline can be extended only enough to allow Constituent Congress members to complete the voting process in two rounds. [end recording] Lucena also warned that he will only propose voting on the amendment if there is a consensus among party leaders. So far this consensus has not been ensured: The PT [Workers Party] and the PDT [Democratic Labor Party] do not support the amendment because it allows changes in the federal system and regarding independence among the three government branches.
