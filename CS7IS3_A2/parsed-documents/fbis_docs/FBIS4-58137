Syria insists that the withdrawal from the Golan Heights be complete, but it is willing to recognize Israel's security needs and to discuss normalization. This is reported by our political correspondent Shlomo Raz. [passage omitted] [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1300 GMT on 2 May carries a report by Sefi Hendler on the meeting between Christopher and Rabin, adding that "according to what we learned from political sources in Jerusalem, progress was indeed achieved in talks with Syria. Even if it is not exceptional, this is unprecedented progress on the Syrian track. This is the first time since the beginning of the negotiations with Syria that the Syrians have not rejected Israel's proposals out of hand. In their meeting, Christopher presented to Rabin Syria's answers to the security issues relating to the withdrawal. This is the first time that Syria has addressed Israel's security needs. The Syrian response is currently being examined."] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said we are at the first stages of our negotiations with Syria, therefore he cannot say whether he is optimistic or pessimistic. Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports Mr. Rabin told the Labor Knesset faction Israel has not used Christopher's service for relaying to Syria a withdrawal map or the final withdrawal lines. Yitzhaq Rabin said he was furious over the fact that a regular army battalion is forced to guard 415 Jews in Hebron instead of fighting terrorism. Mr. Rabin said the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is being stretched to the limit in guarding the settlements and the Green Line instead of fighting terrorism. Rabin said that it is not Elon More [West Bank settlement] which is guarding Hadera and 'Afula, but rather the IDF. It is not the number of settlements on the Golan Heights which defend the Golan, but rather the number of tanks deployed there.
