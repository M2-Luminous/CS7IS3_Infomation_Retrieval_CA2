Finance Minister Theo Waigel (Christian Social Union) criticized "a number of proposals for tax increases covered up as subsidy cuts." Stepping up registration of speculative profits would make housing construction collapse and cause major shifts of securities to other countries, Waigel pointed out. These measures would not hit big capital but the employees depending on German capital for job-creating and securing measures. The finance minister also criticized that the SPD's 10 percent supplementary tax would put a burden on corporations and joint-stock companies "right from the first mark." Joachim Poss, the SPD Bundestag Group's monetary policy spokesman, defended the intention to increase taxes on "high assets." In the case of inheritance and property tax, tax-free allowances should be increased to a level where only people paying high amounts should face higher burdens. With real-estate tax, small and medium assets should not be charged more, either. Waigel is suggesting to taxpayers that the SPD wants to abolish the system of taxable values and to apply full values without adjusting tax-free allowances in future taxation of real estate and property. Although taxable values should be moved closer to actual current values, they must not reach the full amount, Poss said.
