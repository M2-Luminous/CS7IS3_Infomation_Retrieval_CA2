The Freedom Front will fight it with all the power at its disposal. "3. Law and order must be maintained in such a way so as to guarantee peace and security, and to fight crime and violence effectively. "4. The Afrikaner nation's right to self-determination, that is, the right to rule itself in its own homeland is a nonnegotiable right. This also includes specific rights for Afrikaners outside the homeland. "5. Real freedom means a constitutional dispensation that will render any form of domination impossible. "6. We advocate a constitutional solution for southern Africa based on political independence but economical interdependence and cooperation. "Best wishes, Gen. Constand Viljoen" Below the letter are the following statements: "YOUR VOTE HOLDS THE KEY! VOTE FREEDOM FRONT."
