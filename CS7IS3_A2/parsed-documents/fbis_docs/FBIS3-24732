An IFP special general conference in Ulundi at the weekend had, however, mandated IFP negotiators to continue trying to secure Inkatha's constitutional demands . In an interview before closure of the conference on Sunday Mr Felgate said it was still "technically and politically possible for the government and the African National Congress to come to their senses". He was referring to IFP demands for greater regional autonomy, a double ballot system and other issues contained in a list of constitutional proposals put to the government and the anc by the Freedom Alliance last month. But Mr Felgate cautioned the deadline for constitutional agreement was on midnight on Monday. He said the IFP would adopt a "multi-strategy approach", should it be forced to remain outside South Africa's transitional process, he did not elaborate, however. Mr Felgate said the majority of delegates to the special general conference in Ulundi had strongly supported rejection of the April poll under the current interim constitution, adding that those in favour of the poll were likely to rally behind the decision by the majority of the party. Official resolutions are expected later on Sunday.
