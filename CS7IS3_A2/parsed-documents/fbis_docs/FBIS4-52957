PetroVietnam oil company signed an agreement with Mobil Oil to explore the Blue Dragon field on Hanoi's continental shelf, adjacent to the disputed Spratly Islands, after Beijing signed a deal with another U.S. company, Crestone Energy Corp., to prospect in a nearby field with Chinese naval protection. The contracts drew protests from both Hanoi and Beijing, and elicited concern from neighboring countries. Philippine Foreign [Affairs] Secretary Roberto Romulo told reporters that Brunei, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam -- which claim all or part of the Spratlys -- "understand the Manila declaration" to seek a peaceful resolution to the conflict. "We hope that there will be a dialogue and a meeting of the minds," he added. Manila, which has given permission to foreign and local oil firms to prospect for oil in the central and southern Philippines, has likewise approved a geophysical survey and exploration contract (GSEC) with a consortium of seven Filipino firms to prospect an area that includes the Reed Bank, which adjoins the Spratlys. Energy department sources said no foreign or Filipino oil firm has so far applied for a GSEC in the part of the Spratly area claimed by the Philippines. "That is a difficult proposition," the sources said. "Nobody will enter that." [passage omitted]
