Martino reiterated that his mission was to find a peaceful solution to the Yugoslav crisis before the forthcoming G7 meeting G7 in Naples. The Italian Foreign Minister said that he is still a "stubborn" optimist regarding the future, adding that he agreed with President Milosovic that peace is the most important thing for the prosperity of the region, the surrounding states, and the whole of Europe. Martino stressed that the next two weeks will be crucial for finding a solution to the crisis. Expressing his hope that, with peace as the main goal, something constructive would happen in the period between now and the G7 meeting in Naples on 8 July, Martino said that he does not have "a magic formula in his pocket" but that the encouraging signs on the horizon should not be discarded. Asked about Serbia's future role, Martino said that Serbia, President Milosevic and Yugoslavia have a very important role to play in the efforts successfully to implement the peace process. Certain obstacles to peace must be overcome as they belong to the past and are not a problem of the future, the minister said. "If we have a constructive approach to the problem, things will work out fine", he added. Martino said he discussed the sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with Milosevic and that he said that all sides could benefit from trade, which is a unifying factor in international relations and of great importance for all countries. Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic, who also took part in the talks, agreed with Martino's description of the talks as cordial and meaningful and that they showed that both sides are interested in establishing peace promptly and in removing all artificial obstacles to achieving this. "We are particularly encouraged by the fact that the new Italian government will intensify its activities in the peace process, as well as by the abandonment of the double-standards policy and the adoption of a principled stance to the Yugoslav crisis, since this is the only stance that can bring peace," Jovanovic said. The parts of the talks relating to world politics showed adherence to the principles of peace and a significant degree of readiness by both sides to contribute towards finding positive solutions to all different aspects. We believe that we shall continue to develop principled cooperation with Italy, as the most important neighboring state, Jovanovic said.
