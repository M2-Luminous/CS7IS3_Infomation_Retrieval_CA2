Panicked by the fact that the Rwandan Patriotic Army is getting closer to the capital, the government members reportedly headed in unknown directions. According to reports broadcast by Radio France International, the government clique headed for the south of the country. The government army's side is in flight. Some senior officers of the death squads have already cleared off, abandoning their men on the ground. They are Lieutenant Colonel Bahofitse of Byumba military region, and Major (Jombye), commander of (Ngawiro) camp in Mutara, known for having given military training to Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development (?armed) militias to commit the atrocities which have just hit the country, especially in Kigali, the capital. The fact that commanders have deserted gives a clear idea of the nature of the fighting.
