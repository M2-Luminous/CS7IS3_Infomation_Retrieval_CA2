In a statement the Department of Foreign Affairs says the split in the ranks of the royal Lesotho force has created a situation which threatens the peace and security of the Basotho nation. It further says the government of Botswana has been watching the unfolding situation in Lesotho with grave concern, adding that this critical situation resulting from the unrest within the armed forces of Lesotho also threatens the stability of the democratically elected government of Lesotho. While pleading for restraint throughout the Basotho nation, the Government of Botswana strongly appealed to the Royal Lesotho Defense Force to restore the situation to the status quo for the honor and dignity of the sister people of Lesotho. It applauds the efforts of the secretaries general of the Organization of African Unity, and the Commonwealth, to bring the situation in Lesotho back to normal.
