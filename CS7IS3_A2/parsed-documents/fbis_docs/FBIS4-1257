FBIS4-1257 "drafr080_d_94005" FBIS-AFR-94-080 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 SOUTHERN AFRICA Lesotho Information Secretary on Threats To Kill Ministers Information Secretary on Threats To Kill Ministers MB2204154394 London BBC World Service in English 0600 GMT 22 Apr 94 MB2204154394 London BBC World Service English BFN [From the "Network Africa" program] [Text] Yesterday we reported that six ministers had mysteriously left the country, the rumor in Maseru being that they had fled in fear of their lives. But government sources maintained they had left for official duties. Well, two of the ministers have returned and another four are expected to return shortly, according to the principal secretary for information, Seeiso Serutla. Koja Berwado got in touch with Mr. Serutla on the line to Maseru and asked him why the ministers had decided to come back. [Begin recording] [Serutla] This is as a result of the army having accepted their pay cheques because the ministers had to flee because of the allegations of threats on their lives, when the armed forces received their salaries, which apparently did not include the increase. [Berwado] So, is it the case that the army has now been paid these new wages with the 100 percent increase which they demanded? [Serutla] No, at the moment there is no increase in their salaries, but the army has accepted that there will be an increase and there are some increases in their salaries for May, which obviously will be backdadted from April. Let me make it clear that it is not 100 percent, as the army (?heard). [Berwado] So, how much is it? [Serutla] I am not sure about the percentage, but it is certainly not 100 percent. [Berwado] Who exactly is in charge of the country at the moment? I mean, is it the army or is it the government? [Serutla] The Government of Lesotho, through the prime minister, Dr. Ntsu Mokhehle, is the government of this country, and they are still there. [Berwado] So, now, you are definitely going to see a kind of a backlash of this situation that erupted last week? [Serutla] I cannot guarantee you anything as, I mean, the army in Lesotho is obviously a problem, and I can't guarantee anything. All I can say is that we are talking and we are in the process of talking to each other. [Berwado] And who in the army are you negotiating with? Who is in charge of the army at the moment? [Serutla] A major general. [Berwado] Mr. Serutla, it is quite a worrying prospect if you say the army have agreed, but then there are no guarantees. What about the political situation? [Serutla] What kind of guarantees would you want? I mean, they have guaranteed to us that they have accepted some increases in their pay salaries, whatever it is. They have said they have settled down and that we will continue talking to each other. [Berwado] On the question of the mutineers who killed the deputy prime minister last week, are they going to be brought to book? [Serutla] Well, I want to leave that question really to the head of the army. It is their job, whenever there is anything like that to deal with it as it is appropriate. [Berwado] Have they indicated that they are going to deal with that aspect of the situation? [Serutla] Well, not to me personally. [Berwado] Do you believe they will? [Serutla] I believe that. The situation in Lesotho was bad by killing the deputy prime minister, and that the only way which will advance peace in Lesotho is for the law breakers to be seen to be punished for what they have done, I mean that is my personal view. I mean, I think in any civilized country that is what we expect.
