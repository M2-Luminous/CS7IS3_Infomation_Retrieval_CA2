FBIS3-27293 "drchi036_b_94002" FBIS-CHI-94-036 Document Type:Daily Report 23 Feb 1994 United States & Canada Senior CIA Officer Arrested for Spying for Russia OW2202222394 Beijing XINHUA in English 1951 GMT 22 Feb 94 OW2202222394 Beijing XINHUA Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Washington, February 22 (XINHUA) -- In what may be the most serious espionage case in U.S. history, a senior U.S. intelligence officer and his wife were arraigned today for spying for the former Soviet Union and later Russia since 1985. President Bill Clinton described the case as a "very serious one and would lodge a strong protest with the Russians." Aldrich Hazen Ames, 52, a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee for more than 31 years, was chief of the Soviet branch of the CIA's Counter Intelligence Group, before being arrested Monday [21 February] by the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI). Ames and his wife, the 41-year-old Maria del Rosario Casas, allegedly received more than 1.5 million dollars from the former Soviet Union's KGB and its Russian successor for giving vital information on CIA's operations and personnel. If convicted, the couple could be sentenced a maximum of life imprisonment and 250,000 dollars in fines. According to Helen F. Fahey, U.S. attorney for the eastern district of Virginia, Ames also passed classified information to, and received cash from, the Russians through "dead drops" in the Washington, D.C. area. A "dead drop" is a prearranged location where a foreign agent drops off or picks up material from his contact. It is not clear for the time being if any Russian diplomats here would be pronounced as "persona non grata" as a result of the couple's arrest. Attorney Fehey said in the complaint that Ames and his wife, native of Colombia and a naturalized U.S. citizen, used at least two Swiss bank accounts to store and transfer the money they got from the Russians. The couple spent the money on, among other things, a 540,000 dollars house, jaguar automobiles and more than 165,000 dollars in stocks and securities. FBI agents have seized the couple's residence in Arlington, Virginia and frozen numerous bank accounts belonging to or controlled by the couple in the United States and abroad. Ames' wife is a part-time student at the Georgetown University and previously acted as a paid source for the CIA in Mexico City, Mexico. "FBI agents worked doggedly on this case -- not for months but for years -- with the CIA's unwavering assistance every stop of the way," FBI Director Louis Freeh said.
