At a recent meeting in Guangzhou, the provincial government analyzed some prominent problems in economic operations and worked out solutions. According to Lu Ruihua, in the first quarter, the gross industrial output value produced by enterprises at and above township level in Guangdong reached 105.1 billion yuan, an increase of 21 percent over the same period last year; sales reached 96.7 billion yuan, an increase of 18 percent; exports reached $7.555 billion, an increase of 16.1 percent; and the amount of foreign funds actually used reached $2.196 billion, an increase of 48.8 percent. Prominent problems in economic operations at present include a high rate of price increases, a serious shortage of working funds, a hidden crisis in grain production, and a lack of coordination between some reform measures. Lu Ruihua said: The Guangdong government is soberly aware of the current situation, and realizes the necessity of strictly controlling the scale of investment while facing a stern monetary situation, stabilizing and developing grain production and preventing grain production from declining, and conscientiously carrying out fiscal reform and guaranteeing stable increases in fiscal revenue. He said: Local governments at all levels in the province must attach great importance to keeping prices of daily necessities stable, strictly control the adoption of price reform measures without going their own way, intensify government control over market prices, establish food price regulation funds more quickly, establish a reserve system for major commodities, and resolutely check various practices which are contrary to price control regulations.
