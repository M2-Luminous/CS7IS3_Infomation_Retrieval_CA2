FR940713-1-00005 FR940713-1-00001 Inspection under both SIS&hyph;1 and SIS&hyph;2 is conducted in two phases_a post-mortem inspection phase and a reinspection phase. In the inspection phase, inspectors determine which birds must be salvaged, reprocessed, condemned, retained for veterinary disposition, or allowed to be moved down the line as a passed bird subject to reinspection. The reinspection station or stations are located both before and after each chiller. At the prechill station, inspectors examine carcasses by visually monitoring, checking quality control data, or sampling product at the station. SIS incorporates a finished product standards (FPS) program by which product is evaluated and the results tracked with the aid of the CUSUM statistical method. The tabulation and charting of CUSUM results enables the establishment and FSIS inspectors to determine whether the establishment's processes are under control, and hence, whether the process will produce consistently sound, wholesome product. NELS During the 1970's and 1980's the industry continued to make significant technological advances and were capable of better process control. The FSIS inspection procedure became the limiting factor on industry productivity. In 1981, the Agency developed a new procedure, New Line Speed (NELS), that shifted quality control responsibilities to the plant and relied more heavily on monitoring and verification than in the past. This is a voluntary program, and, if approved the establishment can operate at a maximum rate of 91 birds per minute. NELS combines SIS post-mortem inspection procedures with an establishment-operated slaughter quality control program that is monitored by FSIS. The Agency permits the NELS system in appropriately equipped establishments that have requested and been approved for the system. The NELS inspection system consists of three FSIS inspectors performing the NELS whole-bird post-mortem inspection procedure and at least one inspector monitoring the application of an FSIS-approved, plant-operated slaughter quality control (QC) program. The QC program is designed to assure that the processing system is under control. NTIS The above discussion regarding MTI, SIS, and NELS is specific to the development of inspection systems for young chickens, the largest segment of the poultry industry. Other classes of poultry have not evolved through the same inspection procedures. However, as the turkey industry began to grow and become more automated, merely expanding traditional procedures was impractical and inefficient. Therefore, in 1985, FSIS established the New Turkey Inspection (NTI) system which was based on the concepts and procedures used in NELS system. This system calls for one or two inspectors on each inspection line to inspect the inside, outside, and viscera of each bird presented, with establishment employees responsible for trimming passed carcasses. The adequacy of the trimming is assured through an establishment-operated quality control and finished product standards (FPS) program that is monitored by FSIS personnel. Poultry Enhancement Program Introduction Experience has shown that there are two points on the poultry main processing line where birds are more likely to become contaminated. The first of these is at evisceration, when improperly adjusted equipment may perforate or burst the intestines as the viscera is ``scooped'' out, resulting in fecal contamination on the interior surface of the carcass. The second point where contamination may occur is where the viscera are separated from the carcass. Unless the viscera harvest is properly carried out, the interior surface of carcasses can become contaminated with feces. In March, the Secretary of Agriculture announced a series of measures that are intended to strengthen poultry products inspection and reduce the occurrence of pathogens on raw product. The initiatives included a better method for enforcing ``zero tolerance'' for fecal contamination on raw product by changing the inspection sequence to provide on-line inspection checks for contamination, which is not provided by current systems. Also included among the initiatives are the use of approved antimicrobial treatments on carcasses and the 100% reinspection of reprocessed carcasses. Because these initiatives would change procedures that are already authorized or required by the regulations, it is necessary to amend the regulations to carry them out.
