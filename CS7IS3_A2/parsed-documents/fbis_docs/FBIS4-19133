The most important examination question: Does an SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany]-governed Germany demand a special role for itself in security policy? [Verheugen] Not at all. The basis of German security policy is fixed. That means a firm presence in NATO and in the European Union. Germany remains a reliable alliance partner that adheres to its duties. That is one of the important messages that Rudolf Scharping will deliver in the United States. The close German-U.S. partnership is more than just a security-political challenge for the SPD. In this partnership, we want to introduce a new dimension, that of economic and environmental policy, something which the Federal Government has badly neglected. In this sphere we notice a harmony with President Clinton's own views. [Opitz] The Clinton administration also wants to know if Chancellor Scharping would permit German units to be involved in UN operations. [Verheugen] That is an artificial subject. The UN is not at war, and NATO cannot independently assume tasks that go beyond its mission of common defense. It can only do so within a UN framework, and in the future the UN will not demand that German troops are sent into action. [Opitz] But the UN secretary general sees things differently. [Verheugen] Butrus-Ghali thinks Germany could support the UN in various ways. The UN needs unlimited assistance. We are ready to give it. But I do not understand why everyone keeps talking about combat operations. Where on earth should UN units fight? On the contrary, after the experience of Somalia and Bosnia, the UN is reverting to its classic peacekeeping function, and not combat operations. Germany can take part in anything that is undertaken within this peacekeeping framework. But just like any other country, including the United States, in every single case we reserve the right to check whether German involvement is expedient or not. [Opitz] That sounds just like Hans-Ulrich Klose's demand for blue helmets and more. [Verheugen] This is not a question of deploying blue helmets. It is something that has developed in the UN. For years, it was widely believed in Germany that the blue helmets do nothing except monitor cease-fires, whereby people tended to forget that the blue helmets have the right and duty to perform their job with reasonable force if necessary. [Opitz] That is a clever way of putting it. Even so it sounds surprisingly like what the SPD was saying months ago. [Verheugen] The SPD learned a lesson that was reflected in our party resolution in Wiesbaden. We are going one step further than the UN. We want to see the use of blockades as a means of preventing or stopping wars. In such a case, blockades can be backed up militarily. [Opitz] But you will have problems with a potential coalition partner. Since the Mannheim decision by the Greens that they would leave NATO, the idea of a red-green Federal Government is a nightmare for the United States. [Verheugen] The SPD does not want a coalition partner that calls for withdrawal from NATO and the abolition of the Bundeswehr. There will be no such coalition. The Bundeswehr retains its classic defense function. We want to provide it with a certain future. In any case, NATO will be needed until we have a stable all-European system of security that involves the United States. Scharping will tell the United States in no uncertain terms that there is no German partner for the kind of policy that the Greens formulated in Mannheim. Our U.S. friends can count on it.
