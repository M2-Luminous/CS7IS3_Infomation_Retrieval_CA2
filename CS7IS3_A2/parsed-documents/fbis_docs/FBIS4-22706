Maltsev: "Criminal Millions"] [Text] One scandal follows another: Corporations and consortiums collect a bit of money from trusting citizens, and later disappear into thin air along with large sums of money. The citizens moan and groan and...once again take their money to the next "benefactor." Three major swindles burst forth almost simultaneously: two in Moscow and one in Novosibirsk. Muscovites "were made happy" by the Independent Oil Concern, which collected 260 billion in three months of existence, and by the investment fund Oil-Diamonds-Invest, whose business was also not inconsequential. But if the words "oil," "diamond," "investment," and so forth, sound magical to the capital's investors, it seems it was even easier to deceive residents of Novosibirsk. A certain joint-stock company of the closed type--Fineko--which allegedly was a branch of the Irkutsk Credit Industrial Bank, simply announced in a TV commercial that it was beginning to pay b-i-g interest rates for money it collected, specifically, 30 percent per month. The minimum payment, of course, had to be not less than a million. But, as can be seen, the matter did not stop here: In one week, 150 million was collected. Were it not for the vigilance of the law enforcement organs, the volume of the swindle would be no less than the capital "oil swindle." Absolutely all Fineko's documents were fakes, including the license granting the right to financial operations. The victims of the fraud were mainly people of pension age. The victims of the Moscow swindle in those days even came to a rally demanding protection from the authorities. This is a very difficult task, given the current legislative base and the unstable economic situation. It is precisely for this reason that people fall for the bait, inasmuch as they want to guard their money against inflation. After all, each time they were induced by promises of high interest. "Such promises in fact do not always reflect a capability to fulfill them, but rather they are a signal for the law enforcement organs to be interested in how legal the activities of the `enrichers' is," Viktor Sushentsev, deputy chief of the West Siberian Regional Administration in the Fight against Organized Crime, to whom the editorial office turned for information on this matter, commented about the Fineko swindle. This time, intuition did not let our protectors down, otherwise many more people would have been deceived. Still, what is to be done, if you want to guard against similar unpleasant occurrences? The most general advice is provided by an historical example of a highly inflationary period in Italy. People were simply not saving at all. It is said that at that time stores and restaurants there were filled: The Italians were attempting to get rid of money on their own pleasures, since it was no longer possible to accumulate it. The second piece of advice: Before turning over your money it is necessary to convince yourself that the receiving side has the right to engage in investment operations. Nikolay Beloslyudtsev, deputy chief of the main administration of the Central Bank for Novosibirsk Oblast, said that such a right is granted by a license to conduct banking operations. What is to be done if the license is forged, what does a genuine one look like, and what if the ordinary investor does not know? The main administrations of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation in the territories has all of the information on the issuance of licenses. If the clients of Fineko had inquired at the main administration concerning the Irkutsk Credit Industrial Bank, it is very likely they would have been able to ascertain that such a bank did not exist at all. One should not take extreme positions and think that everyone who does not have a banking license but who works with money received from the population is an outright swindler. Of course not. But in any case it is necessary to be concerned about guarantees for your money and get the maximum information about those firms with which you intend to do business. A banking license, of course, is the reliable guarantee here, inasmuch as its owner is obligated to form insurance funds in the event of its ruin, so that investors do not suffer at the same time. It is mainly banks that possess such licenses. Among nonbank structures there are not many as such, and almost all of them are located in Moscow. A law on advertising could be a distinctive protective mechanism. If the advertiser bore legislative responsibility for texts published in the press and broadcast on radio and TV, then probably it would be possible to institute proceedings immediately, without waiting for a scandal. After all, it is clear to every reasonable person: A yeast fungus has not been invented yet for cultivating money. And the capabilities of known catalyzers of this process are very limited.
