However, some people in the world constantly keep the Cold War in mind, because they enjoyed certain advantages during the Cold War. They are none other than the CPC authorities. Whenever a popularity crisis appeared, the CPC authorities certainly made full use of the Cold War. They found their number one enemy outside the country, and then solicited the people's support by resorting to nationalism in order to solve domestic crises. At present, "mountains" of contradictions and difficulties are accumulating in mainland China, as Hu Yaobang noted many years ago. A major crisis has again appeared in terms of the people's trust and support for the government. In June last year, CHENG MING published an article which said that a hundred generals had submitted a petition to Deng Xiaoping. It exclusively revealed that the CPC military required the party leadership to revise its policy toward the United States. After one year of preparation, the new policy option was eventually adopted. This is related to the crisis of trust and support for the regime among the people. On 1 April this year, the CPC Central Committee Secretariat held an extremely important meeting at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, which was attended by the secretaries and propaganda chiefs of the party committees of all ministries, state commissions, provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. The meeting was chaired by Hu Jintao. Ding Guangen announced the work arrangements. Zhang Wannian, chief of the general staff of the People's Liberation Army [PLA], also delivered a speech at the meeting. Hu Jintao first gave an assessment of the current domestic and international situation on behalf of the Political Bureau. Part of the speech was entitled "Changes in Sino-U.S. Relations." Hu Jintao said: The whole party and the whole Army should make full preparations and should be more profoundly aware that Sino-U.S. relations will not be in a normal state in the near future, in the next few years, and even for a longer period to come, and further worsening and confrontations may occur. According to the global hegemonist strategy of the United States, its main rival at present is the PRC. Interfering in China, subverting the Chinese Government, and strangling China's development are strategic principles pursued by the United States. While facing hegemonism, power politics, and the aggressive anti-China strategy pursued by the United States, we have no room for any choices. We must sternly and explicitly tell the United States, and declare to the world also, that the normalization and development of relations between China and the United States can only be made on the basis of the two joint communiques signed by the two governments. The Chinese Government and the Chinese people have not, do not, and will not tolerate any indiscreet criticism or the wanton interference of hegemonism and power politics in China's sovereignty and internal affairs. In the world today, even if there is an impasse in Sino-U.S. relations, China will still be able to develop further and enhance its national strength at a rather high speed. Ding Guangen gave a speech on this subject, and arranged propaganda work around Sino-U.S. relations. His speech included eight main points: 1. The anti-China strategy of the United States is aimed at strangling China's socialism and reducing China to a vassal state of the United States. 2. The United States is carrying out a series of activities to interfere in, harass, and attack China in the political, economic, and ideological fields and also in various international organizations. 3. The United States is interfering in China's internal affairs under the pretext of human rights, and it makes judgments in terms of ideology. This is a subversive strategy. 4. The United States supports and uses hostile forces and elements in China to carry out subversive and seditious activities, create political incidents, and thus disrupt and undermine our country's construction, reform, and social stability. 5. The United States itself does not participate in international human rights conventions of great importance and does not implement relevant UN resolutions. 6. In the last 20 to 30 years, U.S. aggression against other countries has caused destruction and millions of casualties to the victim nations. 7. Racial discrimination, murder, violence, and drug trafficking inside the United States have become serious disasters for its own people, and all of these expose problems with its system. 8. International opposition to hegemonism and power politics has grown into a force. Safeguarding national independence and self- determination and opposing foreign interference and subversion has become an irresistible trend of social development. Chief of the General Staff Zhang Wannian made a speech entitled, "Reinforcing the Army, Accelerating the Army's Modernization, Firmly Opposing Interference and Subversion From Hegemonism, and Defending the Motherland" on behalf of the Armed Forces. Zhang Wannian said: When facing blatant interference by the U.S. hegemonists in our internal affairs and their open support for the debilitating activities of hostile elements inside our country and hostile forces outside the mainland and overseas opposing and subverting our socialist system, we must reinforce the Armed Forces more intensively by grasping the current opportunity and accelerating the modernization and reform of the three services according to Deng Xiaoping's line on army-building and Chairman Jiang's instructions on the work of the Central Military Commission. We should strengthen and develop relations with all friendly countries in the world and oppose international hegemonism and power politics. Any hegemonist attempt to interfere and meddle in our state sovereignty and the nation's internal affairs is intolerable, and our national dignity can never be harmed by hegemonism and colonialism. We shall not challenge other nations, but we must keep our strength in order to defeat the challenge from hegemonism and colonialism. According to information from the General Office of the CPC's Central Military Commission [CMC], the General Staff Headquarters and the Policy Research Office of the CMC have worked out a plan to form a global anti-hegemonist, anti-interference, antisubversion, and anti-aggression united front to unite all countries and organizations willing to oppose hegemonism and power politics for a certain period of time, and the target is the United States. Reportedly, 23 to 25 countries have expressed support for the proposal, and nearly 40 countries have consented to a similar form of organization. The opinion of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Political Bureau is that China should not be the leader of such an organization, but should continue to promote the development of this trend, because this will be conducive to its work. China will support the idea in principle, but will wait for an opportune moment and mature conditions. In fact, the CPC authorities have long been preparing for an adjustment in relations with the United States. As of last March, leaders of the economic, financial, and foreign trade departments of various provinces, and of some large export-oriented enterprises, were organized to study documents issued by the General Office of the CPC Central Committee, and the documents included: "Sino-U.S. Relations Remain Tense," "Developments and Problems in Sino-U.S. Relations," and "China's Principled Position Against the U.S. Policy of Interference and Subversion." The purpose is for dual preparations to be made against a worsening of Sino-U.S. relations and for the adoption of countermeasures against any rupture in Sino-U.S. relations. It seems natural that such an important meeting should be chaired by Hu Jintao, a member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee and a member of the Central Secretariat in charge of day-to-day work. However, it seems somewhat unreasonable that the keynote speeches were given by Ding Guangen, the Political Bureau member in charge of ideology, and Zhang Wannian, chief of the general staff of the Armed Forces. Qian Qichen, the Political Bureau member in charge of foreign affairs and vice premier of the State Council, was excluded and did not attend the meeting. In addition, the organs which submitted the proposal to set up a global anti-hegemonist united front at an opportune moment were not those responsible for foreign affairs, but the General Staff Headquarters of the PLA and the CMC Policy Research Office. This is rather unusual. Although it is necessary to oppose interference from hegemonism in internal affairs, why did this allow the interference of the military in internal administrative affairs? All such "subtleties" remain unclear for the time being, and a clearer picture will appear after the further development of events. Another noticeable point is that, at present, the CPC authorities are adopting highhanded methods to repress dissidents calling for political reforms, but this is not supported by the masses. The CPC authorities now call dissidents "hostile elements" who are supported by U.S. hegemonists. It seems that the CPC authorities are trying to link pro-democracy activists advocating political reforms with the number-one enemy, the U.S. hegemonists, so that such activities can be denounced as "traitorous" and the crisis of domestic trust can be resolved. This shows the sinister nature of their intentions. It should also be mentioned here that in the current post-Cold War period, the attempt to create and use the "Cold War" to mitigate and divert the people's attention from domestic contradictions was not invented first by the CPC authorities, but by North Korea. Of course, relations between the CPC authorities and North Korea are not good, but they may come into good terms again in order to join hands to launch an anti-U.S. campaign. What should the United States do in facing this readjustment of the CPC's U.S. policy? It would certainly be an unwise move if the United States showed weakness and made concessions, and it may also incur losses if it takes a hard-line policy against the hard-line policy of the CPC, because its rival does not play fairly according to the rules of the game. How they adjust their China policy appropriately will be a great challenge and test for the political wisdom of U.S. statesmen.
