The chairman of the presidency of the parliament, Pjeter Arbnori, the vice-premier, Bashkim Kopliku, the chairman of the DP parliamentary group, Ali Spahia, and the DP Secretary General Tritan Shehu took part in the meeting. 1994, underlined Mr. Selami, will be marked as the year of coalition of the left extreme forces directed by the Socialist Party. The Democratic Alliance Party is taking part openly into it unfortunately, he said. Shkoder became one of the arenas of the political tension which is a result of the coordination between left extremes. Speaking abut the killing of Gjovalin Cekini, during an incident on January 14, he said that the Democratic Party has condemned the crime and holds that he was a victim of the unnecessary tensions. Regarding accusations against the DP for the killing are groundless, Mr. Selami said adding that the Democratic Party has no relations with the crime. "We will wait until the verdict is taken and then we shall give our opinion about these accusations." "We will answer the unbridled antidemocratic propaganda, which has in its focus the Democratic Party at all its levels, with the promotion of the reform," Mr. Selami said. Mr. Pjeter Arbnori spoke about the reorganization and consolidation of the commission of the constitution. He said that the constitution "belongs neither to the Democratic Party nor to the Socialist Party, it belongs to Albania, so we should compile it together through understanding." Mr. Bashkim Kopliku spoke about the economic reform in Albania, the achievements and the difficulties which have been encountered as well as about the opinions of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund with regard to the reform in Albania.
