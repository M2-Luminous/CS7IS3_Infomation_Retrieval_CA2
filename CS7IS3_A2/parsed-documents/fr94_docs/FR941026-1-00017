FR941026-1-00017 FR941026-1-00009 40 CFR Part 300 [FRL&hyph;5095&hyph;9] National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan; The National Priorities List Update AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Notice of Intent to Delete the Boise Cascade/Onan/Medtronics Site from the National Priorities List; request for comments. SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Region V announces its intent to delete the Boise Cascade/Onan/Medtronics Site from the National Priorities List (NPL) and requests public comments on this action. The NPL is appendix B of 40 CFR part 300 which is the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), which EPA promulgated pursuant to section 105 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) as amended. This action is being taken, because all Fund-financed response actions under CERCLA have been implemented and EPA, in consultation with the State of Minnesota, has determined that no further response is appropriate. Moreover, EPA and the State have determined that remedial activities conducted at the site to date have been protective of public health, welfare, and the environment. DATES: Comments concerning the proposed deletion may be submitted November 25, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to Gladys Beard (HSRM&hyph;6J) Associate Remedial Project Manager, Office of Superfund, USEPA, Region V, 77 W. Jackson Blvd., Chicago, IL 60604. Information on the site is available at USEPA and at the local information repository located at: Minnesota Pollution Control Agency Public Library, 520 Lafayette RD, St. Paul, MN 55155&hyph;4194.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Table of Contents I. Introduction II. NPL Deletion Criteria III. Deletion Procedures IV. Basis for Intended Site Deletion I. Introduction The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Region V announces its intent to delete the Boise Cascade/Onan/Medtronics Site from the National Priorities List (NPL), appendix B to the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan, 40 CFR part 300 (NCP), and requests comments on the proposed deletion. The EPA identifies sites which appear to present a significant risk to public health, welfare or the environment, and maintains the NPL as the list of those sites. Sites on the NPL may be the subject of Superfund (Fund) financed remedial actions. Pursuant to ยง300.425(e)(3) of the NCP, any site deleted from the NPL remains eligible for additional Fund-financed remedial actions in the unlikely event that conditions at the site warrant such action. The USEPA will accept comments on this proposal for thirty (30) days after publication of this notice in the Federal Register . Section II of this notice explains the criteria for deleting sites from the NPL. Section III discusses procedures that EPA is using for this action. Section IV discusses the history of this site and explains how the site meets the deletion criteria. Deletion of sites from the NPL does not itself create, alter, or revoke any individual's rights or obligations. Furthermore, deletion from the NPL does not in any way alter EPA's right to take enforcement actions, as appropriate. The NPL is designed primarily for informational purposes and to assist in Agency management. II. NPL Deletion Criteria The NCP establishes the criteria the Agency uses to delete sites from the NPL. In accordance with 40 CFR 300.425(e), sites may be deleted from the NPL where no further response is appropriate. In making this determination, USEPA will consider, in consultation with the State, whether any of the following criteria have been met:
