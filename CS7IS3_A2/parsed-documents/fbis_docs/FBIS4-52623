Kosaku Inaba told reporters that an election under the current system is a possibility, although it should preferably be held after the introduction of a new system combining single-seat constituencies and proportional representation. Top leaders of other major Japanese business organizations, including the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), have said the lower house should be dissolved for a general election only after a new electoral system is introduced.
