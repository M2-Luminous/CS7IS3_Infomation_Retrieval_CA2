Mostly, Hungarian minority leaders living abroad are worried that the cabinet led by the Socialists will make basic treaties with the neighboring countries before the interests of the Hungarians living there receive adequate guarantees. Recently, Miklos Duray [chairman of the Coexistence Movement in Slovakia] expressed his worries. We interviewed Csaba Tabajdi on the obviously not unfounded fears. [Tabajdi] If Miklos Duray had read the MSZP's program that I personally handed over to him in Bratislava in January, then I do not really understand what he is afraid of. According to the program, basic treaties can be written in such a way that they lay down the inviolability of borders, and guarantee the rights of the national minorities. The material also contains [a provision] that before a basic treaty is signed, it must be coordinated with the opposition parties and the democratic organizations of Hungarians abroad. [Joo] Would the latter [organizations] be present during intergovernmental negotiations? [Tabajdi] This would also be possible if the negotiating partners do not have objections to it. [Joo] Would the passage on the inviolability of borders lead to documents similar to the Ukrainian-Hungarian basic treaty? [Tabajdi] The two countries that sign the treaty would state that they will not make territorial demands against each other. In my view, this or similar wording of the clause on borders should be in the treaties, as I have already said in the parliamentary debate on ratifying the basic treaty with Ukraine. This can clearly express the political intention and will of the treaty countries, the importance of which has been expressed by a number of our neighbors. Although, there are no tangible signs whatsoever that political forces that are significant in Hungarian politics would question the reality of borders. However, many decades ago, an atmosphere of mistrust emerged in this region; a properly worded, modern, basic treaty would be an answer to this. [Joo] Anyway, during the campaign, there was a difference between the statements made by you, who had drawn up the program, and the statements of MSZP Chairman Gyula Horn. Horn would abolish the Office for Hungarians Living Abroad [HTMH]. [Tabajdi] The work of the HTMH was also sharply criticized in the program. We stated that the Office has to be fundamentally reorganized. The future of the HTMH is uncertain at the moment, because it depends on the future governmental structure as a whole. However, this does not mean that the MSZP does not consider care for the Hungarians living abroad to be important, but it wishes to implement this in a different institutional and organizational structure. [Joo] Is it true that the Socialists are planning to set up a ministry on national minorities under your leadership? And the HTMH would be incorporated in this just as the government office dealing with church affairs? [Tabajdi] It would be too early to talk about the organization at the moment. As for my future office, this is only speculation.
