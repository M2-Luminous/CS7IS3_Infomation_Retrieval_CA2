Following one-hour talks with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, Akashi told journalists that he was encouraged by President Milosevic's readiness to support the United Nations and UNPROFOR in their mission, and added that the talks were very useful. The head of the UNPROFOR mission in the former Yugoslavia rejected the possibility that the United Nations could set an ultimatum to the warring sides in Bosnia, stressing that the word ultimatum does not exist in the United Nations' vocabulary. Akashi said that he had informed President Milosevic about an agreement reached today with Milan Martic, president of the republic of Serb Krajina, on the resolution of the problem that has arisen between UNPROFOR and the Krajina police regarding the bridge near Nova Gradiska. We also discussed the latest developments in Sarajevo and other important issues, such as Mostar and Tuzla, he said. The UN envoy explained that they had discussed the opening of Tuzla airport and said: We would like to resolve this issue in a peaceful and diplomatic way. UNPROFOR is ready to provide certain guarantees to those who think that the airport could be used for other than humanitarian purposes. We are ready to guarantee that Tuzla airport will be used for humanitarian purposes only. If the presence of officers of both sides is necessary we are ready to let it be so, Akashi said. He did not rule out fresh ideas on the resolution of that issue, which would offer greater guarantees. We think it important to resolve that issue (Tuzla airport) through an agreement between all sides, Akashi said. Stating that he also discussed with Milosevic the initiative to set up a Muslim-Croat confederation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Akashi said that he believed that the initiative was good. That is a step toward a comprehensive peace that should not, however, involve only two, but all sides, Akashi said. Concerning the massacre at Sarajevo's Markale market, Akashi said that a special five-member UN commission reached a conclusion that the shell could have been fired from Serb or Muslim positions. We cannot ascribe the responsibility to any of the two sides, but we are sure that a 120-mm mortar shell could have caused such tragic consequences, Akashi stressed. Asked about a secret UN report which says the Muslim side is responsible for the massacre, he said that he had heard various reports but that he had to stick to the conclusions of the five experts. Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic declared on Akashi's departure that the talks with the head of UNPROFOR were cordial and open and that they reiterated the desire of Yugoslavia and Serbia to see peace in Bosnia as soon as possible. President Milosevic, Jovanovic said, expressed deep satisfaction at the success achieved today by Mr. Akashi and [Serb Krajina] president Martic in normalizing the situation surrounding the bridge across the Sava. The president recalled the support we lent to the Vance plan and its implementation and underlined that we were convinced all issues that crop up could be and should be resolved through dialogue, Jovanovic added. The Yugoslav foreign minister stressed that the talks with Akashi emphasized the problem of the sanctions as an obstacle to peace, because the Muslim side is still relying on hopes that the sanctions will help it achieve what it could not achieve on the battlefield. He said that Akashi was told that the lifting of the sanctions would shorten the road to peace and relieve the Muslims of that last grand illusion. Asked about the Yugoslav stand on the opening of Tuzla airport, Jovanovic stressed that the Serb side in Bosnia should negotiate and decide on that. We believe that this is basically a marginal and artificial problem that arose when the Muslim side had to be protected against their responsibility for the failure of the peace plan on Bosnia. The issue of Tuzla airport should not evolve into a problem that could threaten the peace process, and give a fresh impetus to the advocates of the war option to further aggravate the situation in Bosnia. Jovanovic went on to say that this issue could be effectively solved by introducing control of the airport, which would involve the Bosnian Serbs, and which would theoretically and in practical terms rule out any possibility of the airport being misused for other [than humanitarian] purposes. Jovanovic stressed that the issue of opening the airport in Banja Luka would probably be raised at the same time as that of Tuzla airport, because that [Serb-held] area needs humanitarian aid.
