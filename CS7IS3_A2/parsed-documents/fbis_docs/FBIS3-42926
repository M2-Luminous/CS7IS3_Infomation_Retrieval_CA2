It is attaining this goal successfully. In just three years, the bank has become one of the largest financial institutions in the oblast. Its capital stock has increased from 60 million rubles to 6.5 billion. According to independent estimates (particularly the KOMMERSANT rating), it holds a steady position among the 20 most reliable banks in Russia. Our correspondent asked one of its administrators, Deputy Chairman of the Board D.Z. Bagapova, to say something about the operations of the bank. "When we founded our bank, we were relying on the strength of regional industry," Daniya Zavdatovna said. "The founders included such well-known production units and organizations as the Samara Metallurgical Joint-Stock Company, the Samara Aircraft Engineering Enterprise, the Progress Plant, the Kuybyshev Railroad Administration, the Kuybyshevazot Joint-Stock Company, and others. We were naturally hoping to establish a stable, solid, and modern bank. This is not a simple task, particularly under present economic conditions, now that former state firms have had to enter into market relations so suddenly, without any preparation. Obviously, the difficulties inherent in this process have a direct effect on our operations. After all, serving the municipal and oblast economy can account for up to 80 percent of the bank's operations. Nevertheless, in 1993 we managed to achieve a significant rise in most indicators and strengthen our position among the leading commercial financial institutions in the region. Our credit volume last year was 240 billion rubles, and our profits were around 42 billion rubles." [Saklakov] Many financiers are complaining that investments in economic development are tantamount to suicide in today's economy. What is your opinion? [Bagapova] There is no question that investments in long-term projects always entail risks, but we are still doing this. The size of our investments is constantly growing. Our investments in the last nine months of last year amounted to a billion rubles. Of course, we are more likely to finance highly profitable ventures. We extended credit for the construction of a linoleum plant in Otradnyy, we took on the restoration of hops plantations, the products of which were once exported to almost every part of Europe, and we are supporting the development of the rural communities of the Volga Germans and other agricultural production units supplying the population with food. We could invest more, but the problem is the regrettable lack of so-called ready money in the country--i.e., funds available for fairly long-term loans, even at high rates of interest. It is impossible to concentrate only on the present. We have to find some way of developing our industry, and this cannot be done without "ready" money. The government should be the source of this money (or at least find ways of obtaining it). At this time, however, plants are using most of our credit to pay wages. The giants of metallurgy, the aerospace industry, and the petroleum industry are not getting anything from the center. It is as if we bankers are the only ones who care about the future of the economy and of the previously mentioned aircraft engineering plant. In fact, according to a recently passed law, the interest on deferred credit payments will come out of the bank's profits. [Saklakov] Is there really no appreciation of the fact that you are participating in the development of leading enterprises? [Bagapova] None at all! The law draws no distinctions whatsoever between us and the banks subsidizing commercial structures. Everyone is put in the same category, but the most surprising part of the whole situation is the constant violation of the precept that a law cannot be applied retroactively. It is only in our country that they can make a decision today and name some time in the distant past as the date it went into effect. The credit regulating fund of the Russian Central Bank is a good example of this. It would seem to be a good thing to have a strong national financial reserve to cover unpaid loans. We thought so when were depositing 20 percent of the bank's receipts in this fund. Today around 20 billion rubles of just our funds are frozen there. The money is being kept in the fund to no one's benefit, and there has not been a single case in which anyone has used the deposited funds as insurance. It is not even possible to buy the money at the Russian Central Bank loan rate for subsequent use. [Saklakov] Is the possibility that common sense will prevail in our country someday our only hope? [Bagapova] We are waiting impatiently for this day. No one wants to follow orders today, but legal standards, particularly in the interrelations of commercial banks with the Russian Central Bank and, consequently, with the state, must be more explicit. People have implied that we are simply profiting from economic difficulties, but this is certainly not the case. The government and the new parliament cannot leave the banking structure to its own devices. We need the kind of laws that will allow the banks, as the circulatory system of the state, to function in a beneficial atmosphere, with only limited interaction, as partners, with the Russian Central Bank. [Saklakov] Please tell us about your work with your tens of thousands of private depositors. [Bagapova] The residents of Samara Oblast have deposited more than 25 billion rubles in the bank and its 18 branches. We want to open bank service centers wherever possible (including some on the grounds of enterprises), and we are expanding our network of branches. We are the only bank in the oblast to make cost-of-living adjustments in deposits, and we are doing this at our own expense. Our consumer credit operations are extensive, and we buy and sell privatization checks, stock, and other securities. The public appreciates our bank's use of all of the tactics and strategy of its financial operations to guarantee the safety of deposits. Suffice it to say that our reserve fund already exceeds our capital stock. This means that we can insure our clients against many unforeseen developments. [Saklakov] As I understand it, Daniya Zavdatovna, you readily offer services connected with foreign currency operations. [Bagapova] The bank was granted a general license by the Russian Central Bank for all types of foreign currency operations. Enterprises in Samara are active in business abroad, and we intend to help them in these operations. We already have an administration for foreign economic operations and a network of currency exchange centers. We hope to extend credit in foreign currency in the future. [Saklakov] What kind of relationship do you have with other banks? [Bagapova] The days when new banks were viewed as rivals or as dire enemies are over. After all, each bank has found its own niche in the financial system, and now we have to unite our efforts, exchange information, and agree on a common approach to problems. I personally feel that the goal of our bank should not be the attraction of more clients by any means possible, but competition for clients with services of higher quality. We lose many opportunities when we do not bother to inform the public of our views on economic issues. It is time for bankers to be represented in the government and in legislative spheres. [Saklakov] You come from a family of financial employees, and you know the traditions of this system. Do you sense a for technological changes in this field? [Bagapova] We are understandably dissatisfied with many aspects of bank operations. It has been a long time since personal computers on the desks of staff members were a novelty, and now we hope to sign a contract with the Swiss IBS firm on comprehensive automation. This will allow us to offer our clients better service, increase the number of services, and speed up our operations dramatically, so that transactions can be finalized in a single day. This system will unite the central office with bank branches and with trade and consumer service enterprises and pave the way for the use of credit cards in this country and abroad. We hope to develop a network of our own, and not only in our own region. We plan to open branches in 180 cities of the Russian Federation and the CIS countries. We are now analyzing financial flow charts in the interest of our clients, to determine different ways of making new business contacts.
