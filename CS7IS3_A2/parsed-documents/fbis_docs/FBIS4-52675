In a breakfast meeting with newspaper editors today, Deputy Prime Minister Yi Hong-ku predicted that positive progress [kungjongjogin chinjon] will be made in resolving the nuclear issue in the coming week and stressed: Although the replacement of fuel rods has been postponed, the sampling [sonjong], preservation [pogwan], and special measurement [tuksu kyechuk] of samples must be conducted without fail. Deputy Prime Minister Yi said: The government will no longer emphasize the importance of holding South-North dialogue ahead of U.S.-North Korean talks [sonhu kwangye-e chipchakhaji anul kosimyo], and is now focusing on North Korea's guarantee of nuclear transparency in resolving the issue. He stressed: The ROK and the United States firmly share the view that if North Korea possesses even half a nuclear weapon, it would be regarded as an act of nullifying the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
