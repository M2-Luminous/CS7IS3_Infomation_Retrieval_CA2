FR941130-2-00094 FR941130-2-00060 [Docket No. 50&hyph;219] GPU Nuclear Corp.; Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License No. DPR&hyph;16, issued to GPU Nuclear Corporation (the licensee), for operation of the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, located in Ocean County, New Jersey. Environmental Assessment Identification of the Proposed Action The proposed action would delete Technical Specification Section 2.3.0 and its associated bases. The amendment would remove the limiting safety system setting for a high recirculation flow reactor scram based on a maximum attainable recirculation flow analysis. The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application for amendment dated June 24, 1994, as supplemented by letter dated September 30, 1994. The Need for the Proposed Action The proposed action would delete the high recirculation flow scram setpoint of " 117% of rated flow since the licensee has analytically demonstrated that the flow scram setpoint is not necessary. Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed action and concludes that deletion of the high recirculation flow reactor scram based on a maximum attainable flow analysis performed by the licensee with respect to safety system settings and thermal safety limit analysis is acceptable. The change will not increase the probability or consequences of accidents, no changes are being made in the types of any effluents that may be released offsite, and there is no significant increase in the allowable individual or cumulative occupational radiation exposure. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed action. With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed action does involve features located entirely within the restricted area as defined in 10 CFR Part 20. It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents and has no other environmental impact. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed action. Alternatives to the Proposed Action Since the Commission has concluded there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed action, any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impact need not be evaluated. The principal alternative to the action would be to deny the request. Such action would not enhance the protection of the environment. Alternative Use of Resources This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement for the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station. Agencies and Persons Consulted The NRC staff consulted with the New Jersey State official regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action. The State official had no comments. Finding of No Significant Impact Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed action. For further details with respect to the proposed action, see the licensee's letter dated June 24 1994, as supplemented by letter dated September 30, 1994, which are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, and at the local public document room located at the Ocean County Library, Reference Department, 1001 Washington Street, Toms River, NJ 08753. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 22nd day of November 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Phillip F. McKee, Director, Project Directorate I&hyph;4, Division of Reactor Projects_I/II, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.
