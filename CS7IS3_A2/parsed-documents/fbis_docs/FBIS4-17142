Panova] Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the Federal Assembly [as heard], held a routine traditional roundtable in Moscow today. The journalists who assembled there learned about his views on a number of currently topical issues, specifically, on developing cooperation between CIS countries. [Begin Shumeyko recording] As chairman of the Council of Heads of State, the president has proposed drawing up a long-term plan. Two councils of ministers -- the Council of Foreign Ministers and the Council of Defense Ministers -- have been instructed to prepare an initial document, a draft plan for CIS development toward integration. [end recording] [Panova] In Vladimir Shumeyko's view, after such a plan is adopted, the CIS charter will be somewhat amended. [Begin Shumeyko recording] The point is that it was very clearly mentioned at the Council of Heads of State and at the Council of Heads of Government that members of the Commonwealth must not be in a state of war with each other. There is, perhaps, no other case in the whole world when members of the same commonwealth are fighting each other. I am speaking about Azerbaijan and Armenia. [end recording] [Panova] Regarding Russia joining the NATO Partnership for Peace program, Shumeyko stressed that a clear mechanism for implementing decisions is the main condition to be observed here.
