By March 1995, it will increase production capability for STN (super-twisted nematic) method color LCD to 50,000 a month (9.4 inch conversion), over three times the present. Color filters, which are a major product, previously have also only been produced for in-house use, but production will be increased because the supply shortage in the industry has become conspicuous, and it will embark on external sales. The total amount of facilities investment is about 3 billion yen for LCD and filters. Kyocera judges that high growth in the LCD market will continue in the future centering on personal computers and industrial machinery, and it will launch an offensive with the STN method, which is considered the company's forte. The company currently produces 15,000 STN method color LCD's (9.4 inch conversion) a month and 10,000 monochrome LCD's (9.4 inch conversion) a month at the Hayato plant (Hayato-cho, Kagoshima Prefecture). It will again introduce the newest production facilities, make an effort to improve yield, and increase color LCD's to 50,000 a month. Since it will maintain the current scale for the monochrome type, LCD's overall will expand from a monthly production of 25,000 to 60,000. The goal of sales in fiscal 1994 is 13 billion yen, 3.25 times the previous fiscal year. The TFT (thin film transistor) method, which has the special features of fast response and wide visual angle, has been noted for color LCD. However, Kyocera judges the demand for the STN method to be strongly rooted and niche segregation by use is proceeding, and they aim for a share expansion in the method. They also are studying enlargement of the production line next fiscal year if this production increase is on track. The amount of facilities investment in that case is estimated to be on a scale of 10 billion yen. Color filters are produced at the Sendai plant (Sendai, Kagoshima Prefecture). Currently, it supplies the total amount to its own company's LCD use. Beginning in March next year when the production increase is completed, the plan is to sell them outside at a pace of 15,000 a month (portion for 3,000 LCD). The chronic supply shortage in color filters is continuing and it judges that a steady demand can be anticipated.
