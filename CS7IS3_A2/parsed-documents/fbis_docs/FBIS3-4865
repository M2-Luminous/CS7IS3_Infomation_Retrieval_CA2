Hosokawa said he will make up his mind Wednesday on whether to push for shaking up his nearly seven-month-old cabinet after hearing final responses from leaders of the seven coalition parties to his scheme, the sources said. "I'd like to make a final decision (on the matter) during Wednesday after judging the situation as a whole," he said at a session of the House of Councillors' panel on political reform, which started deliberations on amendments to a package of political reform legislation. Hosokawa is eyeing the cabinet reshuffle possibly Thursday after the upper house panel has approved the amendments, the sources said. The primary purpose, it is widely believed, is to replace top government spokesman and chief of staff Masayoshi Takemura, who has been in discord with Hosokawa since late December over such important government political themes as the partial opening of the rice market and the abortive imposition of a "national welfare tax," the sources said. Takemura, the chief cabinet secretary, told Hosokawa in a meeting Tuesday that a cabinet reshuffle could lead to the collapse of the coalition government, other coalition sources said. Takemura maintains that he will not take another cabinet post if the premier reshapes his cabinet, they said. Among the coalition partners, a pessimistic view has begun to prevail that Hosokawa may have to give up the plan because of a tight Diet business schedule and strong opposition from three coalition blocs. Hosokawa and three cabinet ministers will make major policy speeches to both houses of the legislature after the cabinet submits to the Diet the 73.08 trillion yen state budget for fiscal 1994. The full upper house is expected to endorse the amendments to the political reform package designed to help clean up Japan's politics Thursday or Friday. The more powerful House of Representatives approved them Tuesday. Among the seven coalition parties, the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Sakigake (Harbinger), headed by Takemura, and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) are opposed to a hasty cabinet reshuffle, while Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and Komeito are endorsing the plan. In a series of talks with Hosokawa on Tuesday, SDP chairman Tomiichi Murayama asked the premier to drop his intention for an early shake-up, pointing to the need for the cabinet to be united to tackle economic issues such as strained economic ties with the United States and the enactment of the fiscal 1994 budget. Murayama, head of the largest coalition component, told Hosokawa that the party opposes the replacement of Takemura, warning that such action will damage the coalition foundation, the sources said. DSP chairman Keigo Ouchi, who serves as health and welfare minister, also expressed objection to a hasty cabinet reshuffle. Ouchi told reporters that the premier cited as a major reason for the plan growing complaints within the ruling coalition and from bureaucrats about Takemura's work as the top government spokesman and chief policy coordinator. Shinseito leader and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, meanwhile, told Hosokawa that the party will support the plan to reshape the cabinet. Hata told reporters he has notified Hosokawa of his backing in a meeting at the premier's official residence. "Behind the premier's plan is his desire to run the cabinet more smoothly. We support that kind of notion," said Hata, who is leading Shinseito along with Ichiro Ozawa. Ozawa, who is regarded as the coalition's chief strategist, has expressed support for Hosokawa's plan to reshuffle the cabinet.
