FR940426-1-00050 FR940426-1-00006 Section 6.100, Participation in Retailer Association Activities Section 6.100 permits industry members to participate in retailer association activities under certain circumstances. Paragraphs (b) and (d) permit rental of display booth space and purchase of tickets or payment of registration fees, respectively. Each of these paragraphs contains the phrase ``if *␣*␣* not excessive and *␣*␣* the same as paid by all exhibitors.'' ATF proposes amending the section to delete ``not excessive'' and specifying the fees must be the same as the fees paid by all exhibitors ``at that event.'' ATF also proposes raising the limitation for payments for advertisements in programs or brochures authorized by paragraph (e) from $100 to $500. Section 6.101, Merchandise Paragraph (a) currently provides that an industry member who also is engaged in business as a bona fide vendor of other merchandise may sell such merchandise to a retailer if three conditions are met, the first of which is that merchandise is ``sold at its fair market value.'' The petitioners believe, however, that ATF has no authority to regulate or condition legitimate marketing practices pertaining to bona fide sales of non-alcoholic beverage products. Accordingly, the petitioners recommend changing this condition to state that the merchandise is ``furnished, distributed, or sold according to the custom and practice of that business.'' The petitioners also recommend eliminating paragraph (b) regarding things of value covered in other sections of part 6 since they believe it is redundant and unnecessary in light of other sections of subpart D. ATF believes that the elimination of the phrase, ``*␣*␣* fair market value,'' from paragraph (a), as proposed by the petitioners, would result in an ambiguous regulation. The phrase is used in other parts of the regulations. The adoption of the phrase ``*␣*␣* custom and practice of that business,'' would be inconsistent and potentially confusing. Additionally, ATF believes that the elimination of paragraph (b) of this regulation would be a mistake. Paragraph (b) is a necessary clarifying paragraph for the section. As discussed above, §6.101 excepts from the prohibitions of section 105(b)(3) of the FAA Act sales transactions by industry members who are engaged in the business as bona fide vendors of other merchandise in addition to alcoholic beverages. This section sanctions sales of other merchandise to retailers in addition to alcoholic beverages if the merchandise is sold at its fair market value, not in combination with distilled spirits, wines, or malt beverages, and the merchandise is itemized separately on the industry member's invoices and other records. The records are necessary so that ATF can determine the real cost of the merchandise to the industry member and whether the industry member is reselling the merchandise to retailers at its fair market value. Likewise, ATF needs these records to determine whether the industry member is a bona fide vendor of the merchandise or whether it is using the merchandise as a means to induce. Accordingly, ATF is proposing to revise the records requirement of the regulation to state that, first, acquisition costs must appear on the industry member's purchase invoices (available upon request to ATF) and, second, the merchandise and the distilled spirits, wines, or malt beverages sold to the retailer in a single sales transaction must be itemized separately on the same invoice. Section 6.102, Outside Signs ATF is proposing a new section allowing outside signs in certain circumstances and with a $500 limit. 27 CFR Part 8, Exclusive Outlet New administrative provisions and definition changes were discussed previously. Section 8.23, Third Party Arrangements The current regulation can be interpreted to mean that a violation of the section could occur if a third party requires the retailer to use an industry member's product without the knowledge of the industry member. ATF proposes clarifying that the industry member's requirement, by agreement or otherwise, with a third party is necessary to violate this section. However, the requirement need not originate with the industry member. If the industry member knows or is aware that the third party controlling the retailer extends such a requirement with respect to the products of the industry member making payments under the arrangement, and the industry member avails itself of such requirement, then the requirement within the proscription of the FAA Act is present.
