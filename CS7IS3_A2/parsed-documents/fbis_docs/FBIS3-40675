M. Khusro: "Direct Foreign Investment"] [Text] Recent policy reforms in India have given substantial facilities and freedoms to foreign investors, including a 51 percent access to equity in Indian firms and management control, along with other concessions. But the demand for more and more concessions continues and the actual foreign investment flow, though larger, is well below the $1 billion mark. There are many factors which influence and attract foreign investment, such as security, profitability, lower tax rates, avoidance of double taxation, percentage of equity permitted, freedom to manage corporate enterprises, expectations about customs and excise duties and freedom to repatriate dividends and capital. But these and many other factors do not have the same weight: some factors may have a weight of one percent in the investors' reckoning while others may have a 30 percent weight. This aspect is neglected by analysts and even by investors themselves. In the case of India, while many of these factors have moved in the direction of greater facilities and freedoms, what is compelling in investors' decision-making and should weigh much more than other factors in (a) the security aspect and (b) the profitability. Analysts within India go by the feel for policy reform while foreign investors, not knowing the atmosphere too well, go by stark logic. Within the country, one knows that most of the new economic policies, if not all, are non-reversible. All political parties which have a chance of running the government in the foreseeable future are committed to policy reform, including liberalisation, deregulation and globalisation. In their election manifestos, all parties, except those on the extreme left, have favoured liberalisation and globalisation though, for political reasons, they may momentarily oppose this or that aspect of the new policies. The moment one abstracts from the temporary politics of economics, it becomes clear that the new policies cannot be reversed: no one is going to make the rupee non-convertible on trade account; only the market will change the external value of the rupee and the market has already signalled that the rupee is stable. The new trends of export growth--a 25 percent increase in dollar terms within six months--point out the strengthening of the rupee. And the foreign exchange reserves which increased from $1 billion to $8 billion--within two years--also run in the same direction. No one is going to bring Rs.2,000 crore in the budget to provide export subsidies once again. Industrial licensing took nearly 40 years to build and once demolished in the last two years, no one is going to replace the delicensed system with a licensed and, therefore, controlled system. Once people taste the freedoms of decontrol, they do not vote for controls so easily. No one is going to argue for higher import duties, high excise and high tax rates, nor would any government feel competent in the foreseeable future to nationalise the Indian public enterprises. Those who know the milieu, know that the future will not favour nationalisation but denationalisation and privatisation, not higher but lower direct taxes, not larger customs and excise duties but smaller ones. If foreign investors have been allowed a 51 percent access to Indian equity, this proportion can only increase in the future and not decrease. In other words, foreign investors can expect with certainty a greater liberalisation rather than its reversal and a move towards globalisation rather than an inward-looking shift. As for security of foreign investment, it is known to all that India has never defaulted on repayment or repatriation of capital or on the payment of interest and dividend. Foreign financial institutions, including the World Bank, which have rated the countries of the world according to national purchasing power, have ranked India in the fifth or the sixth position, with all the changes that have recently been made and the policy improvements that have been brought about. It is astonishing that international reckoners like MOODY, have not revised India's rating upwards, so much so that one suspects a degree of bias in these ratings. No wonder that investors are ignoring these ratings and are no longer sitting on the fence--with the result that each day that passes brings an announcement of one foreign company or another actually coming in with an investment thus capitalising on industrial approvals already given. As for the expanionist market, it is clear that the market prospects in other countries, with the possible exception of China, are incomparably better in India and that should be the prime consideration for foreign investors. One of our distinguished analysts, a former Governor of the RBI, an illustrious civil servant and a former Ambassador to the United States, the late L.K. Jha, addressed the German industrialists at the Hanover fair in 1984 and gave them a peep into the future. India's GNP, Jha said, was $175 billion in 1984 and, given its established rate of growth, would stand around $230 billion, or more, in 1994 (at the 1984 value). It is known that about 10 percent of it is spent on durable consumer goods and, at that rate, about $23 billion worth of durable consumer goods should be expected annually to be in demand in 1994 and beyond. German industrialists, Jha said, could plan to take advantage of this huge development and participate in meeting the increased demand either directly or through investment and technologies relevant to that demand. Nothing that Jha said has been controverted in these ten years and the scene, in fact, looks even better. As for the security of the regime, which foreign investors and analysts sometimes talk about, it should be noted that people confuse the stability of a particular political party with the stability of the country. All changes of government--six or seven of them--since Independence, have been smooth and impressive. All the political parties are committed to reform except for momentary opposition, often to embarrass the government and not to actually press for a policy reversal. In any case, the recent elections in some northern states of the country would seem to confirm that even the party ruling at the Centre at present has no fear of being removed from power even though it would not matter for the stability of economic policies if it did yield to another political party. All in all, the dominant factors for foreign investment--the expected direction of policy, the security, and the profitability in a rapidly expanding market--are the factors whose weight is far bigger than the sum total of other items of reckoning which influence foreign investment. And, as these are at a highly satisfactory level and are moving in the right direction, one can safely forecast that foreign investment will expand rapidly hereafter.
