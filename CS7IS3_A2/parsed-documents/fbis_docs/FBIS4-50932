Delegation leader Perricos Demetrius said that technical discussions with North Korean officials are expected to last two to four days and that all five IAEA inspectors hope to be coming out together. The three-member IAEA team arrived in Pyongyang last week and immediately reported that refueling of the 5-megawatt Yongbyon experimental nuclear reactor had begun. It is widely believed that discussions will center on allowing the IAEA to inspect and measure fuel rods in order to ascertain whether or not any fuel has been diverted to a suspected nuclear weapons program. The arrival of the two IAEA inspectors coincides with renewed talks at the United Nations in New York concerning the 15-month nuclear impasse between the U.S. and North Korea.
