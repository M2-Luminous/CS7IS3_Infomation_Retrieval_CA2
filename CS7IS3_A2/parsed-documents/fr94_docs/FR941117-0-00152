(b) Licensees may use any channel pair from the assigned channel block at any of their transmitter locations, subject to the prior coordination requirements of §22.907. §22.907 Coordination of channel usage. Licensees in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service must coordinate, with the appropriate parties, channel usage at each transmitter location within 121 kilometers (75 miles) of any transmitter locations authorized to other licensees or proposed by tentative selectees or other applicants, except those with mutually exclusive applications. (a) Licensees must cooperate and make reasonable efforts to resolve technical problems that may inhibit effective and efficient use of the cellular radio spectrum; however, licensees are not obligated to suggest extensive changes to or redesign other licensees' cellular systems. Licensees must make reasonable efforts to avoid blocking the growth of other cellular systems that are likely to need additional capacity in the future. (b) If technical problems are addressed by an agreement or operating arrangement between the licensees that would result in a reduction of quality or capacity of either system, the licensees must notify the FCC by letter. §22.909 Cellular markets. Cellular markets are standard geographic areas used by the FCC for administrative convenience in the licensing of cellular systems. Cellular markets comprise Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) and Rural Service Areas (RSAs). All cellular markets and the counties they comprise are listed in Public Notice Report No. CL&hyph;92&hyph;40 ``Common Carrier Public Mobile Services Information, Cellular MSA/RSA Markets and Counties'', dated January 24, 1992, DA 92&hyph;109, 7 FCC Rcd 742 (1992). (a) MSAs. Metropolitan Statistical Areas are 306 areas, including New England County Metropolitan Areas and the Gulf of Mexico Service Area (water area of the Gulf of Mexico, border is the coastline), defined by the Office of Management and Budget, as modified by the FCC. (b) RSAs. Rural Service Areas are 428 areas, other than MSAs, established by the FCC.
