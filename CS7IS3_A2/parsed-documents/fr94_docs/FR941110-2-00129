FR941110-2-00129 FR941110-2-00078 II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change At its January 1994 meeting, the NASD Board of Governors approved the issuance of a Notice to Members soliciting comments on amendments to the foreign associate provisions in Part X of Schedule C to the NASD By-Laws. These proposed amendments would substantially conform NASD requirements for ``foreign finders'' to certain interpretations under New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Rule 345 recently approved by the Commission in SEC Rel. No. 34&hyph;32431; File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;92&hyph;33. These amendments would permit the payment of transaction-related compensation to non-registered foreign finders who are not subject to the jurisdiction of U.S. securities laws, subject to certain disclosure and recordkeeping requirements by the U.S. broker-dealer. The proposed amendment to Part VI of Schedule C of the NASD By-Laws is limited in application only to compensation arrangements that involve foreign (i.e., non-U.S. citizens) finders who are domiciled abroad and customers who are not U.S. citizens or U.S. institutions that are also domiciled abroad. Additionally, as one of the conditions under the proposed interpretation, customers must acknowledge receipt of information, in the form of a descriptive document, regarding the compensation arrangement. If all the specified conditions of the proposed interpretation are met, members may pay transaction-related compensation to nonregistered foreign finders based on the business of non-U.S. customers that the finders refer to the member. The proposed amendment would also require member firms to verify that these foreign finders are not subject to a disqualification as defined in Article II, Section 4 of the NASD By-Laws. While the foreign finders' sole involvement would be the initial referral to a member or a member organization, compensation could be made on an ongoing basis and tied to such variables as the level of business generated or assets under control. All accounts referred by such foreign finders would be carried on the books of the member. The proposed amendment will allow member organizations the opportunity to enhance their competitive position in foreign countries where new accounts are routinely opened on a referral basis with ongoing compensation. The proposed amendment to Part X of Schedule C of the By-Laws would allow members to continue to use Part X to register Foreign Associates with the NASD but would require members to file Form U&hyph;4 to register such persons. The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(6) of the Act in that the proposed changes to Parts VI and X of Schedule C of the By-Laws will impose substantial regulatory requirements on the relationship between members and foreign finders while at the same time allowing members to use foreign finders to expand the members' business opportunities overseas. (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition The NASD does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended. (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others The Association received 7 letters commenting on Notice to Members 94&hyph;6, the proposed amendments to the Interpretation. The commenters include the Securities Industry Association (SIA), two law firms, and four broker-dealers. Below is a summary of the more significant and/or recurring issues raised in the letters and the NASD's position in connection with the same. One letter dealt with the narrow issue of whether the drafting of the foreign associate provisions inadvertently conflicted with the provisions of SEC Rule 15a&hyph;6. The NASD does not believe the amended proposal conflicts with Rule 15a&hyph;6. Of the remaining six letters, one was from the SIA and another from counsel representing five large, full service member firms. All of these comment letters supported the NASD's attempt to comport its requirements to the disclosure provisions of the interpretation to NYSE Rule 345, but opposed both the requirement to include foreign finders under the definition of foreign associates and the provision subjecting such persons to full U&hyph;4 registration. The commenters argued that foreign finders are not associated persons of a member. The commenters noted that, if NASD rules required such persons to file U&hyph;4 registration documents, the foreign finders would likely refuse to do so and would redirect their business to foreign broker-dealers and banks. Such a result would contradict the purpose of the NYSE interpretation which was designed to permit U.S. broker-dealers to be more competitive in global markets where finding arrangements are common practice. The commenters also noted that it would be very difficult, if not impossible, for NASD members to exert meaningful supervision over foreign finders even if they did file U&hyph;4 registration documents, because these individuals and firms view themselves as independent contractors not otherwise subject to supervision of the broker-dealer. Furthermore, the filing of such documents through a firm may raise regulatory, tax and other issues in the country of domicile for the foreign finders and increase the overall burden of regulation of member firms. The NASD Board of Governors (``Board'') found the commenters' arguments persuasive and developed a different approach to the foreign finder issue. In keeping with a recommendation from counsel for the five large member firms, the Board determined to include foreign finders under the portion of Schedule C that identifies persons exempt from registration and to incorporate the information disclosure requirements of the interpretation to NYSE Rule 345 into the section. The Board also added a provision requiring firms to take reasonable steps to assure that foreign finders are not subject to the disqualification provisions of Article II, Section 4 of the NASD By-Laws. The Board also decided it is important to coordinate its activities with the NYSE to ensure consistency in the NASD's requirements with those of the NYSE. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission will: A. By order approve such proposed rule change, or B. Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. IV.
