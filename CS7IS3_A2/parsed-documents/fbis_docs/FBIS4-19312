Hurd invited President Kim Yong-sam to visit London during his one-hour talk with Han. Han explained recent developments after the UN Security Council issued a statement calling on North Korea to permit nuclear inspections, including Kim's summits in Japan and China and his own trip to the two countries, the United States and Russia, and his meeting with Hans Blix, director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The foreign minister elaborated on Seoul's decisions to withdraw its demand for an inter-Korean exchange of envoys as a precondition to further high-level Pyongyang-Washington talks and to accommodate North Korean loggers fleeing from Siberian camps. London expressed "a full understanding" of Seoul's new measures as well as hope that the nuclear issue would now be resolved. Han thanked Hurd for Britain's support in handling the nuclear problem on the international stage, to which Hurd responded with a promise of continued cooperation. The British secretary said his government welcomes a visit by President Kim anytime. Han met British strategy experts later in the evening to further discuss the nuclear issue and is scheduled to speak at a lunch Saturday sponsored by a non-governmental body, the Korea-Britain Forum.
