Since its establishment in 1991, the fund has taken over state property worth 576 billion Kc, including 148.5 billion Kc worth of property in the second wave of privatization, which ends this spring. --Revenues. Between 1991 and 1993, the fund's revenues amounted to more than 54 billion Kc through large-scale privatization, including more than 23 billion Kc generated through selling shares in companies, 18 billion Kc through direct sales of companies and other revenues generated through public auctions and competitions. Small-scale privatization generated more than 36 billion Kc in revenues. The fund has deposited 20 billion Kc of that sum into the Ceska sporitelna savings bank, with the interest being used to privatize the country's health system. --Expenses. The fund has paid out almost 43 billion Kc on large-scale privatization since its founding, spending more than half of this sum in 1992 on bond purchases to pay off the debts of formerly state-owned enterprises. It also spent almost 4 billion Kc on small-scale privatization, mainly on liquidating state enterprises and helping municipal budgets. --Receivables. The fund requires entities that wish to buy property from it to make an advance payment of 10 percent of the final price. Various buyers currently owe the agency 6.5 billion Kc for the acquisition of 240 enterprises. The fund has already filed suits against 93 of these debtors, who owe a total of almost 2 billion Kc. --Foreign investment. Almost 41 percent of the fund's total revenues, amounting to 22 billion Kc, came from abroad. But the share of foreign investors declined in 1993. --Self-assessment. Fund Chairman Tomas Jezek says the fund has "the worst behind it," because the coupon privatization process is ending this spring with its second wave. There will not be a third wave, Jezek says, since there is basically nothing left to be privatized in this country. But fund officials note that entities interested in buying companies from the agency are facing increasing problems in obtaining money from banks, which have become more cautious.
