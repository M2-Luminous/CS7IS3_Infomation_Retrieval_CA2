He was seen off at Ankara's Esenboga Airport by President Suleyman Demirel. General Dogan Gures, chief of the General Staff; State Minister Cemil Erhan; Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin; and Veysel Atasoy, energy and natural resources minister, were also at the airport. Mubarak and Demirel made statements to the media at Esenboga Airport and answered questions. In his statement, Mubarak said that bilateral relations and cooperation in various fields were discussed during the talks. Noting that regional and international issues were also assessed, the Egyptian president remarked that Bosnia-Herzegovina and other topics, especially the Middle East, were the subjects of discussion. Turkey and Egypt reached agreement on all issues of focus, Mubarak announced. He stressed that Egypt also shares Turkey's long-standing views regarding the protection of Iraq's territorial integrity. From now on, Mubarak explained, the visits between Turkey and Egypt can be held naturally, without adherence to rules of protocol. In reply to a question on whether Turkey was asked to play a special role concerning Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, Mubarak said that Egypt has diplomatic relations with Israel and did not submit any demands to Turkey in this regard. Mubarak remarked: There is no problem between Egypt and Israel that needs mediation. The Egyptian president declared that if necessary consultations can be conducted with Turkey on any subject. In his statement, Demirel declared that the talks conducted during Mubarak's visit demonstrated the great scope of the potential for the development of Turkish-Egyptian relations. This visit also showed what can be squeezed into one day, Demirel noted. The president went on: If peace prevails in our region, this will benefit everyone. To achieve this, Turkey and Egypt -- the two big countries in the region -- will exert every possible effort. In actual fact, as the two big countries in the region, we hold ourselves responsible for the establishment of peace in this area as soon as possible. We hold ourselves morally responsible. Therefore, we will certainly exert joint efforts for the successful outcome of the Middle East peace conference. Actually, Mr. Mubarak has played an immense role in this regard and will continue to do so. We hope that this matter will yield results this year and new horizons will be opened for the region. Pointing out that Mubarak's visit created new horizons for the relations between the two countries, Demirel pledged that Turkey and Egypt will continue to make contributions both to their own people and to the people in the region.
