Kinkel intends to hold "consultations" with Foreign Ministers Luik (Estonia), Andrejevs (Latvia), and Gylys (Lithuania) in early March. The invitation has to be seen in connection with the increasing feeling in the Baltic countries of being under threat from Russia. Kinkel intends to discuss with the Baltic ministers how their countries can be brought closer to the European Union. Germany is trying to extend the mandate for negotiations, which the Brussels Commission adopted in December. So far, the mandate provides for negotiations on a free trade agreement. Kinkel wants to achieve that, comparable to existing Europe treaties with other countries, the agreement should at least contain "prospects" for later accession to the European Union. The Federal Government is worried about developments in Russia. There is lack of clarity in Bonn about the shift of balance in connection with the establishment of the new government in Moscow. Statements by Foreign Minister Kozyrev according to which Russia has "basic vital interests" in the other successor states to the former Soviet Union, the "CIS," and the Baltics, were regarded in Bonn at least as requiring clarification, even after Moscow sources said that the statement was "quoted in a distorted way." Hungary and Washington have also expressed concern. On Tuesday night, U.S. President Clinton and Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl held extensive discussions on the telephone about Clinton's talks in Moscow and and his talks with Syrian President Al-Asad in Geneva. Clinton was obviously not yet aware of the situation after the resignation from the government of the reformers around Deputy Prime Minister Gaydar. In coordination with Clinton, Kohl is currently trying to get Yeltsin on the telephone to ask him about the determination of the course of the future government. Sources in Bonn have stated that, like Clinton, Kohl continues to bank on Yeltsin. Owing to the insecure situation in Russia, the Federal Government is particularly interested in the compliance with the agreements regulating the withdrawal of the Russian Forces from eastern Germany.
