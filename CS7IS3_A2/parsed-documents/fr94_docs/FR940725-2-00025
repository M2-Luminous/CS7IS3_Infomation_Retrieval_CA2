FR940725-2-00025 FR940725-2-00015 [Project Nos. 2390&hyph;003, 2395&hyph;003, 2421&hyph;003, 2473&hyph;002, 2475&hyph;006, and 2640&hyph;010 Flambeau River, WI Northern States Power Co., et al.; Intention to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement and Conduct Public Scoping Meetings July 19, 1994. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has received applications for six new licenses for the continued operation of the Big Falls Water Power Project No. 2390; the Pixley Project No. 2395, the Lower Hydro Project No. 2421, the Crowley Project No. 2473, the Thornapple Project No. 2475, and the Upper Hydro Project No. 2640. The projects are located on the Flambeau River. The projects are located in Rusk, Price, and Ashland Counties, Wisconsin. The FERC staff has determined that licensing these projects would constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Therefore, the staff intends to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) on the hydroelectric projects in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act. The staff's EIS will objectively consider both sites Specific and cumulative environmental effects of the projects and reasonable alternatives, and will include an economic, financial and engineering analysis. A draft EIS will be issued and circulated for review by all interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EIS will be analyzed by the staff and considered in a final EIS. The staff's conclusions and recommendations will then be presented for the consideration of the Commission in reaching its final licensing decisions. Scoping Meetings FERC staff will conduct two scoping meetings. The evening scoping meeting is primarily for public input while the day-time meeting will focus on resource agency and non-governmental organization (NGO) concerns. All interested individuals, organizations, and agencies are invited to attend and assist the staff in identifying the scope of environmental issues that should be analyzed in the EIS. To help focus discussion, a preliminary scoping document outlining subject areas to be addressed at the meeting will be distributed by mail to interested parties on the FERC mailing list. Copies of the preliminary scoping document will also be available at the scoping meetings. The public scoping meeting which will be conducted by staff will be held at 7:00 p.m. on August 16, 1994, at the Park Falls Public Library, 410 Division Street, Park Falls, Wisconsin. The agency meeting will be held at 9:00 a.m. on August 17, 1994, at the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Office at 875 South 4th Avenue, Park Falls, Wisconsin. Objectives At the scoping meetings, the staff will: (1) Summarize the environmental issues tentatively identified for analysis in the planned EIS; (2) solicit from the meeting participants all available information, especially quantifiable data, on the resources at issue, (3) encourage statements from experts and the public on issues that should be analyzed in the EIS, including viewpoints in opposition to, or in support of, the staff's preliminary views, (4) determine the relative depth of analysis for issues to be addressed in the EIS, and (5) identify resource issues that are not important and do not require detailed analysis. Procedures The meetings will be recorded by a stenographer and will become part of the formal record of the Commission proceeding on the Flambeau River Projects under consideration. Individuals presenting statements at the meetings will be asked to sign in before the meeting starts and to clearly identify themselves for the record. Individuals, organizations, and agencies with environmental expertise and concerns are encouraged to attend the meetings and to assist the staff in defining and clarifying the issues to be addressed in the EIS. Participants wishing to make oral comments in the public meeting are asked to keep them to five minutes to allow everyone the opportunity to speak. Persons choosing not to speak at the meetings, but who have views on the issues, may submit written statements for inclusion in the public record at the meeting. In addition, written scoping comments may be filed with the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE, Washington, DC 20426. All correspondence should clearly show one or more of the following captions on the first page: Big Falls Project No. 2390&hyph;003; Pixley Project No. 2395&hyph;003; Lower Project No. 2421&hyph;003; Crowley Project No. 2473&hyph;002; Thornapple Project No. 2475&hyph;006; and, Upper Project No. 2640&hyph;010.
