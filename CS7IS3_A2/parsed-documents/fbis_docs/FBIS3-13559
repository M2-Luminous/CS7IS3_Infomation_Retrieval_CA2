Our police affairs correspondent Uri-Kohen Aharonov has just returned from the site and brings us his report: Tonight was yet another phase in the action by the authorities against extremist elements in Israel. Following a series of administrative arrests and weapons confiscations, particularly among settlers in the territories, police detectives tonight acted against the two big centers of the Kahana Hay and Kakh movements in Jerusalem. They locked the offices of Kahana Hay on Agrippas Street with chains, leaving a closure order signed by the police commissioner on the door, and then proceeded to the offices of Kakh on Usishkin Street. In the closure order, the police commissioner wrotes that based on Article 6 of the Antiterror Act of 1948 he finds that these two centers constitute bases of terrorist organizations and consequently orders their closure for a period of six months as of this evening, 15 March 1994. We learned from police sources tonight that other measures may be taken tomorrow.
