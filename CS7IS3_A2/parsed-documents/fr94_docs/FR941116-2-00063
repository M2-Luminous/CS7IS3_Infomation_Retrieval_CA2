FR941116-2-00063 FR941116-2-00050 INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION [Investigation No. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;683; Final] Fresh Garlic From the People's Republic of China Determination On the basis of the record 1 developed in the subject investigation, the Commission determines, pursuant to section 735(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. ยง1673d(b)) (the Act), that the industry in the United States producing fresh garlic 2 is materially injured by reason of imports from the People's Republic of China (China) of fresh garlic, as defined by the Department of Commerce (Commerce), that have been found by Commerce to be sold in the United States at less than fair value (LTFV). 3, 14 The Commission also determines, pursuant to section 735(b)(4)(a), that critical circumstances do not exist such that it is necessary to impose the duty retroactively. 1 The record is defined in sec. 207.2(f) of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 CFR ยง207.2(f)). 2 Defined as garlic that has been manually harvested and is intended for use as fresh produce. 3 For purposes of this investigation, Commerce has defined ``fresh garlic'' as all grades of garlic, whole or separated into constituent cloves, whether or not peeled, fresh, chilled, frozen, provisionally preserved, or packed in water or other neutral substance, but not prepared or preserved by the addition of other ingredients or by heat processing, the foregoing used principally as a food product and for seasoning. Fresh garlic is provided for in subheadings 0703.20.00, 0710.80.70, 0710.80.97, 0711.90.60, and 2005.90.95 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, 4 Commissioner Crawford finds one like product corresponding to the scope of this investigation as defined by Commerce, and finds that the industry in the United States producing garlic is materially injured by reason of LTFV imports from the People's Republic of China. Chairman Watson, Vice Chairman Nuzum, and Commissioners Bragg, Rohr, and Newquist find that the industry in the United States producing dehy garlic 5 is not materially injured or threatened with material injury, and the establishment of an industry in the United States is not materially retarded, by reason of LTFV imports from China. 6 Chairman Watson, Vice Chairman Nuzum, and Commissioners Bragg, Rohr, and Newquist also find that the industry in the United States producing seed garlic 7 is not materially injured or threatened with material injury, and the establishment of an industry in the United States is not materially retarded, by reason of LTFV imports from China. 8 5 Defined as garlic that has been mechanically harvested and that is primarily, but not exclusively, destined for non-fresh use. 6 Because Commissioner Crawford finds one like product corresponding to the scope of this investigation as defined by Commerce, she does not make a separate injury finding for this industry. 7 Defined as garlic that has been specially prepared and cultivated prior to planting and then harvested and otherwise prepared for use as seed. 8 Because Commissioner Crawford finds one like product corresponding to the scope of this investigation as defined by Commerce, she does not make a separate injury finding for this industry. Background The Commission instituted this investigation effective July 11, 1994, following a preliminary determination by the Department of Commerce that imports of fresh garlic from China were being sold at LTFV within the meaning of section 733(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. ยง1673b(b)). Notice of the institution of the Commission's investigation and of a public hearing to be held in connection therewith was given by posting copies of the notice in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington, DC, and by publishing the notice in the Federal Register of August 3, 1994 (59 F.R. 39674). The hearing was held in Washington, DC, on September 27, 1994, and all persons who requested the opportunity were permitted to appear in person or by counsel. The Commission transmitted its determination in this investigation to the Secretary of Commerce on November 7, 1994. The views of the Commission are contained in USITC Publication 2825 (November 1994), entitled ``Fresh Garlic from the People's Republic of China: Investigation No. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;683 (Final).'' Issued: November 7, 1994. By order of the Commission. Donna R. Koehnke, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;28279 Filed 11&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7020&hyph;02&hyph;P
