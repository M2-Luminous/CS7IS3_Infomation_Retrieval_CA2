Alumina-zirconia stands out among traditional materials in having high hardness and resistance to wear. These properties also make it make it difficult to machine components made of these substances and for this reason they are shaped directly by the Stepanov method of controlled crystal growth which requires no further mechanical handling. It was previously demonstrated that ceramic eutectics of the title composition, as prepared by the Stepanov method, may be used as structural materials, although mechanical testing demonstrated poor consistency in properties. Bending stress, for example, varied from 100 to 500 MPa. This low reproducibility in properties evidently results from contamination of the melt with carbon from the graphite heating zone. In the present work a study of the effects of the graphite heating elements on the composition of alumina-zirconia-ytterbia melts was made and certain measures are presented for lowering carbon contamination.
