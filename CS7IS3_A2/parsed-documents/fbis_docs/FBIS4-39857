Meeting journalists at Tehran's airport upon his arrival, Muradov said that Iran and Turkmenistan have "very good" relations and called for their development, including between the parliaments of the two countries. Iranian Parliament Chairman 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri welcomed Muradov's visit as useful for stepping up the implementation of previous bilateral agreements. Muradov and Nateq-Nuri will discuss among other things the construction of a gas pipeline from Turkmenistan to Europe via Iran. The agreement to this effect was reached earlier and confirmed by the Iranian and Turkmen presidents during their one-day meeting in the Iranian city of Mehrabad in late May.
