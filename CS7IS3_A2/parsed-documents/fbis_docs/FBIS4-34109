The decision was reached during a meeting between the Central American presidents, just hours before leaving together for this Colombian City, to attend the Fourth Ibero-American Summit. The Nicaraguan leader did not disclose the details of the agreement. In her speech before the 21 other participating leaders, Violeta Barrios fiercely defended the privatization process, while downplaying the poverty situation in Latin America, particularly in Nicaragua. In an address tainted by many diction errors and mistaken names and places, the leader used the better part of the seven minutes granted to each president, to overestimate the Nicaraguan democratic situation.
