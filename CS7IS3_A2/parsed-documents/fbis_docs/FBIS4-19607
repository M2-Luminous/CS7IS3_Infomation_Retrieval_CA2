David Kyd said the inspection could begin before the end of the month as the IAEA wants it to be accomplished as soon as possible since the UN Security Council wants a report on the matter in May. He added that if Pyongyang agrees to the new inspections, the IAEA investigators would be ready to leave by next week. Pyongyang refused in March to allow an IAEA team from gathering crucial samples at a facility in Yongbyon suspected of producing weapons-grade plutonium. The IAEA then voted to ask the UN Security Council to take up the issue of North Korea's obstinate refusal to allow inspections of its nuclear sites but stopped short of calling for sanctions against Pyongyang. Kyd said that the current negotiations are not focussing on the controversial sites involved in the last visit by the inspectors.
