The media war, which is undoubtedly being waged against our country, had helped dismember former Yugoslavia, Milosevic said during a talk with Gallois and Analis, who also comes from France where he currently lives, the presidential office said in a statement. Milosevic and his guests, who are on a several-day visit to Yugoslavia at the invitation of the Yugoslav Government, agreed that it was a primary moral duty of all conscientious intellectuals to stand up against such manipulation with public opinion. Gallois expressed to President Milosevic his support for the efforts Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are making to secure a stable peace in the territory of former Yugoslavia. The French general, a prominent fighter against fascism in the Second World War and former chief of the French General Staff, also expressed his strong disagreement with the policy of pressures and sanctions of the international community against the Serbian people. The resoluteness of Serbia and its citizens to persist in protecting their legitimate interests set an example to the countries which strive to equality-based relations among states and peoples and which are determined to defend their freedom and independence, the guests from France said. The statement said Gallois and Analis had promised Milosevic to continue to openly urge the affirmation of truth on the crisis in former Yugoslavia.
