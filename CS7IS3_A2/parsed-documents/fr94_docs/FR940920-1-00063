FR940920-1-00063 FR940920-1-00007 Regarding the third issue, the MWC regulations are complex, and the EPA expects to receive numerous comments on this proposal. The EPA has specifically requested comments on items fundamental to the proposal, including but not limited to the MACT floor, MACT performance levels, and materials separation plans. X. Administrative Requirements This section addresses the following administrative requirements: public hearing, docket, procedural requirements of the Act, Office of Management and Budget review, and Regulatory Flexibility Act compliance. A. Public Hearing A public hearing will be held 15 days following proposal. The public hearing will discuss the proposed standards in accordance with section 307(d)(5) of the Act. Persons wishing to make oral presentations at the public hearing should contact the EPA at the address given in the ADDRESSES section of this preamble. Oral presentations will be limited to 15 minutes each. Any member of the public may file a written statement before, during, or within 30 days after the hearing. Written statements should be mailed to the Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center at the address given in the ADDRESSES section of this preamble. A verbatim transcript of the hearing and written statements will be available for public inspection and copying during normal working hours at the EPA's Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center in Washington, DC (see ADDRESSES section of this preamble). B. Docket The docket is an organized and complete file of all the information submitted to or otherwise considered in the development of this proposed rulemaking. The principal purposes of the docket are: (1) To allow interested parties to identify and locate documents so that they can effectively participate in the rulemaking process; and (2) to serve as the record in case of judicial review, except for interagency review material (section 307(d)(7)(A)) of the Act. The docket number for this rulemaking is A&hyph;90&hyph;45. Docket No. A&hyph;89&hyph;08 also includes background information for this rulemaking that supported the proposal and promulgation of the subpart Ea NSPS. C. Clean Air Act Procedural Requirements The following procedural requirements of the Act are addressed: administrative listing, periodic review, external participation, and economic impact assessment. 1. Administrator Listing_Sections 111 and 129 of the Act As prescribed by section 111 of the Act, establishment of standards of performance for MWC's is based on the Administrator's determination (52 FR 25399, July 7, 1987) that these sources contribute significantly to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. Additionally, section 129 of the Act of 1990 directs the Administrator to promulgate revised NSPS for new MWC's. 2. Periodic Review_Sections 111 and 129 of the Act Sections 111 and 129 of the Act require that the regulation be reviewed not later than 5 years following the initial promulgation. At that time and at 5-year intervals thereafter, the Administrator shall review the regulation and revise it if necessary. This review will include an assessment of such factors as the need for integration with other programs, the existence of alternative methods, enforceability, improvements in emission control technology, and reporting requirements. 3. External Participation In accordance with section 117 of the Act, publication of this proposal was preceded by consultation with appropriate advisory committees, independent experts, and Federal departments and agencies. The Administrator welcomes comments on all aspects of the proposal, including economic and technological issues. 4. Economic Impact Assessment Section 317A of the Act requires the EPA to prepare an economic impact assessment for any NSPS promulgated under section 111(b) of the Act. An economic impact assessment was prepared for the proposed standards. In the manner described in sections III, IV, V, and VI of this preamble regarding the impacts of and rationale for the proposed standards, the EPA considered all aspects of the economic impact assessment in proposing the standards. The economic impact assessment is included in the list of key technical documents at the beginning of today's notice under SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION . D. Office of Management and Budget Reviews 1. Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements in this proposed rule have been submitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. An Information Collection Request (ICR) document has been prepared by the EPA (ICR No. 1506.03) and a copy may be obtained from Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch (2136), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW, Washington, DC 20460 or by calling (202) 260&hyph;2740. This collection of information is estimated to have an average annual reporting burden of about 0.81 person years per recordkeeper (MWC facility). Very small MWC plants with capacities between 25 and 35 Mg/day will have a smaller burden. These plants would only be required to submit reports of notification of construction, anticipated startup date, and actual startup date. Small MWC plants with capacities between 35 and 225 Mg/day would incur the greatest burden as a result of today's proposed standards. The reporting and recordkeeping burden for these plants would include initial and annual testing and reporting of emissions of PM, Pb, Cd, Hg, dioxins/furans, and HC1; SO 2 and CO CEMS demonstration and reporting; preparation of a site selection analysis report, and other requirements. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information Policy Branch (2136), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW, Washington, DC 20460, and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for the EPA.'' The final rule will address any comments on the information collection requirements contained in this proposal. 2. Executive Order 12866 Review Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the EPA must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'', and therefore, subject to the OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant'' regulatory action as one that is likely to lead to a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities; (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;
