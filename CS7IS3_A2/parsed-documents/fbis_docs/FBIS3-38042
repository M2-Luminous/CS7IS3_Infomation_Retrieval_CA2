Power Politics Is a Tough Business. West Creates Image of `Willful Russia'"] [Excerpts] Washington D.C., 23 Feb -- The U.S. capital, nestling cozily on the banks of the Potomac River, has not experienced such an outburst of passions over spying for a long time. Evening newspaper editions, television news broadcasts, statements by administration officials, including the president himself, and commentaries by observers and congressmen -- everything on Tuesday [22 February] was devoted to the arrest of FBI agent and CIA officer Aldrich Ames [as published] and his wife. [passage omitted] Vladimir Chkhikvishvili, Russian charge d'affaires ad interim, was hastily summoned to the State Department. He received a strong protest from the U.S. side. The local press reports that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher demanded that Russia remove Ames' Russian case officers from the United States. "If the Russians do not do it we can do it for them," an anonymous administration official, quoted on television, threatened. Local commentators were quick to predict that the Ames scandal could seriously cloud Russian-U.S. relations. Some people are already asking whether U.S. aid to Russia, which is "spying on the United States," should be restricted. Former CIA Director Robert Gates claims that lately the Russian intelligence services, the GRU [Main Intelligence Directorate] in particular, have even stepped up their activities in the United States. But as a professional, Gates has urged that an excessive reaction to what has occurred be avoided. Nevertheless, CNN reports, the double agent's arrest has already harmed diplomatic relations between our two countries. Collaboration between Moscow and Washington in the talks on a settlement in Bosnia has been jeopardized. The fuss kicked up as if on command over what is, on the whole, an ordinary event is really surprising. After all, many local observers are now saying that there is nothing particularly new in the fact that both the United States and Russia are continuing to monitor each other. But the history of mutual relations between Washington and Moscow features a considerable number of cases whereby "sensational revelations" and passions over spying proved to be by no means irrelevant to the carrying out of more significants acts. Are we not witnessing such a "coincidence" now?
