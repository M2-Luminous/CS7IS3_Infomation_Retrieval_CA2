This opinion was voiced by Ivan Rybkin, speaker of the Federal Assembly's lower chamber, in a conversation with journalists after the meeting between Russian president and leaders of the State Duma factions. He assessed the president's decision to cancel decree No 1590 as a move of conciliation (the participants of the meeting were informed about this during the meeting). As it is known, "a black list" of former deputies of the Supreme Soviet disbanded by the presidential decree No 1400 due to their participation in the October events in Moscow was compiled on the basis of this decree. In Rybkin's words, they have reached an agreement that all leaders of the State Duma factions will be granted an opportunity to express their point of view regarding the agreement on civic accord over the first channel of the Ostankino TV company. While informing the State Duma deputies on the results of the meeting, Rybkin reported that on April 25 the Federation Council should determine whether it would commission Chairman of the Federation Council Vladimir Shumeyko to sign the document along with the constituent members or whether it would be enough if the constituent members put their signatures under this document. Aleksandr Piskunov (New Regional Policy group) reported that there are already 140 constituent members ready to sign this agreement, including all constituent members of the Russian Federation. As he said, it would take two days to revise the document. Yevgeniy Novikov, member of the working group in charge for the preparation of the document (Party of Russian Unity and Concord faction) reported that the president assessed the question on possible political persecution of those who would not sign the agreement on civic accord as "absolute nonsense." In his words, Yeltsin declared that he would not change his attitude to any parties if they do not sign this document. Sergey Shakhray, leader of the Party of Russian Unity and Concord, believes that April 28, the day of signing, is "the beginning of a difficult, long, and tiring process in the search for an accord." Shakhray believes that if the Duma votes against the singing of this document this will be unnatural because the Duma itself started this process by adopting the memorandum on accord on February 23. In addition, when the president, the government, the constituent members, and trade unions sign this document, the absence of the State Duma could lead "to self-isolation of the chamber." Nikolay Travkin, leader of the Democratic Party of Russia, believes that signing would take place and "the absolute majority" would sign the agreement. In his opinion, if there is at least one percent of something which can reconcile the society, it should be used." Leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russian Vladimir Zhirinovskiy reported to journalists that his faction would consider the issue at its sitting scheduled for April 26. At the same time he did not declare that he does not intend to sign this document because, as he said, signing is quite possible "as a compromise for further movement forward." He reported that he had presented his point of view regarding the concept of the country's development and agreed to privately meet with the president. "If several opposition factions do not sign this agreement it will be a norm of democratic life," Zhirinovsky is convinced. The Yabloko faction definitely declared its refusal to sign the document at the meeting with the president. The faction's representative Vyacheslav Shestakovskiy underlined that the faction had adopted an absolutely definite decision on this issue.
