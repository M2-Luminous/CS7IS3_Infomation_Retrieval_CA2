The U.S. introduction of a new missile unit into South Korea means an escalation of its belligerent moves to provoke a nuclear war against the DPRK on the Korean peninsula, the news analyst says, and goes on: The United States and the South Korean warlikers ridiculously say the deployment of Patriot missiles is intended to "supplement the anti-aircraft defence capabilities" and it is an "effective means of defence" to counter someone's "surprise attack". This is a clumsy excuse for covering up their aggresive design. The argument of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean warmaniacs that Patriot missiles entail no danger because they are for "defence" only revealed once again their shameless nature as cunning and wicked aggressor and provoker. It is a daydream if they think they can threaten us and bring us to our knees with the introduction of sophisticated weapons of mass destruction and nuclear war gambles. We love peace. But we are fully prepared to mete out a thousand-fold retaliatory punishment to the enemies if they dare provoke us. MINJU CHOSON in its commentary says "we have the singlehearted unity of the whole party, entire people and whole Army several hundred times stronger than the A-bombs and H-bombs of the United States and invincible self-reliant defence forces." If the enemies dare provoke us, we will deal a decisive counter-blow at them, it warns.
