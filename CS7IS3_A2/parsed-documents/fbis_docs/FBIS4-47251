It was proposed that it be returned to the government for a radical reworking. What induced the subcommittee (one of whose concerns, incidentally, is the revision of the budget for the purpose of reduction of government expenditures) to take such a decisive step? We bring to your attention the arguments of the subcommittee experts set forth in their conclusions concerning the draft law of the Russian Federation entitled ``On the Federal Budget for 1994'' in the section ``Fundamental Research and Facilitation of Scientific and Technical Progress.'' ``The amount of funding of fundamental and applied science provided for in the draft budget is catastrophically inadequate. In comparison with 1991, when the fraction allocated for science was 1.03% of the GNP, the expenditures on scientific research in comparable prices have been reduced by half. The calculations serving as a basis for the presented budget depart from the practices which took shape during the preceding years, solidify and intensify the pernicious tendencies, make no provision for structural changes and principles of budgetary policy have not been laid which would facilitate the necessary restructuring of the organization of scientific research. The proposed draft budget retains the deformed structure of expenditures on science which has taken shape during recent years when the fraction of sums for the payment of labor and social security has added up to more than 81/%. The indicated structure completely ignores the sharp, by a factor of 30-50, increase in prices for fuel and electric power, the significant rise in prices for transportation and communal services, expenditures on scientific equipment, materials, reagents and scientific information. Thereby this ensures only the maintenance, and extremely inadequate at that, of part of the scientific personnel, without the possibility of conducting scientific research itself. "The sum of proposed expenditures for science in the amount of 11.8 trillion rubles, figuring in the composite balance, should not lead one astray because 2/3 of this sum is an unbudgeted fund for scientific research, development, testing and engineering work, allocations to which are not of a mandatory character and therefore under economic crisis conditions are unrealistic (in 1993 of the predicted 1.7 trillion rubles of unbudgeted sums for scientific research, development, testing and engineering work in actuality only 41.6 billion were actually received). Thus, in actuality, one should count only on the budgeted component -- 4.5 billion rubles (0.6% of the GNP). The presented draft budget strengthens the residual principle of funding of the scientific sphere because it is funded from the development budget, whose formation, in accordance with the law ``On the Budget System of the Russian Federation,'' can be carried out only in the absence of a budget deficit, but such a deficit is embodied in the presented draft. Thus, science has virtually no guarantees of funding. In the opinion of the subcommittee, the expenditures for civilian science included directly in the federal budget for 1994 in Article 15, Section 4, should not be 4.5 trillion rubles, but not less than 7.7 trillion rubles (1% of the GNP and 4.2% of all the budgeted expenditures, which is half less the fraction of the GNP allocated for science in the well-developed countries and is acceptable only if there are substantial tax, tariff and customs privileges), of which not less than 2.8 trillion rubles must be directed to material expenditures, purchase of scientific publications, ensuring a modern level of informational servicing of scientists, as well as compensation for the expenditures on energy for the maintenance of scientific institutions and covering the expenditures on energy by scientific projects having high energy requirements. Thus, the minimum expenditures on science require the additional allocation of 3.2 trillion rubles. Even these sums will make it possible to cover the needs of only a part of the scientific research and therefore at the same time it is necessary to make provision for an increase in the direct funding of projects and programs, specifically directed support of scientific schools and groups, as well as individual researchers. The fraction of the budgeted sums (including the monies subject to distribution through funds, ensuring the implementation of a selective scientific and technical policy, must be not less than 45% of the total expenditures on science. In this case it will become possible to direct to the funding of fundamental science, which is a national cultural treasure and which which will provide the premises for economic rebirth of the country, about 2.5 trillion rubles (0.35% of the GNP, which corresponds to the structure of expenditures for these purposes in the well-developed countries). It must be emphasized that the funding of fundamental science throughout the world is virtually completely assumed by the state.'' The conclusion that there is a need for allocating additional sums was supported by the participants at a conference of the subcommittee which was attended by representatives of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Russian Academy of Education, Russian Academy of the Arts, Russian Academy of Architecture and Construction Sciences, Russian Engineering Academy, Academy of Technological Sciences, Academy of Natural Sciences, Moscow State University, Council of Rectors of Moscow Colleges and Universities, State Archives, State Committee for Higher and Intermediate Education and Russian Ministry of Science and Technical Policy.
