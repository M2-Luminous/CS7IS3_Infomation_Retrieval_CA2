The decision was a reaction to northern war propaganda which has tagged southerners "beer drinkers and atheists," Yemeni sources said. Alcohol is forbidden by Islam. The brewery conversion, announced by Aden television Monday, was also aimed at pleasing conservative Gulf monarchs who have looked favourably on the south during the two-month-old civil war, the sources said. A special committee chaired by the breakaway south's trade and industry "minister" Yahya al-Jifri will supervise the brewery's conversion, the television said, quoting a decree by "president" 'Ali Salim al-Bid. The brewery in al-Mansurah, a northwest suburb of Aden, was opened in 1981 with the help of former East Germany. It employs 200 people. Before war erupted on May 5 the brewery produced a million half-litre bottles of beer a month under the trademark Seera. Water shortages brought production to a halt at least two weeks ago. In 1993 the brewery made a net profit of 100 million Yemeni riyals, more than eight million US dollars on the official exchange rate. The south declared the breakaway Yemen Democratic Republic on May 21, two weeks after war broke out between al-Bid's forces and northern troops loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih.
