Before leaving, he expressed his confidence in the role of Portuguese investors in Mozambique. He described the investment as essential to peace. Despite being pleased, Dhlakama criticized the Portuguese Government once more. He said the government should have acted sooner, and that would have prevented death and destruction in Mozambique. [Begin Dhlakama recording] I have always criticized some of the Portuguese Government's attitudes. This time I told PUBLICO that things have changed and that is why many people died in my country. I have said before that if the Portuguese Government had understood five years ago that it was necessary for the sides to negotiate, it would have pressured the regime, the Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front] government, and perhaps only a few people would have died, and perhaps what happened -- the destruction -- could have been prevented. I blame the Portuguese Government for this. [end recording]
