[Rabinovich] We do not know yet. We are not dealing here with speculations or expectations. There is ongoing activity in Israel, the United States, and in other capitals to contain the damage and try to prevent negative effects on the peace process. We are maintaining ongoing contacts with the peace team in the U.S. Administration. We expect there will be high-level contacts between the Israeli Government and the U.S. Administration later today. I think President Clinton will address the issue later today. All this is intended to prevent, or at least minimize, the damages to the peace process. [Golan] Did you speak with our Arab interlocutors to the peace talks? [Rabinovich] Not yet, but such contacts will take place later today. [Golan] Have you heard what they are saying to the Americans now? [Rabinovich] No, I do not think there is any explicit message from them yet. I think the Arab side, like us, is still unclear about the events, some of which are unfortunately still going on. [Golan] They did not say they are halting the talks and returning home, did they? [Rabinovich] No, there was no such announcement. [Golan] What do the Americans intend to do in order to calm tempers down? (Rabinovich] I think right now the Americans are holding internal consultations, with us and with the Arab and Palestinian side. I think they have still not consolidated any concrete policy. This will probably take place in the next few hours. [Golan] How do the Americans regard the Palestinian demand to disarm the settlers? [Rabinovich] I do not think the Americans believe the time has come to address such concrete issues. This is not the key issue when we are trying to figure out how to save the peace process from severe harm. I assume that if such a request was submitted to the Americans they would have known how to rank it on the list of priorities. [Golan] How will the Security Council deal with this issue when it is submitted to it? [Rabinovich] It is too early to assess what will happen in the Security Council, because the format for dealing with this issue has still not been determined. We must remember that the Security Council can meet on various levels and forms, and so far this issue has not been determined.
