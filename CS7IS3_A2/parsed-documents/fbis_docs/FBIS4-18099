This was decided at a meeting of the group of 24 rich countries to discuss macroeconomic aid to Central and East Europe. The EC proposes to make ECU35 million available to Albania. This EU [European Union] loan is to support the country's balance of payments and covers about one half of the financing deficit incurred during the first year of implementing the reform and stabilization program. Over recent years, Albania has already received a loan of ECU70 million from the European Union. The EC is, however, insisting that this East European country should normalize its relations with commercial credit institutions so that the financing of private trade and direct foreign investments can quickly begin. Moldova is to receive a long-term loan of ECU45 million from the EC. The Twelve agreed back in December on the principle of granting assistance to this former Soviet republic. The loan covers one third of the Moldovan financing deficit for 1994. The support for the Bulgarian balance of payments is to be increased to ECU150 million, following the green light from the EU Council. An increase in support for the Romanian balance of payments is also likely, according to EU Commissioner Henning Christophersen. This European assistance comes on top of financial aid from the IMF and the World Bank for the economic reform program in Romania and Bulgaria. [passage omitted]
