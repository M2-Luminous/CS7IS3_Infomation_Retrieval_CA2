FBIS4-10463 "drlat071_c_94005" FBIS-LAT-94-071 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 MEXICO PAN Presidential Candidate Fernandez Interviewed PAN Presidential Candidate Fernandez Interviewed PA1304034494 PA1304034494 BFN [Editorial Report] Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish at 0000 GMT on 8 April broadcasts live, during its "ACIR Radio News" newscast, an interview with Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, presidential candidate of Mexico's National Action Party, PAN, by an unidentified interviewer. After commenting on the preelection political campaign and the assassination of Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI, presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, Fernandez says should he win the elections, he would include members of other parties in his cabinet, "not only PAN members, not at all. I would have to firmly adhere to my ideas and appoint to the topmost positions of public administration individuals who belong to other parties or no party in particular. There are academicians, industrialists, ranchers, and peasants who could hold various positions in the government who are more knowledgeable than many politicians who would like to hold all the positions and pretend to be good for anything." He expresses disagreement with the PRI, whose members, he says, "seem to be so versatile that they are appointed to any position." Asked about his party's economic platform, Fernandez says: "PAN's economic proposal is broad and firm. We admit several of the current government's macroeconomic measures have been positive. No one can deny restructuring the state's finances as well as reordering, reducing, and renegotiating Mexico's foreign debt, attempting to reduce inflation considerably, and trimming the government apparatus by selling many enterprises that should have never been purchased in the first place are positive." He says the government has polarized the country's economic life by making the rich richer and the rest poorer. PAN proposes, he says, "a social market economic system, which consists of prioritizing labor over capital. Labor must be protected, but it must be kept in mind that labor requires capital. A key issue is the millions of unemployed and underemployed in Mexico." Fernandez says permanent, well-paying jobs are required, which would be created through the creation of state-supported enterprises which would in turn "direct the economy, which supports those jobs. All this requires secure and productive investments. Another requirement is a legal guarantee investment protected by law. A third requirement is capital. Mexico does not have resources of its own to create enterprises and jobs," says Fernandez. Resources must come from abroad, he adds. Mexico has failed in economic growth due to, he says, "the government's centralist, authoritarian policies. Mexico needs to create the necessary conditions for foreign capital investment on a long-term basis with sound infrastructure." Fernandez, answering a caller's question on the low income of social security pensioners, says: "The parties have been discussing the issue, and PAN has proposed immediate measures to correct this situation." The PAN candidate finally says he offers the Mexican people "a democratic alternative," and he invites all to participate "in an honest electoral campaign and clean elections."
