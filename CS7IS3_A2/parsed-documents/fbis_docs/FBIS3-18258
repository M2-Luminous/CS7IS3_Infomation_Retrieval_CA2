Girke, who is now employed by the Trust Agency, worked as trustee for the SED holding company Orvag since 1991. He is the owner of the Orvag subsidiary TVO (Trustee, Administration, and Organization company). Meanwhile one knows for sure that a financial adviser to the leader of the Russian nationalists stayed at TVO for many weeks in the fall of 1993. Another piece of evidence is that, after they had met in Austria, a second meeting between Girke and Zhirinovskiy took place in Slovenia in mid-January. When the premises of Girke's company were searched in early January documents were seized that prove that he embezzled 4 million German marks [DM] from SED foreign assets. Meanwhile, the Trust Agency has found out that Girke invested the money in companies in Moscow. To what extent the enterprises are connected with Zhirinovskiy is currently the subject of investigations by the Central Investigations Office for Government- and Unification-Related Crime (ZERV).
