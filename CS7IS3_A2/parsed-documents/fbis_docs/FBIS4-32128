[Sabol] The arms industry of the former Czechoslovakia was organized as a whole. After the federation was partitioned, the situation changed, but, nevertheless, what sense would it make to buy something expensive in third countries that we ourselves can make more cheaply at home? A solution would be to agree on mutually advantageous economic opportunities. In both the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic, there is interest in arms production because arms, as an important source of funds for the state coffers, do sell and will sell in the world. [Zabojnik] As a result of conversion, production was completely phased out in the Slovak Republic. Will there not be problems in reviving production? [Sabol] The arms industry of the Slovak Republic is now working at 8 percent of its capacity. We do not want the industry to produce as much as before. However, we can produce in order to meet the needs of our armies and the armies of countries with similar equipment that needs to be renewed. The modernization of equipment produced in the arms factories of the former federation, the Soviet Union, and the Warsaw Pact countries could become the second and a larger component of our common interests. Each of these countries can carry out this modernization using its own capacities, but full modernization is not quite possible in that way. Purchasing expensive technology from Western arms manufacturers may also be involved. There also is a third possibility: We may reach agreement, and everyone, according to his possibilities, will help to meet our common needs. Now, the final problem is: To what extent are we really able to revive and develop cooperation? [Zabojnik] What did you learn at the recent IDET '94 arms fair in Brno? It was possible to compare the products from both republics there. [Sabol] I saw both the Czech and jthe Slovak versions of the modernized tank, and I spoke with experts from both countries. If we agreed upon joint technological steps, it would certainly lead to even better results and mutual benefit. Other countries do not give up their own arms production, either. For example, Switzerland is developing arms production that is more expensive than possible purchases abroad. When I asked why they were taking this course of action, they said: We keep the know-how at home, the arms industry means the constant development of technologies, and we provide jobs for our own people. This is also a way for us, I believe. [Zabojnik] The Slovak version of the modernized T-72 tank has met with a positive response from foreign experts. How are you satisfied? [Sabol] Some details can still be improved on ours as well as the Czech version. Jointly, we could get even further. I do not imagine that the Czech side is thinking only about its own army, but also wants, like ourselves, to assert itself abroad. This means jobs for people at home and making our presence felt in the world. We are also aware of the financial problems in some countries that want to modernize economically but rationally. This presents great opportunities to the producers in both countries.
