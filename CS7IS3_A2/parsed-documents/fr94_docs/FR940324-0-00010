FR940324-0-00010 FR940324-0-00003 This same commenter also asserted that the proposed rule fails to provide independent review of the decision to repatriate an eligible detainee. It is beyond the scope of this regulation to address that issue. This rule deals solely with parole of Mariel Cubans, rather than repatriation procedures and determinations. One commenter contended that the Associate Commissioner for Enforcement should not be permitted to withdraw parole approval for reasons that do not relate to the established guidelines for parole release. However, the revocation authority exercised pursuant to 8 CFR 212.12(e) is identical to that which was granted by the Attorney General to the Departmental Panels in 8 CFR 212.13. The ultimate criteria for the Associate Commissioner for Enforcement to follow in determination of parole release under both 8 CFR 212.12(e) and 212.13 is set forth in section 212(d)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)(A). When a detainee cannot be sponsored by someone who can help him or her integrate into the community, that fact is a significant consideration in determining whether the detainee's release on parole is in the public interest. Without an appropriate support system, vocational training, and essential social skills, the detainee will be unable in many instances to maintain acceptable behavior upon release. This difficulty is recognized in 8 CFR 212.12(f), which prohibits release without suitable sponsorship or placement. The Service is committed to the task of locating suitable placement for each detainee whose release has been approved. However, administration of the Cuban Review Program has been severely handicapped by cases where suitable placement cannot be secured. In such cases, the detainee remains in custody without any resolution of his or her status. In sponsorship problem cases, parole approval will be withdrawn only after reasonable efforts to secure appropriate placement and after the detainee, where appropriate, has been afforded an opportunity to demonstrate reasonable sponsorship alternatives. The current process does not preclude the detainee from offering sponsorship alternatives. In fact, many detainees do suggest sponsorship possibilities, particularly family sponsors, some of which may ultimately be selected for placement. The Service retains final authority to evaluate sponsorship alternatives and to determine whether release of a detainee is in the public interest. Several commenters also expressed the hope that exhaustive efforts to locate appropriate sponsorship should be made to ensure that those detainees who have been approved for release are actually released from custody. As indicated, the Service will make reasonable efforts to ensure appropriate placement for each detainee approved for release. One of these commenters also maintained that it is inappropriate to withdraw parole approval without a hearing. The Service disagrees. See Alvarez-Mendez v. Stock, 941 F.2d 956, 963 (9th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 113 U.S. 127 (1992); Fernandez-Roque v. Smith, 734 F.2d 576, 582 (11th Cir. 1984). These court decisions establish that withdrawal of parole approval can be accomplished without a hearing. Nevertheless, in cases of sponsorship problems, it is in the Government's best interest to explore alternatives in order to reduce detention costs and to ensure the safe release of an individual into the community. Detainees are encouraged to submit sponsorship alternatives to the Associate Commissioner for Enforcement, as appropriate. Where the Associate Commissioner for Enforcement determines that the inability to secure sponsorship is the sole reason behind withdrawal of parole approval, he may, in the exercise of discretion, give the detainee notice of that fact and the opportunity to present proposals for appropriate placement. This authority is made discretionary with the Associate Commissioner for Enforcement to allow for cases where it would be inappropriate to delay the decision to withdraw parole approval, such as where the detainee has previously provided erroneous or inappropriate information relating to sponsorship. The Service benefits from the detainee's submission of reasonable sponsorship alternatives by the potential for reduction in detention costs. This also may assist the Service in securing the detainee's release pursuant to the initial grant of parole approval. The sponsorship area is particularly amenable to input from the detainee, who may be able to provide information of reasonable sponsorship opportunities otherwise unknown to the Service. The detainee's participation in the placement process will help ensure that no detainee who is approved for parole continues in custody where suitable sponsorship is available and where identifying that sponsorship is the only issue remaining in obtaining release to the community. An opportunity for the detainee to present information to the Associate Commissioner for Enforcement prior to withdrawal of parole approval is only appropriate where the sole grounds for revocation is the Service's inability to locate appropriate sponsorship. Under these narrow circumstances, it may prove beneficial to solicit any information the detainee possesses in order to implement the parole decision. Where the detainee's parole has been revoked for other reasons, it would be inappropriate and contrary to the public interest to delay the revocation decision in order to solicit information from the detainee. For example, in cases where the misconduct of the detainee is the cause of revocation of parole approval, immediate action is required in the interest of public safety. One commenter was concerned that the proposed rule change could have a major impact on future political events involving the relationship between the Governments of the United States and Cuba. This issue is beyond the scope of this rule. Should the Cuban Review Plan be substantially changed or abolished, such action will be published, as appropriate, in the Federal Register . One commenter expressed the view that insufficient programs exist as alternatives to detention. It is beyond the scope of this rule to address this issue. It should be noted, however, that the Department continues to work with other government agencies and private enterprise to develop additional programs. In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Attorney General certifies that this rule will not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule affects only a class of Cuban Nationals in their individual capacity who are in the custody of the Attorney General and will have no impact on small entities. This rule has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to Executive Order 12866. This rule does not have Federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federal Assessment in accordance with Executive Order 12612.
