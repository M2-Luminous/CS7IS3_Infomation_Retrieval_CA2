The ITAR-TASS Russian official press agency yesterday announced the presidential visit to Spain, of which the Spanish authorities learned with surprise 25 February. "I know, I know; do not tell me, because I assure you that I will soon be going to Spain." With these words Yeltsin began his meeting with Felipe Gonzalez in Brussels in December. He thus made clear his bad conscience about having postponed his first visit to Spain as head of state on several occasions since August 1992, because of his country's instability. The Russian leader will spend two days in Madrid -- 11-12 April -- and has expressed his intention to visit Barcelona immediately after. The length of his stay in the Catalan capital is not clear, and could be between 24 and 72 hours. Late yesterday afternoon, the doctors who treated him in Barcelona received a telephone call from Moscow, announcing, without specifying the date or reason, an imminent visit by the Russian president, Milagros Perez Oliva reports. In Barcelona's medical circles it was taken for granted that Yeltsin would not confine himself to paying a mere formal visit, but would take the opportunity to have a checkup. In May 1990, when he was a mere deputy, Yeltsin underwent an operation for a slipped disk by the medical team of neurosurgeon Josep Llovet Tapies. Since then, Llovet and his colleagues, whom Yeltsin describes as "the best doctors in the world," have continued to treat the Russian president. Llovet last went to Moscow for this reason last September, aboard an aircraft which the Russian head of state placed at his disposal. Rumors circulating in the Russian capital indicate that he is suffering from increasing backache. At the first preparatory meeting for the visit, the Russians expressed their interest in concluding with Spain a framework treaty of friendship and cooperation, like the one that was once signed with the USSR. They also indicated readiness to sign several agreements, including a social security agreement which would partially resolve the situation of the famous "war children" -- the Spanish children who fled to the Soviet Union at the height of the [Spanish] Civil War. Another important reason for hastening the visit to Madrid is the desire to become better acquainted with the experience of the Moncloa Pacts, which facilitated the transition from Francoism to democracy at the end of the seventies, Pilar Bonet reports from Moscow. Those pacts, or the idea which people now have of them in Moscow, were a frequent reference point during the parliamentary debate which granted an amnesty to Yeltsin's main opponents, and seem to inspire a new presidential initiative aimed at achieving a charter of social accord with all the political forces.
