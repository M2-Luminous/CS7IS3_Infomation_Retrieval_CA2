This is particularly so in Japan which, in trying to reduce the economic burden of slow growth in some sectors of the country's main economic axis (a zone of heavy concentration of industries linking nine urban centers such as Tokyo, Kobe and Osaka), is urgently seeking international cooperation with countries contiguous to the Japan Sea to develop a second axis in the area north of Kyoto and the coastal area along the Japan Sea. Concerned local governments in Japan are making new plans for industries in this area by constructing basic infrastructure facilities, establishing free ports and taking a series of initiatives to engage neighboring countries in direct discussions over cooperation in relevant areas. Japan's actions fall right in step with developmental needs of other Northeast Asian countries. Both the Republic of Korea, which seeks to develop the area bordering the Tonghae (Korean name for the Japan Sea) and to speed up the changing and upgrading of its industrial structure, and Russia, which desires to develop the rich natural resources of its Far East region, need access to markets and new production facilities of neighboring areas in Northeast Asia. Analysis suggests that from the 1980s to the early part of the next century, China's development has seen three stages of growth, beginning in the south and moving northward, which will in term spur economic development in the country as a whole. The first growth stage started with Guangdong which, relying on its special geographic relationship with Hong Kong, formed and built up the south China economic zone, and achieved the benefits of reform, opening up and development not shared by other provinces, setting in motion the waves of industrial revolution during the 10 years of reform in China. From the 1990s onward, the Central Government has begun to favor the Shanghai-Pudong area, granting favorable conditions for its economic renewal, restructuring and development, enabling Shanghai to use its substantial economic strength and position to help the country's internal and external developments, and using this the second stage of growth to spur continued development of the national economy. By the beginning of the new century, the central government will turn its attention to areas bordering the Bohai Sea and the old industrial base such as Liaoning and elsewhere; at that time, Liaoning can look forward to relying on international cooperation in Northeast Asia to complete its substantive renewal, and benefiting from the third stage of growth which will bring China to becoming a mid-grade developed country. Summarizing the above, it can be said that the Northeast Asia economic area is based on developmental needs of the area and relevant countries themselves, and the combined economic benefits to all can sweep away any noneconomic obstacles and open up a new era in the Northeast Asian economic area. Within the Northeast Asia economic area, Liaoning is situated at the hub of both the transportation network and the circulation of goods. Viewed in terms of transportation, the main channel linking the coastal areas of Northeast Asia and China's interior is the rail trunk line of Fugang-Dalien-Shenyang-Jiningxian-Russia's Siberia; another fast and convenient channel conceivably available at some future point runs from Japan through an undersea tunnel to Pusan, on to Seoul, Pyongyang, Shenyang and points north. Other channels, such as the Xinxie-Tumen-Manzhouli-Chita line which, limited by the present small quantities of goods circulated, is not likely to become a main trunk line linking sea-land transportation in Northeast Asia within this century. Transportation routes often lead to economic development. Liaoning, using its advantageous position in the transportation network, can look forward to becoming an important wing in the main axis of the Northeast Asia economic area. In terms of division of labor and circulation of goods, although Liaoning's level of development is lower than that of comparable areas in Japan and South Korea, Liaoning is not substantially behind in terms of its industrial stage of development. The area north of Japan's Kyoto and along the Sea of Japan coast was the base of Japan's traditional industries including the heavy chemical industries, and not Japan's [modern] industrially developed area, and the difference vis-a-vis Liaoning is not as great as people may imagine. Therefore, Liaoning, South Korea and Japan's coastal areas are comparable and together constitute the developed and relatively developed areas of the Northeast Asia region. From the central part of Liaoning, north and westward to Russia's Far East hinterland, to eastern Mongolia, Northeast Inner Mongolia and to northern Jiangxi and Fujian, this is a large area making up the hinterland of the NE Asia economic area which is next to be developed. Because Liaoning's middle-grade technology can link up with economies of the above-mentioned developed and developing areas, Liaoning stands to gain given its advantageous position as these areas begin to open up to the outside world. Unquestionably, the day when this possibility is realized will be the time that Liaoning's old industrial base will be revitalized. Therefore, Liaoning should look ahead to the future and, to carry out concrete initiatives to promote the Northeast Asia economic area, consider adopting new policies in the following areas: First, determine a positive international market strategy, and direct the policy of opening toward the Northeast Asia region. This is not to suggest that we change the basic policy of opening to the outside, but following the principle of gaining benefits for both sides, we should select markets with the most potentials and gradually develop a stable international division of labor by adjusting the enterprise structure on a reciprocally beneficial basis. In moving toward this direction, we should carry out suitable preferential policies to promote and advance cooperation. Second, base the policy of developing an industrial policy to promote change and upgrading the industrial structure through opening to the outside. With a new structure, we advance to the level of the developed zone within the Northeast Asia region. In Japan, coastal areas in northern Kyushu are positively promoting industrial structural readjustment, seeking to move the traditional heavy chemical industries to the China mainland, keeping in Japan the advanced, high-tech components of these industries and vigorously developing a new high-tech industrial strategy. From the standpoint of resources, Liaoning no longer has any advantage to develop traditional heavy chemical industries, and if more investments were drawn to such industries, it will only exacerbate the limitations on development of such industries and cause them to be mired in even grater difficulties. Liaoning should adopt an industrial policy similar to that of Northern Kyushu in Japan, by dispersing the first-stage of production of heavy industries and moving it to the interior, by vigorously developing the advanced and high-tech components of these industries and, at the same time, positively developing [other] new high-tech industries. Therefore, Liaoning should adopt even more favorable preferential policies to attract foreign investment in new high-tech industries, strengthen further the coastal area new high-tech zones and the building of basic infrastructure facilities, and compete with other similar areas in Japan and South Korea for investment in new, high-tech industries by offering an even more advantageous investment environment. Third, promote policy coordination and direct dialogue with various local governments in the Northeast Asia region. Planning officials of relevant local governments in Japan have pointed out that international cooperation in the region should have the special characteristic of direct cooperation between neighboring countries in the area, and called upon various local governments to enter into direct contact and negotiations for construction of infrastructure facilities along the coastal areas. Government departments on our side should respond positively to such suggestions which create a policy environment conducive to cooperation. Fourth, establish a repository of information and reference sources on Northeast Asia international cooperation. To begin with, we should devote effort to foster cooperation and pooling of knowledge capital among the societies in Northeast Asia. It is the intellectual and scholarly circles that suggested and actively promoted the concept of cooperation in the Northeast Asia region. Intellectuals and scholars are the most important asset in the information age -- they are society's knowledge capital, and will be of pivotal importance in the development of the future Northeast Asia economic area. To meet today's demands against a background of international cooperation in Northeast Asia, we should also promote scholarly exchanges in our own area, take greater initiatives to support scholars and intellectuals in building information and reference repositories to strengthen the atmosphere for international cooperation in Northeast Asia, stimulate new thinking on cooperation, and provide direct informational and intellectual support to bring about such cooperation.
