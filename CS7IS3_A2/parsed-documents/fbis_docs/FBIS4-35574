Prime Minister Rabin said that in view of the difficult situation, Israel needs a full-time health minister. There is nobody to talk to in the Histadrut Labor Federation and its Kupat Holim health fund is bankrupt. Mr. Rabin said the two other ministerial portfolios are being saved for SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim]. Our correspondent Shmu'el Tal reports that a minister without portfolio, either Yosi Beilin or MK Avraham Burg, is also expected to be appointed. MK Sne thanked the Central Committee for its support and called on Kupat Holim Director General Avigdor Kaplan to remain in his post and participate in the efforts to rehabilitate the fund.
