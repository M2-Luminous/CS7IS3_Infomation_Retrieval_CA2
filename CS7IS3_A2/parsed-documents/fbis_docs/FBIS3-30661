Meyer said that the fire, which occurred in one of the transformers in the plant's third bloc, was completely extinguished in two hours and did not cause any leak of radioactive materials. The fire rated a zero on the INES International Nuclear Safety Scale.

The environmentalists said that a secondary cooling system had been damaged, causing a radioactive leak. Local residents were warned by siren and doses of iodine were distributed, the group said.
