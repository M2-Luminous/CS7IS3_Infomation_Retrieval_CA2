FBIS4-30526 "dreas124_c_94011" FBIS-EAS-94-124 Daily Report 26 Jun 1994 North Korea Daily Denounces South's Action Against Strikers Daily Denounces South's Action Against Strikers SK2606090794 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0823 GMT 26 Jun 94 SK2606090794 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Reckless Fascist Outrage" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, June 26 (KCNA) -- The South Korean police recently mobilized a huge force to brutally suppress rail workers affiliated with the National Council of Locomotive Workers on a sit- in strike for wage hike and improvement of working conditions. In this regard, NODONG SINMUN today says this is an illegal fascist outrage and inconsiderable fascist violence. The news analyst says: The council urged the authorities to raise its workers' wages, improve the working conditions and reinstate the expelled workers. This, the minimum demand of the workers for their existence as human beings, should have been met by the South Korean authorities. Nevertheless, the South Korean rulers have put workers on the altar of suppression, refusing to accept their just demand. Then, how can their behavior be construed? It is ridiculous for the South Korean rulers, the guilty party, to threaten that they would "bring legal actions" against innocent workers, charging them with the "railway paralysis." The fascists are calling the workers' sit-in an "illegal violence" and blaming them for the "railway paralysis," motivated by a criminal intention to shift onto the workers the responsibility for all the grave consequences to be entailed by the railway paralysis and harshly suppress and penalize them. The fascist suppression leads to self-destruction. The South Korean authorities would be well advised to promptly stop the fascist suppression, clearly mindful that the more harshly they crack down on the people, the more fiercely the people resist.
