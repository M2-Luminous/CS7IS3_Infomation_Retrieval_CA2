During the talks the sides discussed problems of cooperation between the state and Moslem organisations in reaching civic peace and accord in Russia, problems of imposing fundamentalism and extremism on Russian Moslems by foreign Islamic organisations and the assistance rendered by the state in the restoration and construction of mosques and education of priests. During the talks religious leaders raised the question of setting up a special state department for religious affairs. They also touched upon unfair distribution of air time on television, which prefers foreign missionaries, infringing on the rights of traditional religious confessions in Russia.
