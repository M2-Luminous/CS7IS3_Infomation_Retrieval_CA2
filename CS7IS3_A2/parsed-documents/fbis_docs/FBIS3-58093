At this hard bargaining session, contributions to Swedish farmers could be played off against the size of Sweden's membership fee. European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel is bearing this in mind as a possibility, and a meeting has been preliminarily penciled in by EU president Greece for late February/early March. Ulf Dinkelspiel is preparing himself for the final spurt in the negotiations. At the same time he is very aware of the opposition to the EU in public opinion. The notorious EU optimist admits that the "yes" side's uncritical praise for membership could have reduced its credibility. He even went so far as to mention certain disadvantages. Ulf Dinkelspiel, star negotiator under the Social Democratic government and today a Moderate Coalition Party minister, said that much could happen in the very last phase of the negotiations. A possibility that he does not rule out is that the size of the Swedish contribution to the EU budget could be played off against the contributions which Swedish farmers will receive from the EU. Sweden's membership contribution to the EU has been estimated at 22-24 billion kronor per year. This gigantic sum will be a further strain on Sweden's already overstretched state coffers. The Swedish negotiators are trying on the one hand to persuade the EU to change the basis for calculating Sweden's membership contribution, and on the other to win agreement for phasing-in during a transitional period. But so far this has fallen on deaf ears in the EU. One compromise could be found instead in smaller subsidies for Swedish farmers from the EU's agriculture budget. In an interview with DAGENS NYHETER on the eve of the final spurt of the negotiations, Ulf Dinkelspiel said that for the time being at least each issue is being negotiated on "its own merits." But he spoke more about the importance of regional support than about the importance of agriculture. Sweden wants to continue to pursue its own regional policy, and it also wants support from the EU's structural fund. Very different and much smaller sums are involved here than in the case of agriculture. When Swedish influence in terms of the number of votes Sweden has in the EU's decisionmaking body, the Council of Ministers, is to be determined, a similar give-and-take situation could arise. The EU has offered Sweden four votes, while Portugal with just over a million more inhabitants than Sweden has five. The Netherlands with 15 million inhabitants also has five votes. Asked whether Sweden could be forced to "buy" the fifth vote through lower agricultural subsidies or higher membership contributions, Dinkelspiel replied: "We, like our opposite number, must be prepared to give and take in the final phase of negotiations." Exhausted but happy, the Swedish negotiators traveled home in the days before Christmas. The long awaited "ketchup effect" (a lot at once after several unsuccessful attempts) had materialized. Ulf Dinkelspiel exudes satsisfaction. He thinks that there is a platform to be happy about. The EEA [European Economic Area] agreement is in place, the GATT negotiations have been sorted out, and in the EU negotiations the environmental issues are among those that have been settled. Dinkelspiel's assessment of the EEA agreement, which creates a region of European economic cooperation embracing 18 countries, is that in material terms it is better than expected, but in institutional terms is worse: "For me it is incomprehensible that the `no' side is so strongly critical of the EEA agreement because of its institutional solutions (Swedish influence) and then opposes EU membership." He pointed out that the EEA agreement also embraces Sweden's state alcohol monopoly and transport subsidies that are so important for Norrland and the forestry industry. "Regardless of what happens we are bound by the EEA agreement. The membership negotiations do not really change anything on these points. They are therefore of minor interest." The uproar in Rostanga [village near Malmo] involving the Ica [Swedish grocery chain] storekeeper who challenged the state alcohol monopoly on New Year's Day made many Swedes ask: Just who is it who actually decides? "In the EU it is the governments of all the countries which decide jointly," the European affairs minister said. "But if there are problems of interpretation, as in the present case, it is the EU court which decides in the final instance." Nor does the question of summer cottages worry him. On the subject of the sale of Swedish leisure homes to EU citizens he said: "I do not think that this is a major issue either for the country as a whole or for the electorate." If the timetable is to hold, the negotiations must be completed in seven or eight weeks' time. Sweden will not wait for slower countries, the European affairs minister stressed: "It would run contrary to Swedish interests to make our negotiations dependent on those of other countries." Norway and Finland are demanding transitional arrangements in the field of agriculture which would mean continued border controls. Dinkelspiel affirmed that it is Sweden's goal to abolish them in January 1995. Temporary border controls could be introduced in the Nordic area. Once the negotiations have been completed Dinkelspiel's people will take two or three weeks to draft a departmental memorandum on the results. It will go to the Riksdag and then be sent out for comment for three months. Proposed legislation on membership would not come before the summer, the European affairs minister said. But a referendum could very well take place before then, he pointed out. A popular version of the result of the negotiations will be published. The whole government machine is chugging along as if membership were on the cards, whereas public opinion poll figures show that almost 60 percent of the Swedish people are opposed to membership. What does Ulf Dinkelspiel think is the essential reason for this opposition? "Uncertainty," he replied. "Many interacting factors," he added, without being specific. He repreated his criticism of the Social Democrats: "When Sweden's largest party does not make up its mind, it is not easy for the voters to do so. Uncertainty is given legitimacy." Ulf Dinkelspiel reiterated his prime arguments for membership: peace, jobs, prosperity. Are these arguments believable? Look at Yugoslavia, look at the millions in Western Europe who are permanently unemployed.... For Ulf Dinkelspiel this is simply confirmation of the fact that the European ideal has still not been fully achieved. This time he did not say that better information will have an effect on the negative body of public opinion. Instead he spoke of commitment. Not only on the part of politicians, but also on the part of all Swedes who want a "yes." "It is possible that we are allowing the 'no' side too much room for maneuver." Is it not possible that the "yes" side's glossy picture of the EU as the solution to all problems has made the arguments less believable? Should it not draw attention to the problems and produce analyses in order to win people's confidence? "Yes, I believe so," Ulf Dinkelspiel cried. "It is important to draw attention to the fact that membership has both advantages and disadvantages." Mention a disadvantage! "One of them is the net cost to Sweden. And in some respects the bureaucracy is something that I would want to be involved in reducing as a member. I will work for greater openness." Ulf Dinkelspiel has the EU emblem in his lapel and an EU watch around his wrist. Could these not be taken as signs that he is more on the side of the EU than that of Sweden in the negotiations? He sees them as symbols of the European ideal. "The negotiations are not some zero-sum game. It is a question of finding joint solutions which are of mutual interest."
