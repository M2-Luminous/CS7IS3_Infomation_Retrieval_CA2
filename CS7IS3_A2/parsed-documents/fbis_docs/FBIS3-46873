Director Chang said on 6 January that during a telephone contact with the United States on 5 January, North Korea announced that it will hold contacts with the IAEA to discuss the beginning of the ordinary inspection. He said this is a process for the start of the third round of talks between the United States and North Korea in which the nuclear issue will be earnestly discussed. A relevant government official also said that the move for the working-level contacts between the North and South will be active after North Korea and the IAEA discuss the nuclear inspections, and that the exchange of special envoys between the North and South is likely to be realized before the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks. He said that as soon as the discussion between North Korea and the IAEA over the nuclear inspection is ended, the United States and North Korea will hold a working-level contact in New York and discuss the agenda for partial compromise [pubun takyelan], including the holding of the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks. He also said that the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks will be held in Geneva within the next month only if the present ongoing process of consultations are being carried out as scheduled.
