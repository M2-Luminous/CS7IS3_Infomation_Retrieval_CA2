The Somali Patriotic Movement, which is part of Aidid's Somali National Alliance, said that by signing the agreement, Aidid contravened the alliance's constitution and objectives. "It is an accord that infringes (on) the principal constituency of the Somali National Alliance, conspiring (against) the cause and the struggle of its supporters," the movement said in a statement. It said the alliance, an umbrella organisation of various factions which fought and toppled Barre in 1991, had vowed never to associate with members of the former regime, including his son-in- law, Mohamed Said Hersi. The peace pact, signed in the southern Somali port city of Kismayo on Saturday, was aimed at strengthening an existing ceasefire agreement. The accord, signed by 19 clan elders, was endorsed by Hersi and Osman Ato, who represented Aidid's group. Omar Jess, the Somali Patriotic Movement's leader and the main warlord in the Kismayo region, did not sign the agreement.
