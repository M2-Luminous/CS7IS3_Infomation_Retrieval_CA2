President Gligorov explained that otherwise a conflict would immediately occur because the question would arise of who Macedonia should join with, which, as a matter of fact, has been the cause for the previous Balkan wars, the First World War also having started over the division of Macedonia. He said: "It does not mean that we want to remain isolated. Our firm commitment is to join the European associations and establish good relations with all our neighbors." The U.S. delegation, composed of top journalists engaged in international policy, was very interested in the Greek-Macedonian dispute and U.S. mediation. President Gligorov assessed positively the upcoming meeting of Prime Minister Papandreou and U.S. President Clinton, and he pointed out the following: "Until now the United States has conducted an impartial policy concerning relations between Macedonia and Greece, showing an interest in maintaining peace and security in the Balkans. I hope that position will also prevail during the discussions between Papandreou and Clinton in Washington." Speaking about the U.S. efforts for giving assistance to the finding of a just and acceptable solution for both sides, the Macedonian president said: "It is important that goodwill and desire for discussion win, and let us not use threats and embargoes, because reasonable people can always reach a solution through discussion." Asked about the part of the [Macedonian] Constitution that Greece is calling upon Macedonia to change, Gligorov replied that even before the Badinter Commission came out with its assessments in favor of the recognition of Macedonia, some of the Constitution's regulations had been changed: "We wrote down we had no territorial pretensions and that we are not going to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. At the same time, we proposed an agreement to Greece on the inviolability of the present border under the guarantee of the United Nations and the European Union." Gligorov pointed out the example of Article 108 of the Greek Constitution, where it is written that the Greek state will take care of all Greeks, whichever part of the world they live in. "The moment the dispute between Macedonia and Greece is settled, there will be long-term good relations ahead of us, first of all because of the common economic interest and also because both peoples are very close, share the same religion and have similar customs," Gligorov said Concerning the latest federation between the Muslims and the Croats on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Gligorov emphasized: "I think it is positive, although the war between the Muslims and the Croats was absolutely unnecessary. However, there still remains the problem with the Serbs. In my opinion, it would be a good thing if Bosnia and Herzegovina could reunite, because its division on ethnic principles could have a bad effect not only on the Balkans, but also on some other Eastern European countries. It violates many international regulations and represents a bad precedent for changing the borders and for violent ethnic cleansing." This is how President Gligorov responded to the question of what would happen if Serbia started ethnic cleansing in Kosovo: "That would be tragic; it is necessary to solve the Kosovo problem through negotiations between the Serbian authority and the legitimate representatives of the Albanians in Kosovo. If that does not happen, and if ethnic cleansing takes place in Kosovo, there is a danger of a Balkan war with sizable negative consequences, in which two NATO members -- Greece and Turkey -- would be involved."
