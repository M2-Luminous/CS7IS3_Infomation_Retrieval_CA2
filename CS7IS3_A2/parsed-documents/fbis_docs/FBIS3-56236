It contained recommendations on preparing and holding the elections. Viktor Pohorilo, deputy chief of the Central Electoral Commission, noted that all appropriate documents to be prepared by district electoral commissions should already be at electoral districts by 12 March. The tasks of the district electoral commissions include: compiling a list of voters, planning work during the preparatory period, holding and summing up the results of the elections, and ensuring that legality is maintained during the mentioned period. The meeting's participants approved a resolution on how Ukrainian citizens who work in Ukraine's diplomatic representations and permanent representations attached to international organizations or who are abroad on training can participate in the elections of Ukrainian people's deputies on 27 March 1994. In particular, a resolution calls for electoral districts abroad to be registered with Artemovskiy electoral district No. 1 of Kiev. Deputy Foreign Minister Yuriy Vilych said there are about 75,500 voters abroad. He proposed that the right to form such electoral commissions remain with the leadership of foreign institutions. The Foreign Ministry will be given the right to send copies of electoral documents by fax or diplomatic post. The meeting examined the state of party registration and of electoral blocs which have expressed an intention to nominate candidates for participation in the parliamentary elections. Speaker Ivan Yemets noted that as of today 23 parties have received certificates of registration, the first ones being the Ukrainian Republican Party, the Communist Party, the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists in Ukraine, the Liberal and the Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine, and the Labor Congress of Ukraine. There have been no applications from party blocs to the Central Electoral Commission. The meeting heard a speech by Dmytro Tabachnyk, deputy head of the State Committee for Publications, on measures to ensure the timely preparation of electoral documents (ballot papers, posters containing pre-electoral programs, and biographical information on parliamentary candidates) for district electoral districts using the printing base of Ukraine's State Committee for Publications. They discussed the nomination of contenders for parliamentary posts and their registration and the question of implementing measures concerning the financing and material provision of the electoral campaign. It was stated in particular that the total estimate for the electoral campaign is more than 1 trillion karbovantsi; however, funds are being given both according to real need and in accordance with the possibilities that at present are not big. The meeting discussed the central electoral commission's plan of work for 1994. [passage indistinct]
