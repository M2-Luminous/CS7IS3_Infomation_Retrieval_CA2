The Ministry of Information, Coordination, and Culture issued a communique denying OAS/UN international civilian mission (MICIVIH) and U.S. State Department allegations and added that the lives of foreigners, especially U.S. citizens, were threatened during the presidency of Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide. On Friday, Washington decided to recall some of its personnel from the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince and has urged U.S. citizens to leave the country due to the "unstable political situation." The Information Ministry communique recalls "a series of incidents during the seven months of Aristide's administration, especially the Leogane affair, which resulted in the arrest of approximately 10 U.S. citizens and almost ended in their tragic death in a lynching inspired by President Aristide's violently anti-U.S. speeches." "How and why have they forgotten that anti-imperialism fueled state terrorism during that period and threatened -- fortunately this is a thing of the past -- the lives of U.S. citizens and the security of foreign embassy personnel and facilities," the text added. The communique also denounced the existence of a "systematic disparagement" campaign against Haiti, describing the attitude of the OAS/UN civilian mission as "weak" and adding that the State Department's behavior "could cause irreparable damage to Haiti."
