Rabah Kebir, spokesman-in-exile for the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS], said yesterday in an interview with MBC--despite the ban imposed on his activity by the German authorities--that the FIS will go along with the call for a dialogue, provided all prisoners are released. Here is a report from our correspondent Anis Abu-al-'Ila in Germany: [Begin recording] [Kebir] I believe that the conviction that negotiations are the key to a solution in Algeria is a suitable and civilized approach. However, we must wait for actual deeds. Although there is some seriousness, as I can see from some paragraphs in the speech, there are some contradictions as well. On one hand, Liamine Zeroual insists on using violence once again, while on the other he is insisting on dialogue. A clear-cut stance needs to be adopted. Yesterday, for instance, (al-Qulb) mountains were bombed by aircraft while the speech was being delivered, and these are confirmed reports. Once again we say that if there is a serious desire to hold negotiations, it will have to begin with releasing all prisoners, first and foremost the FIS leaders, and then allowing a meeting among FIS key figures under the leadership of its leaders, Abbassi Madani and Ali Belhadj. [Abu-al-'Ila] Does that mean you are ready for such a meeting as a first step toward a dialogue with the Algerian Government? [Kebir] What I am saying is that a final decision on this matter is up to the FIS leaders, once they are able to meet with their historic leadership. [end recording]
