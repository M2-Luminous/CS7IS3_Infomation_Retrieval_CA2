FBIS4-51760 "dreas085_d_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-085 Daily Report 3 May 1994 South Korea Gap Said Narrowed on Inspections Gap Said Narrowed on Inspections SK0305052994 Seoul YONHAP in English 0514 GMT 3 May 94 SK0305052994 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, May 3 (YONHAP) -- North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have narrowed their differences enough to allow an inspection team to arrive in Pyongyang as early as this week, sources here said. A letter sent by the agency Monday is expected to be their last communication, and the IAEA inspectors should be able to fly to North Korea as soon as Pyongyang responds, they said. The two sides have been wrangling over the scope of the inspection of North Korea's 5-megawatt nuclear reactor. Scrutinizing the reactor's fuel rods would allow the U.N. nuclear watchdog to trace Pyongyang's secretive nuclear weapons program and estimate how much plutonium it has. The sources said the IAEA is unlikely to conduct the inspections required to trace the program's history. However, the agency has compromised by agreeing to let North Korea seal the materials under IAEA monitoring for future inspection and analysis.
