FBIS4-66559 "jpnea020___94067" JPRS-NEA-94-020 JPRS Near East & South Asia 11 March 1994 SOUTH ASIA PAKISTAN Government Urged To Reject U.S. Aid, Dictates Government Urged To Reject U.S. Aid, Dictates 94AS0248F Karachi JASARAT in Urdu 11 Mar 94 p 3 94AS0248F Karachi JASARAT Urdu CSO [Editorial: "Principled Stand"] [Text] Foreign Minister Sardar Asaf Ahmed Ali, Foreign Secretary Shaharyar Khan, and the Pakistan ambassador to the United States Maliha Lodhi met with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in Prime Minister's house on Tuesday and exchanged views on Pakistan-United States relations. The prime minister said that using the Pressler amendment to stop aid to Pakistan is an extreme action. Pakistan is opposed to this unfair action as this amendment should have been imposed upon India also. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has taken a principled stand. The allegations on which the aid to Pakistan was stopped were totally false. This was done just because of the Indian propaganda. The United States used it to deprive Pakistan of aid and loans. The greatest accusation against Pakistan was that it was involved in making nuclear weapons. However, it is clear now that Pakistan never had such a program. Pakistan had started the nuclear program to control the energy crisis, and this program has been frozen for several years. Meanwhile, India is making gradual progress in its nuclear program. It is involved in making missiles that can reach their targets thousands of miles away. It has increased the national defense budget by 20 percent to increase its military strength. However, the United States is not willing to impose any kind of restriction against it, and has given it full freedom to become the supreme power in this region. The second serious allegation against Pakistan is about providing aid to the Sikhs involved in the Khalistan movement in East Punjab. Threats to declare Pakistan a terrorist nation were being made under this allegation. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, however, has unmasked these false accusations levied by India and the United States in a television interview with the BBC. Madam Bhutto's interview revealed that she had helped late Rajiv Gandhi control the Sikh movement in Punjab during her previous government. Had Pakistan not helped at that time, God knows where India would be now. Still, such is India's ungratefulness that it is bent upon condemning and hurting Pakistan. The truth is that India just cannot tolerate Pakistan's existence, and the United States because of the Indian propaganda is also bent upon annoying Pakistan. The U.S. approach is totally wrong and prejudiced. There is no reason for stopping aid to Pakistan using the Pressler amendment. If the United States remains adamant then we should understand that it is blackmailing Pakistan and wants to use it as a pawn in its international political chess game. However, it is a mistake and as this blackmail will not last long. Pakistan can survive and make progress without the U.S. aid. However, this is possible only if the pride of our nation is protected by a sincere, courageous and self-respecting leader.
