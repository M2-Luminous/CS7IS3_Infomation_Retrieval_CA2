The experts agree that this newly-completed Tokamak is the most advanced device in developing countries and that it will move fusion research in China into the world vanguard. The quasi-stable state operation carried out in this device is very important for fusion reactors. They feel that the HT-7 device has substantial flexibility and that this research work is very significant for fusion as a whole and that several important technologies can be further developed and applied in industry. The experts approved of the completion of the HT-7 in a very short time and under conditions of extremely limited funds. The goal of fusion research is to achieve mankind's "ultimate" clean energy resource and is an important topic in man's peaceful use of nuclear energy. The hybrid fusion-fission reactor project in China's high-tech plans is making preparations for producing large amounts of nuclear fuel using hybrid reactors in the next century. During the past 40 years, international fusion research has been relatively concentrated on high-temperature plasma confinement, heating, and other basic questions and has provided a substantial foundation for designing fusion reactors or hybrid reactors. However, there has been relatively little research on how to achieve a stable state or quasi-stable state high-temperature plasma and on its basic properties. Thus, this research project has become one of the realms that attracted the greatest amount of attention in fusion research at the present time, and will be the focus of China's hybrid reactor research for several years into the future. The HT-7 superconducting Tokamak system was built on the basis of broad-ranging international cooperation by the CAS Plasma Physics Institute and is the world's third largest superconducting Tokamak device at the present time. It has China's largest superconducting magnet system and China's largest low-temperature liquid helium system as well as China's biggest continuous high power microwave system and radio frequency system, more than 20 types of advanced testing and diagnostic systems, and a computer and data collection system that is capable of collecting and processing over 1 million pieces of data each second. Its primary objective is research on high-temperature stable-state plasma properties and to prepare for achieving continuous operation of Tokamak fusion reactors, which is also a question that is of the greatest concern in fusion research in the world now. Completion of the HT-7 has laid a foundation for China's fusion research to move to the world's leading edge in the next century. While discussing the construction of the HT-7 device, China's Plasma Physics Institute director and fusion expert Huo Yuping [7202 5940 1627] said that a basic research achievement must be a theory that has not been previously proposed by anyone, a phenomenon or experimental result that has not been observed, or a new experimental method. China's basic research should and must be opened up to the outside world and should participate in competition on a world scale. Only in this way can our basic research very quickly enter the world's leading edge in the entire field. Basic research cannot work only on attaining advanced levels within China. High-level international evaluations in several important fields or important projects are an effective way to spur China's basic research work to enter competition on a world scale as quickly as possible.
