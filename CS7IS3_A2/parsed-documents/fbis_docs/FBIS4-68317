It goes without saying that the space shuttle chassis does not rise a millimeter above its site on the Pushkin Embankment in the Gorkiy Central Park of Culture and Rest. The unique attraction is being opened on Cosmonautics Day. By means of monitors and computers it creates the total illusion of spaceflight. A complex operation preceded the appearance of the supersecret space technology at the center of Moscow. In fact it was transported on a special barge along the Moscow River from the NPO Molniya and the Tushino Machine Building plant; it was even necessary to lower the water level in the river by 20 cm for this purpose in order for the multiton monster to be able to pass under all the bridge spans. This Buran has not been in space. It is one of the more than 10 ships constructed by Molniya and intended for surface tests. It had successfully passed these tests. Specialists say that if engines were mounted on it and it underwent certain modifications it would be able to make a spaceflight. But, as is well known, the highly touted project was put on the shelf. And our Buran would not live on if it were not from dreamers at the AO Kosmos-Zemlya. They found a place for attractions and leased from the Central Park of Culture and Rest a half-hectare of land for a term of 20 years and outfitted a site for the ship. Then it was delivered to the site and now "preflight" work is at its height. "The tourist `space voyage' is to last for two hours," says Semen Lvov, general director of the AO. "The participants on the journey will occupy seats in the comfortable passenger cabin of the orbital ship. Then they will be familiarized with the structure of the Buran and the conditions under which it performs flight, learn about safety rules, will be able to participate in flight control and assist the crew in warding off a meteor attack. For some time they will experience a state of weightlessness and then the illusion of flight will be absolutely complete." The ship has "entered" a circumterrestrial orbit. Now it is time for a snack. Everyone is offered a dinner of real space food. The menu consists of more than 100 dishes prepared at the Institute of Nutrition for Space Technology for real cosmonauts. All the foods are tasty, nutritious and ecologically pure. "We will require 300 servings per day," continues Semen Lvov. "This is virtually a year's production for the institute. Accordingly our attraction, it might be said, will save it from bankruptcy and will prevent unemployment. "Circus actors have been invited to fill the `jobs' of crew members and in the course of the `play' their role will change. They even will be extraterrestrial beings. The stewards and stewardesses are now being recruited and trained. Incidentally, the company is inviting young people and girls to participate in the competition. Attractive and high-paying work in `space' awaits the winners." "The Buran passengers will receive personal tickets the same as plane passengers. In addition, they will receive special certificates as spaceflight participants. It goes without saying that this is nothing more than a pleasing souvenir, but nevertheless..." "The `flight' will cost an average of 29.50 dollars (in current rubles). The relatively high price for the most part is attributable to the expensiveness of the food products. The cost of the tickets varies, depending on the time of the flight (evening flights are more costly), on the makeup of the passengers (any sum may be charged for rich tourist groups). Plans call for complementary `flights' -- for orphaned children, for veterans of the Afghan war, etc." "Advertisements of different Russian and foreign firms are being placed on the Buran fuselage, on the chassis panels, on the lighting towers and showcase displays. Even now the director's office has received more than a few applications for the placement of advertisements. The site of the attraction is clearly visible from the Moscow River embankments and from the Crimean Bridge, along which passes one of the heavily travelled city routes -- the Sadovoye Ring. Between May and October recreational ships pass up and down the river; one of the wharves is situated on the grounds of the attraction. By agreement with the leading tourist agencies the attraction will be included in all tourist excursions. Incidentally, it is planned that tickets for the `space flight' will be sold at all airports in the world from which flights to Moscow are made." "The cost of 1 square meter of advertisement on the fuselage for six months is 3500 dollars or their equivalent in current rubles. The cost is less for the chassis panels, lighting towers and display showcases." "We do not intend to transform the Buran into a messy billboard," declared Yuriy Klebanov, the AO senior manager. "The advertisement will be moderate, of excellent quality and taste. If the number of applications exceeds the possibility for placement of advertisements we will hold a competition for advertisers. We wish that the spaceship -- one of the highest attainments in world space technology -- will become a favorite attraction for thousands of people."
