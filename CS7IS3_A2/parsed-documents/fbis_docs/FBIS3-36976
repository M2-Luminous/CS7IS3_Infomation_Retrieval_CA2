Although, in principle, the appointment could have been regarded as a fait accompli and, therefore, was not included in the agenda of the session, figuring only as the speaker's announcement, it triggered a stormy debate in the chamber today. This is explained by the fact that Andrey Voykov had so far held the post of assistant head of the presidential administration and this determined the attitude of some deputies to his candidature. In the course of the debate, triggered by the speaker's announcement, it became clear that representatives of the factions of the Agrarian Party, the Communist Party, and the Liberal-Democratic Party were in principle against this candidature. Finally, however, the right to make the final decision was left to the speaker. Most deputies, attending the session, voted against Rybkin presenting the new head of the Duma apparatus to them today.
