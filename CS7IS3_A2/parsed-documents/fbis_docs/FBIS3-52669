In a periodic assessment submitted to the prime minister, the sources said that if the deadlock in the talks lingers on, the PLO will become paralyzed and Israel will have to contend with Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]. The sources added that the ongoing stalemate is adversely affecting Palestinian public opinion, which is now doubtful of the Oslo agreement and is thus putting Fatah on the defensive and strengthening Hamas. There are all sorts of pressures on 'Arafat, emphasized an intelligence source: "From below, by the younger intifada-experienced local leaders; from central figures in the PLO inner-circles, such as Abu-Mazin [Muhammad 'Abbas] and Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh; and from the former Palestinian delegation to the peace talks, which is demanding a more democratic decision-making process." A similar assessment was presented to the cabinet yesterday by the government's coordinator of activities in the territories, Maj. Gen. Dani Rothschild. Military sources added that signs of a rift in the making are evident in Jordanian-PLO relations. The sources confirmed that King Husayn is "dismayed" with 'Arafat's reluctance to proceed with an agreement with Jordan. [The Jerusalem political correspondent of Tel Aviv HATZOFE in Hebrew adds on page 2 of its 3 January edition that Rothschild further told the cabinet that Jordan has been punishing the PLO for its failure to honor its agreements by banning citrus fruit exports from Gaza through the Jordan River bridges and by delaying the opening of Jordanian bank branches in the territories.] Based on this information, Rabin told the cabinet that "Israel is in no hurry" to conclude a deal, adding that from now on, all understandings will be "in writing."
