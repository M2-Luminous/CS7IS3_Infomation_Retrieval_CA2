FR940919-0-00123 FR940919-0-00016 (3) The waste must be treated using the technology specified in the table (``technology standard''), which are described in detail in § 268.42, Table 1_Technology Codes and Description of Technology-Based Standards. (b) For wastewaters, compliance with concentration level standards is based on maximums for any one day, except for D004 through D011 wastes for which the previously promulgated treatment standards based on grab samples remain in effect. For all nonwastewaters, compliance with concentration level standards is based on grab sampling. For wastes covered by the waste extract standards, the test Method 1311, the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure found in ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods'', EPA Publication SW&hyph;846, as incorporated by reference in § 260.11, must be used to measure compliance. An exception is made for D004 and D008, for which either of two test methods may be used: Method 1311, or Method 1310, the Extraction Procedure Toxicity Test. For wastes covered by a technology standard, the wastes may be land disposed after being treated using that specified technology or an equivalent treatment technology approved by the Administrator under the procedures set forth in §268.42(b). (c) When wastes with differing treatment standards for a constituent of concern are combined for purposes of treatment, the treatment residue must meet the lowest treatment standard for the constituent of concern. (d) Notwithstanding the prohibitions specified in paragraph (a) of this section, treatment and disposal facilities may demonstrate (and certify pursuant to 40 CFR 268.7(b)(5)) compliance with the treatment standards for organic constituents specified by a footnote in the table ``Treatment Standards for Hazardous Wastes'' in this section, provided the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The treatment standards for the organic constituents were established based on incineration in units operated in accordance with the technical requirements of 40 CFR part 264, subpart O, or based on combustion in fuel substitution units operating in accordance with applicable technical requirements; (2) The treatment or disposal facility has used the methods referenced in paragraph (d)(1) of this section to treat the organic constituents; and (3) The treatment or disposal facility may demonstrate compliance with organic constituents if good-faith analytical efforts achieve detection limits for the regulated organic constituents that do not exceed the treatment standards specified in this section by an order of magnitude. (e) For characteristic wastes (D001, D002, and D012&hyph;D043 that are subject to treatment standards in the following table ``Treatment Standards for Hazardous Wastes,'' all underlying hazardous constituents (as defined in §268.2(i)) must meet Universal Treatment Standards, found in §268.48, Table UTS, prior to land disposal. (f) The treatment standards for F001&hyph;F005 nonwastewater constituents carbon disulfide, cyclohexanone, and/or methanol apply to wastes which contain only one, two, or three of these constituents. Compliance is measured for these constituents in the waste extract from test Method 1311, the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure found in ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods'', EPA Publication SW&hyph;846, as incorporated by reference in § 260.11. If the waste contains any of these three constituents along with any of the other 25 constituents found in F001&hyph;F005, then compliance with treatment standards for carbon disulfide, cyclohexanone, and/or methanol are not required.
