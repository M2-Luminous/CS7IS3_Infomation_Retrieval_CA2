(FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT, 6 March 94) PDP Spearheads Drive To Get Albanians Into Police Jobs An appeal by the ethnic Albanian Party for Democratic Prosperity, PDP, urges "all candidates interested in employment in the Interior Ministry" who have recently filed documents at the "Headquarters" branch of the PDP in Skopje to retrieve these documents, complete them in accordance with the competition's requirements, and present them at the regional units of the Interior Ministry -- the police stations. (FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT, 11 March 94) Albanians Object to Treatment by Kercovo Internal Affairs Units At the request of PDP council members, a meeting was held with representatives of the Directorate for General Juridical Operations and the Sector for Internal Affairs in Kercovo to discuss the mistreatment Albanians have encountered when they request legal documents, according to an article. The PDP representatives demanded the employment of more Albanians in these organizations. "Albanians in the northern part of Kercovo are not at all satisfied with the service of the Macedonian employees in the internal affairs offices of the country. Citizens must wait for days to get ordinary documents or certificates, while Macedonians are able to get them with just a telephone call," the PDP representatives are cited as saying. Because of such delays, the representatives asked that the offices in Osllome (Oslomej) and Zajas be staffed by Albanians, as more than 9O percent of the residents of these areas are of Albanian nationality. Even though the new passports are written in the Latin alphabet, some letters are replaced by Cyrillic letters, causing some ethnic Albanians employed outside the country to demand new passports, the article notes. It goes on to point out that the representatives of the Directorate General and of the Sector for Internal Affairs declared that the appropriate ministries would be informed of these controversies, but they also asked that citizens not request documents that are not needed, pointing out, for example, that new identification cards are not required because the existing ones will be valid until the law is approved. There was also a discussion of the need to train Albanian youths for the police force, the article concludes. (FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT, 25 February 94) Struga Interior Ministry Unit Urged To Hire More Albanians A group of PDP council members met with Stefan Perdulloski, head of the regional unit of the Interior Ministry in Struga, to urge that the procedure for registering the population be accelerated and facilitated, another article reports. They also called for the proportional employment of Albanians in the Interior Ministry unit in Struga, for the acceptance of Albanians into the police force in proportion to their percentage of the population, and for more Albanian students to be admitted to the Interior Ministry secondary school, the report notes. In addition, PDP representatives presented a demand for the employment of Albanians in offices in places such as Veleshte, Ladorisht, Drasllajce, and Struga to Faruk Qazimoski, chief of the Officers Service.
