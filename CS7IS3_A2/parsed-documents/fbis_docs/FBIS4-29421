FBIS4-29421 "dreas117_d_94023" FBIS-EAS-94-117 Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 South Korea * Presidential Adviser on Kim Yong-sam Policy * Presidential Adviser on Kim Yong-sam Policy 942C0113A Seoul SINDONG-A in Korean May 94 pp 224-230 942C0113A Seoul SINDONG-A Korean CSO [By reporter Song Mun-hong] [Text] The North Korean nuclear issue became a focus of world attention when Pyongyang declared its withdrawal from the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) on 12 March last year, only 15 days after the start of the Kim Yong-sam government. More than a year has passed since then, but the issue remains unresolved and no light is seen at the end of the long, long tunnel. The nuclear issue is proving to be an increasingly heavy burden on the new government committed to a civilian age. The discontent of the people is also on the rise amid the battles procrastinating between North and South Korea and between North Korea and the international community. There have been frictions between hard-liners and moderates, confusion between ministries and agencies, and conflicting remarks by the president. Public criticisms have intensified, both in range and tone. In an interview with this reporter, Chong Chong-uk, the senior presidential secretary for foreign policy and national security, who was one of the "quartette of scholars" in the first cabinet of the new government, first referred to the criticisms and said that "as one of the government officials responsible, I feel sorry for the people that the nuclear issue is still unresolved." The interview was held in Chong's Chongwadae office on 9 April, the very next day of the first session held by the Security Policy Coordinating Council, a new organ for adjustments on policies relating to the nuclear issue, which the government created to cope with mounting criticisms by media over controversial remarks made by officials one after another since late March--including those by Ambassador Hwang Pyong-tae and Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong. [Song Mun-hong] There has been strong criticism against our government's policy concerning the North Korean nuclear issue in the past year. Especially, many people point to the fact that differences between the advocates of dialogue and the hard-liners remain unresolved. [Chong Chong-uk] "I am hoping that our people will understand these points: First, the government is holding on to its position seeking a peaceful settlement on the issue. "Second, it is, essentially, an issue difficult to resolve by our independent will and capability alone. While an issue between North and South Korea, it is also an international issue. It is a dual issue in nature. Therefore, it requires exploring for a settlement through two axes. "Under the present circumstances, a North-South mutual inspection through dialogue is a dead plan, while our discretionary power under international cooperation system is, inevitably, a very much limited one. "Hence, it has been unavoidable, I think, that the government appeared to be shifting between a pro-dialogue course and a tough line depending on whether the nuclear issue was in a good or in a strained situation. In other words, I would like to point out that it all reflects the fundamental nature of the issue, not any deficiencies in the diplomatic ability of the government. "Another point is that the people have been extremely sensitive to the nuclear issue. They were very sensitive to developments as the issue was taken to the UN Security Council following North Korea's rejection of the IAEA inspection. Accordingly, the government cannot but be extremely cautious not to cause uneasiness among them." Chong Chong-uk disclosed that the new government had set out with a policy concept on North Korea that was quite innovative. It was based on that concept, he said, that President Kim declared in his inauguration speech that "no alliance can supersede the interests of the nation." The senior Chongwadae secretary explained that the president's statement reflected his ambition to free the nation from an alliance based on its Cold War-era posture toward North Korea and the anticommunist ideology and to establish a new relationship worthy of the post-Cold War era. The progressive posture, however, faced a setback when North Korea declared its withdrawal from the NPT, he said. [Song] With regard to its responses in the past year, there have been widespread complaints that our government was shunned in negotiations with the United States and that it kept making concessions to North Korean demands. Is the government now prepared to take a firmer position? [Chong] "My view is that it is neither necessary nor desirable to keep up with the so-called brinkmanship diplomacy of North Korea. Should we respond with our version of brinkmanship, we will have to follow carefully-thought-out tactics to keep us from falling off the precipice together. If North Korea had really been prepared to go to war, it would not have even mentioned the word war, never. So, I see the recent `Seoul in a sea of fire' remark by the North Korean delegate [at Panmunjom] as part of a shrewd psychological tactic against our people." [Song] A series of comments on North Korea by President Kim Yong-sam have caused repercussions. Some even accused Chongwadae secretaries of failing to properly assist the president. [Chong] "The reportedly controversial comments were quoted out of context, I believe. For instance, a careful study of the context about the sentence 'we cannot shake hands with those who possess nuclear weapons indicates that the president never meant to say that he will hold no dialogue with North Korea. He meant to say that the North Korean nuclear issue is so important that an era of coexistence and co-prosperity can come only when it has been resolved. The expression he used was intended to emphasize his position that gives top priority to national security, not to say that North Korea has nuclear weapons or that there will be no meetings with it until the nuclear issue has been resolved. "The same thing can be said about the president's 25 February remark that `a summit is possible if it is to help achieve a settlement on the nuclear issue.' An exchange of special envoys was first proposed by the North Korean side. The proposal that all North-South problems, including the nuclear issue, be discussed and settled at a summit also came from the North Korean side, did it not? When the president made the remark at issue, both sides had agreed on working-level contacts for an exchange of special envoys; under such circumstances, the president meant to say that `there isnothing I wouldn't do if it was for achieving settlement on the nuclear issue.' "Media overinterpreted the president's comments, claiming that he made contradictory remarks, thus deliberately distorting the president's original intent." [Song] We even hear criticism that the president has no basic understanding of the nuclear issue. [Chong] "It is a grave misunderstanding about the president. Needless to say, the nuclear issue has technically complicated aspects. Speaking for myself, although I have been absorbed in this issue almost daily since the start of the new government, there still are many things I am unable to understand. The president bears overall responsibility for state affairs, and I don't think he needs to be familiar with specific, technical details. And when I brief him of the nuclear issue, I do not include such details. "For what the nuclear issue means politically, and for things a supreme leader should know about the nuclear issue, the president has perfect understanding. He usually uses the kind of expression that does not resort to a logical way of explanation on this or that. While thinking very deeply, he expresses the thought in sentences short but full of implications. That is his style. "As a result, when such implicative thoughts are delivered in general terms, the public may have difficulty in correctly grasping the meaning, I think. I am not saying this to defend the president as a senior secretary for him. But I must say that what I have been feeling about the president briefing him on developments in the nuclear issue over a year is considerably different from reports in media. The North Korean nuclear issue is the most important of all issues. How could the president be unconcerned about it?" [Song] A look at developments in our nuclear policy indicates that there often were differences and confrontations between ministries and agencies concerned. Also, we hear criticisms that in the system of cooperation with the United States, the roles of the two sides are not properly defined. It is also said that U.S. officials have a complaint that they cannot make out what the Korean government's nuclear policy is all about. [Chong] "With respect to responses to the nuclear issue, there are differences among U.S. authorities, too. It is a fact, of course, that within our government, there are some differences in views between ministries and agencies. It would be rather unrealistic and unnatural, I think, if all the ministries and agencies concerned should come up with an identical view about the nuclear issue. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs takes the position seeking a diplomatic settlement while the National Unification Board gives priority to North-South relations. At the same time, the Ministry of National Defense and the Agency for National Security Planning have their respective views. "Eventually, under the presidential system, the president decides the direction of national policy based on his comprehensive judgment. Inter-ministry differences are put through this inner coordinating process, which, when viewed from outside, might appear to be a wavering between hard-line and moderate approaches. This has something to do with what I mentioned earlier--our limitations within the international community and the fundamental nature of the nuclear issue. Let me emphasize that there is absolutely no such thing as the inter-ministry differences which directly lead to policy confusion. "One more thing. I know the fact that a small number of Americans are saying that they `cannot make out what the Korean policy is all about.' As for us, we must, in dealing with the nuclear issue, display tactical flexibility while holding on to our principles firmly. This process inevitably involves dilemmas. When efforts for a through-dialogue settlement fail to produce results, causing tension and a sense of crisis in the Korean Peninsula, we are forced to take the position of putting the brake on the international community, the United States in particular. From the U.S. point of view, it could appear that Korea often takes a hard-line approach but--when the United States actually tries to take a tough stand -- puts a curb on it." [Song] The North Korean nuclear issue can be viewed from two separate angles: the special inspection to ascertain the lack of transparency of North Korean nuclear activities prior to the IAEA inspection of May 1992, and the temporary, general inspection for the continuity of nuclear safeguards thereafter. Also, when the North Korean nuclear issue is viewed from another two points of view--namely, the issue being used by North Korea as a trump card and as a tactic to gain time for actual development of nuclear weapons--we can assume that the situation becomes more unfavorable for us as time passes by. Also, the atmosphere in the United States is showing a subtle change, according to many scholars. From the U.S. point of view, the issue is critical more for the importance it attaches to the preservation of a global NPT system than for the stability on the Korean Peninsula. Meanwhile, arguments that the United States will be compelled to tolerate one to three nuclear bombs which North Korea may already have are gaining ground both in and out of the U.S. government. The quarterly journal FOREIGN AFFAIRS carried an article even calling for U.S. troop withdrawal from Korea. The point is that U.S. troops should not be left on the Korean Peninsula, a danger zone, at a time when North Korea apparently has nuclear weapons. Is our government prepared to deal with these problems? [Chong] "You are saying that the present situation remains unchanged from a year ago or even shows deteriorations. As I said earlier, our influence in the international community is a limited one; nevertheless, we achieved IAEA inspections, intermittent though, in the past year, paving the way for an assessment of North Korea's nuclear development to some degrees. I would like to count it as an achievement if it can be called that. "Second, regarding the question of whether North Korea now has nuclear weapons, and whether the possibility of North Korea having developed nuclear weapons has increased now that a long time has passed since its withdrawal from the NPT in March 1993 or since May 1992...so far, no one in any country in the world has produced firm evidence of North Korea's possession of nuclear weapons. While media have carried a wide range of conflicting speculations, the government has confirmed that at present there is no specific, irrefutable evidence that North Korea has nuclear weapons. "Third, with respect to your question if the U.S. policy is shifting from halting North Korea's nuclear program to imposing a freeze on it at the present level, my answer is that it is not. A careful study of opinions recently voiced in the United States indicates that no one has ever said that the United States would tolerate North Korea's possession of nuclear weapons. "In its current position, the United States divides its policy goal into two phases, striving for a settlement by stage. Efforts for accurate information on North Korean nuclear activities through temporary inspections and for a freeze on them represent the first phase, while realization of special inspections to secure the transparency of North Korean nuclear activities prior to May 1992 constitute its second phase. These are the goals of the two nations, Korea and the United States. It is not intended to abandon special inspections after all." [Song] Some specialists say that if North Korea conceals its nuclear weapons, it is impossible to uncover them even through special inspections and North-South mutual inspections, and that therefore, it is a matter of political judgement on the part of the president to secure complete transparency on North Korean nuclear weapons. "It is not so. If special inspections and North-South mutual inspections are carried out, accurate data can be obtained on North Korean nuclear activities in the past. Special inspections will produce accurate figures on the quantities of nuclear material which North Korea extracted in the past by operating its reprocessing facilities. The mission of the IAEA is to ensure that nuclear activities are not diverted for military purposes; therefore, if inspections produce evidence of such diversion, it is to lead to another round of discussion. "Furthermore, there is the Joint Statement of Denuclearization in effect between North and South Korea, which precludes not only the possession of reprocessing facilities and enriched uranium but also the deployment, manufacturing and possession of nuclear weapons in the Korean Peninsula. If North Korea has nuclear weapons, we can demand their dismantling under this joint statement." [Song] But it is still possible that Pyongyang conceals its nuclear weapons somewhere in North Korea, is it not? [Chong] "In that case, there is legal basis for the IAEA and our government to make an effort to find them. If another problem arises after the transparency has been secured on North Korean nuclear weapons, it shall be discussed then. In the present stage, I do not think it is a right approach to the issue to abandon our current efforts by saying that `North Korea may already have nuclear weapons.' "What we need now is to find out how much weapon-worth material North Korea has secured through its nuclear activities in the past. At present, our problem is that we are not only unaware of all the facts about North Korea's past activities but also unable to shut off its possibility of continuing nuclear activities in the future." [Song] The Security Policy Coordinating Council held its first meeting yesterday. The creation of the new council, on one hand, appears to be a show of the president's will to control discords among ministries and agencies as reported; on the other, however, it overlaps the existing councils that make decisions concerning the nuclear issue. Some say that it is like adding a fifth wheel to a coach. [Chong] "There were four similar councils established earlier--the National Security Council, the Council of Unification-Related Ministers, the High-Level Strategy Council, and the Council of Security-Related Ministers. The National Security Council is a constitutional organ, which seldom met in the past. The Council of Unification-Related Ministers meets about once a month on nuclear- and unification-related issues, presided over by the deputy prime minister for unification affairs. It is deficient in promptness and effectiveness. The High-Level Strategy Council was originally created to prepare strategy for the North-South High-Level Talks, which are prime minister-level contacts. Although media reported that this council met frequently in the past, the sessions were quite irregular. "Finally, the Council of Security-Related Ministers, chaired by the president, has its problems because it is realistically difficult for the president to have a hand in working-level business. Thus, it is not very effective in dealing with issues requiring quick responses. "I understand that those were the reasons why the Security Policy Coordinating Council was created recently by a presidential directive. The new council meets every week. It is for the heads of offices concerned with the nuclear issue--the deputy prime minister for unification affairs, the minister of foreign affairs, the minister of national defense, the director of the Agency for National Security Planning, the Chongwadae secretary general, and the senior presidential secretary for foreign policy and national security--to meet regularly for more prompt responses." Since its inauguration, the Kim Yong-sam government has apologized to the people five times altogether, including three times in connection with the opening of the nation's rice market. Should it fail to resolve the nuclear issue satisfactorily, however, no amount of apology would suffice. It is because the nuclear issue is directly linked to the destiny of our 40 million people and, further, that of the entire Korean nation. Senior Presidential Secretary Chong Chong-uk said that the government is "doing everything in its power" to get the nuclear issue resolved. In fact, however, the government has so far been merely absorbed in confrontations and frictions, giving no such impression as that it is "doing everything in its power." Only when it proves to the people that it is "doing everything in its power" will the Kim Yong-sam government perhaps be able to come out of the prolonged "North Korean nuclear issue" tunnel.
