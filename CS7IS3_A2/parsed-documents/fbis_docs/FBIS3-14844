"This is not a matter of the individuals to whom the decision applies. This is a matter of principle. A precedent is being created in society when the article `Political Rehabilitation' is extended to criminals or people charged with committing crimes," he told an ITAR-TASS correspondent. "This is incomprehensible to Russian society and to the rest of the world, and it is this aspect that should be clarified first and foremost." Filatov, who is in Switzerland to take part in a Russian-Swiss academic seminar organized by the Institute of Federalism of the Fribourg University, said in the interview he regretted that the Constitutional Court was not working. In his words, the court ought to decide whether the decision of the Duma was constitutional. "If we have decided to live according to the Constitution, then this ought to be justified by the Constitution." The concept of "political amnesty" presumes that there was a political offense. "But what is at issue are people that have committed a criminal offense," Sergey Filatov continued. "And this criminal offense cannot be given an amnesty by the said resolution. Because neither the carrying of arms, nor the use or keeping of arms, nor calls to use violence -- all the things that these people are accused of -- can be given an amnesty. That is the craftiness of it. In general, it has no legal precedent." The head of the Russian Federation Presidential Administration reminded that two people who used arms have already been convicted by the court. "The court has ruled and they are already in prison. What kind of political amnesty can one talk of here?" The intentions of those who initiated the decision are clear: "To reach peaceful accord, to refrain from stirring up the things that happened. They must be stirred up," Filatov believes. "The culprits should be identified by name. We have been moving toward this goal for longer than 24 hours. Unfortunately, we have been moving toward this goal for almost a year, starting from the Seventh Congress. All the conciliatory initiatives by the president were met with a categorical rejection, there was aggression and hostility that put one part of society at loggerheads with another. Somebody must answer for that." "When people speak about political amnesty, I would like first of all to define its meaning," the head of the presidential administration remarked. "If there are political crimes in our country, those guilty must be found here, too. Is it somehow related to the political rehabilitation of people who were sentenced and repressed at one time? No, the situation is totally different, and I believe therefore, that a full stop should be put here in a legal appraisal."
