It should help get people off the welfare rolls and relieve the State's financial burden of taking care of them. Last year, 900,000 workers were laid off, mostly from firms that restructured or went bankrupt. The figure for 1992 was 350,000. The dramatic rise is partly attributed to enterprise reform. More unemployed people means that workers have had to work harder -- and wait longer -- to find a new job, said Zhang Xin of the ministry's employment department. He said that before 1992 most people would find work within five months. Now the wait often exceeds six months, costing the government dearly in unemployment pay. Statistics indicate that in the first half of last year the nation's jobless received 108 million yuan ($12.4 million) in unemployment insurance benefits, compared with 130 million yuan ($14.9 million) between 1987 and 1992. But the country's unemployment insurance fund -- supported by government appropriations and corporate contributions -- is limited. Last year it was about 3 billion yuan ($345 million). Unemployed workers get 75 yuan ($8.5) per month. Those with less than one year's working experience are not eligible for unemployment benefits; those who have worked one to five years get benefits for 12 months; and those with more than five years get benefits for up to 24 months. According to the ministry's programme, people out of work for more than six months have to attend a monthly conference sponsored by local labour service departments. If they fail to attend, their welfare benefits will be cut off. At the meetings, officials will issue labour market information. provide job-hunting tips and offer re-employment training services. They also issue recommendation letters to enterprises indicating the kind of training the workers received. For those who have been unemployed for more than a year, authorities will organize meetings between enterprises and the jobless. Companies that hire the unemployed workers will get unemployment insurance from labour departments to cover part of the worker's salary. Enterprises can also employ people on a three-month trial basis. Efforts are underway to expand unemployment insurance to all city employees, but at present only unemployed workers dismissed by firms that have gone bankrupt or have merged are eligible for unemployment insurance. If workers attend the re-employment programmes and still fail to find jobs, they get insurance for another three months. Workers can get preferential policies when paying taxes and applying for bank loans if they decide to find jobs by themselves. "This programme is also an effort to transform the government's functions," Zhang said. "In the past, laid off people were usually assigned by labour departments to other units. But now we do not enjoy the same administrative power so we are providing re- employment services." The programme is expected to begin on a trial basis next month in Liaoning, Shandong, Zhejiang, Fujian, Henan, Hebei, Hunan, Guangdong, Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces as well as in Shanghai. If it is successful, it will likely be promoted nationwide in 1995.
