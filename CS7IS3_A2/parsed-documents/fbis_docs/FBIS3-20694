They must be informed of all the relevant factors that have led to the growing international isolation of Croatia and the threat of international sanctions. 4) The introduction of sanctions against Croatia would be counterproductive, as confirmed by the case of Serbia, and they must be avoided in the interest of the majority of the population which would be hardest hit.
