In January, the authorities registered 13,154 applicants, which is 879 fewer than last December, Erwin Marschewski, domestic-policy spokesman for the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] Bundestag group, told DPA on Wednesday [2 February]. Even the December number of 14,033 registered asylum-applicants had been described by the Federal Interior Ministry as being the lowest figure since March 1991. Marschewski pointed out than in January 1993 as many as 36,279 persons applied for asylum. The decrease in the number of applicants by more than half, which was initiated last July when the new asylum law came into force, is "most encouraging," Marschewski said.
