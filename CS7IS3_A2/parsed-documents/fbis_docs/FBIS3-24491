Dashyan; UDC 621.373.826.038.825.2] [Abstract] Passive synchronization of the modes of YAG:Nd and YAlO[.sup]3[/] lasers using CuInS[.sup]2x[/]Se[.sub]2(1- x)[/]-doped glasses is discussed. The optical block diagram of the laser is provided and its functioning is described. The laser resonator is formed by a spherical mirror and a planar output mirror. A passive synchronization of modes was obtained when glasses with CuInS[.sup]1.2[/]Se[.sub]0.8[/] monocrystal were used as passive gates in pulsed solid state neodymium lasers. The pulse width was 36 and 16 ns for the YAG:Nd-and YAlO[.sup]3[/]:Nd lasers, respectively. The passive gates operate as saturating absorbers at low intensities and perform negative feed-back at high radiation intensities. The glasses with CuInS[.sup]2x[/]Se[.sub]2(1-x)[/] are a promising material for semiconductor cavity saturating absorbers for solid state lasers operating in a self-starting mode. The saturating absorbers exhibit a rapid relaxation, and have low losses and high saturation intensities. They can operate in a nonlinear mode within resonators of solid state lasers, interacting with pulse intensities in a pico range. The required operating wave length can be selected within the 0.9-1.3 ï¿½m range by changing the stoichiometry coefficient and composition of the glass.
