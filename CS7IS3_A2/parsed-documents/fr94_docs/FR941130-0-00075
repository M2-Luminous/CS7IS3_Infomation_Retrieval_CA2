FR941130-0-00075 FR941130-0-00012 §201&hyph;20.305&hyph;1 Regulatory delegations. * * * * * (a) *␣*␣* (1) FIP equipment, software, services, and support services when the total estimated dollar value of all of the FIP resources to be acquired under the contract, including all optional items and all option periods, does not exceed $20,000,000 ($2,000,000 for a specific make and model or a requirement available from only one responsible source) for Department of the Air Force, Department of the Army, Department of Defense/Office of the Secretary of Defense, Department of Energy, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of the Navy, Department of Transportation, Department of the Treasury, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration; $10,000,000 ($1,000,000 for a specific make and model or a requirement available from only one responsible source) for Department of Agriculture, Department of Commerce, Environmental Protection Agency, General Services Administration, Department of the Interior, Department of Justice, Department of State, and Department of Veterans Affairs; $5,000,000 ($500,000 for a specific make or model or a requirement available from only one responsible source) for all agencies; and if either paragraph (a)(1) (i), (ii), or (iii) of this section applies: * * * * * (c) When an agency acquires FIP resources through the Small Business Administration's 8(a) Program, the regulatory delegations in paragraph (a)(1) above apply unless an agency is granted specific agency delegations with different thresholds. If a requirement to be satisfied through the 8(a) Program is for a specific make and model or is one that is available from only one responsible source, the lower of the two specific agency delegation thresholds (or, if none exists, the FIRMR regulatory delegation thresholds) applies. For all other acquisitions, the higher of the two specific agency delegation thresholds (or, if none exists, the FIRMR regulatory delegation thresholds) apply. For acquisitions conducted through SBA's 8(a) Program, a requirement available from only one responsible source is one for which only one source of supply or service exists. The fact that the requirement is directed to one particular source under SBA's 8(a) Program does not necessarily mean the requirement is available from only one responsible source. When using an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract, the FIRMR thresholds apply to the maximum value of all combined FIP resources (including optional periods and quantities), not the minimum guaranteed value.
