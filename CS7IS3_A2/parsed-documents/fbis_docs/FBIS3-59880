Now that the agreement has signed, the treasury will transfer the money that will make it possible to pay November's salaries. According to the new agreement, hundreds of workers will be laid off, in all the AI plants and in the top leadership. Those 50 and over, will leave the company in the framework of early retirement, while workers under 50 will go as part of a round of layoffs with compensation. The management decided yesterday to open a counselling center for laid-off workers. This center will try to help them find alternative work and also advise them on how to invest their severance pay. The treasury has committed itself to funding the layoffs of all 2,900 workers, and for that, will be transferring approximately $330 million to AI's accounts, in accord with the rate the layoffs are carried. The AI management began yesterday preparing to pay debts amounting to $70 million to the company's suppliers and subcontractors. They are also preparing for a similar settlement with the banks, which the company owes $500 million. The company will finish the year with an operating loss of about $70 million. The total loss will be much greater, because it will include the severance payments and the early pensions for those who have been laid off.
