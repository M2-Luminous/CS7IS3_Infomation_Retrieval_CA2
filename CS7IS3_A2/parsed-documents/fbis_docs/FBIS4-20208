"The West European nuclear lobby is trying to get into Slovakia and replace Bohunice with another nuclear power station. In the West, nuclear power can no longer be put forward as a solution, and there is thus an attempt here to conquer the hopeful market in East Europe," Rauch-Kallat said in a press statement. The participation of the American firm Westinghouse in the completion of Temelin nuclear power station in South Bohemia is clearly considered a green light for further similar activity, the minister warned. In her contacts with Slovak leaders, therefore, she had repeatedly emphasized Austrian fears. "We have also found out that the possibility of changing Bohunice into a gas-fired power station is becoming more and more the subject of serious discussion," Rauch-Kallat said, adding that a significant contribution towards this had been made by an Austrian-Swiss study showing that such a project was feasible. Members of the Austrian environmental movement Global 2000 protested in Vienna today against the participation by the French company Electricite de France (EdF) in the completion of the Mochovce nuclear power station in West Slovakia. Activists abseiled off the roof of the EdF building in Vienna and hung up a banner saying "EdF -- Hands off Mochovce." Global 2000 say Mochovce is only a gateway to the East European nuclear market for EdF, and that the company is mainly planning to modernize VVER-440/213 reactors. Besides Westinghouse, EdF is the most significant supporter of nuclear power in East Europe, they add.
