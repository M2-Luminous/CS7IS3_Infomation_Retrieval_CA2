FBIS4-4157 "drchi083_b_94008" FBIS-CHI-94-083 Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 United States & Canada China, U.S. SEC Sign Memorandum on Stock Listings China, U.S. SEC Sign Memorandum on Stock Listings OW2804154894 Beijing XINHUA in English 1429 GMT 28 Apr 94 OW2804154894 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Beijing, April 28 (XINHUA) -- Five Chinese companies will be listed this year on the American stock market, making the United States the second market after Hong Kong to accept Chinese firms seeking direct overseas listings. A memorandum of understanding [MOU] was signed here today by Arthur Levitt, chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and Liu Hongru, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), on behalf of the two countries' securities authorities. The five Chinese firms, selected from a group of 22 candidate companies for overseas listings this year, include the China Eastern Airline Company, China Southern Airline Company, Huaneng International Power Company, Huaneng Dezhou Power Company and Tianjin Steel Pipe Factory. At a press conference after the signing ceremony of the MOU, CSRC Chairman Liu Hongru said the five companies are in top gear making preparations and have finalized agreements with law, auditing and accounting firms to represent them as well as investment banks. Liu did not give the timetable for the listings and insisted that CSRC will stick to the standards to ensure the success of the listings, despite the eagerness of the companies. He predicted that the earliest possible listing might be made after June. According to Liu, the remaining 17 Chinese firms will all be listed on the Hong Kong market, though a small proportion of the shares might be listed in the U.S. after the global offering and first trading in Hong Kong. Stock exchanges of other countries, including Singapore, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom have also expressed hopes for Chinese listings, said Liu. "Our market is young and we lack experience in direct overseas listing," said Liu. "It (the overseas listing) is a step-by-step process. At present, we are in no haste to go to other foreign markets." The Sino-U.S. memorandum of understanding also embraces the SEC's technical assistance for its Chinese counterparts, which features consultancy on a regulatory framework including drafting laws and regulations, personnel training and internship programs for CSRC staff at the SEC and with U.S. financial institutions as well.
