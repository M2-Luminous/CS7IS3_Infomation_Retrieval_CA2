Wichit said that the Navy initially would purchase only one frigate as Thailand and the US still had to discuss details such as expenses for training crews and providing weapons on the ships. "We have to thoroughly check everything first," he said. Wichit said the frigates would be bought under a hire-purchase arrangement, which was considerably cheaper than buying new ships at BtlO billion each. The hire-purchase agreement will take effect in 1995 under a contract which has to be renewed every five years. Wichit said that the Navy would stop payments after the frigates reached 75 per cent of their life-span. Meanwhile, commenting a report that the military was unhappy with its tight budget allocation, Wichit said that military accountants were trying to operate in line with government policy. "We will spend on things which need prime attention first. However, we can ask the government to increase the budget if necessary," he said, adding that the final decision rested with the government. Wichit conceded, however, that the budget restrictions would have some effect on the military structure. He stressed that the main duty of the armed forces was to protect the country. He added that an intelligence centre was crucial to the successful performance of the military.
