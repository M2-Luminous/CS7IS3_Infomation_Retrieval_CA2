The plane failed to respond to the relevant Russian services. The Air Defense Troops informed the plane's crew that overflight of Russian territory was forbidden. However, ignoring the ban, the plane continued on its course and entered 80 km into Russian airspace. At 1410 the plane, accompanied by the Air Defense Troops' fighter planes, was forced to land at the airport in Adler. It was established that the plane belongs to the United States, flying the Frankfurt-am-Main - Tbilisi route. No flight plans involving overflight of Russian territory were filed. The Russian Foreign Ministry expects the American side to adopt disciplinary measures concerning those guilty of the incident, so as to prevent similar dangerous incidents from occuring in the future. The U.S. Ambassador promised to inform the United States leadership immediately of the Russian statement. He expressed gratitude for the fact that in this extraordinary situation the Russian authorities showed tact and understanding and that, once the situation was cleared, the plane was allowed to continue on its way to Tbilisi.
