It was predictable because the ideology of "socialist legality" fully permitted such a concealed form of denial of justice. On the other hand, one does not want to believe that the court today can so blatantly and defiantly take advantage of these obsolete norms of criminal procedure. The more so with a case that is being followed throughout the world. Understandably, a supplementary investigation is to the advantage of the procuracy and the investigation team in order to cover their tracks. But why would the court play into their hands? IZVESTIYA has been writing about the V. Mirzayanov case since the criminal proceedings were initiated. We have discussed various angles of this story, which is incredible from the standpoint of common sense, and tried to understand the underlying causes of these repressive measures that have been taken against the scientist. We have tried to understand the logic of a state which, on the one hand, votes for an international Convention on Chemical Disarmament and, on the other, jails a person who has spoken out against Russia's "military-chemical" weapons. We have appealed to the reason of the investigators and procurators, proving that the scientist's action, regardless of how it may have displeased the bureaucrats, was for the good of public interests and not to their detriment. Alas, they would not listen to us. But still there was hope in the court, a power that is independent of other state institutions, that is capable of listening to both sides and necessarily expressing an independent viewpoint regarding the conflict between the bureaucrats from the military-chemical complex and the citizen. Let me emphasize: The court does not have the right to refuse to hand down a verdict. It must say quite specifically whether the person is guilty or not. That is the point of the judicial practice. According to the rules of criminal law in effect, the arguments of the investigators were quite adequate to put Mirzayanov behind bars. Were it not for one circumstance or, more precisely, constitutional condition: Any normative legal documents affecting the rights, freedoms, and obligations of a human being and a citizen may not be applied unless they are officially published for universal knowledge of them. The lists of state secrets have the stamp "secret" and are not published anywhere. In other words, from the standpoint of human rights and the Constitution, it is as though the lists do not exist. And it is impossible to bring criminal charges against a person on these grounds. Did the investigators from state security and the procurators supervising them know this? They knew, of course, but instead of human rights and the Constitution they chose a different point of reference--criminal law of the 1961 model which is in force, alas, to this day and allows references to unpublished normative acts. Alas, the court also followed in the footsteps of state security and the General Procuracy. And V. Mirzayanov, who was trying to protest, they brought up short using a well-known investigatory device--they put him under guard. That is how the judicial investigation began. And the judicial proceedings rolled on along the trail that had already been blazed by the investigation--the person with more rights is right. In the investigators' version the chemist told the world something that he was categorically forbidden to divulge. It was forbidden, naturally, by the Lists. One small thing was lacking: Take the Lists in hand, put V. Mirzayanov's article in front of them, compare the texts, and draw a conclusion--did the scientist really divulge a state secret? Did he say what the Lists had forbidden him to divulge? The entire investigation would take a half hour! Then they could to present the Lists and their conclusions to the accused and his lawyer--go ahead and refute them, defend yourself. But no: The investigation took more than a year and was actually reduced to a matter making it as difficult as possible for the accused to exercise his right to a defense. This was done in a brilliantly simple way--instead of the content of the List itself, the contradictory opinion of experts regarding points of the secret document was presented. What was the court supposed to do in this case? In the first place, as the defense anticipated, examine the text of the List itself and understand the nature of the disagreements among the experts. In the second place, if the help of specialists was needed, schedule a new expert appraisal but with different experts. The court did nothing of the kind. It followed the same path as the investigators--it refused to include the List in the criminal case and it entrusted the repeat of the expert appraisal to the previous specialists. The result was familiar--the experts again expressed disagreements. And the main document on which the accusation was based remained outside the investigation. Now there is already a judicial investigation. The circle has closed: The person with the greatest rights is right. Why did the investigation team and the court so stubbornly conceal the List from the accused and his defense? "I think there was just one reason," answered V. Mirzayanov's defense lawyer, Aleksandr Asnis. "The paragraphs of that document were not convincing enough to be indisputable evidence. Moreover, if the List were published today, V. Mirzayanov's innocence would be obvious to everyone. No expert opinion would be necessary." It is known that the procurator is not overly delighted with the preliminary and the judicial investigations. Apparently he did not manage to obtain convincing evidence of V. Mirzayanov's guilt. If he is not proven guilty, is he then innocent? And will the procurator give an acquittal? Not at all. He used a tested weapon of "socialist legality"--he asked the court not to pronounce a verdict, actually to deny the accused justice, and to return the case for additional investigation. It is not difficult to guess the results of the supplementary investigation. Such cases as V. Mirzayanov's do not go to court a second time--they are "buried" in the procuracy forever. And regardless of the procuracy's justification for closing the case--whether it be because the accusation was not proved or because the situation changed--the decision cannot be called just. For if there is no judicial decision, there is no justice. And that is the most terrible outcome of V. Mirzayanov's case--to be left with the investigatory brand for his entire life. Incidentally, V. Mirzayanov himself agreed with the suggestion of the state plaintiff and did not object to having the case sent back for further investigation. The lawyer A. Asnis backed his client up. Why? "We had no other choice," explains the lawyer. "We chose the lesser of two evils. There is no point in referring to the law in a society where legal principles and constitutional norms are not enforced. Even if the procuracy has real power over the court, obviously, it too has to decide. After this trial, neither Mirzayanov nor I had any hope left of obtaining justice." I do not know the arguments the court used to justify its decision; journalists were not informed of that. But of one thing I am sure--the judicial investigation conducted following the model and likeness of the state security investigation did not add to its glory and did not lead to the truth. And I am afraid that the judges in these scandalous proceedings were quite suited to the typical position of bureaucrats of some "legal protection department" who actually act and make decisions in deference to their more influential colleagues--the procurators and investigators. So for now let us not foster any hopes in that beautiful slogan about the separation of powers. Judging from the case of Vil Mirzayanov, it seems that we have only one power--military-chemical.
