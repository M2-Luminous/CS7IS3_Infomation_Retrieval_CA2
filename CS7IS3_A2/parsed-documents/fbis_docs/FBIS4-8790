The participants reviewed the current military and political situation following the deployment of NATO aircraft on combat actions on the side of the Muslims. It was noted that, by resorting to the use of air power and other means, certain circles in the West, the United States in particular, wish to goad the Srpska republic into concluding local and regional agreements and making other concessions. This particularly applies to the sectors of the front where the Muslims are in an unfavorable military situation and is geared toward encouraging the Muslims and creating conditions for attaining military and territorial objectives, a statement from the office of the president of the Srpska republic says. The supreme command concludes that conditions are not yet ripe for the normalization of relations with UNPROFOR's [UN Protection Forces] military sector, but that the president of the Srpska republic may, if need be, and if he personally deems it necessary, maintain contact with UNPROFOR's civilian department with the aim of examining possibilities for extending the peace process, the statement reads.
