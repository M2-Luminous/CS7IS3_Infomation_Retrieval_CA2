Mr. Yanyong yesterday led an eight-member committee in charge of examining the encroachment of forest reserves to check the Tha Song Yang Forest Reserve. The committee included representatives of the National Environment Board, Kasetsat University, Third Army Region, Forest Industry Organisation (FIO) and Forestry Department. The trees were cut around their trunks and left to die over ten years ago by Karen tribesmen who fled fighting inside Burma across the Moei River to Thailand, Mr. Yanyong said. He added that the committee had agreed to propose that the FIO be assigned to fell the dead trees. Mr. Yanyong added that the FIO must carry out the assignment by itself, and that granting a private firm a sub-contract would be prohibited. After the dead trees were taken away, new trees would be planted in the area to revive the watershed. If nothing was done to the dead trees they would soon decay or burn down, he said. Forestry Department sources said that several thousand rai of forest area in Mae Ramat National Forest Reserve in Tak Province had been encroached upon similarly. Encroachers hired Karen tribesmen to chop around tree trunks, make a bonfire at the tree bases and build fences around land plots to claim ownership after the forest was declared deteriorated, the sources said. Government officials were believed to have been involved in the encroachment. Tha Song Yang district police chief inspector Pol Lt-Col Anan Saengthong said the encroachment was still being investigated.
