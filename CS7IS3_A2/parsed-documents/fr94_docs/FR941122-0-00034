FR941122-0-00034 FR941122-0-00010 In the January 11, 1993 preamble, the Agency stated that any reductions in emissions rate that have been, or will be, made at the substitution unit after 1985 without the substitution plan (e.g., reductions for economic reasons or required by federal or State law) ``will not have resulted from title IV'' and so should `` not be counted as reductions that would have occurred without the plan.'' 58 FR 3601 (emphasis added). The difficulty with this interpretation is that it appears to read out of section 404(b)(5) the requirement to ensure that a substitution plan does not negate reductions ``that would have been achieved by *␣*␣* the substitute unit *␣*␣* without such substitution.'' 42 U.S.C. 7651c(b)(5). In the absence of the plan, the substitution unit would not be subject to title IV until Phase II. If only reductions required by title IV were considered under section 404(b)(5), the amount of reductions that would have been achieved by the substitution unit without the plan (i.e., the reductions in Phase I) would always be zero *␣*␣*. The reference to such reductions would therefore be meaningless. In interpreting the Act, it should not be presumed that Congress adopted meaningless language. Some commenters on the November 18, 1993 proposal suggested a third interpretation of section 404(b)(5). They claimed that the provision addresses only situations where, as part of the substitution plan, allowances that would be allocated to the substitution unit are instead allocated by EPA to the Table A unit. Specifically, the commenters alleged that the terms ``reassigned tonnage limits'' and ``such substitution'' in section 404(b)(5) are synonymous and refer only to the ``allocation of a number of allowances to the Table A unit in addition to those that the Table A unit would otherwise receive.'' Comments of UARG at 33 n. 54 and 34. Accordingly, it is argued that section 404(b)(5) requires only that the number of additional allowances that are allocated under the plan to the Table A unit cannot be greater than the number of allowances that are subtracted from the allocation that the substitution unit would otherwise receive under the plan. The Agency rejects this interpretation, which is inconsistent with the substitution plans that the commenters themselves have submitted to the Agency and which would reduce section 404(b)(5) to a triviality. As the commenters noted, section 404(b) describes a substitution plan as ``a proposal to reassign, in whole or in part, the affected [Table A] unit's sulfur dioxide reduction requirements to any other unit(s)'' under the control of the owner or operator of the Table A unit. 42 U.S.C. 7651c(b) and Comments of UARG at 33. According to the commenters, such reassignment occurs only where allowances otherwise allocated to a substitution unit are instead allocated to the Table A unit. Id. at 34 and 40&hyph;1. This is allegedly the only circumstance to which section 404(b)(5) would apply. If the commenters' interpretation were correct, then only those plans that actually provide for such an additional allocation of allowances to the Table A unit would be substitution plans, as defined by section 404(b). However, although §72.41(c)(4)(ii) of the January 11, 1993 regulations provides the option to redistribute allowance allocations in this way, such redistribution is not required by §72.41. Moreover, EPA has not received a single substitution plan for any units that includes such a redistribution of allowance allocations. See 58 FR 32667&hyph;32670 (June 11, 1993); 58 FR 34582 (June 25, 1993); 58 FR 38373&hyph;38375 (July 16, 1993); 58 FR 39543&hyph;39544 (July 23, 1993); 58 FR 40812&hyph;40813 (July 30, 1993); 58 FR 42065&hyph;42069 (Aug. 6, 1993); and 58 FR 43110 (Aug. 13, 1993) (summarizing the allowance allocations under the proposed plans, none of which included any redistribution of allowances from a substitution unit to a Table A unit). Under the commenters' approach, none of the substitution plans submitted to date are ``proposals to reassign *␣*␣* reduction requirements'' under section 404(b). Further, the commenters' interpretation of section 404(b)(5) would reduce that provision to a trivial requirement that EPA cannot give more additional allowances to the Table A unit than it takes from the substitution unit. 5 5 Apparently, EPA could, under the commenters' interpretation, allocate fewer additional allowances to the Table A unit than are subtracted from the substitution unit's allowance allocation.
