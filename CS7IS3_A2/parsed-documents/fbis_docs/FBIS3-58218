In a statement after the meeting, the U.S. ambassador stressed that there is complete agreement on the issues Greece is planning to promote during the six months in which it will exercise the EU presidency. Niles stressed that the Yugoslav dispute is one of the priority issues, and he expressed U.S. support for the ongoing UN efforts, through the mediation of Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, for a peaceful settlement. He also expressed the opinion that there will be no disagreement between the United States and the EU on settling the problem in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He added, however, that we should also wait for the results of the tripartite meeting mediated by Stoltenberg and Lord Owen.
