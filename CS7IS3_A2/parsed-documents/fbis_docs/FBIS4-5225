Hosokawa's bombshell announcement prompted the seven coalition parties to scramble to the task of picking his successor. Although Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito [Clean Government Party], key parties in the coalition, voiced support for Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata who leads Shinseito, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) expressed disaffection with the proposal. The 56-year-old Hosokawa told a hurriedly-arranged news conference he had decided to give up the office of prime minister to take "moral and political responsibility" for a fresh financial scandal and the current stalemate of the Diet. "A new problem has come to light. New suspicions emerged that my political office entrusted a certain person with managing my personal financial means, raking in profits for a few years since 1981," the premier said. "The suspicion is that his management may have involved some illegalities, although the person, who is my old friend, asked for permission to manage my personal money, saying it would definitely be invested in a profitable manner," he said. He said the new revelation came on top of controversy about 100 million yen that Hosokawa described as a loan from a trucking company already at the center of a money-and-mob scandal. The opposition camp held up Diet debate on the fiscal 1994 fiscal budget, saying Hosokawa should first agree to the opposition demand to have his financial aide Masatoshi Miyama testify as a witness to clear up suspicions on the allegedly questionable finances. Hosokawa officially offered his resignation at an emergency cabinet meeting after making a surprise announcement to a hastily summoned meeting of leaders of the coalition partners. In a second get-together of the coalition leaders later in the day, Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa insisted that the coalition parties first narrow the differences in their defense and diplomatic policies before making a decision on whether to maintain the current combination of parties. Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, a behind-the-scene strategist, Japan New Party leader Masuo Matsuoka and DSP Secretary General Takashi Yonezawa threw their weight behind the Komeito proposal, while the Socialists vehemently opposed it. The coalition leaders only agreed to resume discussion Saturday afternoon, coalition officials said. Political analysts pointed to the possibility that the coalition might try to form a new coalition by integrating some legislators from the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] even at the risk of alienating the SDP. However, the LDP quickly vowed to block any attempts by the coalition to win over its legislators and instead to establish a new coalition government led by itself. [passage omitted]
