They are liable to appear before the State Security Court, which can pronounce death sentences. Deputy Nizamettin Toguc and Felemez Basboga, a member of the DEP Central Committee, recently made a stopover in Brussels. They gave their explanations: If the State Security Court decided to ban the DEP, the (17 -- LA LIBRE BELGIQUE editor's note) deputies of the party will be dismissed and arrested, as will most of the leaders. Several files have already been opened with regard to their statements on Kurdistan and democracy. The party's property will be seized. The constitution specifies that, when a party is banned, its deputies cannot engage in politics for 10 years. This constitution was drawn up in 1980, following the military coup d'etat. It is still in force. Money [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] This is the fourth time you have reformed the party. That must be costly. Where does the money come from? There is often talk of a revolutionary tax... [DEP Official] We have been supported by the people, without any other support. We have not forced anybody. In Turkey, there are also rich Kurds, but even those who are not rich give their support to the parties which are fighting for liberation. [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] The DEP is being prosecuted for separatism. [DEP Official] The real separatism is practiced by the Turkish state. Turkey is led by the military. That is why it does not recognize any minority, no other people, no other culture. Our party wants democracy, fraternity, and respect for human rights. [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Is fraternity synonymous with federation, or confederation? [DEP Official] The important thing, when we talk of fraternity, is that everybody should be able to express themselves freely. Fraternity means equality. If everybody could express themselves freely, we could talk of federation or confederation, a different system in which peoples can live fraternally, in full equality. Cover [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Could the question be: Do you want to be independent? [DEP Official] Independence is not our objective as a party. It is for the people to choose, not us. [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] It is sometimes said that the DEP serves as a cover for the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan], which is waging an armed struggle against Ankara. [DEP Official] There are many things that the PKK does and that we do too, but not together. The PKK is acting to show the will of the population living in this region, and that is what we are doing too. There are similarities between us, but the DEP is not a cover for or a section of the PKK. We are fighting in a legal and democratic way. Unfortunately, we are being prevented from doing that. Armed struggle is one method. As the Party of Democracy, we cannot say we are for or against the armed struggle. If there was a means of struggling legally and democratically, I think that even the PKK would not wage an armed struggle. But, as you can see, we cannot wage a democratic struggle. Many Kurds are taking up arms, and this is not surprising. Changing the Rationale [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Is there a solution? [DEP Official] The Turkish Government must stop its war against people who are demanding their rights. We need a political and democratic solution. Instead of spending so much on the war, this money should be devoted to investment in Kurdistan. But the Turkish Government is headed by military leaders and that is why it insists on waging war in Kurdistan. If the Turkish Government does not change its policy and persists in this military rationale, the republic of Turkey will disappear. If the war continues, it will not be separation but the destruction of the Turkish state. The Turkish budget for 1993 was 394 trillion Turkish pounds, but the money spent on the war was 400 trillion. If this continues, Turkey will be in a complete blind alley economically.
