The presidential press official [state adviser] Gabil Guseyinly denied reports to the effect that the Russians will set up 35 control points as Armenians withdraw from lands they occupied in Azerbaijan "outside Karabakh." Guseyinly said: "No agreement to this effect has been signed. Besides, President Aliyev is completely opposed to it. Aliyev insists that if the presence of military observers in the conflict zone is needed, then international observers, including Turkish troops, should be dispatched under CSCE direction." Recalling that the Armenians should have started withdrawing from the occupied lands in keeping with the cease-fire that went into effect on 1 March, Guseyinly indicated that so far no withdrawal has taken place in the region. In the meantime Jan Eliasson, chairman of CSCE Minsk Group, who is now in Azerbaijan, left for Nagorno-Karabakh's capital Khankendi [Stepanakert] for talks with Armenian officials. He will go later to Yerevan for talks with Armenian government officials.
