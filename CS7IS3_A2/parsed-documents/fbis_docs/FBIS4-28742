Mohan] [Text] Phnom Penh -- The Cambodian Investment Board [CIB], as the operational body of the Cambodian Development Council, will be empowered to render its decision on a normal investment project within 45 days from the day it receives the completed application form with all the relevant information, including feasibility and profitability studies. The CIB, which will also be entrusted with the implementation of the soon to be ratified Investment Law of the Kingdom of Cambodia, shall also publish its decision on the promotion of investment projects. To enable this, it is empowered to inform potential foreign and local investors on the investment opportunities inn the kingdom, promote, analyse, evaluate and approve investment projects, study and identify investment and economic strategies, and assist and facilitate foreign and local investors by making the board a one-stop service organisation. In addition to this, the CIB shall also issue an Investment Promotion Certificate to the promoted company in which the benefits and obligations of the company in one or more areas shall be clearly stated. This ranges from amount and origin of capital, nationality of the investors and the number of shareholders and directors, the number of local and foreign staff, training schedules of local nationals, to details on the implementation schedule and details on benefits incentives granted. The Investment Law, which is implemented by the CIB, shall govern investments made by foreign and local investors within the territory of the kingdom. For the purpose of this law, investors may be either a person or a corporate entity. Investments may be made in any economic activity or sector provided they have received prior written approval from the board and do not fall under section 16 of the law. Section 16 of the law states that the CIB will not grant its approval on projects where activities and sectors are forbidden by the Constitution of the Kingdom, those listed in the restricted list issued by the board and that which involves trading and activities which the board has confirmed by written notice to be under the responsibility of the Ministry of Commerce. The Investment Law also supersedes any other existing investment law and calls for non-discriminatory treatment of both local and foreign nationals in respect to all rights, benefits, guarantees and obligations attendant to their investments, except for ownership of land as specified in the said law. Under the law, the government has guaranteed that it shall not expropriate, nationalise or take any measures having the same or similar effect with respect to investments established in this nation. The government shall not impose price control on the products or services of the promoted company. The Investment Law of the Kingdom of Cambodia stipulates the guideline on the benefits and obligations related to private investments here. Its objective is to attract investments that could sustain the economic development of this nation and contribute to the building of a strong and dynamic private sector. It is also designed to boost the competitive advantage of this nation among other nations, through a pragmatic economic policy in line with the spirit of the free market system in which the government will act as the facilitator of the private sector.
