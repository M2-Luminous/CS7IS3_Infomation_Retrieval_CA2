The Clinton motorcade entered Vatican City on schedule through the belltower gate to the left of St. Peter's basilica at exactly 11:50 [0950 GMT]. Bill Clinton thus became the tenth U.S. president to come within the precincts of this tiny independent state. The President and his party, which included his wife Hillary and Secretary of State Warren Christopher, were welcomed in the San Damaso courtyard by the prefect for the Pontifical House, Msgr. Dino Monduzzi under the watchful eye of a platoon of Swiss guards. As this was not an official visit, no anthems were played. As the Clintons were conducted through the magnificent rooms towards the papal library where John Paul awaited them, they admired with obvious pleasure the rich decor of paintings, frescoes, sculpture and furnishings which embellish the Vatican complex. Despite his recent hip replacement surgery, the pope was standing up to greet Clinton as he crossed the threshold into the library. The two men then sat down in two armchairs to begin their private talk. Clinton is the fourth U.S. president to be received in the Vatican by John Paul II. The others were Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and George Bush. While the pope and the president talked, Warren Christopher immediately began talks in the nearby Hall of the Popes with a Vatican delegation led by Secretary of State, Cardinal Angelo Sodano. At the end of the private conversation between the president and the pope, the rest of Clinton's party were introduced into the libary. The first to enter was his wife Hillary who was wearing black and who had covered her head with a black veil in keeping with Vatican protocol. She was followed by her mother and then the other members of the American delegation. The usual exchange of presents took place after the pope greeted each of the visitors. At the end of the papal audience, Clinton and his party proceeded to another part of the palace to join up with Cardinal Sodano, and American cardinals William Wakefield Baum and Casimir Szoka, who are members of the Curia. Coming out of the audience, the U.S. president said that among the topics he discussed with John Paul II was the upcoming Cairo conference on birth control; the international situation, with special reference to Bosnia and the Middle East; the role of Islam; and problems of religious liberty in the world, especially in Asia. Clinton said he was honored to have been received by the pope and he praised the willingness of the Catholic Church to cope concretely with problems. The world assembly in Cairo on population, organized by the United Nations, came up again when Clinton stopped to talk with a group of American seminarians. The president said that he and the pope had discussed both what they agree on and what they do not agree on in this area, and said that they found a common meeting ground in their awareness of the need to uphold a responsible growth in population. Both men also reviewed the progress that has been made in the direction of responsable parenthood, he added. The topic came up again when Clinton responded to questions put by a group of journalists. Unlike China, the United states does not support abortion as a means of birth control, he insisted. But his administration is concerned about the tens of millions of abortions that take place in unsafe conditions around the world, putting women's health and very lives at risk. He admitted that "differences" exist between the United States and the Vatican on the matter of contraception, but he voiced the conviction that the thrust of the Cairo conference would be to support sustainable development and strong families. Nevertheless, Clinton said that "progress" had been made in his talk with the pope. White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers stressed that neither compulsory abortion nor abortion upon request were part of the Clinton Administration policy. Abortion must be safe, legal and rare, she said. Nevertheless, family planning and access to contraception are important means by which to control population growth so as to prevent massive migrations of people due to food scarcity and to fend off environmental degradation, the spokeswoman said. Asked if the points of view of John Paul and the American president were irreconcilable, Myers would only say that she did not believe the pope would change his mind on these issues. The two men have distinctly different views on abortion and family planning and have already clashed swords on the issues, including when the pope was in Denver last August, during the pope's appearance at the world youth celebrations there. The issue returned to the spotlight in New York last month during preparatory debate for the Cairo conference. [passage omitted] Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro confirmed that the Cairo conference was in the front line of topics discussed by Clinton and the pope during the private audience. Although the two leaders had discussed a variety of international matters, including world peace in general and the situation in the Middle East and in Jerusalem, the lion's share of their conversation had pivoted on that UN-sponsored conference and the serious ethical questions it raises, Navarro said. The Holy See is deeply concerned with the defense and promotion of life and the defense and promotion of the family, and with this in view, the pope has appealed to the responsibility of a great nation like that of the United States which in its origins and throughout its history has always proclaimed ethical values to be at the basis of every civilization, the Vatican spokesman continued. He added that U.S. Secretary of State Christopher and his Vatican counterpart, Cardinal Sodano, in their separate talks, had reviewed certain aspects of preparations for the Cairo conference and had discussed the chief problems having to do with international peace: Europe, Africa and the Caribbean, and "with special emphasis on peace in the Middle East and the future of the Holy City of Jerusalem," he said. During his meeting with the pontiff today, Clinton also took the opportunity to thank the Vatican for having recognized the state of Israel and for the support it is giving to the Mideast peace process, it was later learned.
