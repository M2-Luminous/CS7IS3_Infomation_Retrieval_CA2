The prompting came at a gathering of personal representatives, called sherpas, of top G-7 leaders, held in Naples for three days from Friday, the sources said. The meeting aimed to lay the groundwork for the Naples summit of G-7 nations on July 8-10. The United States and other countries urged that Japan be mentioned by name in an economic declaration to be adopted at the Naples summit as a country which needs to take strong fiscal and monetary measures to increase domestic demand, the sources said. During the preparatory talks, the participants agreed on the need to press ahead on the reform of labor markets to ensure the creation of job opportunities, the sources said. In this connection, the U.S. and some European countries suggested that region-by-region macroeconomic steps be taken to promote employment, they said. Japanese representatives balked at the demand but these countries maintained their tough stance toward Japan, according to the sources. The Naples summit brings together top leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States.
