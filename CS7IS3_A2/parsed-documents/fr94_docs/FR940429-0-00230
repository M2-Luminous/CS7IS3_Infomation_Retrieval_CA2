FR940429-0-00230 FR940429-0-00015 Discussion: The Secretary agrees with those commenters. An institution or third-party servicer should not be considered to have automatically violated its fiduciary responsibility if the servicer or a principal or affiliate of that servicer violates a Title IV, HEA program requirement. The Secretary has recourse to apply the appropriate sanctions in this subpart against an institution or third-party servicer if the servicer or a principal or affiliate of the servicer commits a violation of any Title IV, HEA program requirement. Changes: The Secretary removes the provisions of paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Section 668.83␣Emergency Action Comments: Three commenters stated that no emergency action should be taken until the servicer has been given the opportunity to defend its actions. One of these commenters remarked that the Secretary could be subject to lawsuit if the servicer were proved innocent. Two commenters voiced concern that emergency actions could have a severe impact on an institution or servicer without a promulgation of evidence. One of these commenters suggested that the language be revised to read, ``Receives verifiable information, determined by the official to be reliable *␣*␣*.'' Four commenters felt that emergency action should only be taken when the errors are intentional or the servicer or institution refuses to take corrective action. One commenter felt that due process mandates that the burden of proof be on the Secretary to show cause why an emergency action is necessary, and that the burden should shift only after the Secretary has made a prima facie case. Several commenters stated that an emergency action against a third-party servicer should not, as a matter of law, prohibit the servicer from engaging in the administration of any aspect of an institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs, but should only be limited to that aspect where emergency action is absolutely necessitated. The commenters felt this was necessary to provide a smooth turnover of servicing responsibilities rather than a sudden halt which could cause chaos, confusion and loss throughout the industry, including the Department of Education, the institution, and the borrower. Discussion: The HEA specifies that the Secretary shall take an emergency action against a third-party servicer if the Secretary receives information, determined by the Secretary to be reliable, that a third-party servicer under contract with an eligible institution is violating any statutory or regulatory provision applicable to Title IV of the HEA, or any applicable special arrangement, agreement, or limitation and the Secretary determines that immediate action is necessary to prevent the misuse of Federal funds and the likelihood of loss outweighs the importance of waiting for the final outcome of a limitation, suspension, or termination action against the servicer. An emergency action is effective on the date that a notice and statement of the basis of the emergency action is mailed to the third-party servicer. If a third-party servicer does not think that such action is warranted, the servicer may request a prompt show-cause hearing. As to the concerns expressed over possible disruption, the Secretary will tailor emergency actions as he determines necessary to protect federal interests. The Secretary also refers the reader to the discussions of emergency actions with respect to institutions in the regulations published on March 10, 1993 (58 FR 13336). Changes: None. Sections 668.84␣Fine Proceedings, 668.85 Suspension Proceedings, and 668.86 Limitation or Termination Proceedings Comments: A few commenters felt that proposed §§668.84 (governing fine proceedings), 668.85 (governing suspension proceedings), and 668.86 (governing limitation and termination proceedings) violate due process and privacy rights by requiring that a third-party servicer apprise all clients of proposed actions. The commenters thought that notification at that time is at a minimum premature if not inappropriate and would serve to create adversarial relations between parties that should have a cooperative working relationship. Several commenters felt that fines should be imposed only if the violation was ``willful'' or ``knowing.'' Another commenter felt that notification of a fine proceeding against a third-party servicer should not be sent until the appeal process is completed because it could damage a third-party servicer's reputation among unaffected parties and could unnecessarily alarm the servicer's client base. One commenter recommended that the notice be limited to affected clients and suggested that if the Secretary does not want to eliminate the notice at the beginning of a fine proceeding, the Secretary should be required to send a notice when the decision to fine has been reversed. Discussion: Quite the contrary to the commenters' views that notification to a third-party servicer's clients at the initiation of a fine or other proceeding against the servicer violates due process, this provision protects those rights. The potential consequences to an institution if the institution's agent violates a Title IV, HEA requirement can be severe, covering the full range of sanctions under this subpart. Thus, notice to an institution allows the institution the opportunity to participate in the process on behalf of its agent and in its own defense. In addition, a sanction imposed against the servicer could have an adverse effect on the participation of an institution that contracts with the servicer, including the severing or limiting of the contractual relationship. Early notice to affected institutions permits them to judge the potential effect of the action on their participation and to prepare accordingly. As the Secretary noted in the NPRM, early notice also allows an institution to take corrective action before the conclusion of a proceeding under this subpart. The Secretary also corrects here two misunderstandings of these commenters: it is the designated department official, not the third-party servicer, who provides notice under this subpart; and the designated department official notifies only those institutions affected by the servicer's violations, not all institutions that contract with the servicer. The Secretary is sensitive to those who were concerned about how notification in the initiation of a fine proceeding could affect a third-party servicer's reputation, but notes that information about actions the Secretary takes with regard to violations of Title IV, HEA program requirements is publicly available and is required by section 494C of the HEA to be shared at least with SPREs and by 34 CFR part 603 with accrediting agencies. The Secretary has provided, in §668.90, for notification to all affected institutions that contract with a third-party servicer of the Secretary's final decision with regard to appeals under this subpart. In determining whether to impose a fine, the amount of a fine, or whether to impose any other sanction for a violation of a Title IV, HEA program requirement, the Secretary always considers the extent to which the violation was deliberate. The Secretary does not consider it necessary to specify that consideration in these regulations. Changes: None. Comments: Several commenters suggested that in the case of a proceeding against an institution, the Secretary should notify the third-party servicers that contract with that institution, because the functions performed by certain third-party servicers could continue to be performed inadvertently when, in fact, the Secretary has limited, suspended, or terminated those activities. The commenters further recommended that in the case of a suspension, limitation, or termination against an institution the Secretary inform each third-party servicer that contracts with the institution of the consequences of the action to the servicer. The commenters also request parallel notification provisions concerning hearings and the submission of written material in the absence of a hearing. Discussion: The Secretary expects an institution to provide immediate notice as necessary to its employees, agents and third-party servicers to comply with the terms of any action taken by the Department. The Secretary notes that he does not hold a third-party servicer responsible for violations of Title IV, HEA program requirements committed solely by an institution. Therefore, the Secretary does not consider it necessary to establish provisions for the notification separately to third-party servicers in every case.
