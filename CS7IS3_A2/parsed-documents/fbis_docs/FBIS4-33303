The task would not be easy for the United States. Everything would be a surprise. The president of the Independent Drivers Union has unveiled a strategy to knock out the great star-studded power. Pierre Malvoisin relies heavily on the participation of the Haitians of the diaspora, Haitians who do not spare their help. Haitians here and in the United States will move in to attack at the first alert: [Begin recording, in Creole] [Malvoisin] Father Aristide has asked for intervention, but 1915 and 1994 are not the same. (?The circumstances are quite different). In 1915, there were no Haitians in the United States; today, there must be 1.5 million Haitians in the United States. We have....[pauses] there are many patriots in the United States. If the Americans land in Haiti now...[pauses] I do not say...[pauses] Haiti is a little country of 27,000 square km, but the United States has 16 million square kilometers. Haiti will perish; it will be the end of Haiti. I believe it will also be the end of the United States because once the Americans land, our patriots there will blow up many U.S. buildings, in Los Angeles, Chicago, California, San Francisco, Florida, New York, Texas. They will lose many things. Even NASA will be attacked. [Unidentified correspondent] Malvoisin, is there a true plan to consolidate this work? [Malvoisin] Yes. [end recording] He added in a firm tone of voice: Everything is ready and has been set up; it only remains to wait for the orders. The leader of the independent drivers called the United States ungrateful. He recalled the U.S. war of independence. He insisted on Savannah. He is sorry about the fate of the great neighbor that has (?shouted): Bound for nothingness! Malvoisin does not understand that a neighbor has decided to solve the problems of a friendly country with force. This statement or firm position has come to support the argument of U.S. Professor Jack Tyle. He said the withdrawal of the U.S. military forces would be more difficult than the landing. This is a way to repeat Jean de La Fontaine: One sees very well how to get into this den, but one does not see how to get out of it. As for union leader Pierre Malvoisin, he will get out of it with a haughty head and proudly.
