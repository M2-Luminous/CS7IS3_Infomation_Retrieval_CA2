A high-level IAEA official expressed concerned that inspections may not be carried out as scheduled as North Korea's issuing of visas has been delayed even though an IAEA inspection team is waiting to begin inspections from next week when the IAEA Board of Governors' Meeting is slated to be opened. The official, however, revealed that he expects North Korea to issue visas for inspectors soon so that inspections can be carried out early next week, now that North Korea has accepted full-scope [chonmyon] inspections.
