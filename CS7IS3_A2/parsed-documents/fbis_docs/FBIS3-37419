The ministry's main conclusion is that "no radical, strategic changes should be made in the government's course," senior ministry official Mikhail Kopeikin told Interfax. But more emphasis should be put in the 1993-95 government program on social security measures, he said. Those proposals "largely correspond to what is suggested by Academicians Leonid Abalkin, Stanislav Shatalin and others," although the Economics Ministry disagrees with those who argue that the social security policy should be set out in the first section of the program and all further changes should depend on it, Kopeikin said. "We are against changing the structure of the government program," he said. The social security measures proposed by the Economics Ministry include penalties for the violation of minimum social security guarantees, concrete measures to help the poorer population strata and the involvement of nongovernmental bodies in the financing of the social security policy. The ministry also stands for tighter state control of the economy, Kopeikin said. He said he was a member of a group, formed recently and headed by Deputy Economics Minister Sergei Vasilyev, which was working on a list of priority financial, economic, social security and other measures to be taken within the next two to three months. All proposals made by the group, which had its first sitting on February 12, would be sent to the prime minister, Kopeikin said.
