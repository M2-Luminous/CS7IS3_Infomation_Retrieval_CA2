The growth rate reached as high as 29.8 percent, nearly 11 percentage points over the previous month, and was close to the highest point before macroregulation and control were exercised. The main causes of the rapid growth rate in industrial production in December 1993 were: First, the implementation of the easy money policy beginning in November injected working funds into many enterprises which were experiencing difficulties caused by the shortage of funds so that these enterprises were able to speed up their production; second, at the end of last year, various localities tried all means to accelerate the production progress in a bid to increase the base figures in the upcoming tax sharing reform. The super high speed operation of the industrial sector of the economy last year was a necessity but it also caused people to worry that the excessive growth in industrial production would inevitably bring about various tense economic relations again and cause a deterioration in the tense supply-demand situation in "bottleneck" sectors. According to reports, the annual growth in industrial production in 1993 was 23.6 percent higher than the previous year and was the highest level in the 15 years of reform and opening up. Nongovernment owned enterprises continued to occupy a leading position in the economic growth and their increased output value accounted for 77.7 percent of the total newly increased output value. The production development of coastal areas was markedly faster than that of the hinterland. The six provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Shandong, Guangdong, and Hainan, whose annual growth rate exceeded 30 percent, are all located along the southeast coast. Viewed from the cycle of economic development, 1994 will undoubtedly be a year with a medium to high rate of growth. The domestic demands remain high, the investment scales in projects under construction and carry-over investment are big, and the readjustment in workers' wages will also give impetus to the consumer goods market. On the other hand, various localities will double their output ahead of schedule and this, together with their strong aspirations to push the economy to a higher level, will promote the industrial production to continue to glide forward on the platform of a high speed growth rate in the fourth quarter of 1993. It is estimated that the production growth in the first quarter of this year will reach over 15 percent. Authoritative people in economic circles have already predicted that China's economy will have a relatively vigorous rise again in the first few months of 1994 and hold that it is necessary to implement, at the proper time, a relatively tight financial policy to prevent the economy from becoming "overheated" again. The year 1994 is a "year of reform" in China. In order to prevent some hidden unstable factors from being intensified and from becoming obstacles in the process of reform, economic specialists have warned against blindly seeking an excessively high growth rate and have called for making greater efforts in structural readjustment so that the industrial sector of the economy can develop appropriately and healthily.
