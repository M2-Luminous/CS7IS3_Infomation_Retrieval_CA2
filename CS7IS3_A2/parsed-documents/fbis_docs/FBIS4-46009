Considering that the National Power Corporation (NPC) has not experienced such problems, critics feel that the setback calls for a review. The Project Director, Mr. Paramahams Tiwari, said an enquiry into the design and execution was underway. The Enquiry Committee includes Mr. C. M. Surendra. NPC Director (Engineering), Dr. Prem Krishna, Professsor, (Civil Engineering, Roorkee Universlty, Mr. D. Rajappa, Chairman and Managing Director, Ministry of Water Resources, and Mr. Kushawaha, Head, Reactor Structure Section. Following the mishap on May 13, when about 130 tonnes of concrete from the under-surface of the inner dome fell from 40 feet, some debris had to be cleared to prevent it from damaging the dust-sensitive equipment housed in RB 1. To document evidence for further enquiry, videographs and photographs were taken. he added. While the civil construction work was curtailed, othcr electrical and mechanical jobs were being done in the building. The total dome would now have to be recast, which could be done in three months. It would not delay the project scheduled for completion in June 1996, Mr. Tiwari explained. The structure design, submitted by Stup Consultants, Bombay, was approved by the NPC and cleared by AERB. Subsequently, I&T was awarded the civil construction contract which includes the RB 1. The 42-metre inner dome was designed to withstand a pressure of 25 pounds per square inch. Designing a dome like the RB 1, which has to bear the weight of 600 cubic metres of concrete, involves pre-stressing. However, the degree to which pre-stressing can be done is circumscribed by parameters governing the elasticity of the material in use. It is pointed out that in this case, the localised failure might have occurred because of transcending the elastic limit. The structural engineers have speculated that the binding factor which causes the dome to hold like an integral whole may have also been contributory. Interestingly, had not the print media chanced upon the event, the localised structural setback might not have become public. The roof of the fire-station on the project site also suffered minor deformations from suspected structural problems.
