This was reported by arrivals from Baghdad in Iraqi Kurdistan in the past two days. They said the clashes took place when the money changers refused to observe the regime's recent instructions banning individuals from dealing in currency in the Baghdad money market and restricting this activity to a group of brokers working directly on behalf of 'Udayy.
