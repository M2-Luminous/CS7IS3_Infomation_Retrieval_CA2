"Unfortunately, I can give no optimistic forecasts. Despite the fact we have managed to ease the situation around Gorazde, the general military-political situation in Bosnia is very complicated after the air-strikes," he said. "The Serb side refuses to meet representatives of the U.N. force command for understandable reasons. I have to make shuttle trips between the Serb and Muslim parts of Sarajevo as part of my mediation. This is what I have been doing for two days, this is what I will do on Wednesday. "There will be more meetings with Radovan Karadzic and the U.N. force command. I also keep contact with Serb President Milosevic," said Churkin. Asked about the truthfulness of reports saying NATO aircraft bombed downtown Gorazde by mistake on Monday, the Russian diplomat said "Mr. Karadzic told me about it, however, representatives of the U.N. force command deny the information".
