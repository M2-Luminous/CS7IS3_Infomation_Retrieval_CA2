Yoshihiro Sakamoto, director general of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's [MITI] International Trade Policy Bureau, told a press conference that the United States had "clarified" its stance not to seek any numerical targets in future bilateral trade talks. He made the comment after Japan and the U.S. agreed earlier in the day in Washington to reopen the stalled trade "framework" talks, ending a three-month stalemate in the negotiations. "The restart of the framework talks will form a basis for further strengthening Japan-U.S. ties," Sakamoto said in a reference to the soured bilateral relations on the economic front since the rupture of the trade talks in February. Sakamoto also said the accord between "the world's two major economic players" will have "not a small impact" on the global economy. "The latest accord marks Washington's confirmation that it will pursue free trade at a time when the global community is prepared to enforce trade measures pledged under the recently concluded Uruguay Round multilateral trade talks," Sakamoto added. The talks to establish a new trade framework were launched after the July 1993 summit between then Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton. But the talks came to a standstill during the Feb. 11 meeting between then Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Clinton when Tokyo and Washington failed to bridge differences over the definition of the "objective criteria" to be used to gauge the openness of Japan's markets. Sakamoto said both parties during the latest subcabinet-level meeting in Washington refrained from defining "numerical targets. We are satisfied with Washington's first official pledge not to seek numerical targets," Sakamoto said. "What is more important than wording or definitions is to get the stalled talks rolling again," Sakamoto said. "Tokyo's understanding is that objective criteria will include a set of measuring yardsticks and they will be used on a sector-by-sector basis in order to gauge only how Japan has done in the past," he said. He said Japan's failure to achieve certain goals would not lead to any trade sanctions. "If something wrong is found, we are ready to remove it to improve the situation."
