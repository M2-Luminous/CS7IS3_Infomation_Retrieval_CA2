FBIS3-52874 "drnes006_n_94015" FBIS-NES-94-006 Document Type:Daily Report 10 Jan 1994 LEBANON Lebanese Forces Deny Attempt to Kill al-Hirawi NC0801080894 (Clandestine) Radio Free Lebanon in Arabic 0545 GMT 8 Jan 94 NC0801080894 (Clandestine) Radio Free Lebanon Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Statement by the Lebanese Forces' Central Information Agency issued on 8 January--read by announcer] [Text] Some media organizations have recently leaked fabricated news on an alleged attempt to assassinate President Ilyas al-Hirawi in 1990-1991 [date as heard]. The reports made implicit and sometimes explicit references accusing the Lebanese Forces of being behind the alleged attempt. In view of the persistent reports on this issue, despite the denial made last week by presidential sources, the Lebanese Forces finds itself compelled to announce the following: 1. The contradictory information contained in the leaked reports regarding the alleged attempt to assassinate the president shows that the reports are not valid. One of the fabricated reports spoke of an attempt against the president's life in his office in the temporary presidential headquarters in al-Ramlah al-Bayda', another report mentioned the Cabinet meeting room, and others mentioned his house in al-Hazimiyah. 2. Such media schemes are part of the ongoing efforts to cause confusion in the public and create an atmosphere of mistrust among official, political, and party leaders. The Lebanese Forces views these schemes as an attempt to undermine national unity, internal peace, and public stability. 3. On this occasion, the Lebanese Forces would like to reiterate its positions on the Lebanese legitimate authority established under the National Accord agreement. The Lebanese Forces also would like to remind everyone of its repeated calls on all parties to get involved in national reconciliation and join the legitimate institutions, which would be the strongest proof of the invalidity of the fabricated news about imaginary operations and attempts. Such news only serves the interests of those who are trying to cause new rifts within the Lebanese official body at a time when the officials who are the subject of such rumors know what is happening. 4. The insistence of treating the Lebanese Forces as a former militia, disregarding the vast political current it represents, seeks to undermine its role and image by searching in the past for twisted and untrue incidents to use against it in the present. This is proof that some people are adamant not to accept the realities of coexistence, accord, and political and democratic practices, as stipulated under the law and guaranteed by the Constitution. 5. While expressing its deep regret for the failure to comply with the great national decision to close the chapter of war with all its details and to engage in public affairs, the Lebanese Forces calls on all Lebanese to live up to the current stage and to concentrate their efforts on exposing the schemes hatched against Lebanon at present and in the future. Instead of attempting to distract attention from the real dangers facing Lebanon and its people, efforts should be made to reveal the real perpetrators and planners of recent bombings, such as the one against the Phalangist Party headquarters, as well as other incidents that have sought to disrupt security.
