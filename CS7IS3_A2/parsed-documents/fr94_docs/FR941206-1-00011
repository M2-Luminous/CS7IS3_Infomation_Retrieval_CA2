FR941206-1-00011 FR941206-1-00001 Although the data reviewed in the 1979 Health and Safety Report indicate that poultry products produced by mechanical separation generally are acceptable from a microbiological standpoint, the data also show that where bacterial loads tend to be higher, it can be attributed to the starting material used. This is not unique to poultry products produced by mechanical separation; it can be applied to other finely comminuted and comminuted products as well. Common starting materials for mechanical separated and other comminuted products are products that remain after the removal of a substantial portion of skeletal muscle or other tissue (e.g., skin) from poultry carcasses or parts of carcasses. As a result, the resistance of the exposed surface area to microbial penetration has been reduced and the ratio of the surface area to the volume of total product which is exposed to contaminating influences has been increased. Higher microbial counts have been associated with the conditions of holding such starting materials. Poultry products produced by mechanical separation are not unique; all finely comminuted and comminuted products present opportunities for excessive microbiological growth because they consist of small particles which have a greater surface area than most poultry products and because during its preparation any microorganisms that are present are distributed throughout the product. Therefore, FSIS agrees with the commenters that there is a general need to address the issue of handling requirements for all poultry products, including finely comminuted and comminuted products. FSIS is currently developing a separate rulemaking that will deal with this issue more fully and that will include handling requirements for poultry products produced by mechanical separation, and the materials from which they are manufactured. Therefore, FSIS will not propose handling requirements for poultry products produced by mechanical separation in this rulemaking. FSIS believes that the promulgation of handling requirements for all comminuted poultry, including mechanically separated poultry products, and the starting materials from which they are made, would eliminate the need to require that the temperature of rooms or compartments in which equipment for mechanical deboning of raw poultry is operated be maintained at 50 â—‹ F or less (9 CFR 381.47(e)). When such requirements are promulgated, FSIS will address the need to rescind 9 CFR 381.47(e). C. Protein Quality. Twenty-five commenters addressed the issue of protein quality for boneless poultry products produced by mechanical separation. Of the 25 comments, 24 disagreed with the need to have a protein quality requirement for any mechanically separated poultry product with up to 1 percent bone solids. The commenters stated the following reasons for their disagreement: (1) the typical U.S. diet provides for an adequate intake of sufficiently high quality protein, therefore, protein quality is not a public health concern in the U.S.; (2) the U.S. is not a protein-deficient society which requires every protein source to be the highest ``quality''; a typical diet consists of proteins from a variety of sources and of varying quality; (3) the Nutrition Labeling Education Act (NLEA) of 1990 indicated that a daily value requirement for protein quality is not necessary; (4) over a 20-plus year history of producing mechanically separated poultry, there has never been a problem identified with the protein quality of products manufactured from this low cost ingredient; (5) processors have no control over the amino acid content of the chicken parts used to manufacture mechanically separated poultry_it is determined by genetics and not processing equipment; and (6) the protein quality testing requirements suggested in the ANPR for mechanically separated poultry are expensive, burdensome, and unnecessary.
