Colombia is no exception, and currently the presence of U.S. military forces in this country has generated a strong dispute between the State Council and President Cesar Gaviria. What do Latin American countries think of the U.S. military presence in our nations? Let us recall that not long ago in Paraguay and Uruguay, senators reacted against the presence of U.S. technicians in their countries. Let us immediately begin to learn the viewpoint of each nation. Let us begin with La Paz, Bolivia. Welcome Juan Jose Hidalgo. [Hidalgo] Thanks, Eduardo. Good morning, Latin America. The presence of U.S. troops in Latin America has raised concern and has prompted various responses. In Bolivia, they use the word technicians, even the word doctors, to avoid direct reference to the U.S. military regarding the presence of U.S. military units. To deal with this issue, we have invited Senator Andres Solis Rada, who is among those who have strongly criticized the U.S. military presence in Bolivia. Senator Solis will give us his opinion regarding the current situation in Bolivia. Senator, 130 million Latin Americans are listening to you. Good morning. [Solis] Good morning, and a Bolivarian greeting to my Latin American brothers. We believe that the systematic presence of the U.S. Armed Forces in our countries is the result of the existence of a new U.S. strategic doctrine regarding Latin American countries. That doctrine is called the new world order, and it was outlined by former U.S. President Ronald Reagan [as heard] immediately after the U.S. invasion of Panama on 20 December 1989. According to the new world order, concepts such as sovereignty, nation, armed forces, dignity, patriotism, or borders are obsolete terms. This doctrine comprises both a pretext and a practical reality. The pretext is the fight against drug trafficking. We believe that if the United States truly wants to eliminate drug trafficking, it can achieve this goal very in a short time -- I would say two or three weeks. How? It can simply control the laundering of $3 or $4 billion by international banks. Instead of controlling the banks, however, the United States has opted to send military forces with the illusory goal of catching mosquitoes with boxing gloves. The biggest drug traffickers are not in the jungles, but in New York's skyscrapers or in the modern buildings of Latin American capitals. Therefore, this is all a great pretext. We believe their primary objective is the occupation of the Amazonian region. According to the developed countries, the Amazonian region is one of the world's lungs, but from the Eurocentric viewpoint, humanity only includes Europeans and white North Americans. According to this outlook, the Amazonian region does not belong to Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Venezuela, Ecuador, or Colombia, but to them. They are seeking to rule the world with ideas that date back to 200 years ago -- the ideas of Adam Smith or Thomas Robert Malthus. To illustrate my point, I will recall that in May 1992, 400 U.S. engineers, who were specialists in troop landings, arrived in Bolivia. The odd part was that to justify their presence, it was argued that they were coming to repair schools and dig latrines. These schools and latrines cost $20,000, while providing transportation for these 400 U.S. engineers rang in at $8 million. Therefore, they are clearly not coming to build latrines or schools; they are getting ready to occupy the Amazonian area, especially the Brazilian part, where there is the greatest opposition to this policy. Their second goal is to get people used to the presence of foreign troops. Before I conclude, I cannot overlook the occupation of our countries by police forces. We have denounced the fact that Bolivia's major cities -- La Paz, Cochabamba, and Santa Cruz -- are patrolled 24 hours a day by agents under the command of Bolivian officials and who also work for the U.S. Government. Their vehicles have license plates that belong to international cooperation or intelligence services. In the end, if we remain passive regarding this situation, we will soon become colonies with a parliament and a flag, but the parliament and the flag will merely be a facade to cover this intervetion. Nevertheless, a slave who realizes his slavery begins to be free. Let us realize this situation of dependence to be loyal to Simon Bolivar's legacy and resist the very tense situation we are currently living. This is our viewpoint from La Paz, Bolivia. [Hidalgo] Thank you Senator Andres Solis Rada. You have heard the senator's position, which strongly questions the U.S. military presence in Bolivian territory. Back to you, Eduardo Lozano. [Lozano] Juan Jose, I really appreciate your report from La Paz, Bolivia. What are the thoughts in Venezuela? What are the Venezuelan people's ideas on whether or not they agree with the U.S. military presence? Caracas, welcome Elsy Verrueta: [Verrueta] Many thanks, Eduardo Lozano, and good morning to all our Latin American listeners. The topic has been a matter of controversy in our country in the past. The possibility that U.S. military forces could come to Venezuela arose emerged and it became the task of Division General Fernando Ochoa Antich to take charge of the problem. First, he was defense minister and then foreign minister until 2 February. He is our guest and he is going to give us his opinion and how he handled the situation. Of course, we also want to hear his opinion about the possibility that U.S. troops could remain in some Latin American country. Go ahead Gen. Fernando Ochoa Antich, we want to hear your opinion. [Ochoa] Many thanks. First, I want to take advantage of this extraordinary opportunity to send my cordial greetings to the Latin American people listening to us. When I was defense minister, I had the great responsibility of negotiating, with the United States, agreements for the antinarcotic radars. Venezuela was very firm in the position we presented to the U.S. negotiators, and we managed to convince them this was not possible in Venezuela because of a basic feeling or principle among Venezuelans of not accepting foreign troops under any circumstance, even though they were unarmed. Venezuelans would not accept, under any circumstance, that the radars be handled by U.S. troops. If this point was not amendable, then these radars could simply not be located in Venezuela, with all the consequences this would have had for the struggle against drug trafficking. We managed to convince the United States; they understood the Venezuelan position and fortunately an agreement was reached whereby the radars are operated entirely by the Venezuelan Armed Forces. This is a very strong feeling, both among Venezuelans as well as Latin Americans. I really cannot understand how Latin American Governments can accept foreign troops in their country -- mainly U.S. troops -- behind the back of the people, even though these troops need not be involved in any military activity. This is a problem of nationalism, which is deeply entrenched among Latin Americans because of our sad history of colonialism. That is why we and the people have always rejected this. This, despite the fact that current relations with the United States are much more constructive than relations based on Marine invasions. None of our people can accept the presence of foreign troops in our country due to our concept of liberty, which is so very much a part of our feeling. Another very basic point, which was discussed very intelligently by the Bolivian senator, is the interest in the drug-trafficking problem. The U.S. interest toward our countries right now, aside from the permanent interest in raw materials, is simply to do with drug trafficking. There are two very complex problems. One, their interest that our Armed Forces direct the work to fight drug trafficking. I have maintained a doctrinal position on this. The Latin American countries' Armed Forces cannot be used against drug trafficking because the corruption capacity of drug trafficking would force the Armed Forces to lose their main capacity as institutions intended to defend our countries and sovereignty. Therefore, this is a position that Venezuela has also maintained very firmly by rejecting the idea that our Armed Forces be used to fight drug trafficking. We accept that the National Guard, which is part of the Armed Forces but tasked mainly as an administrative police, can be used for this. In no way, however, will we accept the involvement of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force in fighting drug trafficking because this would change the main purpose of our Armed Forces. The third point, which I believe is very important and which I will stress, is that the struggle against drug trafficking cannot be successful until consumption in developed countries is controlled, as it should be. This is a fight which these countries must face because while the drug trafficking business remains so productive, this struggle is simply a loss of time, even though we are fighting. In this respect, I admire the people of Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia, who are waging an all-out war against drug trafficking, with a lot of sacrifice. The fact of the matter is that until consumption is not checked and until money laundering is not controlled, we simply cannot be successful in our struggle against drug trafficking. [Verrueta] Thank you Gen. Fernando Ochoa Antich for your valuable opinion. We return once more to Eduardo Lozano. [Lozano] Thank you Gen. Ochoa for your participation in this special program. Now we are with Jorge Ivan Melo, in Quito. [Melo] Thank you, Eduardo. Greetings to our 130 million listeners throughout Latin America. In 1987 in Ecuador, the Ecuadoran and U.S. Armies signed an understanding memorandum to allow military maneuvers and works in support of the civilian population. This resulted in the construction of a road that according to budget figures should have been 57 km long. Only 2,200 meters were built. We invited retired General Richelieu Levoyer to discuss this. He has been government minister, general commander of the Army, and a deputy. Currently, he is the president of Omidelac, Organization of Military Men for Democracy and the Integration of Latin America and the Caribbean. General, what has been the result of the U.S. military presence in Ecuador? [Levoyer] Thank you. First I want to cordially greet the Latin American community, which is very concerned about this very important issue. I can say the Ecuadoran people have always been opposed to the presence of U.S. troops in our territory. These troops sometimes come to build roads but the fact is we have excellent military and civilian engineers who can do this work. We also find it strange that U.S. troops have to come here to build one, two, or three small schools in the countryside. This is something our civil engineers, who can rely on the cooperation of the teachers, can do perfectly well. Why then must troops, and not civil engineers and technicians, come here to build roads or schools? In any event, the clearest evidence of the Ecuadoran people's position on the presence of U.S. troops in our country took place in 1987. I was a congressional deputy at the time. In March of 1987, there was a tremor that destroyed an interior road in our country's Amazon region, the Baeza-La Guagrio road, leaving approximately 100,000 people isolated. The U.S. Army and our government reached an agreement called Opening Routes. Based on this agreement, the U.S. Army would open an alternate 57 km long road going through the towns of Ollin, Loreto, and Coca. A total of 6,000 soldiers, arriving in groups of 600, came to the country to do the work in six months. The performance of this task force, the U.S. 1169 Task Force, was, to say the least, lacking. As a member of the congressional commission charged with overseeing the work of the U.S. troops, I personally confirmed that they built only 2,200 km [measurement as heard] of road. [Melo] General, the Bolivian senator and some Ecuadoran analysts have said the U.S. military wants to learn about Latin America's geography to put pressure on the jungle areas and to familiarize the people with U.S. troops so a future invasion is not seen as odd. How true could this be? [Levoyer] I agree with what Bolivian Senator Andres Solis Rada said. The 1987 event confirms his statement. That year I personally spoke with Lieutenant Colonel Powell, the commander of the U.S. group that came to build the alternate road in the Amazon region, and he emphatically and carelessly told me the U.S. objective had been accomplished: the training of U.S. soldiers in a jungle area like ours. He told me the U.S. troops had become accustomed to performing in this type of environment. Regarding the objectives of cooperation with and the transferal of technology to our military engineers, these objectives failed because equipment was lost, the soldiers did not know the river flow variances, their equipment sank in humid regions, and they could not work well. [Melo] We thank retired General Levoyer for his participation in this Solar program. Now we go back to Santa Fe de Bogota. [Lozano] Thank you. We will now contact Dennis Vargas, in Lima. What do Peruvians think about the involvement of U.S. military forces in aid programs? Go ahead Dennis. [Vargas] Latin America's tradition has been that of defending the principles of nonintervention and sovereignty. This should be clearly established in international law. American or North American doctrine on international law better outlines these principles. In the specific case of drug trafficking, we would have to analyze the situation. Legislative Branches are always concerned about respect for the legal framework of fighting drug trafficking in the various countries, especially in Bolivia, Peru, and Colombia. Some concepts put international law in danger when there is meddling. Our guest today is General Sinecio Jarama. We are asking him, as part of the Solar network, about the U.S. military presence in Peru or how much of a presence there was before and what can he tell us about the topic. What is the role of U.S. soldiers or military engineers in our countries? Over 100 million Latin Americans are listening to you. [Jarama] I would first like to thank you for this invitation. I also wish to send greetings to those 100 million Latin Americans listening to the Solar System. Getting into the topic of whether U.S. troops should be in our countries, it is worth noting first that this has been and remains a permanent concern for all Latin Americans, both civilians and military personnel. Second, it is also worth noting that in Peru there has been adamant opposition to the authorization of the presence of foreign troops in our territory. Whenever this has happened, or whenever there have been complaints about it, the people or various political or social sectors have reacted by demanding an explanation, and the appropriate authorities have explained the matter. Third, I also want to point out that the presence of foreign troops is addressed in the constitutions of all our countries. This is not a decision or whim on the part of the Pentagon or the U.S. Administration. Our constitutions give specific details of the measures to be followed, the steps to be taken, or the institutions to be consulted when a foreign country wants to bring its troops into our territories. This is also a problem that involves the exercise of our sovereignty. The president and his military advisers normally handle such matters. In addition, the respective legislatures must be asked for their authorization; that is, the countries' respective legislatures. That is where the exercise of our sovereignty comes in. I must also say, however, that over the past four decades, from the 1950's until now, the United States, through its military offices or military attache offices, has maintained relations with our military forces. These relations have allowed the development of cooperation programs, which are basically military training programs that have entailed joint actions by combined U.S.-Peruvian forces. There are also programs like Operation Unitas. There are other programs that are part of the training of U.S. reserve troops, which is the case with the troops in Panama. They come with engineer battalions, conduct training exercises, and leave behind some benefit for the community. [Vargas] Thank you, Gen. Jarama, for being with us on the Solar network. We are returning to Santa Fe de Bogota. Eduardo. [Lozano] Thanks, Denis, you are very kind. General Gabriel Puyana, our guest today, is a very well-known military man in Colombia, and although he has retired already, he is a true Colombian. We only have a minute, General. We would like to hear your opinion as a military member and a Colombian regarding the presence of foreign troops -- in this case, U.S. soldiers -- in Colombia. [Puyana] Thanks to Radio Cadena Nacional and the Solar Network. Since I only have a minute, I will be clear and concise. I was able to hear part of what the other guests have said on this program, and basically I agree with them. A distinction must be made, especially with the current controversy in Colombia, between troops being in a country on a temporary or permanent basis. The Inter-American Reciprocal Assistance Treaty signed in 1947 has been mentioned here. We must recall that Colombia participated in Korea. However, we must differentiate between technical advisers, who teach and help facilitate learning about new and sophisticated equipment, and regular troops, because the latter causes wariness and rejection. But there are different viewpoints about this issue. People in those isolated areas, who have been systematically and long forgotten by various governments, are satisfied because their urgent needs are somewhat relieved. But let's not confuse the issue. We cannot think that a military attache in another country implies a foreign military presence in that territory. The Peruvian General has discussed this already. These are two different situations. In addition, our histories give us certain obligations. If there are two countries that must assume dignified attitudes, setting aside the pragmatism of convenience, they are Mexico and Colombia. We must only recall Theodore Roosevelt and how Panama was taken away from Colombia. We were definitely better off, because it is as if one's arm is cut off [words indistinct], it is better to cut off the arm as it happened to Colombia. We were better off that another country, Panama, had to bear all that it has had to tolerate and will tolerate in this unending century. That is why I believe the presence of armed forces -- to be specific, logistics and operational units -- should not be accepted. There is some background to this issue. For example, there was an operation here called America 1962. We must clarify that there is a difference between technicians who teach and help and troops who are here on a permanent basis. Regarding the recent controversy, the problem arose basically due to a mishandling of information. It was very sad for Colombia -- and I say this as a Colombian -- that we had to learn about the entire episode through a statement by the ambassador as if this were a unilateral decision by the Pentagon. It was disgraceful. There has been a lack of information and misinformation. I want to reiterate that this is my personal opinion: I am not quoting anyone. As a Colombian, I do not approve of U.S. soldiers being here and doing things that we can do ourselves. [Lozano] Many thanks, Gen. Puyana, you have been very kind.
