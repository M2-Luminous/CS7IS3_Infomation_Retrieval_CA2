The agreement was reached during a meeting between Prime Minister Chuan Likphai and South Korean President Kim Young-sam. The two leaders also discussed ways to ease tensions over North Korea's suspected diversion of plutonium to build nuclear weapons, officials said. Prime Minister Chuan, who arrived Thursday for a four-day official visit wished President Kim success at the first-ever inter-Korean summit, which is currently being planned to help defuse the nuclear impasse. Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri, reaffirming Thailand's support of the non-nuclear proliferation treaty, said he hoped North and South Korea would be able to reach an accord on the issue through their talks. He said Bangkok hoped that North Korea would return to the Non-nuclear Proliferation Treaty and the United Nations' Security Council would not resort to harsh measures against the nation to force it to comply with the treaty. The United States is calling on the UN Security Council to impose economic sanctions against North Korea and Thailand, as a UN member, will have to comply with any resolution, he said. The Foreign Ministry's Southeast Asian Department Chief Don Paramatwinai quoted President Kim as saying that the nuclear conflict between South and North Korea posed not only a threat to the Korean Peninsula but the entire world. The South Korean President expressed hope that the June 28 summit would be successful. South Korea was prepared to negotiate with North Korea on mutual interest and world security issues, Mr Don quoted President Kim as saying. Mr Kim asked that regulations be eased to allow more South Korean firms to invest in construction and communications projects in Thailand, while Prime Minister Chuan asked that South Korea import more Thai agricultural goods. South Korea is Thailand's seventh largest trading partner, with two-way trade last year totaling US$1.94 billion, a two-fold increase over the past five years. South Korea exported US$1.47 billion worth of goods to Thailand last year, mostly in machinery, oil, Iron, steel, and automobiles, while importing sugar, computer parts, tapioca and rubber from Thailand. The two leaders also agreed to improve South Korea's relations with the Association of Southeast Nations (ASEAN) whose members include Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Indonesia and Brunei. During the meeting, Mr Don said President Kim also agreed in principle to a Thai proposal that a joint commission be set up between the two countries to promote trade and economic cooperation. No actual agreement has been signed on the proposal as both sides would need to discuss how the commission should be formed, he said. Prime Minister Chuan also extended an invitation to the South Korean leader to visit Thailand.
