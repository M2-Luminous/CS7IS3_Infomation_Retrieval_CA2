FR940907-0-00017 FR940907-0-00006 14 CFR Part 73 [Airspace Docket No. 92&hyph;AWP&hyph;6] Alteration and Subdivision of Restricted Area R&hyph;2503 and Revocation of R&hyph;2533; California AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action modifies Restricted Area R&hyph;2503, Camp Pendleton, CA, and subdivides the area into three separate areas designated as R&hyph;2503A, R&hyph;2503B, and R&hyph;2503C. R&hyph;2503A will incorporate part of the existing Restricted Area R&hyph;2533, Oceanside, CA. R&hyph;2533 will be removed concurrent with this action. This action will allow Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton to accomplish required training. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 UTC, October 13, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Paul Gallant, Military Operations Program Office (ATM&hyph;420), Office of Air Traffic System Management, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone: (202) 267&hyph;9361. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On November 23, 1993, the FAA proposed to amend part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 73) by subdividing Restricted Area R&hyph;2503, Camp Pendleton, CA, into three separate areas designated as R&hyph;2503A, R&hyph;2503B, and R&hyph;2503C and by removing R&hyph;2533, Oceanside, CA (58 FR 61854). Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments were received. This action also corrects an inadvertent error that was published in the notice concerning the base commander's name listed in the using agency. ``Commanding Officer'' should have been ``Commanding General.'' Except for the change noted above, this amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice. Section 73.25 of part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations was republished in FAA Order 7400.8B dated March 9, 1994. The Rule This amendment to part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations subdivides Restricted Area R&hyph;2503, Camp Pendleton, CA, into three separate areas designated as R&hyph;2503A, R&hyph;2503B, and R&hyph;2503C. Camp Pendleton has found that having two restricted areas with similar sounding, but different numbers is confusing, and has requested that R&hyph;2533 be removed and modified under the designation of R&hyph;2503A. R&hyph;2503A is smaller in size than the current R&hyph;2533. The southwestern boundary of R&hyph;2503A will be 2 miles closer to the shoreline so that the distance that nonparticipating aircraft will need to fly offshore to avoid the area will be reduced. Additionally, the boundary on the northwestern side of R&hyph;2503A will be adjusted to return airspace near San Clemente to the public. R&hyph;2503B is a slightly enlarged version of the existing R&hyph;2503. The southwestern boundary will be moved 1 mile toward the shoreline to enable the Marine Corps to provide requisite training. R&hyph;2503C is new airspace which will extend from 15,000 to 27,000 feet and will overlie approximately three-fourths of R&hyph;2503B. The Marine Corps has requested this additional airspace to accomplish required training, such as high angle, high altitude artillery firing, and has indicated that its use will typically be less than 40 hours per year. A change to the using agency to standardize format is also included in this action. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Environmental Review An Environmental Assessment (EA) of this action, resulting in a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI), was completed by the Environmental and Natural Resources Management Office, Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, CA. The FAA has reviewed the EA, and adopts the EA/FONSI, as supplemented by the Marine Corps. The FAA concludes that this action will have no significant impact on the environment.
