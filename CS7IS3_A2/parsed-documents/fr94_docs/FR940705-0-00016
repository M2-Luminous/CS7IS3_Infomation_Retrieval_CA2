FR940705-0-00016 FR940705-0-00002 Comments On September 1, 1993, REA published a proposed rule (58 FR 46097) to rescind REA Bulletin 345&hyph;90, REA Specification for Totally Filled Fiber Optic Cable, PE&hyph;90, and to codify the revised specification at 7 CFR 1755.900, REA Specification for Filled Fiber Optic Cables. Comments on this proposed rule were due by October 1, 1993. Comments and recommendations were received from several companies by this due date. The comments, recommendations, and responses are summarized as follows: One respondent commented that the language in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(iv) of 7 CFR 1755.900 should be changed to reflect fiber optic cable designs currently being used by REA borrowers. Response: REA reviewed the proposed language submitted by the commenter and as a result of our review will change the present language in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(iv) of 7 CFR 1755.900 to the language proposed by the commenter. One respondent commented that the language ``twenty-four colors'' in paragraph (a)(2) of the specification should be changed to ``twelve colors'' because the Electronic Industries Association/Telecommunications Industries Association (EIA/TIA) 598 Standard, Color Coding of Fiber Optic Cables, defines twelve standard colors with black and yellow striping used to expand identification up to twenty-four colors. Response: Since the EIA/TIA 598 Standard allows for identification of twenty-four fibers using a twenty-four color coding scheme that is identical to the twenty-four color coding scheme specified in 7 CFR 1755.900, REA will not change the language ``twenty- four colors'' to the commenter proposed language of ``twelve colors.'' Three respondents commented that the issue dates of the Electronic Industries Association (EIA) and the Electronic Industries Association/Telecommunications Industries Association (EIA/TIA) Standards referenced in paragraphs (a)(8) and (a)(9) of the specification should be changed to reflect their current issue dates. Response: REA agrees with the commenters recommendations and will change paragraphs (a)(8) and (a)(9) of the specification to reflect the current issue dates of the EIA and EIA/TIA Standards. One respondent commented that the mode-field diameter requirement of 7.5 # 1.3 micrometers for dispersion-shifted single mode fibers specified in paragraph (b)(4) of the specification will eliminate the use of their currently manufactured dispersion-shifted single mode fiber by REA borrowers. Response: Since it is not REA's intent to eliminate the use of dispersion-shifted single mode fibers which are currently manufactured and used on non-REA telecommunication systems with satisfactory results, REA will change the mode-field diameter requirement for dispersion-shifted single mode fibers from 7.5 # 1.3 micrometers to 7.5+1.5 micrometers/^1.3 micrometers to allow use of the manufacturer's dispersion-shifted single mode fiber by REA borrowers. Two commenters recommended that paragraph (b)(14) of the specification which requires that all optical fibers in any single length of cable of the same type be eliminated from the specification because it would deny REA borrowers the opportunity of purchasing hybrid cables which contain both single mode and multimode fibers. Response: In reviewing past REA 515 Contracts containing fiber optic cables, REA borrowers never purchased hybrid cables containing both single mode and multimode optical fibers. Review of current REA 515 Contracts reveal that REA borrowers are still not purchasing these hybrid fiber optic cables. In fact REA borrowers only purchase single mode fiber optic cables. Since there is no current interest by REA borrowers in purchasing hybrid cables containing both single mode and multimode optical fibers, REA at this time will not eliminate paragraph (b)(14) from the specification as recommended by the commenters. Two respondents commented on the shrinkback test to be performed on both loose tube and tight tube buffers. The first respondent indicated that tight tube buffers containing the optical fibers cannot meet criterion specified in the specification. The second respondent recommended that the shrinkback test be eliminated from the specification because they consider this test to be a cable component test and not a completed cable performance test. Response: In regard to the first commenter's comment, REA has no data from other manufacturers indicating that tight tube buffers containing the optical fibers cannot comply with the shrinkback requirement of the specification. In addition the respondent did not provide test data as to what the requirement should be for tight tube buffers containing the optical fibers. Finally paragraph (c)(6) of the specification allows the manufacturer the option of removing the optical fibers from the tight tube buffers prior to performance of the shrinkback test. Since the respondent did not provide an alternative requirement and the fact that the specification allows for removal of the fibers from the buffer tubes prior to shrinkback testing, REA will not change the shrinkback requirement specified in the specification.
