Sporadic violence continued for a third day in eight of the western state's 30 districts where arson and rioting snowballed after the Maharashtra administration renamed a unversity after the leader of low-caste Hindus. High-caste Hindus outraged by the move on Monday set ablaze an engineering workshop, a dam site and several schools in Parbani district and torched a government veterinary hospital in Jalna district, witnesses said. The attackers hurled rocks at state buses and private cars, forcing vehicles off the roads. Several Hindu and Buddhist temples also came under attack as tension rose in the eight districts torn by caste-strife, witnesses said. Train and bus services remained disrupted because of attacks by upper-caste Hindus protesting the renaming of Marathwada university after Baba Sahib Ambedkar, leader of the socially-oppressed low-caste Hindus. Police stepped up patrols to prevent violence from spilling into new areas. Police also prepared to block a visit later Monday by Hindu fundamentalist leader Bal Thackeray to the city of Aurangabad, site of the rechristened university. Thackeray is the leader of the Shiv Sena, whose members have been at the forefront of the violence which erupted Friday [14 Jan] after Maharashtra chief minister Sharad Pawar renamed the university. Police said they had blocked all entry points to Aurangabad to ensure that Thackeray does not reach the city. They have banned the visit by the firebrand Hindu leader, amid fears it would spark large-scale unrest. "Nobody is above the law," senior police officer Mahesh Narayan Singh said when asked whether Thackeray would be arrested. He also asserted that there was no violence on Monday in Marathwada district. On Sunday, Shiv Sena militants and upper-caste Hindus torched a veterinary hospital, a police station, two schools and a Dalit shanty town and attacked government buses and offices in Marathwada. No casualties were reported in the attacks. Shiv Sena sources said Thackeray plans to lead a rally Tuesday in Aurangabad to protest the renaming of Marathwada university after the author of the Indian constitution. Ambedkar is lionised by lower-caste Hindus, who are called Dalits or "downtrodden" -- those at the lowest rung of the Hindu caste ladder. If Thackeray is arrested, Shiv Sena activists would fan out into villages to carry out "disruptive activities," sources in his party said. A journalist meanwhile swallowed poison and died in the town of Yawat Mal on Sunday [16 Jan], leaving behind a suicide note that said he was taking his life to protest at the renaming of the university. Vinod Gudge was the first person to commit suicide to protest the renaming. Another protestor set himself on fire in Beed district but survived with burns to 80 percent of his body, the MAHRASHTRA TIMES said. Five "Dalits" had committed suicide to force the renaming of the university. The outbreak of inter-caste violence is India's worst since 1990, when the then premier, V.P. Singh, hiked job quotas for the lower castes.
