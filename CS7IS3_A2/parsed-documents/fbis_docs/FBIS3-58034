Together with the other co-chairman of the Geneva Yugoslavia conference, Thorvald Stoltenberg, Lord Owen spoke with [German] Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel about the civil war situation. While Kinkel expressly warned against optimism, Lord Owen went a step further and said that the leaders of all the warring parties were indifferent to the fates of the people "because they have lost touch with reality." They still thought that advantages were to be derived from continuing the fighting. The discussion with the two Yugoslavia mediators followed a meeting between Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, in the run-up to a two-way conference between Presidents Franjo Tudjman (Croatia) and Alija Izetbegovic (Bosnia-Herzegovina), who planned to meet at their own request in Bonn on Saturday [8 January]. Stoltenberg, too, spoke of a "deterioration in the situation." He regretted the lack of UN forces to enforce the UN Security Council resolutions, and warned against further force withdrawals.
