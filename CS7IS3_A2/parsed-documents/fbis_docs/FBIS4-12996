When the incident took place, the agent quarters in the autonomous region, as well as U.S. and Western quarters, initially said that the helicopters were shot down by Iraqi aircraft. When the truth came out and it was learned that the U.S. side was the one that downed the two helicopters, those quarters remained silent and could not avoid the truth. It seems they were forced to tell the truth because those who were killed in the incident were of several nationalities so the truth could not be hidden. Therefore, their black intentions to involve Iraq in any matter were exposed. This tendentious approach in leveling accusations against Iraq betrays premeditated intentions against Iraq. It also reveals the truth about many previous tendentious accusations regarding incidents that took place in the northern region in which Iraq was falsely accused in a tendentious, hasty manner.
