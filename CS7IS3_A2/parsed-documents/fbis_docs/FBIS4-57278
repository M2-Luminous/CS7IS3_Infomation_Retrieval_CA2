He said he is willing "to work for the FSLN's cohesion, to work with his best fellow party members as a team to encourage the rank and file, and to create a group that can lead us and the people to office." This would be the first time in the FSLN's history that the organization's top leader is elected by a secret and direct vote from among several candidates. In an extensive public letter, Ruiz said he decided to run for several reasons, including that "there is excessive polarization of opinion" in the FSLN and unity is needed for an essential renovation "to determine the new strategy to take office." Ruiz, who for the first time was publicly proposed as candidate by Doris Tijerino, an experienced FSLN member, had said he would consider whether or not his candidacy contributes to the party's unity. He did not accept the candidacy explicitly, however. In addition, Ruiz said: "Most of my fellow National Sandinist Directorate members favor a particular trend, an action that impairs their fairness in the debate and their objectiveness in political communication." He also argued: "The new office-taking strategy requires people's consensus to be on our side. The strategy demands a new political approach." "The 1996 victory implies restoring the lost confidence in the people. This restoration starts right at our homes," he said in his letter. He added: "Our people's democratic process demands changes in Sandinism's traditional perception." I Have No Personal Ambitions The current FSLN treasurer also said: "The truth is that I do not covet power. Such ambitions, even if they are legitimate, frequently prevent people from assessing the scenario in its true perspective." Over the weekend, Daniel Ortega, current FSLN secretary general, said the fact that several members run for the position could cause division in the party. In his letter, Ruiz disagreed with this view: "Such a remark runs against the variables that encompass the FSLN's modernization." In addition to expressing his reasons for agreeing to run, Ruiz assessed the FSLN's situation. Among other things, Ruiz said that division in the FSLN could be caused, not by a measured debate, but by "intolerance, inflexibility, fanaticism, the use of pejorative terms, the negation of criticism as a method of investigation, and bias as a tool to bend wills." "Sandinism's present problem is not whether or not leftists, centrists, or rightists coexist in the FSLN, or whether we are right on course or have strayed from ideological parameters," he said. According to Ruiz, the challenge the FSLN must meet is this: "To uphold principles and to enforce practical ways to heal the wounds that war left on our people. To undertake, with all the forces of the country, the lofty task of raising society's material foundation to improve people's standard of living." He also said that his problem has been "to be member of a party that had a consistent political position in the past but that no longer has this position." Only One Way Out: Victory "Sandinism requires a clear-cut strategy at present. Today's strategy is defined by the popular consensus as established through the direct and secret vote at the ballot boxes," Ruiz said. Therefore, "1996 is decisive for the future of Sandinism. If we win, Sandinism will survive. There is no dilemma, only one way out: Victory." Ruiz sternly warned his fellow party members: "There is no time to choose a course according to political inclinations. The Sandinists of today are in the presence of the Sphinx' enigma: Either we succeed or we are sentenced to oblivion." About the leadership crisis in his party, Ruiz said: "The current leadership is in crisis. Today's National Directorate is not different from the one we knew, from the one I knew. It is not the one that the lowliest people conceived and became familiar with. We are surrounded by facts and fantasy." Ruiz' candidacy has been supported, by among others, deputy Doris Tijerino, Col Javier Pichardo, retired, and Luis Enrique Figueroa, FSLN political secretary in Chontales department.
