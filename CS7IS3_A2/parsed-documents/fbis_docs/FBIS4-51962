In a letter dated May 4 to the headquarters for the promotion of the repatriation of unconverted long-term prisoners Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan to the North, the Human Rights Committee of the National Council of Christian Churches, the Bar Association for Democratic Society and the Family Movement for Realizing Democracy in South Korea, she said she believed no one would dare block her brother's return home because these organisations are making much effort for his repatriation and the international law provides for the return of prisoners of war, though the South Korean authorities take issue with his guerrilla activities and "acquirement of (South Korean) nationality" [word indistinct] fetched way. She denounced the rude behavior of the South Korean authorities in refusing to comply with the just demand of the Red Cross Society of the North for the return of Ham Se-hwan who was taken prisoner while in action during the last Korean war. She continued: "My brother is not willing to live in the South and cannot live there. "He has not abandoned his principle despite all manner of persecution and has asked South Korean and international Red Cross organisations to help him return to the Northern half of the country. This is because my brother Ham Se-hwan is earnestly hoping to come back to the homeland where his family and relatives including me, his sister, live. "I wish I could see once the face of my youngest brother, whom I raised on my back, before I leave this world. Please understand the anxious feelings of me, an old woman above 80 who is eagerly waiting for her brother to return home." In a letter dated April 25 to her brother, she informed him of her happy life in her eighties, without any inconvenience under the care of the country as well as of the lives of the relatives. She denounced the South Korean authorities for subjecting her brother to 34 years of imprisonment and all sorts of sufferings in a place away from home, without kith and kin for the mere reason that he refused to be converted ideologically. She said: "The day will surely come when we brother and sister will meet because efforts are being made here and in the South by kind-hearted people for your repatriation. "I ask you to actively fight in order to return to the DPRK at an early date."
