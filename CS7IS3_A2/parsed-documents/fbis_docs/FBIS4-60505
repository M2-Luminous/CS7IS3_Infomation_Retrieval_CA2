First Lieutenant Husayn Abu-Sulaymah, an official at the Khan Yunus post and who managed to enter the Gaza Strip 10 days ago, said that the Israeli military authorities have prevented them from entering on the pretext that their names contain errors and discrepancies, although his brother is one of them. It is worth noting that the families of the officers and soldiers can only send greetings and regards to them across the barbed wire dividing the city of Rafah. The relatives of the officers and soldiers complained to the National Authority officials and the Palestinian security men about this step. The officials have pledged to solve this problem as soon as possible. The officers and soldiers addressed an appeal to the PLO leadership to help them cross the Egyptian-Palestinian borders and reach the homeland.
