"The essence of Russian initiative is to nudge Bosnia's warring sides toward a peaceful solution to the problem," he told Russian journalists who accompanied him. "Russia must use its historically established ties with the Serbs to nudge them toward dialogue, not to encourage aggression." The issue of Russia's policy toward the former Eastern bloc countries cropped up more than once during his conversations in European capitals. Kozyrev assured his partners in the talks that Moscow is nurturing no "imperial plans", that it is prepared "to cooperate with everyone on the basis of neighborliness and mutual benefit". According to him, the intention of Central and East European countries to join NATO is no obstacle to this. "We do not rule out the possibility that Russia will also become part of NATO some time, but today the idea of partnership is of key importance," Kozyrev stressed. In this context NATO's "Partnership for Peace" program acquires special importance, the head of Russian diplomacy said. "There is a need to create a system of "cross-guarantees" by means of signing corresponding agreements with each European state separately," he said. Wednesday morning, addressing a conference on the prospects for Russian-Polish relations in Krakow, Kozyrev formulated Russia's concept of European partnership, which provides for transforming the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) into an "effective regional political organization, and the North-Atlantic Council for Cooperation into an independent structure of politico-military cooperation closely connected with the CSCE. When asked about his attitude to the Liberal Democratic Party and its leader, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, Kozyrev said: "I instructed the Foreign Ministry's press service to neither read what Zhirinovskiy says, nor react to it".
