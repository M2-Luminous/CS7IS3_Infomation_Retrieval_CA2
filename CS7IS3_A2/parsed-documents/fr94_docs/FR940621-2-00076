FR940621-2-00076 FR940621-2-00051 In addition to the cash advances, each Nursing Facility made cash contributions during 1992 and 1993 to their respective sub-Plan account in order to satisfy the Plan's liabilities. Such contributions were in excess of $273,000. 4. At present, the Plan holds certain assets that are not readily marketable and have limited liquidity. These assets consist of interests in New England Pension Properties V (NEPP V) and New England Pension Properties VI (NEPP VI). NEPP V and NEPP VI are real estate investment trusts/limited partnerships. The Plan has paid no servicing fees in connection with the holding of the Interests in NEPP V and NEPP VI nor have any restrictions been placed upon their sale or transfer. The Plan acquired the Interests in NEPP V and NEPP VI on June 22, 1987 and July 13, 1988, respectively, from Copley Partnerships, an unrelated party. The Plan made a cash investment of $50,000 in NEPP V and $40,000 in NEPP VI. At the time of acquisition, the per unit value of the Interests in NEPP V and NEPP VI was $1,000. Thus, the Plan received 50 limited partnership units in NEPP V and 40 limited partnership units in NEPP VI. Both NEPP V and NEPP VI have a maturity date of December 31, 2036. On July 31, 1990, the Plan received $1,926 from Copley Partnerships with respect to the Interest in NEPP VI. This amount represented a return of capital. In addition, the Plan received income payments of $14,082 for NEPP V and $11,165 for NEPP VI or a total income payment of $25,247. The Interests have been appraised by Fredric Daub, President of Capital Insurance Agency, Inc., an independent investment broker from Maynard, MA. In an appraisal report dated February 25, 1994, Mr. Daub has verified that during the fourth quarter of 1993, he obtained firm bids for NEPP V of $232 per unit and $324 per unit for NEPP VI in the secondary market. Thus, the fair market values of the Plan's Interests in NEPP V and NEPP VI would be $11,600 and $12,960, respectively, or a total fair market value of $24,560. Mr. Daub represents that these values reflect gross proceeds before the application of a one-time fee of $250 and a re-registration fee of an unspecified amount. Mr. Daub also notes that these values reflect a commitment as of the day of the offering and that the secondary market for investments such as NEPP V and NEPP VI is extremely limited. 5. To facilitate the liquidation and termination of the Plan and reimburse the Nursing Facilities for the cash advances they have made to the Plan, the Nursing Facilities propose to have the Interests transferred to them. Accordingly, an administrative exemption is requested from the Department. The Interests will be transferred to the Nursing Facilities for the greater of their historical cost to the Plan, their fair market value, or $100,754 representing the total outstanding loans advanced previously by the Nursing Facilities to the Plan. According to the applicant, these loans would have been repaid in cash had the Plan not been in the process of terminating. As a result of the transfer, the Nursing Facilities will cancel the outstanding indebtedness. The Plan will not be required to pay any fees or commissions in connection therewith. 6. In summary, it is represented that the proposed transaction will satisfy the statutory criteria for an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act because: (a) the transfer will be a one-time transaction to satisfy certain cash advances made by the Nursing Facilities to the Plan; (b) the Interests will be transferred to the Nursing Facilities for the greater of their historical cost to the Plan, their fair market value or the total amount of cash advanced to the Plan; (c) for purposes of the transfer, the fair market value of the Interests has been established by a qualified, independent appraiser; and (d) the Plan will not pay any fees or commissions in connection with the transfer.
