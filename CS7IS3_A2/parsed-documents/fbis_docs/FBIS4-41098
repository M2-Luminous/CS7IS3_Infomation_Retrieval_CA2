And if a crisis arose, who would benefit from it? In all hypothetical cases, we find the sinister "brown factor," without which a major political accident is unlikely, although fascism (hard or soft, brown or red- brown) would be the death of Russia, a disaster equal to that of 1917. The events on 3 and 4 October were a warning. Before that, who could have believed that the legal or even legalist opposition would hold out its hand to avowed Nazis, to Barkashov's gangsters (Footnote) (Aleksandr Barkashov, 41 years old, is the leader of the neo-Nazi Russian National Unity Party, which has a militarized group of party stewards)? Worse still that it would arm them? And yet that is what Khazbulatov, Rutskoy, and the Supreme Soviet did. In a time of crisis, in the name of the government, they thought they could form an alliance with the Nazis, and adopt their methods. This is the decisive political lesson of the present time.... This alliance was seen once again on 12 May during the meeting held by the newspaper ZAVTRA (Tomorrow), the organ of the "radical" opposition, for the launch of the Accord for Russia bloc. Rutskoy, Zorkin, and Baburin warmly applauded Barkashov's opening speech. The passionate support of the fringe elements was backed up by that of part of the country's political establishment, leaders of the parliamentary opposition. On the one side are deputies, chosen by legal ballot, and on the other are fringe elements and Nazis.... Of course, the avowed Nazis have little influence and, at first sight, are the "younger brothers" of the alliance. Seen more closely, however, they are its driving force. This paradox can be explained by the ideological poverty of the moderate nationalists. Despite their statements on "enlightened patriotism," they have never been able to define this concept which, all-in-all, is merely a chocolate filled with red-brown rum. On the other hand, the Nazis do have an ideology. Their watchwords are criminal and stupid, but clear. All the nationalist patriots can do is kneel at the polished boots of the Barkashov militias. Nazism is a malignant mutation of nationalism. National egoism is as natural as individual egoism. It only becomes aggressive if a feeling of frustration and injustice is added to it. Weimar's Germany is an example of this. The same feeling of lost empire exists in Russia today. The fall of Communism created an ideological vacuum which the values of the "consumer society" do not fill. They are an insult to a whole mass of people, like an advertisement for unobtainable products. It is at this level that nationalism comes in. The consumerist frustration is "sublimated" in national frustration, which gives it dignity and turns it into an ideology, gives it a spiritual dimension. The social and national frustrations come together producing what is called national-socialism. Remarks made by ordinary people, such as "the Caucasians are taking everything," are turned into ideas, producing "the universal plot against Russia is trying to turn it into a colony of Western, American, or Zionist capitalism." Even if racism proper is rare in Russia, this ideology plays on national and/or social prejudices. Behind this madness are real problems. As elsewhere, we have an ethnically structured Mafia (in addition to the Russian Mafia proper). On the world markets, there is a merciless struggle. Some circles are openly hostile to Russia and are seeking to isolate it. There is nothing surprising or horrible about that. Why has Russian society proved more vulnerable than others to the action of the red-brown killer bugs? Have our social structure and our history predisposed us to totalitarianism? In Central Europe, the totalitarianism imposed by our tanks collapsed once our tanks left. In our country, totalitarianism has been imposed in an endogenic way, produced by our society and our history. In our past, the aspiration to freedom and the rejection of freedom were tragically and indissolubly linked. Bolshevik totalitarianism inherited the autocracy it sought to destroy and carried it to its extreme logical conclusion. The Cheka shot the Black Hundreds but it was their spiritual daughter which surpassed its parents. Another example of the tragic interweaving of the terms of our historical conflict was the wartime watchword: "For the Fatherland, for Stalin." This slogan was developed to become: "For the Fatherland, and for Stalin which is its executioner." Our tragic history weighs heavily on the nation's memory and opposes the emergence of a rational and moderate conservatism. What national values to be defended could a Russian conservatism include in its program? Civilian society? The autonomy of the individual in face of the state? Private property? Yes, all these values exist in our country, but only in an embryonic state. Thus Russian conservatism is sliding, by inertia, toward the "cult of autocracy" and the "policy of the big stick." And yet, a healthy society must have a strong conservative pole, because that is the most effective curb to keep nationalism within reasonable limits. This healthy Russian nationalism, which would be based on the Russian people's civic rights and on their inalienable right to private property, does not yet exist. We intend to build it if social circumstances permit. The structure of society is even more important than the psychological traditions. The totalitarian regime has been knocked out but is still standing. The economy is still militarized. The bureaucratic oligarchy still holds the economic and political power. It persists in its desire to return to the past. The ultimate foundation of a society is formed by relations of ownership and we are still resolving this historical problem for Russia. The move toward capitalism is now irreversible. The problem is whether we want a bureaucratic capitalism or a democratic capitalism. If we opt for the bureaucratic-state option, we are condemning ourselves to stagnation and Russia will merely be a semicolonial supplier of raw materials. This brings us back to the famous "plot against Russia." It is not the "Masonic lodges" which are hatching it, but our own bureaucratic elite in the name of its so-called "sense of state" (but this is a semicolonial state). The bureaucracy has kept the bulk of the power, particularly in the provinces. Its only interest is to maintain it. Like all the rich, bureaucrats are cautious and fear extremes. That does not prevent them from talking with the Nazis, just in case. Is it possible that they will opt for the Nazi alliance, thinking that they are "hiring gangsters to serve them," like the Weimar Republic on the eve of its fall? Only an alliance with the most aggressive party of the bureaucratic bourgeoisie can pave the way to power for the Nazis. Such an alliance was formed in October 1993 with Rutskoy, Khazbulatov, and other members of the former Supreme Soviet. Let us now imagine a mutation on a bigger scale, and we will see the scale of the resulting political disaster. Fascism in Russia is only possible in the form of a dictatorship exercised by the most aggressive sections of the parasitic "bureaucratic bourgeoisie." The alliance between this bourgeoisie and the Nazis is the main danger which we have to combat. Compared with the fashionable hopes in an "enlightened authoritarianism," my position is clear: There can only be a "good dictatorship" for those who would live happily even with a bad one. We must counter the possible alliance of the bureaucrats and Nazis with our own alliance of democrats and the liberal bourgeoisie, while neutralizing the most influential sectors of the bureaucracy and, consequently, safeguarding their interests. Of course, our interests are opposed to those of the bureaucracy: We are in favor of developing the market economy, eliminating the control of the bureaucratic oligarchy over the economy. But, out of principle, we are opposed to a fight to the death. We only envisage such a struggle as necessary and inevitable against the Nazis, and we only mean the term "death" in the political sense. Faced with the bureaucracy and the bourgeoisie linked to it, we are still ready to seek a compromise and pursue our policy so as never to force them into a corner. The essential thing is to avoid an alliance within which, for the bureaucracy, the Nazis are seen as the "lesser evil." The whole of Russian history shows that, for a coup d'etat to be possible, a situation of dual power is necessary, as was the case in 1917, in August 1991, and in October 1993. The democratic forces must therefore ensure that they never allow such a situation to arise again. We show our support for Russia's national interests by seeking to ensure that every Russian citizen can have a normal and dignified life, whereas the "nationalists" gauge their patriotism by the yardstick of their hatred of non-Russians, or even with the help of the compasses used to measure the thickness of non-Aryan skulls. We have more of a sense of the fatherland and state than they do and we express this by trusting the people and telling them the truth. Our dignity lies in our reason. And it is in the light of reason that specters vanish, including the specter of Nazism which is trying to terrorize our fatherland.
