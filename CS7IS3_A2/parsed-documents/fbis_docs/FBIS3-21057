Chairman of the VKE, Dr. Albrecht Eckell, says, "By 1998, capacities of 700,000 metric tons per annum and more will be ready." In the case of returnable packages, plastics are already on the offensive in the Federal German packaging market, according to Dr. Bernd Hallier. He is the director of the Euro-Handelsinstitut in Cologne. In the case of non-returnable packages on the other hand, he says that plastics are still on the defensive. The reason for this is the recycling crisis into which the plastic branch has slid since the Packaging Ordinance became law. This is because the increase in capacity for material utilization of plastics has not yet been able to keep up with the rapidly growing amounts collected by the Dual System Deutschland (DSD) in Bonn. However, this situation will change soon. Dr. Albrecht Eckell predicted on 30 November at the "Plastics + Environment" symposium in Cologne that, "Just using raw-material recycling, the plastic utilization problem will be solved by 1998." He is the chairman of the Association of Plastics Producing Industries (VKE) in Frankfurt. Starting by the end of 1997, he claims that in Germany, recycling capacities on the order of magnitude of 700,000 metric tons per year and more will be available. In spite of this, Dr. Albrecht Eckell welcomes the current political consideration being given to the Packaging Ordinance and the acceptance of raw-material recycling (in the form of chemical preparation methods) as material reuse provided in the draft amendment. This is because a fifty-fifty division of the discussed new utilization quota (60% instead of the previous 64%) between processed-material recycling (plastic remains plastic) and raw-material recycling (plastic becomes petrochemical raw material) is still not sufficient in the opinion of Dr. Johannes Brandrup, the director responsible in his association for environmental interests. For reasons of quality, only 10% to 20% of the recycled processed material may be accessible over the long term. Reutilization on a large scale, on the other hand, is provided by the raw material method. Prof. Dr. Klaus Topfer is the Federal Minister for the Environment. In an amendment to the Packaging Ordinance, he wants to see the pressure maintained on the industry by means of a specific quota for processed-material recycling. Corresponding technologies that are just starting in the small-business arena should not be allowed to wither because of a lack of critical mass. "Where we set bottlenecks in a market economy, the reaction is not resignation but rather technical progress." Virtually no packaging has remained unchanged for example as a result of the Ordinance -- with a corresponding reduction in the packaging volume. Even the DSD has struck a resounding chord with the people. The bottleneck in utilizing sales packages is not demonstrated in collecting nor in sorting but in material utilization. However, it could scarcely be expected that appropriate capacities for reutilization would be built before the corresponding quantities of material were available. According to Topfer, "For me, the question in amending the Packaging Ordinance is, what is utilization? For this reason, in the future, we will not only observe and make possible processed-material recycling but also raw-material recycling in all possible facets. We are assuming that both sub-areas will achieve a recycling quota of 60% by 1998 and want to specify this quota in the amended Ordinance." In the words of the Federal Minister for the Environment, everything exceeding these figures not only can be sent to a thermal utilization process but must be sent there. Says Topfer, "No one can explain to me why it is that we mine brown coal from the earth using open-pit mining, burn this coal for power and heat and then fill the holes we have made by mining with domestic trash when the domestic trash has a higher heating value than the brown coal."
