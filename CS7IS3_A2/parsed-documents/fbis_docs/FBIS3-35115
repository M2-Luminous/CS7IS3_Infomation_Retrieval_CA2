The ministerial source told AL-HAYAH that arms contracts concluded between two states or between a state and the manufacturing company usually stipulate that the country which purchases or uses the aircraft has no right to dispose of them without prior approval. He said that the Lebanese Government will seek France's approval as soon as it receives an official offer from the Pakistani Government to purchase the Mirage planes. Lebanon will thus have complied with the terms of the contract signed between the two countries. There is no commitment in the contract as far as Dassault, the manufacturing company, is concerned. Discussing numbers, the source said that the Lebanese Army's Air Force had received 12 Mirage aircraft since 1968, all made in 1967, and that although they were placed in active service, they were operated for only a limited number of hours. He confirmed that the Army command now has 10 aircraft still parked at al-Qulay'at military airfield in 'Akkar (in the north), and that the other two were damaged before 1975, one having crashed during exercises in the early seventies at Riyaq airbase in al-Biqa' -- the pilot survived. In conclusion, the source said that "although their manufacture dates back to 1967, the aircraft are as good as new and are in good condition because of their limited flying hours not exceeding 100. They need maintenance to become operational." It is known that the Pakistani Air Force has some Mirage aircraft.
