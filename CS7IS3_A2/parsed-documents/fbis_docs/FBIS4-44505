Explains in Detail the Three Great Change Factors That Will Decide the Future Political Situation, and the Eight Different Outlooks Stemming From Different Combinations of Strengths and Weakness of the Three Change Factors"] [Text] The author of this article is an assistant professor at the CPC Central Committee Party School who uses a pen name for reasons that may be inferred. This article makes a rather brief, complete, and factual exposition of the social and political situation on the China mainland. The models for forecasting the post-Deng political situation are also scientific and fresh. They provide a rare analysis from within the CPC for the discussion of the post-Deng political situation that follows. When people speculate about whether the Chinese political situation will become chaotic once Deng Xiaoping passes away, I first define "chaotic" as social and political disorder resulting from the intensification and eruption of various social and political contradictions when cohesiveness is lost. Three Great Change Factors That Will Determine the Future Political Situation It is apparent from this definition that there are three main variables that will determine whether the political situation in China becomes chaotic once Deng Xiaoping passes away. The first is the socio-political contradictions (the kind and the intensity) that accumulate while Deng is still alive; the second is the degree of cohesiveness and the possibilities for cohesiveness within the party when Deng passes away; and the third is economic factors. The correlation among these three variables is as follows: 1) The correlation between socio-political contradictions and institutional cohesiveness is: the higher the degree of cohesiveness within the system, the more easily social and political contradictions outside the system can be surmounted. Conversely, the lower the degree of cohesiveness within the system, the less easily social and political contradictions outside the system can be surmounted. 2) The correlation between the economic situation and institutional cohesiveness is as follows: the better the economic situation, the more easily cohesiveness can be achieved. Conversely, the worse the economic situation, the more difficult the achievement of cohesiveness. 3) The correlation between the economic situation and social contradictions is as follows: the better the economic situation, the fewer the contradictions, meaning that even though contradictions may exist, they will not easily intensify. Conversely, the more readily contradictions may arise and be difficult to surmount. This article analyzes the three variables that will determine the Chinese political situation after Deng passes away, and it arranges them to form eight models that show eight possible scenarios that may unfold. Vermin Who Become Wealthy Overnight Intensify Social Contradictions 1. Socio-political contradictions The first important variable determining China's political future is the social and political contradictions that have piled up by the time Deng passes away. So-called social contradictions means the contradictions between unorganized social forces, such as contradictions between peasants and urbanites, and contradictions between working people and corrupt officials or profiteering parvenu merchants. These contradictions usually stem from unfair distribution or other inequities or injustices. They are rooted in the distribution crisis, which is one of the five kinds of political crises that a society in transition must go through according to the American Comparative Government Committee (The five are administrative crisis, participation crisis, legitimacy crisis, identity crisis, and distribution crisis). By so-called political contradictions is meant contradictions among organized political forces (or semi-organized political forces such as social movements). Contradictions among organized political forces include contradictions between civil rights forces and the CPC, as well as contradictions between ethnic separatist forces and the government. The former example is a manifestation of the participation crisis; the latter is a manifestation of the identity crisis. Since 1984, the contradictions between ordinary and wage and salary workers and corrupt officials and profiteering parvenu merchants have become more and more serious. If one acknowledges that prior to 1989 corrupt officials gobbled up the property belonging to the whole people through graft, bribe taking, diversion of public funds for private use, and taking trips at public expense, then the situation during the past several years has reached open looting proportions. The contract operating system, development of the joint stock system, and the formation of enterprise partnerships and mergers all provide corrupt officials opportunities to embezzle state-owned assets. Some of them misappropriate state-owned and collectively owned assets by colluding with accounting offices, auditing agencies, and notary organizations to arrange false evaluations, false audits, and false notarizations. Some misappropriate, illegally divert, or swindle state or collectively owned property in the name of contracting. Others insert themselves as middlemen in commercial and trade activities to get a share of profits that should go to state-owned or collective enterprises. Still others abuse their official position to make a profit, gaining equity rights without paying for them in the course of share system reform, share listing, and share trading. Some enter into collusion all around, arrange under-the-counter deals, practice bribery and get kickbacks for facilitating loans, helping get licenses, assisting with court cases, assisting press operation, assisting household registration, and helping handle title deeds. Some resort to falsification of exports to cheat on tax rebates. Some abuse their authority to set up private companies abroad, or engage in off-the-books operations inside China, falsely using the name of a unit operating abroad or a foreign firm to make illegal profits... The methods are unusual and varied. A November 1993 Central Television Broadcasting Station news report said that 200 billion yuan worth of state-owned assets had been lost somehow. Some experts estimate that the amount should have been no less than 300 billion. Where did these assets go? The fact is they flowed through the hands of corrupt officials into their own, or their children's and relative's, pockets. These tremendous assets make them China's new bourgeoisie in fact as well as in name. While these vermin are getting rich overnight, or carousing around, betting huge sums on the roll of the dice, being social butterflies, or throwing stock markets and exchange markets into turmoil, how many peasants can get only an IOU for the grain and cotton they sell the state! How many children cannot attend school because they are unable to afford 300 yuan for books! And how many intellectuals, working masses, retired and separated cadres and workers who have just a few hundred yuan in wages or pension bemoan the steady rise in prices. The dissatisfaction of the masses toward corrupt officials and rich merchants and tycoons is bound to translate into dissatisfaction with the CPC and the government because, in a certain sense, this state of affairs might be said to be directly or indirectly attributable to certain CPC distribution policies or government's feeble withholding capabilities. What is more, when the rural price index exceeds the city price index for the first time, the peasants will want to go after the government about the various kinds of taxes, assessments and fines levied in the name of the law. No wonder that during a visit to a certain county in Hunan Province, when Jiang Zemin asked a peasant what he needed most, the reply he received was, "What I need most is Chen Sheng and Wu Guang." Once social contradictions intensify, they generate a large scale popular reaction that is bound to create a revolutionary situation. Whether this revolution is benign (constructive) or malignant (purely destructive) depends on whether at the time the revolution occurs a political organization can be formed that is sensible and that is guided by reform and modernization. The CPC Has Itself Created a Huge Opposition Faction The conflict between the civil rights movement and the CPC has gone on for 15 years since 1979. If one says that the CPC has been unable to bring corrupt officials to heel, it has also never been soft on the civil rights movement, not to mention that since thousands of resisters have been cruelly butchered or jailed since 4 June 1989. Who knows how many civil rights movement personnel were jailed in 1989 alone? Since Wei Jingsheng was sentenced to 15 years in prison in 1979, virtually no one who founded a civilian publication or held a responsible position in one has escaped misfortune. In 1981 alone, the following people were sentenced to prison or labor reform: In Beijing, Xu Wenli [1776 2429 4539] and Chen Erjin [7115 1422 2516] of SIWU LUNTAN [JUNE 4TH FORUM], to 15 and 12 years respectively; in Guangzhou, Wang Xizhe [3769 1585 0772] and Xu Yongliang [1776 3055 5328] of XUEXI TONGXIN [STUDY COMMUNICATIONS], to 14 and 10 years respectively; in Guangzhou again He Qiu [0149 3061] of RENMIN ZHI LU [THE PEOPLE'S ROAD], to 10 years; in Shanghai, Fu Shenqi [0265 3947 1142] of MINZHU ZHI SHENG [THE PEOPLE'S VOICE], seven years (Released from prison in 1986, he was jailed again in 1991. He was let out of jail in February 1991 only to be sentenced to three years labor reform in 1993). Sun Weibang [1327 4850 6721] of HAILANGHUA [SEA SPRAY] in Qingdao was sentenced to one year (Following the 4 June incident, he was sentenced to an additional 12 years). In Wuhan, Qinu Yongmin [4440 3057 2404], Zhang Minpeng [1728 2404 7720], and Zhu Jianpin [2612 0256 2430] of ZHONG SHENG [BELL SOUND] were sentenced to a respective eight years in prison, three years in labor reform, and six years in prison. In Hangzhou, Shen Jianmin [3088 0256 3046] of ZHI JIANG was sentenced to four years. In Tianjin, Tang Gedan [3282 2047 2481], Liu Shixian [0491 1102 6343] and Lu Honghe [0712 3163 0735] of BOHAI ZHI BIN [SHORES OF BOHAI] were sentenced respectively to 4 1/2 years imprisonment and three and three years of labor reform. In Chongqing, Liang Junxi [2733 0193 6007] of GONGMIN BAO [CITIZENS NEWS] was sentenced to an unknown number of years imprisonment. In Anyang, Liu Eran [0491 0059 1344] of MINZHU ZHUAN [DEMOCRATIC BRICKS] was sentenced to one year. Even those members of the civil rights movement who were not sentenced to jail have been treated with prejudice. An example is Hu Ping [5170 1627], the editor-in-chief of the former WOTU [FERTILE EARTH], who was stripped of his masters degree and not assigned to a job for two years. Following graduation from university, poet Bei Ling [6296 1545], a member of the editorial committee of the first issue of the former ZHONGGUO RENQUAN [CHINESE HUMAN RIGHTS], was deprived of his right to work for two years following graduation. Following Deng's remarks during his travels in south China, the mainland civil rights movement once again became sctive, and tended toward reasonableness. Its "Peace Constitution" expressed support for CPC reforms and called for social reconciliation. Thanks to the campaign to eradicate spiritual pollution of 1983, the anti-bourgeoisie liberalization campaigns of 1981 and 1987, and the large scale massacre, large scale arrests, and large scale purges of 1989, the CPC created with its own hands an enormous opposition faction. This opposition faction includes not only the activists of the Democracy Wall and election campaign period, but also those who supported Hu Yaobang's "Lilun Wuxu Faction" [3810 6158 0523 5711 3175] (people such as Yan Jiaqi [0917 1367 0366], Zhang Xianyang [1728 7359 2254], Su Shaozhi [5685 4801 2535], Yu Haocheng [0060 3185 2052], Yu Guangyuan [0060 0342 6678], Hu Jiwei [5170, 4958 0251], Wang Ruoshui [3769 5387 3055], Wang Ruowang [3769 5387 2598], Xu Liangying [6079 5328 5391], Li Honglin [2621 3163 2651], Li Shu [7812 3412], Guo Luoji [6753 5012 1015], Wu Mingyu [0702 2429 3842], Ge Yang [2047 2254], Ruan Ming [7086 6900], Sun Changjiang [1327 7022 3068], and Li Rui [2621 6904], plus Zhao Ziyang's braintrust, the members of the "three institutes and one association." If one says that each of these civil rights forces was fighting its own war prior to "June 4th," the "June 4th" repression made them unite and set up a "civil rights association front" overseas. The civil rights movement in China is fairly quiet today because of severe repression and strict control, but it does not lack a small number of courageous people who have established an underground organization to carry on resistance activities. Examples include the "Chinese Freedom and Democracy Party," the Chinese Free Trade Union Preparatory Committee," and the "China Progressive League," which the Chinese Communists apprehended in 1991. They were preparing to use a model airplane to scatter leaflets over Tiananmen Square on 4 June that year calling on the people not to forget "June 4th." When the incident came to light, scores of people were arrested, 16 of them in Beijing including Hu Shigen [5170 4258 2704], Kang Yuchun [1660 3768 2504], Wang Guozhai [3769 0948 7872], Lu Zhigang [7120 2535 0474], Liu Jingsheng [0491 0079 3932], Gao Yuxiang [7559 3768 4382], Wang Tiancheng [3769 0160 1813], Wang Peizhong [37690150 1813], Chen Qinglin [7115 7230 2651], Chen Wei [7115 5898], Zhang Chunzhu [1728 4783 2612], Rui Chaohuai [5360 2600 2037], Xing Hongwei [6717 1347 0251], Li Quanli [2621 0356 0448], Xu Dongling [6079 2639 1545], and Zhang Guojun [1728 0948 6874]. In June 1992, Wang Shengli [3769 0524 0448] and Liao Jian [1675 0679 1344], Chinese People's University students, were arrested by the CPC for "counterrevolutionary propaganda instigation" because they had organized a student's society called "Book Reading Society" and published a magazine titled DAJIA [EVERYBODY]. Following Deng Xiaoping's remarks during this travels in south China, the civil rights movement became active on the mainland once again, but tended toward reasonableness. The "Peace Constitution" issued by nine people including Qin Yongmin [the editor of the former Wuhan magazine, ZHONG SHENG, and Yang Zhou [2799 0719] expressed this trend. While calling upon the CPC to release political criminals, abolish counterrevolution as a crime, and accelerate political system reform, this constitution also called for peaceful reform. In this regard, it expressed support for the CPC-led reforms, and called for social reconciliation. The Chinese Communists response to this moderate manifesto was to arrest Qin and Yang. This action was tantamount to refusing to join hands with the civil rights movement on reform for a peaceful transition to a modern society. It also stifled the possibility of a benign revolution and avoidance of the prospect of a destructive, malignant revolution should a reckless and large scale popular uprising occur. News of Bloody Clashes in Southern Xinjiang and in Lhasa The contradiction between the minority nationalities and the Han nationality is not just a social contradiction. In Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Tibet, it has become a political contradiction as well. For many years, organized ethnic separatists have fought for the independence of Xinjiang and Xinjiang. Their political goal is the establishment of a Turkestan and Turpan republic. Despite the strict news blockade, one still hears about bloody clashes in southern Xinjiang and Lhasa. The 22 November 1985 demonstration and presentation of a petition by more than 3400 Uygur students from all Beijing institutions of higher education opposing the government's use of Xinjiang as a nuclear weapons test range, and as a place for the banishment of criminals is well known. The intense ethnic conflicts and bloody clashes in Inner Mongolia are apparently not as serious as those in Xinjiang and Tibet; nevertheless, the Mongol hatred of the Han and their anti-foreign sentiment is no less than that of the Uygurs and the Tibetans. The source of the trouble is the purge of the Inner Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party [MPRP] during the Cultural Revolution. This party was originally a Mongolian anti-Japanese resistance organization, which was subsequently merged with the CPC. During the Cultural Revolution, acting on orders of the CPC Central Committee, the MPRP Central Committee's first secretary, chairman of the revolutionary committee, and commander of the military region, Teng Haiqing [3326 3189 3237], said that an MPRP whose goal was the merger of Inner Mongolia and Outer Mongolia still existed in Inner Mongolia, and that ethnic Mongolians in the CPC were members of this party. Thus a mammoth, pervasive, and sustained campaign of "ferreting out and purging" was launched. During the course of this campaign, 100,000 ethnic Mongolian Party cadres were arrested and locked up, and more than 10,000 were beaten to death. Most of those doing the beating were ethnic Han who used extremely brutal medieval torture implements, such as drilling holes into people's bodies with a red hot iron chopstick, or suspending a large iron cauldron filled with water on steel wires from the neck of a person being interrogated, then making him stand arms stretched sideward on a high bench at the end of a fire pit, the cauldron hanging in a roaring fire until the water in it reached a rolling boil and scalded the person being interrogated till he had no choice but to confess. Many people died from this torture because they refused to confess. To this day, whenever the term "ferret out and purge" is mentioned, ethnic Mongolians gnash their teeth, and when Teng Haiqing is mentioned, they would like to eat his flesh and skin him. Three Large Chinese Communist High Level Factions 2. Cohesiveness Within the System and Ability of the System To Maintain Cohesiveness When Deng Passes Away The second important variable determining China's political future is cohesiveness within the system and the ability of the system to maintain cohesiveness. There are four groups whose cohesiveness must be maintained: all party factions, local power factions, civil rights forces and ethnic separatist forces, and various mass organizations and social forces. 1. All Party Factions The main high level factions in the CPC today are as follows: (A) The main line faction of which Jiang Zemin is the "nucleus," which is now being built and whose perimeters are as yet undemarcated. Since becoming CPC Committee secretary general, Jiang has made no contributions to ideological theory or to modernization plans or lines, but he has put a lot of effort into accumulating strength and gaining power. He knows very well the importance of military support. In contrast to Zhao Ziyang, who never concerned himself with military affairs when he was vice chairman of the Military Affairs Committee, Jiang seeks out persons in charge in all sectors of the Military Affairs Committee and military regions for individual chats. He has also transferred to Beijing his old comrade-in-arms and former Shanghai garrison commander Ba Zhongtan [1572 0022 6151], promoting him to commander-in-chief of the People's Armed Police. The incumbent chairman of the CPC Office, Zeng Qinghong [2582 1987 4767] is also a secretary who Jiang Zemin brought from Shanghai. In addition, CPC Propaganda Department director Gong Xinhan [7895 1800 3466], Chinese Social Sciences Academy deputy director Liu Ji [0491 0679], and RENMIN RIBAO deputy editor-in-chief, Zhou Ruijin [0719 3843 6855] are all people Jiang transferred to important posts from Shanghai. This shows somewhat that he subconsciously fears a repetition of the 1976 Hua, Ye, and Wang seizure of the "gang of four." If one says that prior to 1992 Jiang's work emphasis was on opposition to the right and prevention of peaceful evolution, since the remarks of Deng Xiaoping during his travels in south China, one must admit that he has suddenly changed into a vanguard for reform. He is currently employing the three volumes of Deng's selected works as a banner for increasing cohesiveness in order to consolidate his own "nuclear" position in the hope of creating a mainline faction within the party. Whether such a mainline faction can be formed and its ability to achieve cohesiveness with other factions holds great importance for the future stability of the political situation. However, the most unfavorable factor for the formation of this mainline faction and its cohesiveness is Jiang himself. Possibly as long as Deng lives, he will be found hand and foot, but whatever the case, his left lining and his mediocre performance since 1989 have left an indelible impression in people's minds. Unless Jiang and his faction can do something spectacular in the days immediately following Deng's demise, one can imagine how weak his ability to achieve cohesiveness will be. B. The leftist faction united around the person of Deng Liqun [6772 0500 5028]. Historically, the persistence of leftism in the CPC has been an extremely serious ailment. The power of the leftist faction is deep-rooted. Even during the decade of reform and opening to the outside world, the leftist faction has been able to organize forces to make three major comebacks in 1981, 1983, and 1987. The power of the leftist faction increased greatly in the wake of "June 4th." Not only did it take the opportunity to settle scores with the reform faction, but it also took back many important powers from the central government to local governments, and from party affairs to the government. It also used the public opinion and propaganda power it held to instigate a constant leftist clamor, even going so far as to say that the seizure of the capitalist roaders during the Cultural Revolution was correct (a speech that Deng Liqun made commemorating the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the CPC). "The theory of continuing revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat remains the touchstone for differentiating true and false Marxism" (State Education Commission document written to provide guidance to professors at East China Teachers College in Shanghai). It said that it is necessary to "seize the initiative in handling contradictions" anew. (An article written by Deng Liqun published in the 23 October 1991 issue of RENMIN RIBAO). In order to seize this initiative, this faction is preparing to do battle with the reform faction after Deng passes away. It is collecting and collating all sorts of typical materials to criticize Deng's rightist errors. Zemin is using the three volumes of Deng's selected works as a banner to increase conformity and consolidate his own "nuclear" position in the hope of shaping a future mainstream faction within the party. C. The reform faction. The people generally regarded as comprising the reform faction include incumbent Politburo members Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, and Tian Jiyun, former Politburo members Zhao Ziyang, Wan Li, and Hu Qili, and former Secretariat secretaries Zhu Houze, Yan Mingfu, and Rui Xingwen. Their reform orientations are not entirely the same. For example, Zhao Ziyang not only advocates market-oriented economic reforms, but also stands for a considerable degree of opening to the outside world, democracy, and freedom. Some of the others may want to build a market economy first and then talk about freedom and democracy. Some only approve of a market economy, but basically do not agree with espousing freedom and democracy. These differences mean that although the CPC high level reform faction can maintain unanimity in the face of leftwing faction attacks on reform and opening to the outside world, it may split on political reform issues. Reportedly, Zhao Ziyang and others are pondering the problem of how to redress the June 4th events. Once Deng passes away, the NPC and the CPPCC, which Qiao Shi, Tian Jiyun, and Li Ruihuan head may become bases for consolidating the reform faction and for pushing ahead with reform and opposition to the counterattacks of the leftist faction. Three Main Ways of Gaining Cohesiveness Within the CPC Once Deng dies, no matter whether the leftist faction first rises in revolt or whether the reform faction, which advocates political reform, rises in revolt, a clash between the two factions will surely be difficult to avoid. What role elder statesmen like Chen Yun and Bo Yibo will play in this clash at that time is also difficult to estimate. Generally speaking the tactics that the CPC has used to produce conformity within the party have been the leaders (personal charisma), the system, and ideology. When Mao Zedong was alive, all three of these methods played a role; consequently, cohesiveness within the party was extremely high at that time. Since the advent of reform and opening to the outside world, a unified ideology has become virtually useless in achieving cohesiveness, and the system cohesiveness that Deng has always hoped to build has yet to be realized. Thus, all that is left is the cohesiveness that the leaders individually can bring. Even during Deng's lifetime, his record, ability, and charisma could not bring cohesiveness within the party. (During "June 4th," Deng's personal ability to bring cohesiveness was also in danger; he could maintain his authority only by relying on military force, and it was not until after his remarks during the visit to south China that his charisma and legitimacy revived). Once Deng dies, there will be no one having a record (Jiang became a party member only in 1947). Furthermore, once Jiang, who lacks ability and charisma, has lost the means to use ideology and the system, will he be able to harmonize and reconcile clashes within the party? Local Power Faction Too Cumbersome To Be Effective 2. The Local Power Faction Thanks to the delegation of legislative authority, authority over the assignment of people, and fiscal authority during the past decade, local governments' power and financial resources have increased greatly. It is on this foundation that local power factions that are too cumbersome to be effective have taken shape. In recent years, some local legislation has dared to defy central government legislation. When central government policies and directives reach local governments, they are either not implemented or their emphasis or flavor is changed. Zhu Rongji's macroeconomic regulation and control (the 16 articles), of June 1993 aimed at getting rid of "local princelings" policy making, but the abortion of this effort was announced after just three months, thereby showing that the central government is unable to impose cohesiveness in the face of local power factions opposition. Ever since institution of the system of dividing revenues and expenditures between the central government and local governments and holding each responsible for balancing its own budget in 1980, the central government's financial resources have fallen seriously. The state's percentage of fiscal revenues declined from 31.2 percent in 1978 to 14.7 percent in 1992. During the Seventh 5-Year Plan (1986-1990), the ratio between central government fiscal revenues and local government fiscal revenues declined further to 40:60. If unbudgeted funds are figured into fiscal revenues, the central government's fiscal revenues amount to only one-fifth of total revenues. In some western countries, coordination of the relationship between the central government and local governments depends largely on some effective institutions such as Congress or the Bundesrat. In China, the central government's main instruments for bringing local governments into line are fiscal authority and the authority to allocate resources. When the central government regularly has to beg from local governments to get by, one can imagine how much power it has to bring local governments into line. Another example that reflects the increase in strength of local power factions versus the central government is the increase in the number of local representatives in the Politburo: Before 1982, not a single one of the 12th Party Central Committee's 28 Politburo members and candidate members was a local cadre. In the 1987 13th Party Central Committee-created Politburo, four of the 18 members and candidate members were local representatives; and in the Politburo that the 14th Party Central Committee produced in 1992, six of the 22 members and candidate members were local representatives. In order to increase the central government' financial resources as a means of keeping local governments in line, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Party Central Committee decided to institute a tax division system beginning in 1994, the central feature of which was readjustment of the taxation structure. Customs duties, bank financing insurance taxes, and income taxes paid by post and telecommunications and railroad enterprises would be given to the central government, and income taxes from ordinary enterprises would be given to local governments. At the same time, the Bureau of Taxation would be divided into a central government bureau and a local government bureau, each of them collecting its own kinds of taxes. This measure was designed to ensure the central government's fiscal revenues. Had it been possible to institute these measures, they would truly have increased the central government's authority; however, the central government's existing authority had to be relied on to put these measures into effect. This gave rise to a contrary theory. Reportedly, a report from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences warned the Central Committee: Institution of a tax division system in China in 1994 would produce social instability. The Armed Forces Are Absolutely Not Willing Suppressors 3. Civil Rights Forces and Ethnic Separatist Forces In order to enforce cohesiveness, a political system has to be able to incorporate newly emerging social forces and political groups into its own system as they appear. This means that institutionalized channels for participation must be set up. In modern political science terms, this denotes institutional expansion and development of the ruling party's power. However, the Chinese Communists promote a self-contradictory policy. During the past 10 years, they have steadily promoted a splitting up of the social and political structure (a structural split is bound to create a pluralization of social interests and a pluralization of social groups); however, they have refused and restricted the demands for government participation of the newly emerging social and political forces that splitting of the structure generates. A steadily increasing participation crisis has been the result. Moreover, when a participation crisis occurs, the CPC not only does not readjust its own policies but uses force to repress it. Thus, not only are the contradictions not resolved, but they steadily intensify and accumulate. Chinese Communist political thinking has always maintained that the urban society and that society's representatives -- the civil rights forces -- brought about by the split are antagonistic forces (when actually this is not necessarily so; the civil rights organization could play a role within the system of a loyal opposition), and that the spontaneous participation of civil rights groups is "causing trouble." The Chinese Communists also believe that dialogue and other forms of equality are something that the civil rights forces may not enjoy. They can only use force to wipe out the civil rights movement. However, the fact is that force has not been able to wipe out the civil rights movement. During the past 10 years the civil rights movement has developed and grown stronger. It became so strong that the Chinese Communists had to use conventional forces and tanks to deal with it. However, history has shown that armed forces positively are not a willing suppressor. Deng is the only person who can use the armed forces against their own will. Once Deng is gone, should another civil rights movement storm arise, will Jiang Zemin, in his capacity as chairman of the Central Military Affairs Committee, be able to for the armed forces to aim their muzzles on the public? Might not the armed forces split when faced with such an order? Chinese Communist Organizational System Lax and Disintegrating 4. All Kinds of Mass Organizations and Social Forces Aside from the methods cited above for enforcing social cohesiveness, namely charismatic leaders, Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Though ideology, and force, the Chinese Communists must rely largely on strict party organization and a pervasive organizational system from top to bottom. In the rural villages, this is communes; in cities, it is "units." Some people believe that China has no society, just "units." This is because society is within "units." Every commune and "unit" is a small society. This analysis makes very good sense. Since communes and "units" perform social security and social supervision functions, they play a role in social cohesiveness. However, following reform and opening to the outside world, the separation of government administration and social management, and the separation of government administration and enterprise management has enabled society to begin to separate from the state. Development of a market economy will further accelerate this trend; thus, society will develop in the direction of a pluralization of interests, and a pluralization of blocs. Simultaneous with the trend toward disintegration of the communes and "units" that formerly enforced social cohesiveness, new social organizations able to take over the communes' and "units'" cohesiveness functions, namely mass organizations, will be in a state of either no healthy development or atrophy (like after "June 4th"] owing to strict Chinese Communist restrictions (the need to have approval from and be controlled by a higher level administrative authority and a civil government department). Thus, full and correct expression and coordination of social interests will be difficult. The weakness of social self-rule and the ability of self-rule organizations, as well as the current increase in the crime rate and the chaotic state of social order foreshadow future social unrest. Ordinary People's Income and Prices Cause Popular Revolt 3. Economic Situation The third major variable determining China's political future is the state of the economy when Deng dies. How well the economy does is not only the foundation for the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist's role, but also directly affects the degree of cohesiveness within the system, and the intensity of social contradictions and social conflicts. Many political crises stem from economic crisis. One need look no farther for examples than the 1988 collapse of the effort to battle down prices, which led to major central government personnel and policy readjustments, and the campus unrest of 1989. The Chinese Communist's reason for doling out huge amounts of money since 1989 to subsidize the losses of state-owned enterprises in violation of market laws is fear of an economic decline (depression) that might bring about civil unrest. When we regard the economic system as a variable affecting China's political future, our focus is mostly on superficial factors such as income and prices that can cause public anguish and a sense of frustration, and only secondarily on policy issues such as the speed, or the regulation and control of development and reform that can cause splits within the party. 2. Eight Political Situation Prospects After Deng Eight models can be derived by grouping the foregoing three variables that will determine government in China after Deng. These eight models show eight possible scenarios for the Chinese political situation after Deng dies. (See table). However, they are all only starting points for changes in ;the Chinese government after Deng; they are not the final results. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Outlook for the Chinese Political Situation | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Degree | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |The three variables that |Strong |Weak | |will determine China's p-| | | |olitical prospects after | | | |Deng | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Degree of cohesiveness w-|1 |4 | |ithin the system, and sy-| | | |stem cohesiveness possib-| | | |ilities | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Social-political contrad-|2 |5 | |ictions | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Economic situationx |3 |6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ideal Political, Economic, and Social Outlook, After Deng The key variable among the three variables affecting the future is the degree of cohesiveness among the top echelons of the CPC. If the CPC dares to carry out political reform, China's outlook will be extremely optimistic. Model 1 (1+3+5): Stable Model Sustained and consistent growth of the industrial and agricultural economy, with more rational readjustments of the industrial structure accompanying economic growth; more pervasive reform of the economic system; establishment of a market system; formation within the CPC of a mainstream faction in which Jiang Zemin is the nucleus, and whose authority is stable, with Jiang continuing Deng's line of reform and opening to the outside world, and receiving major support from within the party. Despite clashes between left and right wing factions, the general welfare is not impaired; the armed forces are stable, and they continue to play a role in backstopping reform and opening to the outside world. Smooth implementation of the tax division system increases the cohesiveness of the central government, and localism is curbed. Despite the existence and frequent occurrence of socio-political contradictions, and although they produce large scale social tumult, they pose no threat to Chinese Communist rule. Agriculture's increased output and the increased income it provides, a rise in prices paid the peasants for grain and cotton, and payment of money [rather than IOUs] for grain purchases permits the peasants to maintain their income at the level of previous years or increase it. The development of township and town enterprises absorbs large amounts of surplus agricultural manpower, thereby reducing pressures on the cities from drifters. Growth of industry and price stability or a rise in the income of urbanites that excess the degree of rise in prices calms urban sentiment. Crackdowns on graft and corruption promote social justice, thereby increasing the legitimacy of the regime. All these events play a role in stabilizing society. Although a small number of civil rights groups and civil rights movement people constantly call for the release of political prisoners in order to redress "June 4th" and quicken political reform, not only is this difficult to do on a very large scale while the CPC is in process of changing from force to a policy of limited opening up, but it might lead to the development of an opposition faction within the system. All the foregoing is an ideal social, economic, and political scenario after Deng passes away. However, realization of this scenario will depend, first of all, on how many more years Deng lives so that his authority may be relied upon for completion of the building of a market economy to enable Jiang Zemin to fashion a mainstream faction, and to be able to bring the armed forces and local governments in line. Second, it depends on Jiang Zemin's policy innovations such as continuing reform and opening to the outside world, not yielding to or compromising with the leftists, cracking down severely on graft and corruption, accepting modern political concepts, gradually opening the way for democracy, and bringing opposition factions outside the system into the system as an opposition faction. Third, it depends on the favor of heaven to bring in continuous bumper harvests. Since these objective conditions are not likely to be in being at the same time, the prospects for model 1 are not great. A Transition to Stability or Turmoil Model 2 (1+2+3): Model for a Transition to Turmoil. Jiang Zemin's mainstream has taken shape and his power has been consolidated. Within the party, a strong consensus exists, the degree of cohesiveness is high, and the CPC's cohesiveness with local governments, the central government, and society is very strong. The good economic situation has further enhanced the legitimacy of the CPC regime, and it has improved unity within the party and within the armed forces, and between the CPC and local governments. Despite severe social contradictions and CPC clashes with forces outside the systems, these are of short duration. Unrest is quelled very quickly. The civil rights movement is either suppressed or brought within the system. Model 3. (3+4+5): Model for A Transition to Turmoil. Economic growth continues; the people's livelihood is relatively stable; and contradictions between society and government are not severe. However, Jiang Zemin's mainstream faction and the cohesiveness of all factions in the party could not be achieved while Deng was alive. Jiang's authority fails of recognition. Temporary stability cannot last for long. Clashes may erupt at any time among factions within the party, between the central government and local governments, and between the CPC and forces outside the system. Model 3 is a short-lived transitional stage. Model 4 (1+5+6): Model for a Transition to Stability. A mainstream faction has taken shape within the party; Jiang Zemin's authority has been consolidated. Cohesiveness within the party is fairly high, and the system is quite cohesive. Although conflicts between society and the government occur at times, they pose no threat to the system. Despite some problems in the economy, the CPC and the government have the will and the time to solve them to realize the model 1 scenario. This situation does not rule out two other possibilities, namely a worsening of the economic situation as a result of policy mistakes, social turmoil occurring as a result, or intensification of political contradictions with forces outside the system, the country ending up with the model 5 scenario. If economic factors and socio-political contradictions cause further clashes within the party, the CPC will lose its existing cohesiveness advantage. The state will sink into a tumultuous model 7 scenario to face a revolutionary situation. Benign or Malignant Revolution Model 5 (1+2+6): Clash and Confrontation Model A mainstream faction has taken shape in the party; Jiang Zemin's authority has been consolidated; cohesiveness within the party is high; and cohesiveness with forces outside the system is also fairly strong. The economy has regressed; agriculture has atrophied; industrial concerns are operating under capacity creating an increase in the number of drifters and the unemployed; income has decreased; there is inflation and prices have soared; and the renminbi has been devalued provoking cries of discontent all around. Collapse of the stock market causes stock market turmoil. Popular revolts break out; and the civil rights movement surges. The CPC and its system face a strong challenge from social and civil rights forces. This confrontation may last for a fairly long time, and may lead to a split within the party. Two outcomes are possible: Either the party's reform faction seizes control and reaches an agreement with the civil rights movement, China thereby taking a political reform road, or the party's conservative faction comes to power and uses force to put down the civil rights movement and uprisings, China regressing to a sealed off and conservative state. No matter which occurs, the attitude of the armed forces will be decisive. Model 6 (2+3+4): Benign Revolution Model The economy continues to grow with no large scale outbreaks or reckless and destructive uprisings. Within the party, cohesiveness is low, and the system's ability to bring cohesiveness is poor. Factional fights and power struggles within the party are intense. Local "princelings" have much strength; and graft and corruption are serious. The public makes a huge outcry as centrifugal forces in the party grow. At the same time, another surge occurs in the civil rights movement, which is becoming organized and cohesive. This scenario is a benign revolution scenario whose most likely outcome is a link up between the reform faction within the party and the civil rights forces to bring down the conservatives and gain power to put China on a democratic reform path. Model 7 (2+4+6) A revolutionary model (in which the outlook, whether benign or malignant, is uncertain) Both cohesiveness within the system and the system's ability to bring cohesion are very weak. Contradictions between society and government are very grave. This turn of events is strengthened by deterioration of the economy. Consequently, China faces a revolutionary situation. The key element at this time is the degree of organization of the reform forces (the reform faction within the party and the civil rights forces). Whether the revolution will be benign or malignant will depend on this. Model 8 (4+5+6) A revolutionary transitional model. In this scenario, both the government and society are very weak. Factions within the party overlap and fight for power. Local "princelings" are very strong; "independent kingdoms" exist. The economy is in depression. Clashes between society and the government are quiescent, but this scenario cannot last for long, because deterioration of the economy is bound to intensify social conflicts. Splits within the party also provide development opportunities for the civil rights movement, the prospects for which may be those given in model 7. The Key Lies in the Cohesiveness of the CPC Upper Echelon The foregoing eight models show that the key variable of the three major variables affecting China's future political outlook is the degree of cohesiveness of the upper echelon of the CPC. To a very large extent, the extent to which other conflicts may intensify and produce a crisis depends on whether a compromise may be reached among the contending factions within the CPC to produce a consensus and produce cohesion. If clashes do not intensify between the ultra-leftist faction and the reform faction within the party, and if the upper echelon of the CPC does not split, the local "princelings" will find it difficult to grow in power, and ethnic separatism will not succeed. In that case, even if an economic crisis occurs, it can be handled; and should uprisings occur, they can be very quickly quelled. Everyone remembers that the Democracy Wall movement of 1979 developed out of a crevice in the struggle between the reform faction and the whatever faction. The campus unrest of 1989 also developed into a nationwide democratic movement against a background of struggle between Zhao Ziyang and Li Peng. If the CPC mainstream faction can produce policy innovations at the same time that a high degree of cohesiveness exists within the system, not only will there be economic development in the midst of stability but political system reforms can also be ventured while controlling the situation. Thus, party factions can operate within the law; fights within the party can play out within the rules, the armed forces can become nationalized, and the government structure can be federalized. Thus, the NPC and the CPPCC will be able to play a greater role in supervising the government and political life, establishing a senate-like structure to coordinate the interests of the central government and local governments, and the interests of one local government and another. Then, prohibitions on speech, the press, and party can be gradually removed, and non-violent civil rights movements can be brought within the system. In this way, organic cohesiveness founded on modern principles can be attained. At that time, China's prospects will be extremely optimistic.
