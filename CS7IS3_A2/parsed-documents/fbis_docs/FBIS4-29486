The company, the authorised representative for the purchase of Thai rice for Iraq, had struck a deal for annual interest payments. It says the contract will be guaranteed by the Iraqi central bank, which will open a letter of credit to ensure payment. Further negotiations between the bank and the buying representative are set for today. According to the deputy managing director of Ex-Im Bank, Somphan Iamrungrot, the company has proposed a two-year extension of interest payments, but the condition could not be accepted because of the risks of the transaction. It could not be sure when the United Nations would release Iraqi assets. Mr Somphan learned that Iraq's Bank of International Settlements (BIS) has only US$100 million in hand, which may not be enough for the rice payment. Iraq is set to buy about 500,000 tons of 10 percent and 15 percent white rice worth about five billion baht from Thailand this year through Chaiyaphon Rice. The Ex-Im Bank has been asked by Commerce Ministry to finance local exporters on the deal. Phaibun Khuansongtham, the managing director of Chaiyaphon Rice Co, said he wondered why the bank has taken such a long time to examine the deal when Iraq's central bank has acknowledged payment. He was also informed that the assets will be released by the end of next month and that it is urgent that the Thai Government makes a decision, as the released assets may not be earmarked for the rice. The rice price will be quoted in line with market prices plus 15 percent interest, which Mr Phaibun says is a risk worth taking. Iraq still owes about 1.8 billion baht to Thai rice exporters, who sold about 200,000 tons of rice to Iraq before the Gulf War.
