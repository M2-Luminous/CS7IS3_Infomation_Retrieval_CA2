If not, it will be excluded from a major European defence programme -- dubbed Euroflag -- expected to secure 37,500 aerospace jobs and generate sales of $55 billion. The demand comes as Deutsche Aerospace, Aerospatiale of France, British Aerospace [BAe], Italy's Alenia and Spain's Casa [Dasa] prepare to challenge U.S. domination of the world market for military transport planes by building a European alternative. The so-called Future Large Aircraft is designed to meet the needs of the Western European Union [WEU] defence forces and enter into service by the year 2002. WEU air forces have total requirements for 300 Euroflag aircraft in the transport and tanker roles. Euroflag also hopes to win additional contracts for another 300 copies from non-European air forces. Despite early support for the Euroflag project, the British Government withdrew in 1989 and assumed "observer status" within the European partnership as its Ministry of Defence and Air Force considered a cheaper offer from Lockheed to refurbish its existing fleet of 61 U.S.-built Hercules C-130 transports and eventually to replace them with an upgraded C-130J variant. Other members of the consortium say that a British decision in favour of the Lockheed offer would be anti-European and give U.S. manufacturers continued domination of the European market. "Lockheed hopes to kill off the Euroflag," said a British Aerospace spokesman, "and continue to monopolise the military large aircraft market in Europe and worldwide." Britain's fleet of C-130s dates from the 1960's and is now suffering from "a number of corrosion, fatigue and age-related problems," according to a recent parliamentary defence committee document. BAe this week launched a campaign to persuade UK legislators that support for the $7 billion development phase of Euroflag is vital if Britain is to avoid repeating its disastrous decision in 1969 not to join the Airbus Industrie consortium at its inception. Although BAe subsequently sought membership, it has ended up as a minor player in Europe's most successful aerospace venture to date and forfeited billions of dollars in lost work as a consequence. The Euroflag consortium which also includes Belgium, Portugal and Turkey as associate members -- plans to develop a four-engined aircraft capable of transporting up to 25 tonnes of military hardware and personnel over ranges up to 3,700 kilometres. It will have 2.5 times the airlift capability of the U.S.-built Hercules C-130J and, says a Dasa spokesman, is designed for the rapid deployment of forces. Growing pressure from member governments to reduce the project's development and productions costs has prompted a recent decision to make the Euroflag a turboprop rather than a jet-powered aircraft. Euroflag plans to run the programme within the framework of Airbus Industrie "in a professional and commercial fashion," explained an industry insider. This will involve the creation of a special Airbus subsidiary and will be the first time it has been able to accommodate the Italian aerospace sector through the involvement of Alenia. Each of the partners will have a 20 percent stake and share of the work schedule. Through this structure, Euroflag hopes to allay fears in Germany and Britain that the programme will experience the usual budget over-runs associated with cost-plus defence contracts. According to a Dasa spokesman, Bonn does not expect to face the same level of opposition as that experienced over the Eurofighter which has been consistently attacked as a Cold War weapon system. French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur last week urged WEU governments to throw their weight behind the Euroflag programme. "I invite our main partners to develop this European aircraft with us," he said in a pointed reference to British vacillation. The project was, he said, "a bearer of hope for common European defence."
