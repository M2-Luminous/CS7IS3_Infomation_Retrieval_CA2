He said that Russia's joining the "Partnership" on the same terms as other partners is in the interest of Poland. "And it has happened that way. Russia has joined the programme within the framework of the same general document," Olechowski said. Earlier in the day, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev sidestepped the issues of Poland's bid for the membership of NATO. He told newsmen that Russia has excellent relations with Poland. So are my relations with my "good friend" Andrzej Olechowski, he said. Speaking at a news conference with NATO Deputy Secretary General Sergio Balanzino after the signing ceremony at the NATO headquarters in Brussels, Kozyrev was asked by Polish journalists whether Russia will be friendly towards Poland's NATO membership and whether it sets any conditions after it has signed a far-reaching cooperative relationship with NATO. He answered that the only condition of all actions is that they "fit into the building of a stable, united, democratic Europe from Vancouver to Vladivostok." He went on to say that "being equal members of Europe and equal partners of NATO, we have equal rights to speak out our mind with Poland."
