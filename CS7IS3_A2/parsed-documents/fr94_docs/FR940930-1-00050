FR940930-1-00050 FR940930-1-00016 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 49 CFR Part 571 [Docket No. 91&hyph;49; Notice 04] RIN [2127&hyph;AF43] Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards for Electric Vehicles AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Department of Transportation (DOT). ACTION: Request for Comments. SUMMARY: The purpose of this notice is to solicit public comments to help NHTSA assess the need to regulate electric vehicles (EVs) with respect to battery electrolyte spillage in a crash or rollover, and electric shock hazard in a crash or rollover and during repair or maintenance. Comments are requested on the potential safety hazards associated with each, and possible regulatory solutions, for original equipment EVs and EV conversions. DATES: Comments must be received by November 29, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments on the notice should refer to the docket number and notice number shown above, and be submitted in writing to: Docket Section, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Room 5109, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. Telephone: (202) 366&hyph;4949. Docket hours are 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Gary R. Woodford, NRM&hyph;01.01, Special Projects Staff, Office of Rulemaking, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590 (202&hyph;366&hyph;4931). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Introduction A sizeable increase in the number of alternatively fueled motor vehicles, including electric vehicles (EVs), in the United States is expected. This expectation stems from initiatives by the President, Congress, State and local governments, and private interests, since these vehicles could help reduce air pollution and conserve petroleum fuel. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 include provisions that promote the use of alternative fuels in motor vehicles. Under these Amendments, fleet vehicles sold in geographic areas with the most serious air pollution problems will be subject to emission standards that will require the use of clean fuels, including methanol and ethanol, reformulated gasoline, natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, and electric power. In addition, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT) requires Federal, State, and alternative fuel provider fleets to acquire increasing percentages of alternatively fueled vehicles. The Department of Energy is in the process of initiating a rulemaking, as required by EPACT, to determine if private fleets should also be required to purchase certain percentages of alternatively fueled vehicles as part of their new fleet acquisitions. Executive branch initiatives will also encourage the increased use of alternatively fueled vehicles. Executive Order 12844, dated April 21, 1993, directs that purchases of alternatively fueled vehicles by the Federal government by substantially increased beyond the levels required by current law. It also established the Federal Fleet Conversion Task Force to accelerate the commercialization and market acceptance of alternatively fueled vehicles throughout the country. A primary impetus for introduction of large numbers of EVs in the U.S. market is a regulation of the California Air Resources Board. Similar regulations are under consideration by other States. The California regulation requires that not less than two percent of a manufacturer's sales in the State (roughly 40,000 vehicles total) must be zero emission vehicles (ZEVs), beginning in model year 1998. This requirement will increase to 10 percent or roughly 200,000 vehicles beginning in model year 2003. The definition of a ZEV is a vehicle that emits no exhaust or evaporative emission of any kind. Currently, the EV is the only vehicle which meets these requirements. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is authorized by law (49 U.S.C. 30101&hyph;30169) to regulate the safety performance of motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment through the issuance of Federal motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSSs). In addition, NHTSA has the authority to issue guidelines for States to use in state motor vehicle inspection programs.
