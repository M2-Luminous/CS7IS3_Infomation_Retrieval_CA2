FR940913-0-00009 FR940913-0-00002 Emergency Action The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that an emergency exists that warrants publication of this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action is necessary because of the possibility that the gypsy moth could be spread artificially to noninfested areas of the United States, where it could cause economic loss due to defoliation of susceptible forest areas. Also, where gypsy moth no longer occurs, immediate action is needed to delete unnecessary restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated articles. Because prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this action are impracticable and contrary to the public interest under these conditions, we find good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effective upon publication in the Federal Register . We will consider comments that are received within 60 days of publication of this rule in the Federal Register . After the comment period closes, we will publish another document in the Federal Register . It will include a discussion of any comments we receive and any amendments we are making to the rule as a result of the comments. Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act This interim rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866. This action affects the interstate movement of regulated articles and outdoor household articles from and through gypsy moth regulated areas in Ohio and Virginia. There are several types of restrictions that will apply to the newly-listed areas in these States. These restrictions will have their primary impact on persons moving households, nursery stock, logs and wood chips, and mobile homes out of a generally infested area. Individual and commercial movers moving outdoor household articles (OHA) to areas outside the generally infested area must attach to the articles either a certificate issued by an inspector, or an OHA document issued by the owner of the articles. Most individual homeowners moving their own articles who comply with the regulations choose to self-inspect and issue an OHA document. This takes a few minutes and involves no monetary cost. Individuals may also have State certified pesticide applicators, trained by the State or USDA, inspect and issue certificates. Persons moving regulated articles from a generally infested area (significant examples include logs, pulpwood and wood chips; mobile homes; and nursery stock) must obtain a certificate or limited permit to move the articles. There is one exception to this requirement, for logs, pulpwood and wood chips. This exception allows the person moving such articles to self-certify on the waybill that he or she has inspected the articles. This exception minimizes costs with regard to logs, pulpwood, and wood chips. Persons moving mobile homes and nursery stock must obtain a certificate or limited permit. They may obtain one from an inspector, or a qualified certified applicator. Inspectors will issue these documents at no charge, but costs may result from delaying the movement of commercial articles while waiting for the inspection. Documents self-issued under a compliance agreement avoid this delay costs, but result in costs associated with salary and recordkeeping for the self-inspections.
