What happened with the speech by Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus? In Colombia, we are interested in learning the reaction. What happened? [Alarcon] We are reporters, not diplomats; so we have to say the speech by the Nicaraguan foreign minister was rude. [Reporter] Nicaraguan or Costa Rican? [Alarcon] Pardon me, Costa Rican. [Reporter] Niehaus. [Alarcon] Mr. Niehaus. Pardon me. [Reporter] That is fine. [Alarcon] The speech was rude and arrogant. It was prompted, perhaps, by the agony of defeat. He called those countries colonies of an imperialist, namely, the United States. He said the best thing would be for the United States to handpick the new OAS secretary general. He withdrew irately from the hall, where the session continues. The Argentine foreign minister spoke next to ask the assembly not to pay attention to the Costa Rican foreign minister's remarks, which were uttered in the agony of defeat. Those in attendance took that advice more seriously than Niehaus' statements. The assembly continues. We will enter the assembly to be close to Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin, to carry her first reaction, given the fact she handled this campaign. She was truly the architect of the campaign of Cesar Gaviria Trujillo, who was elected the new OAS secretary general this morning.
