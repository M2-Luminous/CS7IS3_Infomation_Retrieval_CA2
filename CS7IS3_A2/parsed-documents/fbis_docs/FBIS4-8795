Several civilians were wounded and fresh material damage was caused. [passage omitted] [Karakic] [video shows damaged houses and Croat soldiers with weapons] All this shows that the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina is not over. Senior officials of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna stressed this today at a ceremony of oath-taking by the First Guards' Brigade of the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] in Capljina, southern Bosnia. [Bender] Since you know very well what is going on in Gorazde, in Posavina in northern Bosnia, and our Usora, we must keep that in mind at all times. You are the people who will stand with us on the bulwark of our homeland, and we must always think of those who have given all they had, who have given their lives. [Soljic] We will fight for the Croats to have the right to decide for themselves on their future. If we create a joint army, that army will be formed so that one nation can never use it against the other, as it happened with the so-called Yugoslav People's Army. There is a lot of talk about the end of the war and demobilization. Unfortunately, an end to the war is not in sight yet, and therefore, we cannot speak about a large-scale demobilization. We will use the cease-fire to consolidate (?our forces) and divide the burden of the war more equally. [Roso] You have heard enough wise words and phrases. There is one eternal truth: The war will never be over for us. I will repeat it once again if someone does not understand Croatian well: The war is not over. This much about the future. Personally, I congratulate you today. I will place one thing upon your conscience. Bow only before the memory of this oath and before our dead. Do not entrust Croat weapons into anyone's hands. Thank you very much. [Karakic] The oath-taking ceremony in Capljina was attended by many guests from the military and political ranks of Herzeg-Bosna, and by relatives of the Croat patriot Ante Bruno Busic after whom the HVO's First Guards' Brigade has been named.
