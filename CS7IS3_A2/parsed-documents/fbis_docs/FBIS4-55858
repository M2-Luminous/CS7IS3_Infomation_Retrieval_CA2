At a meeting with the president 20 May, representatives of the Macedonian Transport and Defense Ministries agreed that two out of three airstrips will be used for civilian purposes -- one for passenger and the other for cargo air traffic. After the departure of the JNA [Yugoslav People's Army], the Petrovec air base was mostly taken over by the army of the recently formed state. This impeded development of civilian air traffic, while the military section of the airport was insufficiently exploited. Modernization plans have been announced for next year, primarily the reconstruction of the runway and signaling system.
