FBIS4-8986 "dreeu076_p_94012" FBIS-EEU-94-076 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 POLAND Voivodship `Investment Risk' Map Listing Voivodship `Investment Risk' Map Listing 94P20635A 94P20635A CSO [Editorial Report] GAZETA PRZEMYSLOWA I HANDLOWA, a Warsaw-based "weekly for entrepreneurs and employers," published a lengthy article in its 15-21 March edition, detailing the contents of a report by the Gdansk Research Institute on Market Economy (IBnGR) that provides a "map" of investment risks in Poland, intended for both Polish and foreign investors. The report provides a ranking of voivodships in terms of investment risks, with Class A status referring to voivodships that offer the greatest attractiveness to investors, Class B to high attractiveness, Class C to average attractiveness, Class D to low attractiveness, and Class E to very low attractiveness. These categorizations were based on local market potential, labor market, industrial base, business-friendly environment, environmental quality, tourist potential, and commercial and transportation infrastructure. According to the article, research results "clearly show a division into Poland A and Poland B," with voivodships in eastern Poland and in urban areas in central Poland generally proving to have "the least attractive investment climate." The Suwalki, Lomza, and Elblag voivodships in northern Poland were found to have the least environmental degradation, while the worst environmental quality was found in the heavily industrialized areas of both Upper and Lower Silesia as well as in other centers where heavy industry is concentrated. The report traced the wide disparities in infrastructure and environmental quality to the uneven regional development policies of the communist era. "For many years, regional authorities were incapacitated," stated the report, and financial resources reached the regions only through the central budget, with priorities often dictated by political reasons instead of by economic requirements. The result has been "huge disproportions in Poland's regional development." The areas showing the least investment risk, those with Class A status, are the capital city voivodship of Warsaw, followed by Katowice, Gdansk, and Poznan. These are cities with a "certain renown, a large industrial base, and a marked diversity of market potential." These voivodships are generally known outside of Poland and possess a certain "magnetism" in terms of attracting investments, demonstrated by the fact that most of the joint-venture companies currently operating in Poland are located in them. According to the report, chances for developing "weaker regions" of Poland rest to a large degree with the regional authorities, which are "responsible for creating conditions conducive to investment." In addition, border regions may benefit from the increased opening up of the borders. Highway construction and privatization should also contribute to the promotion and development of certain regions. The IBnGR researchers also note that the flow of investments can also contribute to eliminating the differences in development between regions. In addition to the Class A voivodships listed above, the remaining Class B through Class E voivodships are given below, in order of investment risk: Class B--Wroclaw, Krakow, Szczecin, Lodz. Class C--Bydgoszcz, Olsztyn, Koszalin, Bielsko-Biala, Slupsk, Leszno, Lublin. Class D--Rzeszow, Opole, Elblag, Walbrzych, Kalisz, Bialystok, Kielce, Gorzow, Zielona Gora, Suwalki, Torun, Legnica, Jelenia Gora, Lomza, Konin, Krosno, Nowy Sacz, Plock, Czestochowa, Ciechanow, Siedlce, Chelm, Tarnobrzeg, Skierniewice. Class E--Radom, Piotrkow, Biala Podlaska, Zamosc, Sieradz, Przemysl, Tarnow, Ostroleka, Wloclawek.
