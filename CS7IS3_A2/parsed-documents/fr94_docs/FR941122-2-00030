Take notice that on November 10, 1994, National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation (National) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, proposed Substitute Second Revised Sheet No. 216; Substitute First Revised Sheet No. 216A; Substitute Original Sheet No. 216B; and Original Sheet No. 216C. National states that these tariff sheets are filed in an effort to address the concerns of its customers raised at the October 4, 1994, technical conference in this proceeding, and are related to the flowthrough of upstream pipeline take-or-pay (TOP) costs charged to National by its former upstream pipeline suppliers. In this regard, National states that it is (1) clarifying tariff language addressing refunds, (2) proposing additional tariff language to clarify Additional Adjustments made under Section 20.2(f) of the General Terms and Conditions (GT&C) of its tariff, and (3) proposing GT&C subsection 20.2(g) to provide for a true up filing to be made subsequent to the final billing in each upstream pipeline's TOP proceeding. National proposes an effective date of July 29, 1994, to coincide with the effective date of its other tariff sheets addressing the flowthrough of TOP charges. Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC, 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211. All such protests should be filed on or before November 23, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Linwood A. Watson, Jr., Acting Secretary.
