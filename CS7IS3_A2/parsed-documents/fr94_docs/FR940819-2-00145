FR940819-2-00145 FR940819-2-00083 Financially constrained plans and TIPS_The regulations require that MPOs have in place a process that produces current metropolitan plans and TIPs that are financially feasible. Plans must demonstrate the consistency of proposals with known and reasonably expected sources of revenue for transportation uses. The TIP must be financially constrained and include a plan that demonstrates how it can be implemented without detriment to operation and maintenance of the existing transportation system, and only projects for which funds can reasonably be expected to be available may be programmed. The metropolitan TIP is incorporated into the financially constrained State TIP which is jointly approved by FHWA and FTA. In nonattainment and maintenance areas, funds for projects in the first two years of a TIP must be available or committed.
