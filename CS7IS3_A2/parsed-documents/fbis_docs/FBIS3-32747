What is your position on the Council of State decision regarding the conduct of President Gaviria and the presence of U.S. troops in our country? Good morning, Dr. Humberto de la Calle. [De la Calle] Good morning, Dario. I am pleased to greet you. [Arizmendi] The same here, sir. [De la Calle] I can tell you the following: I criticized the little school episode because it was poorly handled. I believe that what the country deserved was to be told the whole truth right away, however I also want to tell you that I do not agree with the decision Council of State decision because I do not believe the Constitution has been violated. I share the belief that an international treaty is being applied here. We are not talking about a wartime situation or the presence of foreign troops here but of joint maneuvers aimed at improving Colombia's response capabilities in the area of security and the fight against crime. I believe there is a precedent. All Latin American countries conduct these type of joint exercises. Colombia has been holding them for the past 30 or 40 years. I believe the Council of State decision endangers all possible military cooperation in matters of security and the fight against drug trafficking. Among other things, we not only receive military support, but also judicial support. This excess of nationalism only benefits criminals, drug traffickers, and the guerrillas. I do not share the positions of the Council of State. [Arizmendi] Dr. Humberto de la Calle Lombana, do you believe this decision made by the Council of State can seriously endanger the candidacy of President Cesar Gaviria for the post of OAS secretary general. [De la Calle] I frankly hope the congress, which will review his conduct, will bear in mind what we have pointed out with the interpretation, which I believe is the correct one. I hope it will clear up this incident, which is naturally disturbing for the president and for Colombia.
