In his statement, Juppe declared that Turkey is an important country, which is gaining weight and strength throughout the world. The free trade union to be effected between Turkey and the 12 European countries in 1995 demonstrates its economic importance.

Pointing out that Turkey constitutes a factor of stability in the region, the French minister remarked that a solution is imminent concerning the problem in former Yugoslavia. In reply to a question, Juppe explained that France is loyal to Turkey's unity and integrity and opposes all acts of terrorism, regardless of their origin.
