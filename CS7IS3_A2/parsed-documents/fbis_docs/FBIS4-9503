In reply to our question, Peter Zwack, chairman of the Liberal Civic Alliance-Entrepreneurs' Party [LPSZ-VP], said that they would like as many entrepreneurs as possible to get into parliament because it is impossible to base a successful economic policy on ideologies. [Zwack] We want to represent the interests of small and medium sized enterprises. Initially, our organization was called Entrepreneurs' Party and we later added the name Liberal Civic Alliance to this. This expresses our intention also to open toward the intellectual entrepreneurs, namely lawyers, doctors, and so on. At the moment, Hungary does not have a strong middle class, therefore, the LPSZ-VP mainly deals with economic issues. This party is something unique to Hungary, we could call ourselves the party of economic conscience. We intend to help as many entrepreneurs as possible into Parliament. We would be happy to end our operation in eight to 12 years' time if the economic processes get to a level where our party is no longer needed. We find it unfortunate that the current coalition was organized on an ideological basis and the professional viewpoints were pushed into the background. The Christian and popular-national way of thinking is respectable but an economic policy cannot be based on this. In our view, the serious economic crisis is partly due to the fact that the government did not have a clear economic policy that could have been followed. Under such circumstances, it is impossible to create enterprises. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] The LPSZ-VP is part of the four-party liberal cooperation. In view of the various polemic statements, how stable do you think the liberal bloc is? [Zwack] The alliance is more stable than the media often allows people to believe, although arguments certainly do exist between the leaders of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] and the Federation of Young Democrats [FIDESZ]. Prime Minister Peter Boross is applying clever tactics when he says that a contest of the left wing and the coalition can be expected at the elections. In contrast to this, the experience of setting up the candidates shows that the liberal bloc is so strong that even if it does not reach 50 percent, it will be able to choose its coalition partners. As a matter of fact, in my view, a responsible prime minister cannot state that the country will not have a stable government unless the current coalition wins. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] What are your views on your party's election chances, with special reference to the fact that, according to the surveys, the LPSZ-VP's current support does not reach the 5 percent necessary to get into Parliament? [Zwack] It is unfortunate that we did not manage to set up a list in Budapest in the end. At the same time, we put up 69 individual candidates and we have regional lists in 14 counties. We are doing all we can to get into Parliament, but even if we do not succeed in this, our party will play a more important role in the future than now. Our link with the entrepreneurs may upgrade our role, among our allies are those liberal parties that we hope will be determining forces in the next government. We will suggest the establishment of an economic top ministry, an advisory body for the future prime minister, which will consist of small and medium entrepreneurs, and the introduction of a two-chamber parliamentary system. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] If the parties of the liberal bloc do not reach 50 percent, you will have to think about the potential coalition partners. It is obvious that two alternatives exist: the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] or the current coalition parties. Has the LPSZ-VP formed its stance on this? [Zwack] Not yet, and this issue was not discussed at the latest meeting of the four liberal parties, either. We will be able to decide with whom to form a coalition when the election results are known. We agreed that we will do all we can for the best possible election performance of the liberal bloc and that we will begin coordination talks on the future government program. We can be certain about one thing: The better our results are at the elections, the fewer compromises we will have to accept when the coalition is formed.
