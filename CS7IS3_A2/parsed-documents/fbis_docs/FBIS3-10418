Marc Bazin's party considers this document to be based on a sound analysis of the crisis and thinks it offers a satisfying framework for a negotiated and peaceful settlement. MIDH president Bazin asserts that the legislators' approach meets his party's objectives: [Begin Bazin recording] MIDH fully supports this plan because -- as has always been known -- MIDH considers that in the current state of the country's sociopolitical conditions, the transition toward democracy can succeed only if it rests on a political compromise acceptable to all, based on reciprocal guarantees, without radical breakups, and without motives of revenge. It is the only formula that will bring all true democrats -- realists from the Left, reformers from the Right -- to the common task of remodeling a state in which responsible people would have no interest in seeing even more destruction. [end recording] MIDH, which has always favored a compromise, invites the key sectors in the crisis to work toward the success of the legislators' plan. [Begin Bazin recording] That is the reason we are inviting all sincere patriots, especially the two concerned parties, in good faith and without any holdouts. To ask the Haitian people today to accept additional sacrifices can no longer honestly be justified. It is therefore urgent simultaneously to fill the political vacuum and to satisfy the conditions for an immediate suspension of the economic sanctions. Those are, in our opinion, the first inevitable steps toward the normalization of public life and the beginning of emerging from the tunnel. [end recording]
