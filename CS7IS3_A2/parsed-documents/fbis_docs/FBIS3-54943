Sokovnin: "Main Guideline"] [Text] Russia 1994. The Strategy of Security. A special report by scientific center leaders and experts on this vitally important topic has been published in a special issue of the RAU-corporation's information and analytical weekly OBOZREVATEL. This report will be issued to all State Duma and Federation Council deputies since it is intended primarily for people who make political decisions or take part in their preparation. The new Federal Assembly has to begin work at a dramatic and crucial period in Russia's history. The country's fate in forthcoming years will depend largely on the present-day decisions of the legislative and executive organs of power. Will the present crisis be overcome or not -- that is the question. Suffice it to say that the year of 1992 went down in Russia's history with an extremely alarming outcome. For the first time in peace time the death rate exceeded the birth rate. Over the first nine months of 1993 the situation deteriorated still further -- the death rate exceeded the birth rate by 0.5 million. That means that there is a real threat to the existence and survival of the nation itself. Today we must assess soberly and without prejudice the situation in which the country has found itself and ascertain the reasons which have led to such a tragic development of events. The authors of the report believe that it is essential to renounce an excessively ideological assessment of events and the traditional habit of forcing these assessments to fit the short-term goals and aims of particular political parties. Before it is too late the interests of the people and the country as a whole must be put foremost -- not verbally, as has been the case before, but in practical actions. The main principle of state policy in our day is less ideology, and more science, pragmatism, and national consensus. Otherwise, with the present split, it is impossible to elaborate a correct and effective policy for effecting transformations to society and the economy. This approach is especially important in ensuring the Russian state's security. Above all, the report's authors believe, we must clearly determine Russian national interests and the priorities which accord both with the interests of individual citizens and of society as a whole and among these put foremost those on which the existence of the state itself depends. On this basis scientists propose to elaborate a program of reforms in the interests of all society as a whole, and not of individual strata of society. A program which is of a national nature, a realistic, pragmatic program free of any form of dominant ideology -- that is what our country is in extreme need of today. The authors of the analytical report about Russia's future rightly emphasize that the Fatherland's citizens have the right to know and are even obliged to know the nature of the latest "bright horizons" which are being offered to them, the way in which reforms will be conducted, and how much time they will take. Citizens have the right not only to question but also to completely disagree with a proposed program and ultimately to demand a report on the government's activity. As the recent elections showed, the country needs a government which can find a way out of the crisis. All democratic forces interested in Russia's conservation and prosperity are called on to unite on this government's nationwide platform. For this scientists propose not so much an economic as a comprehensive program of actions. Russia's national security strategy in 1994 should include, first, the renunciation of the extremes of the political struggle and the consolidation of legality and law and order, second, a fruitful struggle for Russia's economic, financial, and political independence, third, a series of effective measures, not propaganda measures, to improve the living conditions of Russia's citizens and above all of the least protected of them -- pensioners, the sick, children, and the disabled -- and, fourth, the resurrection of Russia's spiritual potential. The report offers a detailed analysis and a package of measures for all these avenues.
