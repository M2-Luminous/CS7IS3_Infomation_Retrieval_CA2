FR940106-0-00120 FR940106-0-00022 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In General The Trade Act of 1974 made major changes to the trade adjustment assistance program (hereafter ``TAA program'') for workers displaced because of increased imports of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced by the workers' firm. On receiving a petition for trade adjustment assistance (hereafter ``TAA'') from a group of workers or its authorized representative, the Department conducts a factfinding investigation in response to the petition. If the findings substantiate that the workers of a firm or subdivision of a firm have been adversely affected by import competition, a certification is issued stating that the workers are eligible to apply at a local office of a State employment security agency for TAA benefits. The 1981 Amendments to the Trade Act of 1974 (Title XXV of Pub. L. 97&hyph;35) made extensive changes in the TAA program. Further changes were made in the 1984 Amendments (Sections 2671 and 2672, of Pub. L. 98&hyph;369) and in the 1986 Amendments (Part 1 of Subtitle A of Title XIII of Pub. L. 99&hyph;272). Final regulations implementing the 1986 Amendments were published in the Federal Register on August 24, 1988, at 53 FR 32344, and on May 23, 1989, at 54 FR 22277. The 1988 Amendments to the TAA program are contained in Part 3, Trade Adjustment Assistance, of subtitle D of title I of the ``Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988'' (Pub. L. 100&hyph;418) (hereafter the ``OTCA''). The 1988 Amendments expand eligibility for TAA to workers in the oil and natural gas industry engaged in exploration and drilling; require detailed information about TAA program benefits to be given to every individual who files an initial claim for unemployment benefits, and further require an individualized notice to every worker believed to be covered by a certification issued by the Department; require publication of a notice of the certification in a newspaper of general circulation; require a worker to participate in training as a condition for receiving basic trade readjustment allowances (hereafter ``TRA''); authorize the waiver of the training requirement for a worker when training is not feasible or appropriate; authorize the payment of basic and additional TRA to a worker during breaks in training that do not exceed 14 days; reinstate the movable eligibility period for basic TRA, based on the worker's most recent qualifying (total) separation rather than the first qualifying separation as was previously required; extend the expiration date of the TAA program to September 30, 1993; emphasize coordination with programs and services to dislocated workers provided under title III of the Job Training Partnership Act; and make other changes. While most of the provisions of Part 3 affecting the TAA program are in the form of amendments to Chapter 2 of Title II of the Trade Act of 1974, some provisions of Part 3 affecting workers do not amend existing law. Examples are the provision which permits workers in the oil and natural gas industry engaged in exploration or drilling, separated after September 30, 1985, to file petitions under new eligibility rules, and the provision concerning the eligibility of workers totally separated from adversely affected employment during the period beginning August 13, 1981, and ending April 7, 1986. The provisions of the 1988 Amendments became effective, in general, on August 23, 1988, except that the amendments to sections 231(a)(5), (b) and (c) took effect on November 21, 1988, and the amendment to Section 225 took effect on September 22, 1988. Because many of the 1988 Amendments were effective on the date of their enactment into law, August 23, 1988, most notably the new ``movable'' eligibility period for basic TRA, the Department issued interim Operating Instructions in General Administration Letter (hereafter ``GAL'') No. 7&hyph;88, dated September 12, 1988, which was published in the Federal Register on September 16, 1988, at 53 FR 36180&hyph;36213, together with Training and Employment Information Notice (hereafter ``TEIN'') 6&hyph;88. GAL 7&hyph;88 and the two changes thereto were subsequently rescinded and replaced by GAL 15&hyph;90, dated August 21, 1990. These GALs disseminated controlling guidance to the States on the administration of the TAA program as amended by the OTCA, pending the issuance of final amendments to the regulations. GAL 15&hyph;90 was published in the Federal Register on November 21, 1990, at 55 FR 48774&hyph;48800, together with TEIN 13&hyph;90. Following the issuance of GAL 7&hyph;88, amendments to the regulations at 20 CFR part 617, implementing the 1988 Amendments, were proposed in a document published in the Federal Register on November 30, 1988, at 53 FR 48474, with a comment period ending on December 30, 1988. Preparation of a final rule document, addressing the comments received, began after the end of the comment period. The need for other changes in the regulations was identified in light of the comments received, further reflection on the 1988 Amendments, and experience with the interim Operating Instructions. The most significant changes, resulting in the issuance of GAL 15&hyph;90 and in delaying the publication of this final rule document, were the changes in the interpretations of subsections (a) and (g) of Section 1430 of the OTCA, relating to the new ``movable'' eligibility period for basic TRA. This significant change, and other related changes, were announced in GAL 15&hyph;90. This final rule therefore includes substantive changes in the amendments to part 617 that were included in the proposed rule published on November 30, 1988. The most significant of these changes are the new interpretations of the effective dates of the 1988 Amendments relating to the ``movable'' eligibility period for basic trade readjustment allowances (§§617.3 and 617.11(a) (1) and (2)). This document also includes substantive changes to Part 617 that were not included in the published proposed rule, including sub-stantive changes that were announced in Changes 2 and 3 to GAL 15&hyph;90, relating to a complete revision of §617.26 and a change in §617.22(a). Many of these substantive changes resulted from a consideration of comments received on the proposed rule. Nonetheless, in the interests of keeping its rulemaking processes as open as possible, the Department is inviting public comments on these changes. Further changes are made in §§617.3, 617.11(a), 617.15(b) and (d), 617.16, 617.19(b), 617.21, 617.22(f), 617.33, 617.44, 617.50(d), 617.55, 617.60 and 617.64, which are related to the revision of §617.26 or for other reasons as explained below. Conforming changes are also made in §617.67.
