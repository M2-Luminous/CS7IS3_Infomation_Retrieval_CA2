Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin said, "The U.S. dollar has just started to slip; we need to monitor it further." He added, "If this is only a short-run development, there won't be much impact. But if it is a long-run problem, there might be a lot of ramifications. I have urged officials to closely monitor the development." Currency analysts said the fall of the U.S. dollar is not a surprise, but the depths it has reached are indeed low, because the U.S. and Japan have failed to settle their trade disputes. They said the jitters over the U.S.-Japan trade talks has been accentuated by repatriation of the yen by Japanese corporations, who are selling the dollar for yen on the belief that the economy back home is recovering. "If U.S. dollar is weakened over a long period of time, there will be significant impact on the baht. But there is an advantage: a large chunk of foreign debt is dominated in U.S. dollars, we might seek to refinance such loans," a ministry source said. "In our own fiscal position, we are ready for that. It is also the policy of Finance Minister Tharin who wants to seek early repayment of existing loans," the source said. The baht also appreciated sharply against the U.S. dollar, to the highest level in four months. The mid rate was fixed at Bt25.05 per dollar, while the Exchange Equalization Fund bought the dollar at lows of Bt24.95. The ministry source added that there had been high volatility in the U.S. financial market. "The U.S. authorities might not want the dollar to be too high. And it is expected that the Federal Reserve may not raise interest rates too high," the source said. Higher interest rates would make the dollar more attractive on international markets. "The Fed might not want to raise interest rates further because the U.S. economy has just recovered; and world economic growth has been at just 2.5 per cent," the source said. The benefits of early repayment of dollar denominated loans is not expected to be significant, as Thailand loans are equivalent to only five per cent of its exports, the source said. As there is more volatility in the foreign exchange market, the swap premium has risen by three per cent to nine per cent, according to a trader at Standard Chartered Bank. Importers are to pay higher forward rate. The forward rate for one month ahead is BtO.10 a dollar, for two months it is BtO.26 and for three months BtO.41. Exporters get a premium of BtO.09-BtO.10 a dollar for one month, BtO.24-BtO.26 for three months and BtO.42-BtO.44 for six months, the trader said. The recent weakening of the U.S. dollar has not created any sense of panic in the local market. Most participants are watching the markets in London and New York to see if the monetary authorities will step in and intervene. [passage omitted]
