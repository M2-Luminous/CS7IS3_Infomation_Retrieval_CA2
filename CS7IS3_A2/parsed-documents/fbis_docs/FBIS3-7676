We are pleased to note that the relations of friendship and multifaceted cooperation between our two countries, during the past period, have consistently strengthened and expanded. The exchange visits of high-level delegations of the two countries have contributed to significantly developing this relationship and strengthening mutual understanding and trust between the two countries. In recent years, there have been great and fundamental changes in the regional and world situations. The most outstanding feature is that nations wish to attain peace, stability, and security in order to develop further. The trend of regional cooperation is vigorously developing. We highly appraise the Philippine Government's efforts to support Vietnam becoming an ASEAN observer, to encourage it to participate in the regional cooperation mechanism, and to invite it to join ASEAN at an appropriate time. I am firmly convinced that the visit to Vietnam by the Philippine president will be crowned with success, thus opening up a new chapter in the relations of friendship and cooperation between our two nations for the interests of the two peoples and for peace, stability, cooperation, and prosperity in Southeast Asia and the world. President Le Duc Anh proposed a toast for the development of the relations of friendship and multifaceted cooperation between Vietnam and the Philippines, for the happiness and prosperity of the Vietnamese and Philippine peoples, for peace and progress in Southeast Asia, and for the good health of the Philippine President and the distinguished guests. In the reply speech, President Fidel Ramos sincerely thanked President Le Duc Anh for his kind words and hospitality extended to the Philippine delegation. President Fidel Ramos stressed that this is the first visit by a Philippine President to Vietnam. As a result, the visit is a significant event in the history of the two nations. He said: The purpose of my visit is to restore our relations, which were interposed by history. The president further said: The foundation of friendship between the two nations has been strengthened since the establishment of diplomatic relations after the reunification of Vietnam. Our relations were further consolidated when we reached agreements in 1978 and 1992 to respect each other's national dependence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. After asserting the Philippines' commitment to these agreements, President Fidel Ramos stressed: Manila was proud to host a forum two years ago at which Vietnam gained access to the Southeast Asia Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation and became an observer to ASEAN. On that occasion ASEAN approved the Manila Declaration on the Eastern Sea and Vietnam promptly welcomed the declaration. The Philippine president contends that the sooner Vietnam joins ASEAN the better for ASEAN and Southeast Asia. Dealing with the conflict in the Eastern Sea, the Philippine President said: We should not focus on suspicion among countries in the region but should concentrate on promoting cooperation to achieve mutual trust among countries concerned. After reviewing the similarities between the two countries and their common wish to expand bilateral relations in the economic, cultural, social, investment, and tourism domains, the Philippine President recalled that, in a famous message to the Philippine people, President Ho Chi Minh wrote: Only when the root is firm can the tree live longer. President Fidel Ramos expressed the wish to promote and strengthen the relations of friendship and cooperation between the two countries. The Philippine President proposed a toast for the happiness and prosperity of the Vietnamese people, for the development and long-lasting relations between the Philippines and Vietnam, and for the good health of President Le Duc Anh.
