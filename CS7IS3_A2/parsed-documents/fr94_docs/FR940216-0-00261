FR940216-0-00261 FR940216-0-00010 (g) Compliance calculations. (1) In the case of any refiner or importer subject to an individual refinery baseline, the annual average value for each parameter or emissions performance during the averaging period, calculated according to the following methodologies, shall be less than or equal to the refiner's or importer's standard under paragraph (b) of this section for that parameter. (i) Exhaust benzene emissions under the Simple Model for an averaging period are calculated as follows: EXHBEN=1.884+(0.949×BZ)+(0.113×(AR&hyph;BZ)) where EXHBEN=the average exhaust benzene emissions for the averaging period BZ=the average benzene content for the averaging period AR=the average aromatics content for the averaging period (ii) The average value for each parameter for an averaging period shall be calculated as follows: E:GRAPHICSER16FE94.023 where APARM=the average value for the parameter being evaluated V i =the volume of conventional gasoline and other products included under paragraph (d) of this section, in batch i PARM i =the value of the parameter being evaluated for batch i as determined in accordance with the test methods specified in §80.46 n=the number of batches of conventional gasoline and other products included under paragraph (d) of this section produced or imported during the averaging period SG i =specific gravity of batch i (only applicable for properties determined on a weight percent or ppm basis) (iii) Exhaust benzene emissions performance for each batch shall be calculated in accordance with the applicable model under §80.45. (iv) Exhaust toxics emissions performance for each batch shall be calculated in accordance with the applicable model under §80.45. (v) Exhaust NO X emissions performance for each batch shall be calculated in accordance with the applicable model under §80.45. (2) In the case of any refiner or importer subject to the anti-dumping statutory baseline, the refiner or importer shall determine compliance using the following methodology: (i) Calculate the compliance total for the averaging period for sulfur, T&hyph;90, olefins, exhaust benzene emissions, exhaust toxics and exhaust NO X emissions, as applicable, based upon the anti-dumping statutory baseline value for that parameter using the formula specified at §80.67. (ii) Calculate the actual total for the averaging period for sulfur, T&hyph;90, olefins, exhaust benzene emissions, exhaust toxics and exhaust NO X emissions, as applicable, based upon the value of the parameter for each batch of conventional gasoline and gasoline blendstocks, if applicable, using the formula specified at §80.67. (iii) The actual total for exhaust benzene emissions, exhaust toxics and exhaust NO X emissions, shall not exceed the compliance total, and the actual totals for sulfur, olefins and T&hyph;90 shall not exceed 125% of the compliance totals, as required under the applicable model. (3) In the case of any batch of gasoline that is produced by combining blendstock with gasoline, where the gasoline portion of the blend is not included in the compliance calculation, the emissions performance for exhaust benzene, exhaust toxics, and exhaust NO X emissions for the blendstock shall be: (i)(A) The emissions performance of a gasoline that would be produced by combining the blendstock used at the volume percentage used, with a gasoline that has properties that are equal to the refiner's or importer's anti-dumping baseline; minus (B) The emissions performance of a gasoline that has properties that are equal to the refiner's or importer's anti-dumping baseline. (ii) The volume weighted net emissions performance for exhaust benzene, exhaust toxics, and exhaust NO X emissions, as applicable, for all batches of gasoline that are produced during the averaging period by combining blendstock with gasoline, shall be equal to or less than zero. (iii) The value of those properties measured on a weight percent or ppm basis shall be adjusted for the specific gravity of the gasoline and blendstocks used for the purposes of calculations under paragraph (g)(3) of this section. (iv) For blends which contain greater than 1.50 volume percent ethanol, the RVP of the final blend shall be 1.0 psi greater than the RVP of the base gasoline and blendstocks without the ethanol for the purposes of calculations under paragraph (g)(3) of this section.
