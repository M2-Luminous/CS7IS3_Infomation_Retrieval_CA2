FR940207-1-00059 FR940207-1-00013 NRC informed EPA by letter that the Commission received extensive comments on NRC's July 20, 1993 proposal to approve the Atlas reclamation plan, including the closure schedule and interim milestones required by the MOU, and the Environmental Assessment and the Finding of No Significant Impact for the Atlas mill. NRC rescinded its Finding of No Significant Impact for the Atlas mill in October 1993. 58 FR 52516 (October 8, 1993). One issue appears to be the potential for flooding of the Atlas impoundment if it is reclaimed on-site, due to the proximity of the site to the Colorado River. This concern and others appear to have caused delays in the license amendment for this site. NRC informed EPA it intends to reassess the reclamation plan for that site and prepare a report. Based on the results of that reassessment, the NRC will determine what the next steps should be. In its reassessment of the reclamation plan, NRC will obtain input from Federal, State, and local representatives. NRC is actively pursuing a timely final decision on the Atlas site location and its reclamation plan. To this end, NRC informed EPA by letter dated December 28, 1993, that NRC has conducted several meetings with the various representatives enumerated above and has requested additional technical information from the licensee. The near edge of town is located about 2 km to the east of the Atlas tailings impoundment. However, it appears the area within a 1.5 km radius of the Atlas mill tailings impoundment site is sparsely populated. An interim cover is being placed over the impoundment for radon emission control as the Atlas tailings impoundment dries sufficiently to allow access of the necessary equipment. As discussed in the Background Information Document (BID) for the amendments to 40 CFR 192 subpart D, interim covers significantly reduce radon emissions. Technical Support for Amending Standards for Management of Uranium Byproduct Materials: 40 CFR Part 192 Background Information Document, EPA 402&hyph;R&hyph;93&hyph;085, October 1993. If the 1996 MOU target date for emplacement of the permanent radon barrier is extended by NRC, EPA will review such an extension at that time. Under the present circumstances, it appears an extension of the MOU target date would be consistent with the factors to be considered under the ``as expeditiously as practicable'' standard at 40 CFR section 192.32(a)(3)(i), since there may be a need for consistency with mandatory requirements of other regulatory programs (i.e., NEPA) and there may be factors beyond the control of the licensee. 40 CFR section 192.31(k). Based on representations from NRC, EPA believes that the extra time NRC is taking to further review the proposed Atlas mill site reclamation plan is necessary to address the large amount of public comments received and that it will result in a final solution that is more responsive to public comment. NRC and the affected Agreement States have also agreed to enforce the provisions of the amended licenses to ensure compliance with the new schedules for emplacing the permanent radon barriers, including interim milestones, and to ensure (and verify) the efficacy of the design and construction of the barrier to achieve compliance with the 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard contained in the amendments to subpart D. III. Proposed Rule To Rescind 40 CFR Part 61, Subpart T for NRC and Agreement State Licensees EPA is proposing to rescind subpart T as it applies to non-operational uranium mill tailings disposal sites licensed by NRC or an affected Agreement State. The Agency sets forth this proposal pursuant to its authority under CAA section 112(d)(9), as amended in 1990. The support for this proposal includes (1) The MOU, which reflects consultation with NRC and the affected Agreement States and sets forth a course of conduct that will bolster NRC's regulatory program under UMTRCA so that it is protective of public health with an ample margin of safety, (2) the settlement agreement which adds comprehensive detail to the MOU, (3) EPA's amendments to 40 CFR part 192 subpart D, (4) the relevant license amendments, to date, and (5) expected amendments by NRC to its implementation regulations at Appendix A, 10 CFR part 40. A. Proposed EPA Determination Under CAA Section 112(d)(9) 1. Background Section 112(d)(9) authorizes EPA to decline to regulate radionuclide emissions from NRC-licensees under the CAA provided that EPA determines, by rule, and after consultation with NRC, that the regulatory scheme established by NRC protects the public health with an ample margin of safety. The legislative history of section 112(d)(9) provides additional guidance as to what is meant by ``an ample margin of safety to protect the public health'' and what process the Administrator should follow in making that determination in a rulemaking proceeding under section 112(d)(9). The Conference Report points out that the ``ample margin of safety'' finding under section 112(d)(9) is the same ``ample margin of safety'' requirement that was contained in section 112 of the CAA prior to its amendment in 1990. The conferees also made clear that the process the Administrator was expected to follow in making any such determination under section 112(d)(9) was that ``required under the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals in NRDC v. EPA, 824 F.2d 1146 (D.C. Cir 1987) ( Vinyl Chloride ).'' H.R. Rep. 952, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 339 (1990).
