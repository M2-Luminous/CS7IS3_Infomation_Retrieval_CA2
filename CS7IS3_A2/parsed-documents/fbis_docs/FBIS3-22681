At least in the way it is transmitted (through the air). This important detail had created widespread panic among the people. Among the medical community, though, there is calm although the basic tools for responding do not exist. Thus far quickly eradicating the epidemic remains uncertain. Ever since this epidemic spread in the wilaya of Tizi-Ouzou, there has been a combat-like commotion among local public-health authorities. Six people have died, a total of 140 people have been hospitalized, and there were as many cases of healthy carriers, it was reported at the University Hospital Center. Besides, the state of alert is always maintained. However at the "Antidiphtheria Combat Committee," which had been set up as soon as the epidemic appeared, they are clear about it. For them, the situation has just about been brought under control. It should be mentioned that this multidisciplinary group made up of experts continues to meet each Sunday to get updated on the situation. It has been pointed out that the first case of diphtheria was reported in Ath Zmenzer, a rural community of 11,000 located about 10 km from the town of Tizi-Ouzou. A young ninth grade student died and several people were infected. Not only had the news shaken village residents it had also produced major panic. The rush to get vaccinated was indescribable. The small treatment room could clearly not satisfy everyone. The doctor at the health center, who only works mornings (?), and was overwhelmed, had to push the panic-stricken crowd back. Because of the confusion between antidiphtheria vaccines and DWTP (diphtheria, whopping cough, tetanus, and poliomyelitis), several people ran to private pharmacies (because public-sector pharmacies did not sell them) to buy some. Limited Vaccination After the death of this teenager, only some members of his family were vaccinated, it was said. As to the grade school he attended, it would appear matters were not taken seriously. One teacher recalled: "The day the vaccination team arrived at our school, only the dead boy's class was vaccinated and the teacher who was in class at the exact time they arrived." Several months later, the wait was still on. Among all of the staff and all the students, the panic was continuous. Dr. Bourbia, the main leader in the antidiphtheria fight, stated that: "a real panic arose around the vaccination in Tizi-Ouzou. Of course, even if the vaccines are available, you cannot vaccinate an entire population. People need to understand that you can only vaccinate [text illegible], such as the family or classmates where school children are involved." In fact, these vaccination "criteria" are not followed, as we have just seen. Is this an isolated case? Don't be too sure of it! The people's vaccination coverage is far from satisfying the required standards. This epidemic revealed all. At Draa Ben Khedda, a medium-sized city, the situation is more dramatic. It is Sunday, 30 January, and the time is 1000. At the city's polyclinic, many people are waiting. Parents are anxious. A middle-aged woman carrying a baby in her arms exclaims: "I have come for my baby's second vaccination and they have just told me there isn't any." A nurse would add that: "We are out of our supply of DWTP and we have been for 10 days. We are expecting a delivery of vaccine any day now." Given this situation, parents had to buy it for 106 Algerian dinars. For their part, pharmacists pointed out that all the vaccines were gone and that their orders would not be filled until the end of February. In every corner of the wilaya of Tizi-Ouzou, the diphtheria epidemic is still a primary discussion topic. For their part, public-health officials are reassuring. They say that of the 140 cases of diphtheria, there were few typical cases, and that the number of new cases is clearly declining. According to these same officials, the patients are responding well, "despite the lack of serum and the insufficiency of vaccines." In addition, we would point out that the Nedir Mohamed Hospital made available 30 beds from their infectious diseases unit and 40 beds from their psychiatric unit. So every possible agency was requisitioned and nine patients were transferred to the El-Kettar Hospital in Algiers. Furthermore, it was revealed that the individuals affected are, generally speaking, between the ages of 10 and 15 who were poorly vaccinated or not at all. As to the origin of this epidemic, a source in the medical community stated that the population of the wilaya of Tizi-Ouzou was infected by a citizen of the wilaya of Bouira who was reported to have stayed in the south of Algeria (a region supposedly infected by peoples of the Sahara). It should be noted that the affected areas are the most remote (Azzefoun, Ain El-Hammam, Draa El-Mizan). In these very remote areas, the people are very far away from health services. One country doctor said that he had not been aware of the existence of diphtheria in his area until after the burial of one patient. Well, now! Even the medical community is caught unaware. For some, [diphtheria] is basically a childhood disease. Furthermore, it is said that there exists another viral illness (infectious mononucleosis) that has the same symptoms as diphtheria. Upper respiratory ailments (influenza, colds, angina) make it difficult to diagnose positive diphtheria cases, they go on to say. In the case of Dr. Bourbia, he has to wait until the end of the winter, which would bring its share of upper respiratory illnesses, to isolate the diphtheria cases and hope to eradicate it once and for all. But, when you are dealing with an epidemic, no one can predict how it will develop. Several questions remain. How did we get to this point? Was vaccination coverage correct? At school, is the vaccination certificate systematically required? Have the public-health officials assumed their responsibilities to force parents to vaccinate their children who were born at home? Diphtheria is a contagious, deadly illness. You can be a healthy carrier and transmit the disease to anybody who is unvaccinated. In other words, the lives of many of us are in danger.
