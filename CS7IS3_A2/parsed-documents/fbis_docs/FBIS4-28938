The warplanes were flown in an air war exercise with the skies above Yongwol, Chunchon and Asan Bay as its operational theatre. In coordination with more than 100 fighter-bombers, assault planes, observation planes and reconnaissance planes of the U.S. Seventh Air Force stationed in South Korea, they staged an exercise of striking targets and supporting ground attack. The drill was a wildcat war gamble designed to increase the capability of quick flight of the fighter planes of the U.S. Marines to the Korean peninsula and their capacity of surprise strikes at the North in coordination with the U.S. Air Force flying corps present in South Korea. The frantic war exercises against the northern half of Korea clearly reveal the aggressive and bellicose nature of the U.S. imperialists.
