FBIS4-62912 "drsov097_u_94004" FBIS-SOV-94-097 Daily Report 18 May 1994 Latvia Ministers Suspected of Working for KGB Urged To Resign Ministers Suspected of Working for KGB Urged To Resign MK1805114594 Moscow NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA in Russian 18 May 94 p 3 MK1805114594 Moscow NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA Russian BFN [Unattributed report under the "NEGA Reports" rubric: "Latvia"] [Text] In his comments on a televised statement by Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs, Economic Reform Minister Ojar Kehris said that no ministerial changes have been officially discussed at the Latvian government. The prime minister said in his statement on 15 May that the removal of ministers suspected of cooperating with the KGB would be the first step in reshuffling the Latvian Cabinet of Ministers. Kehris, in turn, stressed that the situation can be straightened out by the voluntary resignation of the ministers themselves. Valdis Birkavs pointed out that he will not discuss possible candidacies of new ministers as long as there is no legal basis to do so. Kehris said, however, that this could mean only a court ruling establishing the guilt of the suspected ministers, something that could serve as a reason for firing one minister and appointing another. For the time being, Foreign Minister Georgs Andreyevs is on vacation, and Edvin Inkens, minister for special assignments, continues to go to work every day. (These two are "the main suspects.") It is known that Inkens is ready to be temporarily dismissed from office if Birkavs so requests. The Cabinet of Ministers committee on economy and finances has opted against supporting the proposal made by the Prenex Anftalt firm for a second time to build a plan to incinerate hazardous wastes in Latvia. It is well known that at the beginning of March Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs signed a letter turning down the proposal; he explained that the Latvian government decided not to cooperate with the firm because bringing hazardous wastes into the country from abroad would run counter to the Latvian law banning hazardous wastes from entering Latvia. Minister Ojar Kehris said at a briefing that the committee on economy and finances recommended against accepting the firm's proposal because there is no sufficient information about the types of wastes Prenex Anftalt is going to bring into Latvia. The firm did not respond to repeated requests by the Environmental Protection Ministry that it provide appropriate documents. In addition, the Basel conference [as published], which Latvia has also joined, specifies that as an exception a state could ask another state to accept wastes, but a firm cannot make such a request to another firm or a state. The project called for three incineration facilities to be built outside Riga to incinerate 300,000 tonnes of waste a year, including 210,000 tonnes to be brought from EC countries and 90,000 tonnes of local wastes.
