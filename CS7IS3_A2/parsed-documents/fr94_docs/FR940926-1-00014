FR940926-1-00014 FR940926-1-00006 (i) Except for the label specified in paragraph (c) of this section, the lettering on the label shall be of a color that contrasts with the background of the label. (j) The label shall contain the following statements, in the English language, lettered in block capitals and numerals not less than three thirty-seconds of an inch high, in the order shown: (1) Name of manufacturer: Except as provided in paragraphs (j) (1) (i), (ii), and (iii) of this section, the full corporate or individual name of the actual assembler of the vehicle shall be spelled out, except that such abbreviations as ``Co.'' or ``Inc.'' and their foreign equivalents, and the first and middle initials of individuals, may be used. The name of the manufacturer shall be preceded by the words ``Manufactured By'' or ``Mfd By.'' In the case of imported vehicles, where the label required by this section is affixed by the Registered Importer, the name of the Registered Importer shall also be placed on the label in the manner described in this paragraph, directly below the name of the final assembler. (i) If a vehicle is assembled by a corporation that is controlled by another corporation that assumed responsibility for the conformity with the standards, the name of the controlling corporation may be used. (ii) If a vehicle is fabricated and delivered in complete but unassembled form, such that it is designed to be assembled without special machinery or tools, the fabricator of the vehicle may affix the label and name itself as the manufacturer for the purposes of this section. (iii) If a trailer is sold by a person who is not its manufacturer, but who is engaged in the manufacture of trailers and assumes legal responsibility for all duties and liabilities imposed by the Act with respect to that trailer, the name of that person may appear on the label as the manufacturer. In such a case the name shall be preceded by the words ``Responsible Manufacturer'' or ``Resp Mfr.'' (2) Month and year of manufacture: This shall be the time during which work was completed at the place of main assembly of the vehicle. It may be spelled out, as ``June 1970,'' or expressed in numerals, as ``670.'' (3) ``Gross Vehicle Weight Rating'' or ``GVWR,'' followed by the appropriate value in kilograms with the commensurate weight in pounds shown in parentheses, which shall not be less than the sum of the unloaded vehicle weight, rated cargo load, and 68 kilograms (150 pounds) times the vehicle's designated seating capacity. However, for school buses the minimum occupant weight shall be 55 kilograms (120 pounds). (4) ``Gross Axle Weight Rating'' or ``GAWR,'' followed by the appropriate value in kilograms with the commensurate weight in pounds shown in parentheses, for each axle, identified in order from front to rear (e.g. front, first intermediate, second intermediate, rear). The ratings for any consecutive axles having identical gross axle weight ratings when equipped with tires having the same tire size designation may, at the option of the manufacturer, be stated as a single value, with label indicating to which axles the ratings apply. Examples of Combined Ratings GAWR: (a) All axles_1850 kg (4080 lb) with 7.00&hyph;15 LT (D) tires. (b) Front_5442 kg (12,000 lb) with 10.00&hyph;20(G) tires. First intermediate to rear_6803 kg (15,000 lb) with 12.00&hyph;20(H) tires. (5) The statement: ``This vehicle conforms to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards in effect on the date of manufacture shown above. The expression ``U.S.'' or ``U.S.A.'' may be inserted before the word ``Federal.'' (i) In the case of passenger cars manufactured on or after September 1, 1978, the expression ``and bumper'' shall be included in the statement following the word ``safety.'' (ii) In the case of 1987 and subsequent model year passenger cars manufactured on or after April 24, 1986, the expression ``safety, bumper, and theft prevention'' shall be substituted in the statement for the word ``safety.'' (6) Vehicle identification number. (7) The type classification of the vehicle as defined in ยง571.3 of this chapter (e.g. truck, MPV, bus, trailer). (k) Multiple GVWR-GAWR ratings. (1) (For passenger cars only) In cases where different tire sizes are offered as a customer option, a manufacturer may at his option list more than one set of values for GVWR and GAWR, in response to the requirements of paragraphs (j) (3) and (4) of this section. If the label shows more than one set of weight rating values, each value shall be followed by the phrase ``with XXXX tires,'' inserting the proper tire size designations. A manufacturer may at his option list one or more tire sizes where only one set of weight ratings is provided. Passenger Car Example GVWR: 1995 kg (4400 lb) with G78&hyph;14B tires, 2177 kg (4800 lb) with H78&hyph;14B tires. GAWR: Front_907 kg (2000 lb) with G78&hyph;14B tires at 165 kPa (24 psi), 990 kg (2200 lb) with H78&hyph;14B tires at 165 kPa (24 psi). Rear_1088 kg (2400 lb) with G78&hyph;14B tires at 193 kPa (28 psi), 1179 kg (2600 lb) with H78&hyph;14B tires at 193 kPa (28 psi). (2) (For multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks, buses, trailers, and motorcycles) The manufacturer may, at its option, list more than one GVWR-GAWR-tire-rim combination on the label, as long as the listing conforms in content and format to the requirements for tire-rim-inflation information set forth in Standard No. 120 of this chapter (ยง571.120). (3) At the option of the manufacturer, additional GVWR-GAWR ratings for operation of the vehicle at reduced speeds may be listed at the bottom of the certification label following any information that is required to be listed.
