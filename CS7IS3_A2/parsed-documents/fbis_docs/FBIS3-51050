The revenues and expenditures of the National Treasury will amount to $88.8 billion. Planning Ministry Executive Secretary Raul Jungman said that the measures will come into force only if approved by Congress. "Lawmakers are also responsible for the stabilization of the economy, and they will have to decide whether we will have a balanced budget, without a deficit." The total budget, including debt rescheduling, amounts to $280 billion. The strict budget proposal establishes that in 1994 government spending will not surpass revenues, and that public debt certificates will be issued only for rescheduling the existing domestic and foreign debts. Economist Edmar Bacha, who is a special adviser to Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, said that the budgetary balance is the cornerstone for implementation of the second and third stages of the economic stabilization program, which involves adoption of the URV [Real Value Unit] and its transformation into a strong currency. "We are getting rid of the need to balance the budget through inflation and corruption. We are exchanging that for negotiation, which is the only alternative we have, because the other would be a dictatorship." In the new budget bill the government provided for a real interest rate of 15 percent for 1994, because no new debts will be contracted. This will help reduce payment of interest, which will drop from $8.7 billion in 1993 to $7.7 billion in 1994.
