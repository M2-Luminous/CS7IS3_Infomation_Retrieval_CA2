China's chief representative on the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, Guo Fengmin, said the two sides would set the date for the meeting next week. Speaking at the Xinhua News Agency local office Lunar New Year banquet yesterday, Mr Guo said it would be difficult to hold the Airport Committee talks next week. "There will be expert talks on security and defence land next week, and it would be difficult to hold the two sets of talks simultaneously," he said. He said the date for resuming the Airport Committee talks would be arranged by the time the two sides' experts met next week. The Chinese representative on the security and defence land committee, Luo Jiahuan, said he hoped next week's talks would lead to an agreement. "Although the issues are very complicated, there is still hope of reaching a resolution," Mr Luo said. He was not sure if the British side would be able to resolve the differences. He said the main argument would be on the garrison and redevelopment. It was proposed that the British military hospital in Tsim Sha Tsui would be scaled down and Shek Kong garrison would be redeveloped. Mr Luo said the Chinese and British sides would arrange a joint tour to the sites next week. Meanwhile, another new airport contract has been awarded, despite the Sino-British impasse over funding. The Provisional Airport Authority yesterday announced it had awarded the contract for the airport's baggage handling system to Swire Engineering Services, in conjunction with Van Der Lande Industries of the Netherlands and Siemens of Germany. A political party yesterday urged the government to make contingency plans to relieve traffic in Kowloon in case the airport railway link was not completed by 1997. "It seems to us the government is very optimistic about the financial arrangement and thinks that the railway will be completed," Leung Kwong-cheung of the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood (ADPL) said. "It (the government) says it has no special plans as it is optimistic." But Mr Leung said in case the railway could not be completed as scheduled, the government should now start preparing measures to cope with extra transport demands in West Kowloon, Tsing Yi and the future No 3 route after the airport opened in 1997. At a meeting with Principal Assistant Secretary for Transport Arthur Ng, the ADPL proposed four contingency plans, including extending the Kowloon-Canton Railway to Central.
