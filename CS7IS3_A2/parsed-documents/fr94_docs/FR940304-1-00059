FR940304-1-00059 FR940304-1-00011 This rule, if promulgated, will not have any adverse economic impact on any small entities since its effect would be to reduce the overall costs of EPA's hazardous waste regulations and would be limited to one facility. Accordingly, I hereby certify that this proposed regulation, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This regulation, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis. VI. Paperwork Reduction Act Information collection and recordkeeping requirements associated with this proposed rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;511, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ) and have been assigned OMB Control Number 2050&hyph;0053. List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 261 Environmental protection, Hazardous waste, Recycling, and Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Dated: January 26, 1994. Elizabeth A.
