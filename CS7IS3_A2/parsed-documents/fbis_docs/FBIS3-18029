In the race for second place, the PvdA [Labor Party], VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy], and D66 [Democrats 66] are currently running neck and neck, recent opinion polls indicate. The excitement among members of the principal opposition party, the VVD, over last week's 34 seats seems to have been rather premature. The Social Democratic PvdA has made something of a comeback with 30 seats. The advance of the liberal left D66 has apparently reached a strength of 30 seats. These are the results of the latest polls published on Tuesday [22 February] and conducted by the interview bureau for the ANP press agency and the Dutch television current affairs program, NOVA. Two weeks ago the CDA received a sharp setback following doubts about the future of the AOW, the Dutch pensions law. The party dropped in the polls to 37 seats, a dramatic loss of 17 seats compared with their present strength of 54. The 24 percent for the Christian Democrats was the lowest figure since the Lubbers/Kok government took office in November 1989. Brinkman's party, who is heading the list of candidates, climbed back up to 26.2 percent in the survey which closed last Monday. That probably represents a gain of three seats compared to two weeks ago, but nevertheless a significant loss of 14 seats. PvdA, the coalition partner, scored 19.5 percent in the poll, which means that Kok's party is maintaining the momentum of growing support recorded over recent weeks. But with around 30 seats, the loss of 19 compared with the present 49 is nevertheless quite dramatic. The VVD, the big winner over recent weeks, has lost ground in this latest poll conducted by ANP/NOVA. Interview has dampened their enthusiasm somewhat, recording a score of 19.2 percent or 29 seats, which means that the VVD falls back to fourth position. D66 stands at 30 seats in the poll, a big gain of 18. But following the unprecedented advance of summer 1991 when it won 36 seats, decline seems to have well and truly set in. Two weeks ago Van Mierlo's party still stood at 32 seats. The Greens have also made gains, up by 6.4 percent from 6 to 9 seats.
