In addition to the nonpayment of their salary arrears and the devaluation of the CFA franc, the specter of war has also come to trouble (?their fragile peace). At 0420 this morning, the inhabitants of Abeche woke up to the sounds of automatic weapons fire and exploding shells. Elements of the Chadian National Front [FNT] had attacked the Chadian National Army [FAT] troops in Abeche. Our correspondent (Solomon Ngartha) has the details: [Begin Ngartha recording] At 0450 today, elements of the FNT present in Abeche, who were awaiting their integration into the FAT--in accordance with previously signed agreements--attacked the government troops stationed there, (?flouting) those agreements. The assailants launched their attack on the military garrison during the first hours of the morning. First they attacked a training center storeroom and obtained 405 light weapons, including bazookas, [word indistinct], and Kalishnikov assault rifles. Once in possession of these weapons, they then attacked other weapons depots at the camp, including an (?operations) storeroom where they looted (Bavar 82) 60-mm mortars, in addition to a large quantity of personnel weapons. We visited a military camp this morning in the company of National Defense Minister (Mamadou M'biyi); Youssouf Togoimi, the prefect of the area; and top military officers, including (Tetengar), the deputy commander; Lieutenant Colonel (Gbese Moussa); and Lieutenant Colonel Moussa Haroun. We observed traces of blood, forced doors, and SAM-7's which had been destroyed. During our visit to the camp, we were constantly coming across dead bodies lying on the ground. These were the bodies of FNT rebels who had been killed by government forces. Within the camp alone, nine corpses were lying on the ground. In the [words indistinct] running along the Abeche market, two other corpses were observed, covered with dust. At the entrance to the residence of the prefect, two other corpses were seen on the ground. Not far from the sign indicating the road to [name indistinct], another rebel (?who was shot in the back was seen). For the moment, relative calm reigns in the town of Abeche, punctuated by the sounds of isolated firing. Elements of the government forces are carrying out mopping up operations. The attackers have fled toward [name indistinct]. They are being pursued by government forces. The official provisional results of the attack say 29 rebels were killed and 32 were captured. On the government side, two people have been killed and nine injured. Seven of these people were seriously wounded and were evacuated this afternoon to Ndjamena. A curfew has been imposed on the town of Abeche by the prefect. It runs from 1900 to 0600. [end recording]
