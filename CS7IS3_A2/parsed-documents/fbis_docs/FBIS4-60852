Ter-Petrosyan spoke yesterday in the parliament. The nation's existence--this is what national accord means, said the president. The nation has always been united by common concerns, customs, ideas of the future. Disagreements, on the other hand, existed between political forces. Nor does Levon Ter-Petrosyan recognize such a notion as national ideology. In his opinion, in a democratic society it is impossible to unite democracy around one idea, since the final outcome may be fascism, as world experience has proven. Armenia must have a national program of democratization and development that, in addition to traits mentioned in its title, must be universal and humanitarian. "A constitution is an accord! All citizens, as well as different political forces in Armenia, must obey it," said Ter-Petrosyan. The president believes that a referendum is the most effective way to adopt the basic law. He expressed certainty that the Armenian people will adopt their constitution and thus remove tension in the sociopolitical life of the country. The president said once again that a violent change of authority--the way it had happened in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Tajikistan--is impossible in Armenia. Further on L. Ter-Petrosyan proposed his plan for pulling out of the crisis. First: The parliament expresses confidence in either the Constitutional Commission's draft or the draft of "the six" and without discussion votes on submitting one of the drafts to a referendum vote. Second: If this does not happen, both drafts are put to a referendum and then a second round of the referendum may be needed. Third: In the event the draft of six parties passes, the president and the government resign. Fourth: If the Constitutional Commission's draft passes, new elections for president and National Assembly are held. And fifth: Before this session ends, the parliament must adopt a law on Armenian Republic citizenship and elections to the republic's National Assembly.
