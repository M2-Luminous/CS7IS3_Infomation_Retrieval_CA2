Defending the might of our single-hearted unity around the party and the leader like the apples of our eyes and further displaying it are decisive factors guaranteeing triumphs for this year's march. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: We should defend the revolutionary ranks' single-hearted unity, which has been consolidated under the leadership of our party, like the apples of our eyes, and further develop and consolidate it. Single-hearted unity is a immortal tradition of glory and a immortal banner of victory. Our people have strived heroically by closely rallying around the party and the leader. As a result, they have triumphantly overcome countless difficulties and trials lying in the way of the revolution and set up a strong socialist country of self-dependence, self-support, and self-reliant defense on this land. Last year, in which the fatherland and revolution were faced with a stern trial, our people proudly defended sovereignty and security of the socialist fatherland and achieved a big success in socialist economic construction thanks to the might of single-hearted unity. We should ardently adhere to the tradition of glorious single- hearted unity and further bring full play to the might of it so as to fully display the superiority of the socialism of our own style and complete the socialist cause of chuche to the end in any storm. Firmly consolidating single-hearted unity among our revolutionary ranks is an important requirement for the environment of our revolution and enormous tasks arising before us. The imperialists and reactionaries are intensifying an unprecedented offensive in political, economic, military, diplomatic, and all other spheres to isolate, stifle, and crush [korip, chilsik, apsal] the Republic which is advancing under the banner of socialism. Due to the enemies' anti-Republic and antisocialist maneuvers, the situation in our country became extremely tense and complicated, and countless obstacles were laid before us. Under such conditions, we should uphold the banner of single-hearted unity higher in order to effect a revolutionary upsurge in socialist construction by waging a movement to carry out the revolutionary economic strategy of our party. Our single-hearted unity is unity of ideology and action of the whole party and the entire people who follow the great leader [suryong] and the illustrious leader [yongdoja] with unquestioned worship. There are no obstacles nor fortresses that we cannot overcome or occupy when we march by upholding the might of great single-hearted unity that is unprecedented in history. The road to smashing every step of vicious anti-Republic and antisocialist maneuvers of the imperialists and reactionaries and bringing full play to the spirit of the chuche Korea lie in displaying the might of single-hearted unity. In addition, the road to consolidating the foundations of the nation's independent economy rock-solid by vigorously accelerating the general onward march of socialism lies in the fact that all the people unite single-heartedly around the party. The ideology on all the more strengthening the single- hearted unity of our revolutionary ranks which was elucidated in the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's New Year address, is a precious guideline which provided a decisive guarantee in the victory of this year's battle. Here lies the great leader's lofty will of trying to bring about a historical turning point in our country's revolution and construction this year by all the more highly manifesting the might of our single-hearted unity of the entire party, all the people, and the entire Army solidly uniting around the great leader [yongdoja]. All the party members and workers must all the more consolidate and develop our single-hearted unity in accordance with the prevailing situation and the demand of the revolutionary development to brilliantly realize the militant task presented in the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's New Year address and achieve greater victories in the struggle to advance the cause of socialism of our own style. Most of all, all the party members and workers must have a deep understanding of the leader's [yongdoja] greatness. Also, it is important for them to have a clear faith of absolutely having faith in and following their leader [suryong] and their leader [yongdoja] in whatever kind of environment. The might of unity of the revolutionary ranks is the firm might of faith of all the people toward the leader [yongdoja]. Our dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a peerless great man who is combined with both literary and military accomplishments as well as loyalty and filial piety. He is also the fate and future of our fatherland, nation, and socialism of our own style. All the party members and workers must experience in their hearts of how we are upholding such a great leader [yongdoja] at the head of the party, the revolutionary ranks, and the people's Armed Forces through our revolutionary's proud reality which is advancing without the slightest wavering amid the world's disturbances. We must always deeply bear in our hearts the rock-firm faith that the fatherland exists because of the leader [yongdoja] and that our happiness and the prosperity of the posterity is guaranteed, and uphold the dear comrade leader with single-hearted loyalty and filial piety. Comrade Yi In-mo is a magnificent example in absolutely admiring and following the dear comrade leader who is the center of unity of our revolution and the center of leadership. As concentratedly reflected in the poem dedicated to the dear comrade leader filled with the single-hearted unity of loyalty, Comrade Yi In-mo's ideological and spiritual world is truly a lofty spiritual world which can be possessed only by a true revolutionary who shares the fate with the leader [yongdoja] to the end in whatever hardships. All the party members and workers must reflect themselves in the spiritual world of Comrade Yi In-mo and must endlessly cultivate themselves to become genuine loyalists. The great chuche idea is the ideological basis of our single- hearted unity. All the people are firmly guaranteeing the consistency of ideology and behavior according to the demand of the chuche idea. Here lies the invincible might of our single-hearted unity. The party members and workers must deeply bear in their minds that the chuche idea is the life of socialism of our own style and must all the more firmly arm themselves with the chuche idea. In particular, the work to deeply study the great leader's classic works and the dear comrade leader's documents which completely compiles the chuche idea, theory, and method must be carried out steadily. We must deeply study the great leader's New Year address of this year by analyzing it in detail and firmly arm ourselves with its profound ideology. Along with this, we must continue to energetically study the dear comrade leader's immortal works including, "Interference in Socialism Cannot Be Tolerated," and "The Historical Lesson in Socialist Construction and Our Party's General Line," so that we can all the more firmly consolidate the faith that we will always win as long as the great leader [yongdoja] exists who is leading our revolution toward the one road of chuche. Our single-hearted unity is a strong driving force of the socialist construction and its might must be wholly manifested in the practical struggle to accelerate socialist economic construction. In accordance with the changing environment and the actual demand of our country's socialist construction, our party today presented the method on moving toward the road of agriculture first, light industry first, and trade first and is calling the whole party and all the people to fulfill it. We must consolidate like bedrock the country's independent economic basis, all the more enhance the people's living standard, and wholly display the might of unity of our people which is firmly united around the party and the leader in today's worthwhile struggle to occupy a new offensive camp for the domination of a higher ground in socialism. All the party members and workers must highly manifest endless devotion and the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude toward the party and the revolution so that the plan of the people's economy which they are entrusted with can be accomplished at an appropriate time and without fail. When the party members and workers of all sectors of the people's economy exert strenuous efforts by highly upholding the party's intention to help and lead each other and highly manifest the popular heroism, we can magnificently fulfill any kind of task we are faced with this year. To elucidate socialism of our own style through the might of single-hearted unity, the communist virtue which is overflowing in all of the society must all the more be fully blossomed. Our people's revolutionary trait which is single-heartedly united around the party and the leader must be vigorously displayed in highly manifesting the communist virtue of all the members of society helping and leading each other according to the collective principle of one for all and all for one. We must substantially carry out the work to establish a revolutionary outlook on life, and persistently carry out the work well to learn the beautiful ideological, spiritual, and moral traits of the pioneers of the communist virtue so that laudable communist acts can be highly manifested. In particular, we must all the more fully blossom the virtue of Army-people unity which has been highly manifested traditionally. All the party members and workers must not forget even a second that we are living and struggling with the strong willpower and optimism because of the People's Army led by our comrade supreme commander. Therefore, they must assist the People's Army from the bottom of their hearts and love the People's Army as if it is their own flesh and blood. By doing so, work must be carried out to all the more loudly resound the shouts of hurrah of the ideology of Army-people unity anywhere. The party organizations and functionaries are possessed of an important duty in further firmly consolidating our single-hearted unity and highly manifesting its might. The party organizations must adhere to and elucidate the tradition of single-hearted unity. This must be put forth as a [words indistinct] work related to the fate of socialism of our own style and must yield everything to it. The party organizations must consistently carry out all work so that it can all the more firmly consolidate our single-hearted unity. In particular, priority must be put into thoroughly embodying the politics of benevolence presented by the dear comrade leader who endlessly loves the people. Our functionaries are the core force of the party and faithful servants of the people. The role of the functionaries is importantly dependent on how great our party's politics of love and politics of faith toward the people is actually brought about. All the functionaries must uphold the party's slogan of, "Serving the People," and must sincerely work as a messenger of the people and take pains so that the party's benefits and considerations can be all the more extended to the people well. All the guiding functionaries must substantially and persistently carry out the revolutionization and working classification work of themselves so that the revolutionary and people-oriented work method and work style can be all the more embodied. This is to make all the guiding functionaries into genuine functionaries and true messenger of the people in which the masses truly respect and follow. The single-hearted unity is our most mighty weapon and strength to advocate, adhere to, and complete socialism of our own style to the end. As long as there is the wise leadership of the party and the leader, and the single-hearted unity united like bedrock around the great leader [suryong] and the great leader [yongdoja], there is nothing to be afraid of in this world. Let us all the more move forward by highly upholding the banner of single-hearted unity with redoubled courage and unshakable confidence so that the resolute spirit of the heroic Korea can once again be displayed in this year's socialist general onward march.
