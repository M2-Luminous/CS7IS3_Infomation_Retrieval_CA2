He said that "the aim of his visit was further consolidation of cooperation and friendship of Albania with Malaysia and Brunei. Albania and Malaysia, although geographically far from each other, have similarities that unite them spiritually. Both countries have a religious pluralism. The different religions in Malaysia and Albania have in full harmony among them. The two countries have had a difficult past and backwardness. Malaysia has successfully overcome this period and is one of the countries which is considered a miracle for Southeast Asia with regard to development." Mr. Berisha said that "the secret of development of Malaysia is not in its great resources, but in the wisdom of the people of Malaysia, their untiring work, their discipline and determination to develop a market economy." Mr. Berisha added that they had signed several agreements, that on economic, cultural and technical cooperation with Malaysia, an agreement to lift double taxation, another for payments and the guarantee of investments. "I think that the agreements signed between Albania and Malaysia create a sound basis for a powerful cooperation between the two countries. Malaysia voiced its readiness to help Albania in the field of construction, telecommunications and infrastructure. Malaysia has a great interest in the business with Albania with the aim of making investments in this country. About 50 Albanian students are studying in Malaysia and some of them were going on very well with their studies in the university," Mr. Berisha continued. Regarding the visit to Brunei, Mr. Berisha said that "it was a short working visit, during which we discussed development of relations between our two countries. I may say that His Majesty, the sultan, and the ministers whom we met, showed great interest in various projects, especially in communication and infrastructure. We presented there a number of projects which will be studied by the Investments Agency in Brunei and later, a decision will be adopted on respective investments. Albania and Brunei are two small countries but with great possibilities of cooperation."
