Of the 35, at least 21 died of diarrhoea in Pajaru, Jajarkot district, 300 kilometres (187 miles) northwest of here because of contaminated water, he said, adding a medical team had been sent to the area. [passage omitted] "Similarly, fourteen children fell victim to the killer disease, meningitis in the Nepalese capital over the week," he said. "People also fall victim to seasonal diseases during the monsoon season (May-August) in Nepal when they drink polluted flood waters," he said. But a television report on the deaths of the children and those who fell ill due to meningitis, has panicked parents in Kathmandu who have rushed to private clinics to get vaccines, witnesses said. The Infectious Diseases Control Department at a hospital in Kathmandu used to provide free anti-meningitis vaccines, but has now run out of stock, a doctor said. Private clinics were charging about four dollars for a shot, he said, but added "people need not get panicked by the death rate because it is an average rate at this time of the season."
