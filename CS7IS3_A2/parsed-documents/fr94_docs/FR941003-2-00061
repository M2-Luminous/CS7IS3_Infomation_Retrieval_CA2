Submission of Grant Applications Grant applications must be submitted to the HCFA Grants Officer (see the ADDRESSES section of this notice). The following schedule applies to the receipt, review, and award of SBIR applications: Receipt date_December 9, 1994 Technical review_January 17, 1995 Award decisions_February 10, 1995 Approximate award date_February 17, 1995 Applications must be received by December 9, 1994. Applications mailed through the U.S. Postal Service or a commercial delivery service will be ``on time'' if they are received or postmarked on or before December 9, 1994. Submissions by facsimile (fax) transmission will not be accepted. Applications that do not meet the above criteria will be considered late applications. Respondents are cautioned that if their application is late, it will be returned without review. V. Method of Selection and Evaluation Criteria All Phase I and Phase II grant applications will be evaluated and judged on a competitive basis. Applications will be screened, and those found to be inadequate for review or programmatically unrelated to HCFA's mission will be returned to the applicant. Those passing the screening will be reviewed for technical and scientific merit. Each application will be judged individually, as described in this section. HCFA is under no obligation to fund any application or make any specific number of awards in a given topic area. It may also elect to fund no projects within a given topic area. A. Review Process Grant applications are subject to a review process involving two sequential steps. The first step is performed by a technical review panel composed primarily of Federal and non-Federal professionals selected for their competence in particular fields. The task of the panel is to evaluate applications for scientific and technical merit. The reviewers furnish a number rating, make an overall recommendation, and, on occasion, make highly specific recommendations related to the scope, direction, and conduct of the proposed research. The second level of review is made by the senior management of HCFA's ORD. ORD management decisions are based on judgments about not only the technical merit of the proposed research, but also its relevance to our mission. Generally, HCFA may award a grant only if the corresponding application has been recommended for approval by the panel. However, applications recommended for approval are not automatically funded. B. Review Criteria In considering the scientific and technical merit of each application, the following criteria and weights will be used: •The soundness and technical merit of the proposed approach_35 percent. •The potential of the research for technological innovation including the potential for commercial application_30 percent. •The qualifications of the proposed principal investigator, support staff, and consultant_20 percent. •The appropriateness of the budget_10 percent. •The adequacy and suitability of the facilities and research environment_5 percent. C. Funding Decisions When making funding decisions, ORD takes into consideration the following: (1) ratings resulting from the technical evaluation process, (2) program relevance, and (3) applications. D. Release of Grant Application Review Information Following decisions on grant applications, summary statements are mailed with a disapproval letter to principal investigators whose proposals have not been accepted. E. Submission of Similar Grant Applications by the Applicant Organization HCFA discourages the submission of more than one grant application submitted by the same applicant organization with essentially the same research focus: That is, a product or technology that, with nonsubstantive modifications, can be applied to a variety of purposes. In evaluating groupings of applications with a common scientific focus or objective, technical review groups are in a position to easily identify multiple grant applications from the same organization for essentially the same project. In these cases, HCFA will give funding consideration to only one application. VI. Considerations SBA's SBIR Program Policy Directive (58 FR 6144) specifies that we furnish the following information: A. Awards •There will be approximately 10 to 15 Phase I and/or Phase II awards in FY '95.
