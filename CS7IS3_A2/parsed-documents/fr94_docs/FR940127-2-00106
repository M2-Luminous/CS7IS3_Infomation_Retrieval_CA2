FR940127-2-00106 FR940127-2-00071 [Release No. 34&hyph;33498; File No. SR&hyph;MSRB&hyph;94&hyph;01] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Proposed Rule Change by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board Relating to Suitability of Recommendations January 21, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on January 7, 1994, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``Board'' or ``MSRB'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The purpose of the proposed rule change is to strengthen the MRSB's rules governing customer suitability. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The Board is filing amendments to rule G&hyph;19, concerning suitability of recommendations and rule G&hyph;8 concerning recordkeeping. The proposed rule change: (1) Clarifies and strengthens the existing language of rule G&hyph;19 that requires suitability determinations to be made when recommending transactions to customers; (2) clarifies the obligation of dealers to make reasonable efforts to obtain specific types of customer suitability information for all accounts that are not ``institutional accounts'' ( i.e. , retail accounts); and (3) clarifies the definition of ``institutional account.'' II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the Board included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below and is set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change The proposed rule change is designed to strengthen the Board's customer suitability rule. In a letter dated May 8, 1992, the Commission's Division of Market Regulation asked the Board to review the requirements of rule G&hyph;19 on suitability of recommendations. 1 In September 1992, the Board published a Request for Comments on a number of customer protection issues, including the application of rule G&hyph;19 to customer transactions. After reviewing these matters, the Board decided that rule G&hyph;19 embodies the appropriate general standard for dealers in making recommendations to customers. Nevertheless, the Board recognized there was a perception that certain provisions of the rule could be viewed as permitting recommendations to go forward without proper regard to the nature of the security being recommended and the customer to whom it is recommended. Accordingly, at the May 1993 Board meeting, the Board approved a Request for Comments on draft amendments to clarify and strengthen the suitability requirements of rule G&hyph;19. The draft amendments were approved at the November 1993 Board meeting and form the basis of the proposed rule change. 1 Letter from William H. Heyman, Director, Division, Commission, to Christopher A. Taylor, Executive Director, MSRB (May 8, 1992). Rule G&hyph;19 generally requires that, before making any recommendation to a customer, a dealer must first determine that the proposed transaction is suitable for the customer. To strengthen rule G&hyph;19, the proposed rule change eliminates two provisions from the rule which, in effect, are exceptions to this general requirement. The first such provision permits a dealer to make a recommendation when a customer refuses to provide sufficient information about himself for the dealer to determine that the recommendation is suitable for the customer. The provision states that a recommendation can go forward in this case as long as the dealer has no reasonable grounds to believe and does not believe that the recommendation is unsuitable (the ``not unsuitable'' provision). Although the Board did not conclude that this provision was the cause of customer protection problems ( i.e. , there was no evidence that dealers relied on this provision to make unsuitable recommendations), the Board believed that the provision should be deleted to avoid any ambiguities regarding a dealer's obligation to make a suitability determination. Eliminating the provision also will prevent any future use of the provision as an excuse for unsuitable recommendations.
