FR941013-2-00109 FR941013-2-00079 Accordingly, in 1985, the Commission approved, on a pilot basis, an Amex proposal to change the type of property acceptable as an escrow deposit. 13 This pilot program subsequently has been extended seven times, 14 in order to provide the Amex and OCC with the opportunity to resolve certain matters concerning the format of the receipt and administration of the program. 13 See pilot approval order, supra note 4. The Commission simultaneously approved the use by the clearing member of an escrow receipt form, in lieu of margin payments to OCC. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 22324 (August 13, 1985), 50 FR 33443 (August 18, 1985) (File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;85&hyph;07). 14 See, e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 23741 (October 22, 1986), 51 FR 39724 (October 30, 1986) (File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;86&hyph;26); 24121 (February 20, 1987), 52 FR 6258 (March 2, 1987) (File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;87&hyph;09); 24708 (July 15, 1987), 52 FR 27604 (July 22, 1987) (File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;87&hyph;09, Amendment No. 1); 25242 (January 5, 1988), 53 FR 648 (January 11, 1988) (File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;87&hyph;09, Amendment No. 2); 25888 (July 6, 1988), 53 FR 26547 (July 13, 1988) (File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;87&hyph;09, Amendment No. 3); 26274 (November 10, 1988), 53 FR 46522 (November 17, 1988) (File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;87&hyph;09, Amendment No. 4); 27657 (January 30, 1990), 55 FR 4295 (February 7, 1990) (File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;87&hyph;09; Amendment No. 5) Currently, a MIOER may be collateralized by cash, cash equivalents, one or more qualified equity securities, or a combination thereof. Pursuant to Regulation T, the term ``cash equivalents'' is defined to mean the market value of any of the following instruments with one year or less to maturity: (1) Securities issued or guaranteed by the United States or its agencies; (2) negotiable bank certificates of deposit; or (3) bankers acceptances issued by banking institutions in the United States and payable in the United States. 15 An equity security (other than warrants, rights or options) is qualified to be used as collateral for MIOERs issued to cover short call positions if it is traded on a national securities exchange and substantially meets the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') or Amex or if it is enumerated on the current list of over-the-counter margin stocks published by the Federal Reserve Board. 15 See 12 CFR 220.8(a)(3)(ii) (1990). The current escrow receipt program requires that, at the time the option is written, the total value of the collateral underlying the MIOER must be at least equal to the aggregate initial position value ( i.e., the index value at trade date times the applicable index multiplier times the number of options contracts covered by the collateral). Although the escrow deposit may include only one or even no securities, the customer must affirm that he is writing index options against a diversified portfolio. In addition, the issuing bank or trust company must be approved by OCC if the receipt is to be forwarded to OCC to meet the clearing member's margin obligations. 16 16 There are also certain financial, regulatory and depository standards for MIOER issuers. For further discussion of OCC's monitoring obligations, see OCC approval order, supra, note 5. Thereafter, the terms of the MIOER 17 specify that, if the value of the collateral falls below 55% of the current position value, the issuing bank or trust company promptly must notify the customer and request that the escrow deposit be supplemented. If the value of the collateral falls below 50% of the current position value, the bank or trust company promptly must notify OCC and the broker who, in turn, will disregard the MIOER and request that margin be deposited for the previously covered short position. 17 Under the Amex rules, escrow receipts must be in a form satisfactory to the Exchange. Because the Commission has only reviewed the escrow receipt submitted by OCC, the Commission previously has indicated and now reiterates that approval of these proposals is limited to the use of escrow receipts containing terms and conditions substantively identical to those in the OCC escrow receipt. The Amex proposes to convert its MIOER program from pilot to permanent status and to conform Rule 462 with recently approved amendments to the rules of OCC 18 and the other options exchanges. 19 Despite certain refinements, as discussed in more detail below, the current rules will, for the most part, continue to apply. 18 See OCC approval order supra, note 5. 19 See permenent approval order, supra, note 6. First, the Amex proposal will limit acceptable ``cash equivalents'' to securities issued or guaranteed by the United States and having one year or less to maturity (``short-term United States government securities''). As a result, securities issued or guaranteed by agencies of the United States, certificates of deposit and bankers acceptances will no longer be eligible as collateral for MIOERs issued to cover short call positions. In addition, the definition of ``qualified equity securities'' will be amended to incorporate all exchange-traded securities, whether or not they meet NSE or Amex listing standards. The proposals also will make certain editorial changes to the Exchange's rules regarding the use of over-the-counter securities to collateralize an escrow receipt, in order to conform that language with the phrasing used in OCC's rules. After careful review of the operation of the pilot program, the Commission has concluded that the revised MIOER should help provide a safe and efficient mechanism by which index call options can be written in a cash account. As set forth in more detail in its order approving the pilot procedures, 20 the Commission believes that the range of collateral permitted thereunder should provide market participants with greater flexibility, prevent settlement delays and eliminate many of the problems encountered under the original MIOER program. To the extent that the revised escrow receipt is a cost-effective means for institutions restricted to cash account transactions to manage portfolio risk, its implementation on a permanent basis should encourage broader participation in the index options market, thereby adding depth and liquidity to that market. 20 See pilot approval order, supra, note 4.
