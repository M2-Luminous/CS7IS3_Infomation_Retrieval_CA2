"A reasonable compromise with Russia not only meets the interests of Latvia but is of importance for Europe as well," he said. On Thursday the Sejm members discussed the condition set by the Russian side during the discussion on the troop pullout and concerning a strategic facility, the radar at Skrunda. Russia agrees to withdraw troops by August 31 if the radar remains operational for another five years and two months and if social guarantees for the military pensioners and members of their families are ensured. Otherwise, troops will be withdrawn according to the time-table drawn up by Russia, said Sergey Zotov, leader of the Russian delegation at the negotiations. Sejm members' opinions over the issue diverged and they decided to examine it once again soon.
