The most important idea propounded in the work is to continue to deepen the work of establishing the monolithic ideological system of the party and make the unity and cohesion of the party and the revolutionary ranks more unbreakable. In the work, the dear leader expounded that to establish the monolithic ideological system of the party is a fundamental principle of building a working-class party and a permanent work which all the party organisations should always regard as its cardinal task. And he laid down questions of principle arising in further deepening the work of establishing the monolithic ideological system of the party. He also indicated tasks and ways of closely rallying all the party members, cadres and working people around the party and the leader by intensifying the work with the people and stressed the need to strengthen party leadership over socialist economic construction. The work emphatically urges all the officials to learn from the great leader's work method, which requires them to go down to the lower units constantly and share sweets and bitters with the masses, and thoroughly apply it to practice. Recalling that the validity and vitality of the idea, theory and policies laid down in the work have been fully proved in the revolutionary practice in the past, the author of the article says: The work of establishing the monolithic ideological system of the party has been further deepened, the fighting capacity and leading role of the party have increased remarkably and the singlehearted unity of the revolutionary ranks with the illustrious leader at the centre has been consolidated further still in keeping with the requirements of the developing revolution in which the modelling of the whole society on the chuche idea has developed to a new, higher stage.
