Professor Naomi Chazan, a member of the delegation, told Emeka Onwachukwu that one of the reasons for their visit was to (?intimate) the Nigerian Government on the peace process in the Middle East. [Begin recording] [Chazan] I and my delegation were sent by the foreign minister of Israel, Mr. Shim'on Peres, to the government of Nigeria to do two things: Number one, to explain the progress on the peace process, autonomy for the Palestinians, and also on the subject of negotiations with Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon; and number two, to bring together Israel and Nigeria more closely to examine possibilities for cooperation and for mutual enrichment. [Onwachukwu] Now, you have just alluded to the fact that your trip here is to acquaint Nigerians of what has been going on in respect of the peace process between the PLO and the Israeli Government. Now, what is the present situation about the negotiations? [Chazan] There has been a fair amount of progress in the last few weeks. About two weeks ago, Israel and the PLO initialed the Cairo Agreement, which deals with most of the security issues that had been outstanding, and in the past two weeks, there has been substantial progress on almost all other things in our negotiations with the Palestinians. We anticipate if the progress continues, as it has in recent weeks, then within one month to six weeks' time, we will begin implementation of the Gaza-Jericho withdrawal. [end recording]
