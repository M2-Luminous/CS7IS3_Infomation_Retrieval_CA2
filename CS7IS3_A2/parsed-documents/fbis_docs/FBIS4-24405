Xu Yongfu, a senior research fellow in the Hong Kong-Macao regional office of the Bank of China, said the decision to renew China's MFN trade status and delink human rights from trade issues was a pragmatic and wise option. He said that the decision dispelled fears over the Sino-U.S. trade development and laid a foundation for the trade growth between China and the United States and in the world trade as a whole. Edward Leung, chief economist of Hong Kong Trade Development Council, said Clinton's announcement to delink human rights from trade issues provided a basis for the smooth trade development between the two countries and is conducive to China's reentry into the GATT. As a large number of Hong Kong manufacturers have opened plants in southern China and shipped their products to the United States, renewal of China's MFN trade status will make owners of these plants at ease and help increase the volume of re-export. Benny Chiu, research manager of the China Service Ltd. of the Hong Hong Bank, said that Clinton's decision will benefit both the United States, a major supplier of funds to China, and China, a big market for U.S. investors.
