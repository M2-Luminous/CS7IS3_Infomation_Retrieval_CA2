The president made the remark here monday in his meeting with visiting Kazakh premier, Sergey Tereshchenko. He described as positive the political will existing in both the countries for strengthening of mutual cooperation and called for putting into practice the agreements reached between Tehran and Almaty. The president referred to the setting up of a free trade zone at the port city of Bandar Anzali, and said this would greatly strengthen Kazakhstan's links with Iran's Caspian provinces of Gilan and Mazandaran by facilitating trade exchanges and making the private sectors of the two countries more involved. The decision to declare Bandar Anzali as free trade zone was taken yesterday at the end of the president's inspection tour of Gilan Province. The southern shores of the oblong Caspian, the world's largest inland sea, are hemmed in by Iran, while the northern and part of the northeastern shores forms the Kazakhstan coastline. The other three countries with access to Caspian waters are the Russian Federation on the northwest, the Azerbaijan Republic on the southwest and Turkmenistan on the southeast. Tereshchenko who arrived in Tehran on Saturday, submitted Rafsanjani a message from Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev and said Tehran-Almaty ties had further expanded especially after Nazarbayev's visit to Iran. He said Iran's valuable experiences in establishing industries and re-activating factories was very useful for his country. Raising the volume of Tehran-Almaty wheat and coal exchanges in the long-term, Kazakhstan's purchase of copper and fire-resistant material from Iran, joint production of engine oil and expanding road, rail, shipping and air transportation between the two countries were among the topics Tereshchenko discussed with Iranian officials.
