With no way found to raise the consumption tax in an effort to secure financial resources to make up for a fiscal shortfall resulting from the income tax reduction, it has become difficult for the Japanese Government to announce plans for a full-fledged income tax reduction which the U.S. Government has sought prior to Japan-U.S. summit talks scheduled for July. The Japanese Government is committed to mapping out another set of measures to open up the Japanese market in June, but it will have nothing to present to the U.S. Government unless it decides how to reform the current tax system. The Japanese Government plans to hold informal consultations with the U.S. Government to discuss ways to resume the stalled framework talks right after the May holidays, but some government officials are speaking of difficulty in holding the informal consultations. At his recent meeting with Prime Minister Hata (then deputy prime minister and foreign minister), U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor set three conditions for resuming the stalled framework talks which include: 1) macroeconomic policy; 2) agreement between the two countries on holding talks to discuss ways to expand Japan's imports; and 3) establishment of objective criteria. The backbone of the macroeconomic policy is the continued income tax reduction, and at a 24 April meeting between the Japanese and U.S. finance ministers, Japan explained to the United States that Japan would continue the income tax reduction after 1995. The Japanese Government is examining a sweeping reform of the current tax system to cut the income tax by lowering the maximum tax rate and to raise the consumption tax in order to secure financial resources to make up for a fiscal shortfall from cuts in the income tax. Many government officials take the view that the SDPJ will oppose any attempt to raise the consumption tax since it broke away from the coalition (according to the Finance Ministry). This development will make it hard for the Japanese Government to explain to the U.S. Government in June that it intends to seek long-term cuts in the income tax. The government made clear that it would decide how to reform the current tax system in June when it announced a package of external economic measures in late March, but there is a high possibility that if the Hata government remains a minority in the Diet, it will be unable to decide on the second package of external economic measures. The Hata government would find it difficult to announce any new policies concerning deregulation and the expansion of government procurement. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry points out that "it would be difficult to resume the stalled framework talks unless Japan presents the United States with its macroeconomic policy." The Japanese Government has studied the possibility of sending a vice minister to Washington to present Japan's responses to the three conditions laid down by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor. The Japanese Government, however, would be unable to present the U.S. Government with concrete plans for tax cuts and the study of how the Japanese Government should respond to the two remaining conditions, including the establishment of objective criteria, has been delayed, clouding prospects for sending the vice minister to Washington. The Finance Ministry takes the view that the "U.S. Government will not make rash moves to resume the stalled framework talks because of its need to watch how Japan's political situation will develop." Things are not likely to go according to the Japanese Government's scenario, which aims to reach an agreement with the U.S. Government on the resumption of the stalled framework talks prior to the July Japan-U.S. summit talks.
