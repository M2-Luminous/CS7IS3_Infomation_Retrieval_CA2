[Words indistinct] out a "primary framework" for resolving the three issues at hand, said negotiators from the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), the two non-official organizations authorized by Taipei and the mainland to handle cross-strait exchanges. The three issues are the repatriation of mainland hijackers, the repatriation of illegal mainland immigrants, and cross-strait fishing disputes. SEF Vice Chairman Chiao Jen-ho and ARATS vice chairman Tang Shubei at the end of their Beijing talks in February claimed to have reached a "consensus" on the issues and hoped that draft agreements would be signed at the current round of talks. According to Taipei negotiators, Beijing is reluctant to pay the costs of repatriating the illegal mainland immigrants and recompensing Taipei for their stay in Taiwan -- a cost the Taiwan side has estimated to be NT$1 [new Taiwan dollars] billion (about U.S.$38 million). In addition, the mainland has disagreed with Taiwan's suggested wording of the draft agreement on the repatriation of hijackers: "Neither side has to return a hijacker who is a citizen of that country." Since last April, 11 mainland passenger planes have been hijacked to Taiwan. In Taipei, the Mainland Affairs Council [MAC] said the mainland side was to blame for the lack of progress during Friday's talks. "The mainland side is even tougher than before," MAC spokesman Kao Kung- lien said.
