This shows that the world after 50 years of the event has not been genuinely tranquil. Clinton's conversation with the reporters was still two sided. On the one hand, he said sanctions should be imposed on the DPRK and, on the other hand, he said that there was still time for the DPRK to change its course. Therefore, on the dispute over the DPRK nuclear issue, he has not yet fully disclosed his stand. Before Clinton left Washington for Western Europe, the United States, the ROK, and Japan held a meeting of senior officials and adopted two resolutions. One was that the UN Security Council would be first invited to discuss the issue of sanctions against the DPRK and the other was that if the council failed to adopt any sanctions after discussion, the United States, the ROK, and Japan would impose sanctions by themselves. It can thus be seen that the United States was not very sure of the results of the Security Council discussion. When speaking to reporters in the White House, although Clinton indicated that China and Russia, permanent members of the Security Council, were in support of the U.S. stand, this was not so as far as estimates of the international community were concerned. Although Russian President Boris Yeltsin stated that he agreed with the U.S. stand on the whole, he still added: Even if sanctions are really imposed, they will not have any great effect. So far Beijing has not made any official indications about how it will handle the issue. China has not made any remarks, agreeing or disagreeing, on the imposition of sanctions against the DPRK, let alone mentioning the issue of a veto. According to reports from foreign new agencies, Beijing has indicated its support for Russia's proposal of convening an international conference. If this is true, it means that China is obviously unwilling to take a stand in the Security Council on the issue of sanctions against the DPRK, but hopes for another way of handling the issue. Nevertheless, the United States indicated that now was not the time to convene an international conference because the issue should be first handled by the United Nations. In fact, even though the United States, the ROK, and Japan have already made common resolutions, still there are differing views among themselves. In the last two days, ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu has carried out activities in the United Nations and held talks with the Chinese ambassador to the United Nations, Li Daoyu. Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa will also visit China to discuss the DPRK issue. All these show that there is still some gap [biao xian 5903 3807] among the three countries in terms of agreement. Pyongyang indicated: If the United Nations does adopt any sanctions, this will be an act of war. This remark was in sharp contrast to the 50th anniversary of the landings of the Allied forces in Normandy, which was held yesterday. Now let us see what new developments will take place this week.
