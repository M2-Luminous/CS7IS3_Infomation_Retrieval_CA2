FBIS3-47503 "dreas009_c_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-009 Document Type:Daily Report 13 Jan 1994 North Korea Kim Yong-sam's Meeting With Former Presidents Viewed SK1301052094 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0503 GMT 13 Jan 94 SK1301052094 Pyongyang KCNA Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Pyongyang, January 13 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Yong- sam, a puppet, a few days ago invited the traitors Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u, dictators of the "Fifth and Sixth Republics", to "Chongwadae" [presidential office] and solicited their "active cooperation". And the two military dictators expressed "thanks" for his "magnanimity" and accepted the request. The fact that the traitor Kim Yong-sam kissed the dictators of the "Fifth and Sixth Republics" at the beginning of the new year bespeaks that he chose to openly collude with his predecessors, say press commentaries here today. A news analyst of NODONG SINMUN says: Kim Yong-sam the puppet is a born fascist and traitor. That is why he, while talking about "liquidation of the past" and "reforms", has defended and protected the chief culprits in the Kwangju massacre and is now taking the road of treachery, fascism, confrontation and war by succeeding to the military dictatorial system of the "Fifth and Sixth Republics" without any reform. It is crystal clear that the traitor Kim Yong-sam who came to power through his political marriage to the dictators of the "Fifth and Sixth Republics" can neither part with them nor enforce reforms in South Korean society. The puppet Kim Yong-sam is intending to find a way out in openly joining hands with the military dictators of the "Fifth and Sixth Republics" who have been forsaken by the people, but it is a foolish dream. A commentary of MINJU CHOSON says the traitor Kim who has been driven to a tight corner, isolated from and rejected by the people at home and abroad, is trying to prolong his remaining days at any cost with the help of the successive military fascist dictators. This is the last-ditch effort of the doomed, notes the commentary.
