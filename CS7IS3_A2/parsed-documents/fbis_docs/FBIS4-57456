[Lacalle] The decision to support departmental constitutional reform, because this is a reform of the departmental governments, has a scope for us that surpasses being a mere episode of the reform, and it is an endeavor to get the country moving toward a harmony that will help it achieve electoral freedom. The last century opened with a struggle among us for electoral freedom, something essential for the National Party. The 1870, 1897, and 1904 revolutions were not carried out in order to take power, to overthrow the Colorado government; they were carried out to obtain voting guarantees. We wanted to vote freely and with guarantees. This was being achieved until 1925 when the Election Law that was implemented by the Electoral Court closed the cycle for seeking voting guarantees. We can say without making a mistake that since 1925 we have had complete voting guarantees and someone has said, not without reason, that the revolution's objectives were obtained in 1925. Then, another stage begins. We have the profuse legislation on the Lema Law [intra-party tickets], or Lema Laws because there is more than one, which gives us our current system. We then go from the one and only list and ticket of the 1951 Constitution to departmental separation but within the same lema in the 1966 reform. Now this new reform is being attempted. Now the end of the century finds us facing a situation in which it is notorious that the voter does not have full freedom. [EL PAIS] Why do you say this? [Lacalle] Because the simultaneous double vote is in a certain sense a restriction of the popular will; because the citizen in legal fiction says he votes for a certain party and that within this party he prefers a certain candidate, but it is the party that he really prefers. Why is it that we talk about electoral freedom when departmental reform comes up for discussion? Because we give the voter another option. The voter can combine his departmental option with his national option; in other words, there is more freedom, there are more options. Thus, the voter will combine one party with another one by taking into consideration the management ability more than party loyalty. We believe this option within the constitutional reform is the most adequate one at this time because at this time we begin to commit our influence and political force as soon as the new government is installed to begin a campaign for achieving greater freedom. We have observed that people have moved from one party to another, and we believe that mechanisms must be sought that will allow the voter to vote for his party at one level and for the government at another. It is also true that we propose using some of the points contained in the last frustrated reform to help us with our commitment. [EL PAIS] In order to make it clear for the people. A constitutional reform is going to be voted on in November and if it is successful your idea will go into effect at that time? [Lacalle] Of course. Of course. The two systems must be voted for simultaneously. For the system that is being proposed and for the current system. [EL PAIS] The same as in the 1971 elections? [Lacalle] Yes, exactly.
