He said the beastly act of spraying bullets on a fasting people prostrating in the safety of the house of God is a very ugly and shameful picture further revealing the savage and shameful nature of the Zionists. If there was a sufficiently enlightened and healthy conscience in the world the incident could have shaken the world into ending its policy of support for the Zionist regime. Addressing a gathering of educational officers today Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani criticized the stance of the UN Security Council and the sad silence of international organizations, and he blamed America and its allies for their support for Israel. He said: If the world had correct education and moral purification such incidents would not have happened, or even if they had they would have caused a wave of protest, anger, and disgust across the effective and decisionmaking organizations of the world.
