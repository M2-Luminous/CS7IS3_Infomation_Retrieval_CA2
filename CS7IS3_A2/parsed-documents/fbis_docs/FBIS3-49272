Presidents Tudjman and Izetbegovic, Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic, Mile Akmadzic, foreign minister of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, and adviser Martic and others are continuing their talks on a cease-fire, the delineation of borders, access to the sea at Ploce, and mutual Croat-Muslim relations in the future. The details of the Croatian text -- in which Zagreb, we have learned from well-informed sources, is seeking 17.5 percent of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina for the Croats in the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna and is not allowing the Muslims in any way to take control of Neum -- have not been made public. Izetbegovic last night agreed in principle to the Croat proposal that offers peace, but the Muslims are very tough when it comes to the details. It seems that the Muslims have objections regarding Mostar; in central Bosnia they are seeking to obtain virtually everything for themselves, and access to the sea is unresolved as far as they are concerned.
