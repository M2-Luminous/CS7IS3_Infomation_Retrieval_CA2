After three years of war, but also after the opening up to a multiparty system, the Arusha agreements accepted by all the Rwandan protagonists, had laid the foundations for a fairer distribution of power, for a peaceful transition to democratic elections. The United Nations, which is now so reluctant to be involved on multiple fronts, had agreed, at Belgium's insistence, to sponsor the peace process. In Burundi, exemplary democratic elections had brought to power FRODEBU [Burundi Democratic Front] headed by President Ndadaye, a moderate. In both cases, the change was dramatically interrupted despite the fact that peaceful transitional structures existed and that a "civilian society" -- free press, human rights defense associations -- were becoming increasingly active. What therefore happened to bring about the failure of reforms and national reconciliations amid bloodshed? In both cases, we have witnessed the obstinacy of the ruling political class, which refused to give up or share power. For the Burundian Army, or at least for the most radical of its officers, there was no question of seeing a Hutu become president. In Rwanda, in President Habyarimana's entourage, a group of political racketeers who benefited more from war than from peace grew up, and they did not intend to share the "national cake" with other regional or ethnic groups and were even more intransigent than the defunct president himself. In addition to these internal obstacles, the external context is not very favorable to democracy: In Uganda, President Museveni is the determined opponent of a multiparty system which he regards as a source of tribal struggles. Is there any need to recall the interminable crisis which has paralyzed neighboring Zaire, making it impossible to implement the resolutions of the national conference? Paradoxically, (but is it really unintentional paradox?) the violent chaos which currently reigns in Rwanda is strengthening the position of the region's "strong men" who are becoming synonymous with stability. The hopes of the nineties have misfired in Africa, and, in many countries on the continent, democracy has been wiped out, less because of a so-called immaturity on the part of the peoples than because of the refusal of the leadership classes to bow to the verdict of the polls or majority rule. It is also because of the faintheartedness of the "Western friends" who were arguing for change but without having the courage to effectively support those who believed in their democratic statements. The power vacuum, the political crisis in these two African great lakes countries are now forcing the Western countries, and more especially Belgium, the former colonial power and the leader in terms of cooperation, to face their responsibilities. Brussels, in the framework of the United Nations, has already started to play a positive role in Rwanda, but it has tragically abandoned the Burundian democrats, turning a deaf ear to the appeals from Bujumbura at a time when a rapid intervention would have saved thousands of civilians, Hutus and Tutsis. It is true that Belgium was not stingy in its humanitarian assistance after the event. Today, the same choices face us, even more urgently than before. First, because there is no guarantee that the lives of expatriates will not be threatened in the general conflagration. Finally because, especially in Rwanda, the opposition leaders, the human rights campaigners, and priests are being killed or imprisoned, the United Nations' authority is being flouted, and thousands of human lives are in danger. The duty of humanitarian intervention is stronger than ever. For the sake of democracy, but primarily for the sake of human solidarity toward peoples in danger.
