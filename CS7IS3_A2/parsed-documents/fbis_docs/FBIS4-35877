[Begin Peres recording] I did not send any letter to Yasir 'Arafat. I sent a letter to the Norwegian foreign minister in response to his letter to me. My letter was not even addressed top secret and contained my remarks to the Knesset. The reason for my action was our insistence that the Palestinian civilian authority be based in Jericho and not in Jerusalem. I said we do not want to harm the spiritual, cultural, medical institutions in Jerusalem, but that the authority would deal only with Jericho. I would like to remind you that the negotiations almost blew up over the Jericho issue because of our insistence that the autonomy's center would be in Jericho. [end recording]
