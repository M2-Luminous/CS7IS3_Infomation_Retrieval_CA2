[Reporter Vicente Briceno] Gen. Montero Revette has made the announcement from Miraflores Palace, disclosing the decision by the president with whom he met for approximately three hours to review the military promotions that will be submitted to Congress in the coming days. Through the Senate's Committee of Defense, Congress will study the appropriate files. Montero has reported the approval of the following promotions: 30 brigade generals, 10 of which are in the Army, six in the Air Force, eight in the National Guard, and six Navy rear admirals. Also up for promotion are 120 colonels, broken down as follows: 40 in the Army, 25 in the aviation division, 35 in the National Guard, and 20 ship of the line captains in the Navy. As the minister explained, the promotions to the ranks of vice admirals and division general were left pending for next week because President Rafael Caldera was unable to review them. Montero has said that based on a decision by the president, a group of officers from the four branches who participated in the 1992 coup attempts will also be promoted on that same date. [Begin Montero recording] These officers, primarily from the Army, rejoined the force more than two years ago and are working in troop commands in different posts of the organization. They have the same rights and duties of other officers. For that reason, those entitled to a promotion are evaluated. He may or may not be promoted, but not due to the coup attempts, because that is over for us.
