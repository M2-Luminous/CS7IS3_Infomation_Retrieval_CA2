Never Pay Cash in America"] [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The FBI has investigated the Ames case for two years. He was finally tracked down last October when Ames took time off to visit his mother-in-law in Bogota. It transpired, however, that Ames' mother-in-law lives in the United States, while instead of Bogota her son-in-law went to Caracas to meet a contact. It was also known that in buying a house in Arlington, Virginia, Ames paid cash. [passage omitted] The Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS] refused to comment on the incident. In his time, responding to a question from General Volkogonov, who sought to justify the famous spy Alger Hiss, FIS director Yevgeniy Primakov said: "The Foreign Intelligence Service gives no information about who is or is not a spy." This time it has done exactly the same. According to an FIS press service official, all special services of the world act like this in such circumstances. Meanwhile, FIS press service chief Yuriy Kobaladze in an interview with INTERFAX made a statement which can be seen as indirect confirmation. Intelligence, he said, even in a changing world, remains intelligence, with its own specific means and interests. Grigoriy Karasin, Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry Information and Press Department director, said in a telephone conversation that concerning the report on the Ames case provided by the State Department, Moscow has some questions that should be clarified through direct contacts between the special services. "We believe," Karasin said, "that special services can straighten things out especially since their cooperation has been developing successfully." U.S. and Russian special services are, indeed, cooperating. One such sphere of cooperation is fighting drug trafficking. Lately Ames' responsibility in the CIA has been precisely in this area. Apparently the contact whom Ames met in Caracas used the same "cover."
