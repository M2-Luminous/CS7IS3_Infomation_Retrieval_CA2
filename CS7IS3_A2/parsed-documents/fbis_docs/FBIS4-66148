[passage omitted] Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, addressing fellow ministers, welcomed the planned pact, but warned it might conflict with the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). Accords reached at the roundtables will be enshrined in a Stability Pact which could be signed early in 1995 and registered with the CSCE. [passage omitted] French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe denied at a press conference that the stability conference was duplicating existing organisations such as the CSCE. The stability conference was "filling a vacuum" and was "not a CSCE mark-2, nor another Council of Europe nor a Western European Union," Juppe said. The foreign minister said that the CSCE had not undertaken any action on behalf of the Hungarian minorities, for example, and that it was the special interest of the EU to sponsor efforts to solve the problems of future members. Juppe hailed the conference as "a great success," but insisted that "the essential remains to be done" in preparing accords to be slotted into the Stability Pact. He said the conference would disappear "within a year" when the pact was inaugurated. One of 10 countries listed as a potential new member -- Slovenia -- was dropped in the final draft of potential new members, leaving Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. The move illustrated that some existing EU members also have minority problems. Officially Slovenia was removed because it has no association agreement with the EU, but Slovenian conference sources said the new Italian government had applied pressure on behalf of the 3,0O0-strong Slovenian minority in Italy agitating to recover their property in Slovenia. The conference turned down a plea by Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszensky for direct participation by 1.6 million Hungarian-speakers in Romania and 600,000 in Slovakia in its regional roundtable. Budapest is anxious to protect their rights to autonomy, notably in the cultural field, while the Romanian and Slovakian Governments are seeking Hungarian acceptance of the inviolability of existing borders. Kozyrev insisted the focus should be "to concentrate on specific steps to improve interethnic relations and to ensure the rights of national minorities. This is especially necessary for the three Baltic states -- Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania," he added. He said discussion of border and minority issues "should take place exclusively in the framework established by CSCE documents." But the tone of the conference was set on Thursday by Balladur and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. In a joint opinion column in the daily LE MONDE, the two leaders proposed that the would-be EU members be invited to attend Union summit meetings.
