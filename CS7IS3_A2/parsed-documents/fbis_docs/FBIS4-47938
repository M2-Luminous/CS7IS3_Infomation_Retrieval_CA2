FBIS4-47938 "drafr088_c_94011" FBIS-AFR-94-088 Daily Report 5 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA ANC's Natal Leader Comments ANC's Natal Leader Comments MB0505203694 London BBC World Service in English 1705 GMT 5 May 94 MB0505203694 London BBC World Service English BFN [From the "Focus on Africa" program] [Text] An almost hotly disputed region in the elections was KwaZulu-Natal. The ANC accused the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] of all sorts of trickery, including stuffing ballot boxes and setting up pirate polling stations. Inkatha counter-accused the ANC of electoral skullduggery. In spite of that it looks as though the IFP will be declared the winners in the region. The ANC's president, Nelson Mandela, says the elections were free and fair and that the KwaZulu problem should not be allowed to overshadow that. My colleague Jeremy Skeet talked to the ANC Chief in Natal Harry Gwala, and asked him what he would do if Inkatha was declared the winner. [Begin recording] [Gwala] If they are declared winners, and with our protest -- we are making a fresh start. First time we go for democratic elections in this country. We will protest, but we won't seek to upset the apple cart. I am speaking for the leadership now, but the leadership will have a problem here, and then there is a serious problem. It may not be able to contain the masses on the ground. [Skeet] But what is your message to the comrades going to be? [Gwala] My message is not to my comrades. My message is to those who have been conducting the elections, that think of the consequences of an announcement you may make, because it may set things ablaze. We don't want that sort of thing to happen. My message is that you can even exclude Natal for the time being. Hold celebrations of whatever you can, get the thing properly sorted out before you make any announcements. [Skeet] Don't you think the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] is in a difficult position? You have said stop the announcement, but the Inkatha would say if we don't win this there is also going to be trouble. [Gwala] No, they don't have to announce. They have got to take the matter to the government and wait for a political decision. [Skeet] So, you think that South Africa's first elections should be decided on a political level? [Gwala] If they could not be decided on the ballot boxes, then we could have done something else, but here we are satisfied that there were irregularities here and there -- I am talking about other provinces now -- but you are not talking of irregularities in Natal. We talking of downright corruption. [end recording]
