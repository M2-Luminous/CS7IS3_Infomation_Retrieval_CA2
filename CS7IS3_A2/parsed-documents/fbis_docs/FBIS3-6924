Rolf Hagel, chairman of the Workers' Party-Communists of Sweden, in a statement March 10 said the South Korean authorities keep An Hak-sop, an old man, behind bars for more than 40 years on the charge of being a "spy" of North Korea merely because he refused to recant his belief in communism. They take to prison and put to torture not only communists but many figures who call for a peaceful reunification of Korea and democratization of society, by invoking the "National Security Law", he noted. He demanded that the South Korean authorities abolish the "National Security Law" immediately, release unconditionally all the unconverted long-term prisoners including An Hak-sop now suffering in prison and repatriate Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan. Nzemba Yangana, chief of the Zairean youth group for the study of the chuche idea, in a statement March 11 said that the struggle of An Hak-sop, who is an old man, for the reunification of the country cannot be a "crime" but a proud patriotic deed of a righteous son of the nation. He demanded that the South Korean authorities release An Hak-sop at once, scrap immediately the "National Security Law", an obstacle to reunification, and unconditionally release all the unconverted long-term prisoners who have devoted their all to the reunification of the country. The Burundi-Korea Friendship Association in a letter to the South Korean authority on March 9 strongly urged the unconditional and immediate release of An Hak-sop and the prompt abolition of the "National Security Law".
