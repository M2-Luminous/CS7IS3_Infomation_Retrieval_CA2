"Many of the developing countries' requirements have not been met and the world must continue to address the remaining issues," said Chen Yuan, deputy governor of China's central bank, the People's Bank of China. Speaking at the 50th meeting of the group of 24 ministers, part of the spring meeting of the World Bank and the IMF, Chen said much work remained to be done to implement the concluded trade agreements. Chen stressed that while trade protectionism in the developed countries has increased rather than decreased, the developing countries have adopted measures to liberalize trade and open up domestic markets. "The developed countries should further open their markets and eliminate various forms of subsidies as well as non-trade barriers," Chen said. "We earnestly oppose the use of so-called social barriers on part of developed countries as an excuse to restrict the exports of developing countries," he stressed.
