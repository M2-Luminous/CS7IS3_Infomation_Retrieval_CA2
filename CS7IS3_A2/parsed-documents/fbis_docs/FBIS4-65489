Mr Sutherland, whose leadership at GATT was instrumental in securing the Uruguay Round world trade liberalisation deal, recently said he would be stepping down at the end of the year. "If I was asked the question about being a candidate (for the Commission presidency) by a member state then I would have to give it serious consideration," Mr Sutherland said. He told RTE, Irish television, that "it's an entirely hypothetical situation." But he stressed twice that "it's a very important position for Ireland, for Europe and the world." Mr Sutherland's candidacy opens up a field which includes Mr Ruud Lubbers, the outgoing Dutch prime minister, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian premier, and Sir Leon Brittan, the senior British commissioner in charge of the EU's [European Union] external economic relations. The Irishman, a successful competition commissioner in Brussels in 1984-88, is a plausible if long-shot compromise. But he must pick up endorsements from leading member states -- particularly Germany -- and win the support of Dublin. The EU's 12 heads of government are expected to decide on Mr Delors' successor at their summit in Corfu on June 24-25. It is understood that of the larger member states, only Spain has so far sounded out Mr Sutherland. The GATT chief has a Spanish wife, and a Commission president from Ireland, which is a member of the "Cohesion" group of the four poorest member states including Spain, Portugal and Greece, would be a useful ally for Madrid. Mr Lubbers remains the front-runner, but has less than warm relations with Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Mr Kohl is said by some leading EU officials to favour Mr Dehaene, who could also get backing from Paris. Sir Leon is hampered by being from the UK, which has opt-outs from the Maastricht Treaty.
