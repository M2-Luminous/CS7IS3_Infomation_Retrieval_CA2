All streets that lead to the square have been given the names of various medieval Croatian rulers. Thus, the part of Rudjer Boskovic Street that leads to the square in question was renamed King Drzislav Street. Even Mestrovic's pavilion, built immediately prior to the war (in 1990 it was not necessary to emphasize particularly which war was being referred to), and conceived as a lasting display of modern art, which at the time of the NDH [Independent State of Croatia] was converted into a mosque, and after the war into the Museum of the Revolution of the People of Croatia, must now become a pantheon-mausoleum for (future?) Croatian rulers. When this decision of the City Assembly was announced, protests by citizens took place en masse and petitions were written, and on 22 September 1990 a large number of Zagreb residents gathered (on that day alone 2,371 people signed a petition of protest against changing the name) in front of Mestrovic's pavilion, encircling the whole pavilion with candles as a sign of remembrance of the victims of fascism and as a sign of protest against the decision to change the name of the square. The mayor at that time, Boris Buzancic, informed the president of the republic about the dissatisfaction of part of the citizens with the decision to rename the Square of the Victims of Fascism, but the president was unyielding in his conviction of the need for the renaming. He gave up the idea of the pantheon and a version of the Square of Croatian rulers, but on the afternoon of 27 November 1990 the plates with the name Square of the Victims of Fascism were removed and replaced with new ones. In stealth, almost secretly, and, as Srdjan Dvornik will say in an appropriate article, "as if suitable for an unworthy act." It reminded many people of the removal of the monument to Ban Jelacic, with which another government "announced with the support of a plebescite that everything was starting anew with it." Officially, it has been the Square of Croatian Greats since then; unofficially, the Square of the Victims of Fascism for many residents of Zagreb. A Council for Action on the Square of Victims of Fascism has been founded, which writes petitions, gathers signatures, and organizes speaker's platforms, is issuing the booklet Square of Victims of Fascism in Zagreb. Among the numerous arguments as to why the name Square of the Victims of Fascism should be restored, the following are repeated: --that this name is a reminder of the thousands of Zagreb antifascists who did that which was most worthy in the history of the people--oppose darkness and tyranny when the darkness seemed impenetrable and the tyranny undefeatable; --that this name is a reminder of the thousands of citizens of Zagreb and citizens of Croatia, victims of fascism, who were not antifascist, only of another nation, another faith, or another race; --that right on that square during the NDH, there were Ustashi and Gestapo prisons, through which thousands of victims of fascism passed; --that countries of today's Europe, when they speak of the vision of a Europe of prosperity, do not call on their totalitarian, nation-building regimes from the past, but on the values that have always been the hope of the oppressed and those deprived of rights--freedom and the worth of the individual, the universality of human rights, and tolerance of differences. The president of the Republic has answered all the arguments and petitions cited: "The restoration of the name Square of Victims of Fascism is sought by political dilettantes and exhibitionists." (VJESNIK, April 1991) Since 9 May 1991, the Council for Action on the Square of the Victims of Fascism has organized each year, at 1800 hours, a gathering of citizens as a sign of observance of the Day of Europe-Day of Victory. On that day the demand for the restoration of the name Square of the Victims of Fascism is always repeated. This name has become not only a symbol of arrogance and the devastation that the ruling group caused during the antifascist part of Croatian history, but also that narrow watershed that can determine if a country wishes to move toward an appropriate well-being for its citizens oriented to administrative organization, or ends in totalitarianism and repression. Naturally, the existence (or restoration) of the name Square of the Victims of Fascism is not a sure guarantee even of this, but for this reason a national government that removes names of streets and squares of victims of fascism, and puts up names of fascist war criminals, has oriented itself quite certainly to the trash heap of history. The way through Gospic, Pakracka Poljana, Ahmic, the Mostar stadium.... Croatia has earned something quite a bit better than such nostalgic NDH people, who cannot restore the name Square of the Victims of Fascism, but who can, to the detriment and shame of Croatia, introduce the kuna as Croatian currency. The best that this government can do for Croatia is to lose democratically organized elections and withdraw, in a democracy of customary consequence. Restoration of the name Square of the Victims of Fascism is conditional on a change in the existing government. Or, as it could be said with a little optimism as a paraphrase of a famous sentence: "Next year on the Square of the Victims of Fascism!"
