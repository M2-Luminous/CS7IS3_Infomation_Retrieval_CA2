The detectors are comprised of 50 GaAs quantum wells and Al[.sub]0.28[/] Ga[.sub]0.72[/] As barriers. The detectors were fabricated by etching a 320-�m-diameter mesa. We have achieved a detector responsivity R[.sub]_n_[/] = 9.7 x 10[.sup]5[/] V/W and a high-detectivity at peak wavelength in excess of 1 x 10[.sup]11[/] cm-(Hz)[.sup]1/2[/]/W at 9.2 �m; device dark current is lower than 0.1 �A at an operating temperature of T = 77K.
