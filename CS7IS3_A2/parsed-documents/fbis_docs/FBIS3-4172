Chinese President Jiang Zemin reiterated the need for patience on all sides and added pressure should not be used, spokesman Shen Guofang told reporters after a summit meeting between the two leaders. Although there has been no breakthrough on easing tensions on the peninsula, Shen said, "China has its own diplomatic relations with the DPRK (North Korea), so the diplomatic channel between the two countries is open." "China has made contacts with all the parties directly concerned in the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and China hopes that all these parties express patience and constructive ideas," the spokesman said. It was one of the clearest public statements concerning China's involvement in the crisis over North Korea's refusal to allow international inspections at areas of two sites suspected of being part of a clandestine nuclear weapons program. North Korea again lashed out Sunday at what it calls U.S. imperialism. But Shen maintained, "We have made a due effort but China can only play a limited role." He said the issue should be resolved through dialogue between North Korea and its counterparts in South Korea, the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency. The two leaders did not discuss the proposed UN Security Council nonbinding presidential statement concerning the issue and raised Friday in New York, nor did they discuss the possibility of hostilities breaking out, Shen said. [sentence as received] Concerning the United Nations, he said China's Foreign Ministry's position is that "the rhetoric of such a presidential statement shall be constructive and shall contribute to the resumption of the three bilateral talks involving four parties." "Such talks are the only effective way to settle the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula," he said. When asked about the renewal of Team Spirit war exercises and the deployment of Patriot missiles to South Korea, Shen would only say China is opposed to "any actions detrimental to the deterioration of the situation on the Korean peninsula." In the talks with Jiang, Kim expressed his desire to see the issue solved through dialogue, without pressure and China would continue to play its role, Shen said. Kim, on the third day of a five-day trip to China, arrived in Beijing late Sunday and will hold talks with Chinese leaders Tuesday and Wednesday. Other than the nuclear issue, economic cooperation and trade have been high on Kim's agenda with bilateral trade growing to more than 9 billion dollars in 1993. Kim is the first South Korean president to go to China since former president No Tae-u visited one month after diplomatic relations were established in August 1992.
