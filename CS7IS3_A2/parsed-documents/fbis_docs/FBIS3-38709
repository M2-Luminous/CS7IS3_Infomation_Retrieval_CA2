Feeling mocked by [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary] Occhetto, they have spoiled the party. [LA REPUBBLICA] Mattioli, why this rupture? [Mattioli] It goes back a long way. Twenty days ago it became clear that this alliance would consist of well-behaved forces, the archaeologists of communism, this rascal [Rete Secretary] Orlando, and others. On Tuesday [1 February], before the joint signature, [Greens coordinator] Ripa di Meana repeated that our joining was conditional: freezing of the 12-trillion lire for the high-speed train, freezing of the 16 trillion of Anas, Montalto di Castro, Giota Tauro [power stations], freezing of the arms industry involved in the bribery and corruption scandals. Occhetto was reassuring: First sign, and then we will clarify the program. No way. The program can wait , but in the meantime they are pinning us against the wall on the question of candidates. [LA REPUBBLICA] Hence it is a problem of parliamentary seats? [Mattioli] We discovered yesterday that the number of safe seats reserved for us is well below the number that we have in parliament right now. While we are growing.... [LA REPUBBLICA] Safe in what sense? Is this first majority vote not new territory for everybody? [Mattioli] Studies and projections exist which allow us to forecast. I ask myself how one can ask electors to vote for people they do not know, for unknown party or cooperative movement officials, and not, instead, for the proponents of a civilized society. [LA REPUBBLICA] In other words, your quarrel with the PDS is that it is not giving you strong seats to guarantee the election of environmentalists? [Mattioli] The Democratic Alliance has lots of candidates. For two months it has worked for an electoral coalition. It has been screaming so loudly that in the end it gets everything. Our main talking partner is the PDS, it is they who deal out the cards. If it wants to win, it should renew itself in those areas where it has electoral control: in Emilia and Tuscany. [LA REPUBBLICA] Passing over its own candidates to allow yours through? [Mattioli] Let it choose. If it thinks that it can capture voters with the old faces (while people are so hungry for renewal that they even clutch hold of [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi, the man who celebrated the confirmation of Craxi's parliamentary immunity), let it go ahead. If it wants to win, it also needs us. I would recommend political generosity. [LA REPUBBLICA] In such uncertain elections? [Mattioli] I am not interested in what goes on in back rooms, I am fully aware that everyone is asking seats from the PDS. We do not want the moon, it is not Occhetto's job to look after us. It is we who are bringing votes in to the alliance. As for the others (Democratic Alliance [AD], Social Christians), I do not know. [LA REPUBBLICA] You are against the AD's request for the prime minister to be designated before the vote? [Mattioli] There is a time for everything. Let us first of all see who is backing the government. Let us win the elections. Then let us designate a leader. [Prime Minister] Ciampi again? Fine. Provided that, unlike his first government, he includes our demands in his program. [LA REPUBBLICA] And if you are ignored. [Mattioli] We are not unscrupulous tightrope walkers like [Pact for Italy leader] Segni. We will not move to the center, nor will we stand in the elections on our own. We can quit Parliament. In fact, it is by remaining outside that we won the fight on the major nuclear issues.
