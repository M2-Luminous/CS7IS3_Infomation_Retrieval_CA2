Its statement was read out in parliament by Deputy Speaker Vakhtang Rcheushvili in Tbilisi late on Tuesday. It speaks of a disastrous situation in the Abkhkazian region of Gal in which five other Georgian villages were razed to the ground following the return of Georgian refugees from western Georgia. In the last few days, as many as 60 people were shot dead and dozens of others taken hostage in that region. Over 800 houses were destroyed. The official said some 3,000 Georgians had been forced to flee for shelter to nearby woods and that Tbilisi was now trying to find a way of helping them. Ten other busloads of militants from the Northern Caucasus arrived in Abkhazia on Monday and Tuesday, the Deputy Speaker said referring to anonymous sources.
