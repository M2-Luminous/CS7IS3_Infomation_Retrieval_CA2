FR940817-2-00267 FR940817-2-00113 Risk assessment for neurotoxicity shares many common features with other noncancer toxicities such as developmental toxicity and immunotoxicity. As such, there are several generic assumptions that apply to all traditional, noncancer endpoint risk assessment procedures (Table 5&hyph;1). Table 5&hyph;1._ General Assumptions That Underlie Traditional Risk Assessments a,b 1‚ê£ 1. A threshold dose exists for noncancer endpoints. 2. NOAEL/LOAEL uncertainty- or safety-factor approaches are reasonable. 3. Variability in the toxic response to the chemical exposure is not due to a heterogeneous population response. 4. Average dose or total dose is a reasonable measure of exposure when doses are not equivalent in time, rate, or route of administration and the average (or total) dose is proportional to adverse effect. 5. Structure-activity correlations can be used to predict human toxicity. 6. The mechanism of action is the same at all doses for all species. aThis is not intended to be an exhaustive list. bModified from Sheehan et al., 1989.
