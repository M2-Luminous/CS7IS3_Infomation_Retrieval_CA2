A pool report on page 2 of Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT cites several members of the coalition. Construction and Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer says: "Al-Asad spoke about peace of the brave, but did not speak of security, settlements, or withdrawal. He bypassed all the road mines. I am very pleased, though I am missing a few answers." Knesset Member [MK] Avraham Poraz (Meretz) says: "We must not accept full withdrawal from the Golan, not even for full peace with Syria. Sovereignty may be handed over to Syria, but Israel has the right to protect its settlements." Minister Shim'on Shetrit is cited as saying: "The many expectations we had pinned on the Clinton-al-Asad meeting were not met, but the process made progress." A report by Pe'erli Shahar on pages 1 and 8 of Tel Aviv 'AL HAMISHMAR says that "Minister Ya'ir Tzaban yesterday said in response that his impression of the Geneva summit is that a real chance has been opened for a breakthrough that could change the entire Middle East. `It is reasonable to assume that the prime minister's formula, according to which the depth of withdrawal will equal the depth of peace, will soon stand the real test. Israel has a single supreme interest: That in the future, the Golan Heights never serve as a springboard for acts of aggression against Israel in general and the Galilee in particular. There is room for far reaching compromises on all the other issues.'" A Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ page A4 report by Gid'on Alon and Yerah Tal carries reactions by opposition members. Likud MK David Levi, former foreign minister, stated "Israel has maneuvered itself into a position in which the United States now coordinates its moves with Syria." According to him, this is a renewed recognition of Syria without it stopping its support for terrorists. Levi further says that "the coordination between the United States and Syria is not healthy for Israel." He adds: "Now, it will be almost impossible to prevent a U.S.-Syrian understanding about Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights." MK Moshe Qatzav, Likud Knesset faction chairman, says that President Clinton has turned al-Asad into "a key figure for making a comprehensive peace in the Middle East. According to him, from now on, Syria will have a right to veto peace arrangements with other Arab countries, without a single Syrian concession toward peace." The HA'ARETZ report also carries a reaction by the National Religious Party which says that "the government has created a situation in which foreign presidents determine the future of the state." Moledet Movement Chairman Rehav'am Ze'evi is cited as saying that "we do not need the ruler from across the ocean to manage our peace process." He adds that all al-Asad wants is to receive the Golan Heights back, and hopes that the government would sober up before we encounter hardships. A report by Shim'on Weiss and ITIM on page 2 of Tel Aviv DAVAR says that "Golan settlers reacted with satisfaction to what they termed `al-Asad's tough statements in Geneva.'" A statement they issued after the summit says: "Al-Asad's uncompromising statements shattered the illusion that an Israeli willingness to make concessions on the Golan will cause a moderation of the Syrian stands." The Golan settlers call on the government to adopt a policy which represents the "broad consensus among the Israeli public -- a policy of peace with the Golan."
