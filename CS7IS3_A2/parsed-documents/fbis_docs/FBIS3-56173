The purpose of our meeting was this: The process of forming the Azerbaijani Army has been going on in our republic for the last few months. And, you are witness to the fact that this process is going in the correct direction and positive results are being achieved. All these things contribute to the improvement of the Azerbaijani Republic's defenses and armed forces. [passage omitted] I can now happily note that the work of forming an army is speedily progressing in Azerbaijan, our military units are taking shape, our armed forces are working to create a regular army, and the measures we have taken have started giving results. The existing army units that are in the battle zones are befittingly displaying their military potential and power [words indistinct]. You are already aware of the changes taking place in recent months. You are all officers serving in the Azerbaijani army. The changes in recent months are obvious, these being: Disciplined military units are being created in our army, and many have already been created; and in those regions where they defend Azerbaijan on Azerbaijan's own territory, these units are giving a deserving reply to the Armenian armed forces, inflicting extremely heavy blows to them, and are reliably defending Azerbaijan's territory. The fighting and warfare is continuing. The war is being waged by the Armenian Armed Forces against the Azerbaijani Republic. I already said that a portion of our land has been occupied, and the Armenian Armed Forces still believe that by occupying more territory they can impose their conditions on Azerbaijan. If they previously had some chance of achieving this objective, now they no longer have a chance to do so. The Azerbaijan Army units facing the Armenian Armed Forces are reliably defending our lands all along the front. In so doing, they are undoubtedly waging battles and, as I already said, they are striking hard at the Armenian Armed Forces. You know that as a result of these battles some of the occupied Azerbaijani lands have returned to the control of the Azerbaijani Army -- that is, these lands have been recovered and the Azerbaijani Army units are now courageously trying to regain the rest of the occupied lands. These are bloody battles. Our Azerbaijan Republic's brave, heroic sons, our soldiers and officers in the army, all our fighters -- and I note this with satisfaction -- are fighting heroically, and they are being killed and wounded. But I want to note that henceforth superiority rests with the Azerbaijani Army in these battles, and enormous losses have been inflicted on the Armenian Armed Forces as a result of these heavy blows. They are suffering heavy losses in men and material every day and are being defeated. All these developments are exacerbating the situation on the borders. Again it is the Armenian side that is responsible for this exacerbation. You are aware that I have frequently stated that we want an end to the war, the fighting, and to hold peace talks. I have put forward proposals and made statements in this direction. However, the Armenian side is not in accord with this, and sometimes they put forward conditions that we undoubtedly cannot accept. Therefore, the Armenian side and the Armenian Armed Forces are culpable and responsible for all the ongoing fighting and the war, whereas we are fighting to defend our own lands and homeland. Inevitably, as the fighting intensified in this manner we felt a need for measures to further mobilize our forces. In this context, the Azerbaijani youth are now applying to serve in the army with high spirits. The situation is no longer the same as previously, when there were a considerable number of desertions from the army. Now, as you know, after my address to the nation on 2 November there was an upsurge in patriotism among all the citizens, especially the youth and those able to serve in the army. They are coming to the military commissariats and military units of their own volition to enter the fight and serve in the army. [passage omitted] Our officer cadres at the fronts are fittingly fulfilling their duties, and displaying excellent heroism. However, our officers should be even closer to the war front and should be active there and serve there. The Defense Ministry leadership informed me that the officers gathered here will be sent to the military units. Maybe most of the officers here are serving in the military commissariats and in army units deployed in Baku, but now you should continue your service in the military units at the battlefronts. [passage omitted] You are officers in the military service, which has an unbreakable law that says that any serviceman serves where he is assigned by the homeland and army command. You all know this, so you should comply with the orders you will receive today, and I hope that you will go to the fronts, serve in the army units there and thus enhance Azerbaijan's defensive potential and contribute your share to the defense and recovery of our lands. [passage omitted] I wish you success and hope that you will all go to the front and display heroism. That is all I have to say. God help you in your glorious work, and I hope that you will honorably discharge the orders given to you by the homeland. We are waging a war for the homeland, for the defense of our homeland, and you are active participants in this war for the homeland.
