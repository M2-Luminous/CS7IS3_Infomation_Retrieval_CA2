For a more complete statement of the facts and representations supporting the Department's decision to grant this exemption, refer to the notice of proposed exemption published on December 29, 1993 at 58 FR 68958. EFFECTIVE DATE: The effective date of this exemption is May 8, 1990. TEMPORARY NATURE OF EXEMPTION: This exemption will be effective for all transactions described herein which have been entered into by the Plans and the Companies since May 8, 1990. However, this exemption will not apply to any transactions which are entered into with the Companies after five years from the date on which this exemption is published in the Federal Register . NOTICE TO INTERESTED PERSONS: The applicant represents that it was unable to notify interested persons within the time period specified in the Federal Register notice published on December 29, 1993. The applicant states that all interested persons were notified, in the manner agreed upon between the applicant and the Department, by January 28, 1994. Interested persons were advised that they had until February 28, 1994 to comment on the proposed exemption. WRITTEN COMMENTS AND MODIFICATIONS: The applicant submitted a comment letter which requests that certain modifications be made to the notice of proposed exemption (the Proposal). The applicant states that the Plans covered by the exemption should include the Saturn Individual Retirement Plan for Represented Team Members and the Saturn Personal Choices Retirement Plan for Non-Represented Team Members (the Saturn Plans), whose assets are now included in the trusts which hold the assets of the other Plans sponsored by GMC and its subsidiaries or affiliated companies. The applicant has confirmed that the participants of the Saturn Plans received notice of the proposed exemption in the same manner and during the same time period as the other participants of the Plans. Therefore, the Department has modified the Proposal to include such Plans. With respect to the Summary of Facts and Representations in the Proposal (the Summary), the applicant wishes to add the following additional information for purposes of clarification: First, Paragraph 1of the Summary should state that Mellon Bank, N.A. (Mellon), in addition to Bankers Trust Company, is a trustee of the Plans. However, Mellon does not have any discretionary authority over the investment management of the assets held in the Plans relating to the subject transactions. Second, Paragraph 6 of the Summary should be clarified to reflect the following: (a) The Company may receive additional compensation, in the form of operating fees, if the Company operates some or all of the Properties pursuant to agreements with the Plans which allow the Company to operate the Properties (Operating Agreements). In addition, a conveyance of a NPI (the Conveyance) may allow the Company to recoup certain general or administrative expenses incurred by the Company as WI owner of the Properties. Such operating fees or expenses are disclosed in detail in the Operating Agreement and the Conveyance, respectively, and are not subject to arbitrary changes by the Company. The applicant states that increases in any operating fees generally involve expenses related to the operation of a Property and are not related to any element of operation within the Company's control, such as the ability to increase the level of production on a Property. The nature and extent of any operating fees under an Operating Agreement, and any general or administrative expenses under a Conveyance, will be reviewed, approved and monitored by the ``qualified oil and gas investment manager'' acting for the Plans. 2 2 The applicant states that any fees or expenses received by a Company for operation of a Property in connection with a NPI owned by the Plans will meet section 408(b)(2) of the Act. However, the Department is providing no opinion as to whether payment of any fees or expenses to a Company under the circumstances described herein would meet section 408(b)(2) of the Act and the regulations thereunder (see 29 CFR 2550.408b&hyph;2).
