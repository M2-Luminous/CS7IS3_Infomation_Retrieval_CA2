The [word indistinct] of putting forward such a demand is perhaps very big, and the general, noble, intention is very visible, but afterwards it has to be implemented. We want, through our actions, to bring about the implementation of this intention. When we speak of limiting the growth of energy carriers, I, too, am in favor of such a solution. In this budget, we can already see a visible decrease in the growth rate of energy prices in comparison with what had been planned as late as in the second half of last year or compared with the growth rate of prices that were implemented last year. I would like to remind you that our government limited these price increases, and it seems to me that the difference between us here lies in how to implement these demands successfully. I am also in favor of implementing them. As I have said, however, if we were to discuss and compete on the level of ideas as to how to do this better and more quickly, it would certainly be of benefit to us all. I would encourage the holding of such a discussion and such a debate. [end recording]
