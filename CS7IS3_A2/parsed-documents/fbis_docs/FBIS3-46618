Moored in front of the Royal Palace and less than 50 metres from the National Assembly, its presence was perceived as cultural insensitivity and arrogance. Its ability to lift anchor and steam out of town if things got a little hot also implied a grab and run mentality that many Cambodians say is typical of Thai investment in their country. The hotel, on government orders, has since taken up a new, less offensive birth further up the Tonle Sap river but much resentment still remains in Cambodia over Thai businessmen and their activities. A dispute over fees charged for stalls at the central Olympic market, redeveloped by a Thai company, continues to simmer and in recent weeks Khmer language papers have renewed their attacks on Thai investment. Like Thailand's military leaders, Thai businessmen, who could have served to lay foundations for better relations between the two countries have instead only caused greater distrust. And in many cases it has been nothing more than naked greed for which in many cases they are starting to pay. During the more than two decades that Cambodia was engulfed in war and revolution, Thailand prospered and emerged as a regional economic power. Cambodia's reopening to the world came as Thai businessmen were beginning to assume a relatively new role as foreign investors. With the signing of the Paris Peace accords in 1989, Cambodia was hailed as a golden opportunity and Thai speculators and businessmen rushed in. Poor, undeveloped, closed off to the world for decades and soon to host the cash-rich UN peace mission -- the thinking was get in now or miss the chance forever. Two years later, however, Cambodia has become more like a business nightmare. The new government is indicating it will redraft concessions awarded to some of the biggest Thai investors in aviation, tourism and telecommunications and a sober reevaluation of the country suggests the rewards from doing business there are going to be small and slow in coming. In the meantime, Thailand's international reputation has been dragged through the mud. Thai loggers and gem concessionaires became the focus of an international campaign to have their operations halted because of the environmental havoc they were wreaking. The perception that they were the main financial supporters of the Khmer Rouge also did little to help Thailand's assertions that it deserved credit as one of the main forces behind the peace process. In Phnom Penh, Thai businessmen, in particular bar and massage owners were singled out as the worst of the carpet baggers who descended on Cambodia in search of quick profits from the UN mission. In a pure business sense, the most essential mistake made by Thai businessmen was to back the wrong horse. Practising business much as they have at home, Thai businessmen invested heavily in building up contacts with the despised former Phnom Penh based government of Hun Sen. The shock election win by the royalist Funcinpec [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] party left many Thai businessmen holding dubious and potentially worthless contracts. Thai businessmen in Phnom Penh estimate the cost in pay-offs for some of the more spectacular concessions won by their compatriots could have been as high as 10 million dollars. If such reckoning is correct it is a sad irony because, with the exception of the oil exploration companies and a few others, there has been little legitimate investment in Cambodia of the same magnitude. Thais were obviously not the only foreigners doing business in Cambodia, nor were they the only ones involved in the logging or bar trades, or the only ones with conspicuously close ties to the former government. The behaviour of Singaporean and Malaysian businessmen has been little different to their Thai counterparts although for the most part they seemed to have escaped international condemnation. Part of the problem for Thailand has been the traditional suspicion with Cambodians have viewed their larger neighbours. The return of peace provided the two countries with an opportunity to embark on a new chapter in Thai-Cambodian relations but so far there is little to suggest a change from the distrust of past. The Thai government itself can do little to control Thai companies overseas. That is the responsibility of the host countries. It can, however, be more aware of internationally accepted standards of business behaviour and not defend the worst excesses of its businessmen, as was the case with the logging and gems concessions. It is also too much to expect Thai businessmen to heed official recommendations. In the world of business the only lessons are the ones taught by the profit line. Hopefully, after the debacle in Cambodia they may yet learn that good ethics may also be good business.
