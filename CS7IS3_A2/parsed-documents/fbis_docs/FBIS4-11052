Previously, much of this land could be explored only by ECOPETROL and was not open to third parties. An interesting process begins today. It will continue in Houston, United States; Calgary, Canada; and, in approximately two weeks, London. Three packages with information from three regions will be presented. The regions are El Pie de Monte, in Los Llanos; Magdalena's Valle Superior region, in Tolima and Huila; and the Putumayo region. Each information package is worth $20,000. Colombia, as the newspaper EL ESPECTADOR reports in today's Salmon Section, is going to go all the way to attract new investors by means of more attractive contracts to build a sound future as far as exploration and exploitation of oil goes. We have ECOPETROL President Juan Maria Rendon on the line. Good morning, Dr. Rendon. [Rendon] Hello, Dario, how are you? [Arizmendi] What do you and ECOPETROL expect from this probe being initiated today? [Rendon] The main objective is to attract new investors to the country so that they can help Colombia get into this oil business, which is characterized by high risks and heavy investments. Colombia suitably decided 20 years ago to work on this in conjunction with the private sector. Unfortunately, low oil prices and the fact that China, Russia, and many others have opened up to foreign investments like Colombia did appropriately a long time ago makes it more difficult to find companies that want to come here for exploration. The main objective is to engage in a very aggressive campaign in the cities you mentioned to visit the headquarters of the companies with our information to secure oil production levels Cusiana will make possible. [Arizmendi] How many foreign companies are expected to join the exploration process? [Rendon] We do not have any fixed estimate, but we hope that 10 or 15 new companies come to the country. [Arizmendi] Dr. Rendon, After this initial process that covers the three big regions we just mentioned -- the Pie de Monte of Los Llanos, Magdalena's Valle Superior, and Tupumayo -- will information be prepared on other regions of the country for similar exploration activities? [Rendon] This year we will work on this process only, basically. We are going to wait for results. Possibly next year we will work on a new bid. [Arizmendi] Current contract conditions are attractive enough to compete with nations like China and Russia? [Rendon] These countries we have mentioned, plus Argentina, Peru, and others, are working on this under very special conditions because previously they had not considered foreign investment to develop the oil industry. The state was doing that. Now they have come to the foreign investment arena in a very hearty way. Their conditions are special, and it will be difficult for Colombia to match them. We have produced conditions we think are attractive. They are based on the country's economic stability and on the respect we always show to companies, plus the fact that this country is attractive because of the Cusiana oil breakthrough which we think will be successful. [Arizmendi] Much has been said about Cusiana and (Cucuagua). The country has to start thinking about what will happen after the year 2000. Exploration activities have dropped, probably because of high exploration and exploitation costs and because we are not being sufficiently competitive with other countries such as China and Russia, as you have noted. What other factors could exist with regard to Colombia's loss of competitive clout with foreign investors? [Rendon] Companies go to countries that offer revenue possibilities and respect for the rules of the game. These are two factors on which we want to make emphasis. We have also changed our attitude, from one that consisted of passively waiting for the companies to come here, to a more businesslike attitude of preparing reports on Colombia's potential to present them at formal bidding sessions, like the ones we have prepared. We will elect the winner after a public bidding that will consider investment factors [words indistinct] in the country. [Arizmendi] Will this international bidding include the potential oil zones of Medina and Cundinamarca? [Rendon] No. Those are reserve areas that have a high potential and that ECOPETROL maintains for itself to develop in the future. This is an area near Cusiana. We are looking for ways of working on those fields by somehow forming an association with a company willing to share risks and manage investments. Oil wells there will cost $30 million each. That is a very complex area. The budget for that operation could be a bit difficult. [Arizmendi] If foreign investment is necessary, why have we renounced the support of Shell in Huila Department, as it has just happened? [Rendon] This is a legal matter more than anything else. What happens with this company is that there is this contract, signed over 30 years ago. It is based on outdated circumstances, when the state [words indistinct] intervention. Later Colombia went modern, and now foreigners and ECOPETROL are partners and manage things jointly. After 30 years the contract is over, and there has been a legal ruling. Shell believes it can extend the contract. The State Council has said no. In view of this, the government has decided that it cannot extend the contract. It is not that we want them to leave. Shell is one of the most important companies in the world. We would like them to be in Colombia, with an even larger presence. I hope we can understand each other. This is not a matter of attitudes or of lack of compliance, but a legal matter.
