Here is the content of the telegram: Prompted by the spirit of genuine national reconciliation and unity to which the PDK has all along adhered, I would like to inform Your Majesty that the PDK is happy and ready to attend the roundtable meeting for peace and national reconciliation under the lofty chairmanship of Your Majesty in the (Kiang Si-un) Palace [near Pyongyang]. In case this palace is not convenient, the roundtable may be held at another neutral site. I still believe that a roundtable is the first step for all Cambodian factions to meet and have discussions so that they can gradually agree upon and move toward an accommodation with the aim of achieving national reconciliation under the shade of the king and the throne. Moreover, I have raised the issue of a neutral site with the sole aim of ensuring security and providing equal conditions for all parties attending the meeting. All of this is to enable the roundtable meeting to be held successfully in line with Your Majesty's desire and the profound aspirations of our nation and every Cambodian in the countryside, in Phnom Penh, and abroad who desires to achieve the national reconciliation and unity of all forces under the leadership of the king, thus enabling Cambodia to enjoy peace, national unity, and territorial integrity. Availing myself of this occasion, I would like to inform Your Majesty that I accept this new initiative for the participation of the PDK in the government and the Army, and the preparation of the election suggested by Your Majesty on 7 May 1994.
