The spokesman, as well as Mexican diplomatic sources, has dismissed the possibility of including a special clause pertaining to Mexico in the final document on Latin America, which will be signed by the European foreign ministers at their summit in Corfu. "It is unrealistic to believe that relations with Latin America will focus on Mexico, because that could create political problems with other states in the region," said a spokesman for Manuel Marin, commissioner for EU development. According to this source, there is "disagreement" within the EU regarding Mexico's status within the context of relations with Latin America, because of the North American Free Trade Agreement that the country signed with the United States and Canada. Mexican diplomats have denied the existence of official documents that substantiate the alleged negotiation of a free trade agreement between the two countries, as the Spanish newspaper "EL PAIS" reported in its Friday edition. Nevertheless, the newspaper explained that within the EU there are "groups" that have a specific political interest in Mexico, but countries such as Spain and Portugal are opposed because they fear a souring of relations with the rest of the region. "It is very unlikely that Spain will support the decision to give Mexico special treatment, because that would prompt other Latin American countries to request similar treatment," the spokesman told NOTIMEX. Portugal, meanwhile, has said that it will request a special agreement with Brazil if the European Commission decides to sign a treaty of association with Mexico. According to EL PAIS, the EU is planning to make qualitative changes in its relations with Mexico during the summit of heads of government and foreign ministers scheduled for 24 and 25 June on the Greek island of Corfu. The newspaper asserts that plans are taking shape to negotiate an industrial free trade agreement similar to the one the EU is currently discussing with Morocco.
