Unlike last year's sanctions which had to do with the regress in the democratisation process, the latest are related to the increasingly urgent issue of the hard drugs trade. Presidential memorandum addressed to American officials is directing these to vote against all Nigerian request for financial assistance at the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and similar organisations. The charge of the Americans is the complicity of the Nigerian government in the hard drugs trade, in the area of interdiction, law enforcement and prosecution of offenders. Specifically, they allege the uncooperative attitude of Nigerian officials in the extradition of suspects. They point to four cases of American request for the extradition of drug barons, only one of which has been honoured. Government's inaction in the other three pending cases, is evidence, they claim, of the protection which the suspects enjoy from the Nigerian government. In view of the standing Cooperation Agreement between the two countries, these are indeed strange and unfortunate developments. Nigerian officials are wont to point out that the Agreement is subject to judicial process. In other words, it is too much to expect that Nigeria would immediately hand over suspected citizens for prosecution in America, without due process. Not only would this be a violation of Nigerian law and sovereignty, the rights of individual citizens could be infringed. For their part, the Americans profess understanding of this, but insist that even when clearly documented cases are prepared for that judicial process, they are frequently stone-walled by the Nigerian government. Such action, they charge, can only be deliberate. The American insistence is premised on claims by its high officials including the Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics Matters, Robert Gelbard, that more than a third of all heroin imported into the United States, comes from Nigerian syndicates. The Nigerian Ambassador to the United States, Zubair Kazaure denies this, citing in support of his contention of a report of the U.S. International Narcotics Centre which declares an improvement in the level of drug cooperation between Nigeria and the America for the year 1993. Neither of these recriminatory claims are of any avail in the concrete question of tackling a pervasive menace which hard drugs represent in the world today. There are those who argue that the American sanctions might in fact be counter-productive in the long run. The nonchalance or outright complicity of government officials is unlikely to be significantly altered merely on account of these sanctions, given our experience with unelected governments. On the contrary, the ordinary citizenry which would be more directly affected by them might in fact become more sympathetic with the cause of the government. One area, for instance, in which citizens have been particularly resentful concerns the treatment meted out to Nigerians abroad. On the strength of certain foreign campaigns, the image of the average Nigerian is of a drug-peddling, uninformly [as printed] dishonest character out of dupe his foreign second in any business dealings. What this eventually translates into is incessant and unjustifiable harassment of Nigerians around the airports and seaports of the world. It is impossible to deny the criminal activities of some Nigerians abroad. But against the background of many upright and excellent services rendered by Nigerians in innumerable institutions, workplaces and environments around the world, the negative campaign provides only a partial and foreshortened picture of the country and its people. Lest this foregoing be interpreted as support for or denial of the American allegation of government complicity in drug trafficking, we must hasten to say that the perception of the National Drugs Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) can only lend credence to the allegations. The NDLEA seems not to have been able to find its feet since its creation. Dogged by frequent leadership changes, occurring in circumstances which raise questions of probity and competence, this Agency has so far failed the nation. When it is not bungling investigations and prosecutions, it is being trailed by serious scandals significantly related to drugs. In the past one year alone, the organisation has had no fewer than four heads, and been involved in many more scandals and failings. And, therefore, unless a serious re-organisation takes place, we might as well write it off as a hindrance and not a help in the fight against drugs. The inability of the government and its agencies to act promptly and with determination in this fight, gives the impression that hard drugs are not at all a matter of serious concern to the nation. They cannot be more wrong. Research shows that an unfailing pattern in this menace is that from being a drugs transit country, Nigeria would eventually graduate into a consuming one. Already, among the offsprings of the well-to-do in our society, remarkable changes in the consumption pattern have been noticed. Given our societal propensity for negative habits and trends to grow rapidly, it cannot be long before Nigeria becomes one of the drug-consuming nations. The drugs menace cannot but be seen as a global problem. Consequently, only in a concerted way, through a network manner can the world approach the fight against it. Nigeria must contribute seriously to this struggle. Even if Nigeria were not so directly implicated, this would still have been a serious obligation. As it is, Nigeria by acts of omission and commission, is perceived to be right at the centre of the problem. It is not a responsibility to shirk or take lightly. The government can only convince the world of its innocence by the determined way it sets out to join the rest of mankind in fighting what is really a global scourge. Recent dismissals at the NDLEA can only be a first step.
