EFFECTIVE DATE: March 18, 1994. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Chicago Asylum Office Effective upon publication of this notice, applicants who live within the Michigan zip code areas 48800 through 49699 will have their interviews scheduled to take place at the Asylum Office in Chicago. The INS is unable to continue to conduct circuit rides to Detroit to interview applicants who live in these locations. Interviews that have already been scheduled to take place will be conducted in Detroit as scheduled. Applicants residing in the immediate Detroit area and Eastern Michigan, in zip code areas 48000 through 48799 and 49700 through 49999, will continue to be scheduled for appointments in Detroit. The Chicago Asylum Office is located at 209 S. LaSalle Street, suite 625, Chicago, IL 60604. Newark Asylum Office All applicants who reside in Delaware and eastern Pennsylvania, within the jurisdiction of the Philadelphia District Office, will now have their interviews scheduled to be conducted at the Newark Asylum Office. As is the case with the Detroit circuit rides, resource limits do not permit the INS to continue to conduct circuit rides to Philadelphia from the Newark Asylum Office. The Newark Asylum Office is located at 200 Washington Place, Newark, NJ 07102. All asylum applicants affected by this change in the location of circuit rides will be notified of the proper location of the interview when the interview is scheduled. Questions regarding interviews should be directed to the appropriate Asylum Office having jurisdiction over the applicant's place of residence. Dated: March 8, 1994.
