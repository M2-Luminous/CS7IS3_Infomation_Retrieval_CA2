She added that this outcome was achieved through the competent defense of a just cause. Ciller concluded her visit to Brussels and has returned to Ankara. Prior to her return, Ciller visited a Turkish quarter in Brussels. [passage omitted] At Ankara's Esenboga Airport, Ciller was received by various ministers, deputies, and many citizens. Speaking at a news conference at the airport, Ciller gave information on the issues taken up at the summit and on her contacts. She noted that the stand to be adopted and strategy pursued by NATO regarding the restructuring of Europe were discussed in Brussels. Pointing out that within this framework the concept of a partnership for peace was adopted, Ciller said: A strategy that extends its defense wing to countries that were once Warsaw Pact members but that currently want to be part of Europe has been adopted. Ciller continued: [Begin recording] Now a door has been opened to former Warsaw Pact members. This door is the NATO membership door. One should not, however, interpret this as though the former Warsaw Pact members have been accepted into NATO. According to this concept this door has been opened to all of Eastern Europe and the eastern bloc, including Russia, without disrupting the principle of equality but at the same time taking into consideration the differences among these countries and their respective peace plans. This process has also been extended over a certain period. [end recording] Ciller stated that an agreement has been reached on the defense of the countries within the eastern bloc and on their joining the alliance within a certain period of time. She added that in time a program and a plan will emerge on the issue. Ciller stated that while this was agreed upon, a strategy that will prevent placing Russia against NATO was also put forward. She said: [Begin recording] We have, once again, found the opportunity to defend the view that, given the changing world conditions both from east to west and north to south, Turkey is no longer only a flank country but also a central one. Within this framework, I am glad to state that significant steps have been taken in the struggle to get NATO to adopt Western values as well as the values of other worlds. [end recording] Ciller stressed that member countries confirming at the summit that they will cooperate on the struggle against terror is a significant step for Turkey. She said the following on the issue: [Begin recording] We can now say that this organization, a member of which we have been for the last 42 years, has decided to back up the struggle against terror in the world. This has been achieved through the competent defense of a just cause. This was not all we managed to achieve. A series of agreements and views concerning Azerbaijan and the unjust developments in that country were included in the communique. A struggle was also waged for the just cause of our Muslim brethren in Bosnia-Herzegovina. A step further than the original text of the communique was attained. The opening of Tuzla, the rescue of Sarajevo, and the promise that efforts will be exerted to distribute humanitarian aid were also included in the communique. [end recording] She noted that despite all this world public opinion did not use the explicit expressions Turkey desired, adding that the political determination on the issue should be further consolidated. Stressing that Turkey views this as another stage in the human rights struggle, Ciller referred to the need for more cooperation with world countries in a bid to achieve more concrete work on the issue. She said that at the summit she observed that Europe is waging a struggle for self-identity, adding that a plan that introduces the flexibility of acting outside NATO, without being independent from the alliance, has been adopted. She noted that from now on the Western European Union will have the opportunity to benefit from NATO forces with the approval of the alliance. Pointing out that the other friendly countries agreed that Turkey's status within NATO should be raised, Ciller described this as an auspicious development. Ciller said that during her contacts the issue of the European Union was also discussed. She added that the member countries agreed that joint new steps should be taken with the EU and that a financial protocol should be realized within the framework of the Customs Union. Pointing out that the execution phase will begin in the next few months, Ciller recalled that Turkey will be part of the Customs Union in 1995. Stressing that Turkey is a key country in the region, Ciller concluded as follows: [Begin recording] The developments in Europe and the world and the disintegration of the Soviet Union have not decreased Turkey's importance. On the contrary the developments on the east-west and north-south axes have made Turkey a key country. We share the same problems. As a country that has made an equal contribution to the solution of these shared problems -- and not as a country that follows suit -- I hope that this summit will contribute to peace in Turkey and the world. [end recording] Ciller later, cheered by the public, left Esenboga Airport for the city.
