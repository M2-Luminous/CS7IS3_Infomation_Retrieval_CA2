MIEP Cochairman Lajos Horvath is to report to the listeners of "Extra" about the decisions made during the one-day meeting. [passage omitted] Mr Horvath, was this one-day meeting the opening of the election campaign? [Horvath] Naturally, this was also the opening of the election campaign and, like every party preparing for the forthcoming tasks seriously, we also had to give a political program. [Correspondent] Parties are usually stereotyped in their own country and abroad alike. You are called populist, national radical, and I have even heard that the MIEP is a national fundamentalist party. What do you consider yourself? [Horvath] None of these. [passage omitted] I think that the MIEP is a party which, in the Hungarian society of castes, wishes to represent the caste of those excluded, that is the majority caste. We consider that the old nomenclatura allowed into its own ranks a few people from the new parliamentary parties and created a new caste consisting of 100,000-200,000 people in this country, who can get access to everything in this country, while the majority is living in ever-deteriorating circumstances. So this is a national party representing their interests, in fact, a kind of people's party. [Correspondent] How do you mean that 600,000 people [as heard] were allowed inside the nomenclatura? Who are inside, the ruling parties, members of the coalition? [Horvath] Well, the people of the ruling parties and the coalition were let inside this nomenclatura, and the old members have not really left. So the compromise between the two sides was the great compromise of 1990. [Correspondent] But members of your party were also party to this great compromise, since the MIEP then was still part of the MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum]. [Horvath] This was one of the initial reasons for leaving the MDF, for instead of the change deemed real by us, this compromise took place. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Are you going to form an election alliance with anybody? Which parties do you consider as potential partners? For if you intend to participate in the government, you will have to form a coalition, but with whom, with the MDF, Fidesz [Alliance of Young Democrats], the HSP [Hungarian Socialist Party]? [Horvath] I think that these three parties are out of the question. First of all, perhaps I can start at the level of self-organization of society, for this is always more important that the political parties; the Farmers' Circles [Gazdakoeroek], Peasant Alliance [Paraszt Szovetseg], Society for the Protection of [Hungarian] Intellectual Life [Szellemi Vedegylet]. [passage omitted] Representatives of the KDNP [Christian Democratic People's Party] and the Independent Smallholders' Party were also present at our consultation, as guests, which also shows that the MIEP, on today's political scene, is a national people's party undertaking Christian and Smallholders interests also. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Mr. Csurka said that the people wish to overturn the present pseudo-order completely. What should one understand by this? [Horvath] What I said earlier; there is a pampered stratum of society which exercises the jobs-for-the-boys principle. [passage omitted] For example, one-time comrades, now bank president or industrialist, can lend each other hundreds of millions, and if the loan goes down the drain at the end, the state will bail them out with its program of bank consolidation with taxpayers' money. [passage omitted] The MIEP wants to replace this pseudo-order with a real order. The manifestation of this pseudo-order in parliament is the six- party consensus, which somehow always comes about in parliament eventually. You mark my word, in most cases, outside the plenary sessions the six parties sign an agreement somewhere else, and at the plenary sessions only a pretend debate takes place. They say that there is a consensus. This is making a mockery of parliamentarianism a bit, this is a pseudo-order. [Correspondent] However, according to my information the MIEP is not in favor of a witch-hunt, but in spite of this you intend to sack 5,000-6,000 leaders. How can you reconcile this? [Horvath] Innocent people must not be burned at the stake, but where witches can be found, Christians have to take action. [Correspondent] Mr Csurka said once that if there were not an overwhelming cultural revolution in Hungary, that would mean the end of the nation; after the Chinese Cultural Revolution, this sentence has a somewhat unpleasant connotation. What do you mean by this ? [Horvath] We mean something entirely different. [passage omitted] The Hungarian cultural revolution, if I may say so, is only a figure of speech. What it means is that in the country there should be education and support for culture which prioritize Hungarian interests and values. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Are you in favor of the present Hungarian foreign policy of trying to join NATO? [Horvath] I think it is very important that Hungary join every European institution. We also consider it important not to keep begging for admittance like a dog with its tail between its legs, but to clarify the conditions and in turn we should give our own conditions, and this is how consensus should form. This means that a few fundamental national interests must not be given up, for example, the autonomy aspirations of the Hungarians living in the neighboring countries. We consider them so important that we can not give these up in order to be admitted to the European Community. The prime example, that if a nation fights for autonomy steadfastly and tenaciously then it achieves that, is Palestine. [passage omitted]
