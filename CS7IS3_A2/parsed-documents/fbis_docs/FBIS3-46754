The Indonesian Bar Association (Ikadin) in its assessment of legal sector development in the past 12 months found much lacking. "Ikadin sees an erosion in the way human rights were respected, as exemplified by limitations and violations of the rights to associate and to express opinions and of the principles of democracy," the organization announced yesterday. The statement cited the arrests and prosecution of students for staging demonstrations as a clear violation of the principles of democracy, especially the rights to express opinions and to have different views, which are guaranteed by the constitution. The police are currently detaining 21 students and a human rights activist, who will be charged with insulting President Suharto, an offense punishable with six years imprisonment. Ikadin noted that the authorities have detained a number of people without going through the proper procedures as required by the Criminal Code, and this, it said "is one reason for the decline in the integrity of the law." Ikadin did not give any examples, but the authorities came under strong criticism, when in October, they detained nine men accused of murdering labor activist Marsinah. The case has become highly political. The warrants for their arrests were not issued until after pressures from relatives, lawyers and wide media exposure made it all but impossible to delay doing so further. Ikadin deplored the use of violence and intimidation against people who were defending their land and other legitimate rights. "These represented violation of the most fundamental human rights." There have been a series of incidents pitting the authorities against the local people in land disputes. Most notable was the one in Nipah, on Madura Island, in September, which left four people dead. The military leadership was quick to remove three local officers, who were considered directly responsible for the incident. The lawyers' association also deplored the bureaucratic obstacles imposed by the authorities for people holding gatherings, congresses, seminars and even anniversaries, all of which can only be held with permission. Ikadin also noted a series of government bans, prohibiting certain people from appearing before academic seminars. "This is alone a form of suppression of the principle of campus freedom." Leading human rights lawyer Adnan Buyung Nasution was banned from appearing before two seminars this month and noted poet W.S. Rendra also suffered the same fate earlier on. The statement, which was the result of a year-end meeting, was signed by Ikadin's chairman, Harjono Citrosubono, and its Secretary-General, Johan Jauhary. Also taking part in the year-end Ikadin meeting held last week were E.J. Kanter, Sukarjo Adijoyo, Alie Amangku, Kitty Sugondo, Frans H. Winarta, Abdul Hakim Garuda Nusantara and Luhut M.P. Pangaribuan.
