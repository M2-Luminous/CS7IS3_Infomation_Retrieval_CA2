Three kingpins in the organization were also ordered to hand over to the state the tens of thousands of markkas in profits they received from drug selling. The longest sentence, six and a half years, was given to Nils Erik Sjoberg. He was convicted on two counts of felony drug violations and five misdemeanor drug violations. Sjoberg had received and passed on altogether three kilograms of hashish and 50 to 100 grams of amphetamines in the period of summer 1991 to February 1993. He was arrested at his residence, from which was seized a little over two kilograms of amphetamines and well over a kilogram of hashish. Of the others convicted, Janne Hautapaakkanen was given a prison sentence of four and a half years, and Markko Franken three years. Neither will be able to receive parole. In addition to felony drug charges, Hautapaakkanen was also convicted on four weapons violation counts. Found on his possession was a so-called tear pistol, which can only fire one round. The court considered this aggravating, since this type of weapon is used only for committing crimes. Franken's sentence came from two felony drug counts and several misdemeanor drug counts. In addition, two others received sentences to six and seven months of prison without chance of parole.
