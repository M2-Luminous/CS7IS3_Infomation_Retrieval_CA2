Ours is a people's government, and the aim of the people's government is to serve the people wholeheartedly. He urged that governments at all levels make caring for the people and improving their living standards the first and most important task. The two-day national work conference, convened by the State Council, closed in Beijing this afternoon. Vice Premier Zhu Rongji presided over today's meeting. Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan, Tianjin Mayor Zhang Lichang, Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju, Vice Mayor Jin Mingshi of Shenyang, and Vice Mayor Zhou Jianzhong of Chongqing spoke at the conference. After hearing the speeches, Premier Li Peng said: The current situation of the production and market supply of farm products as a whole is good. We have reaped good harvests for several years in a row and have achieved notable results in the "vegetable basket" project. The total supply of farm produce, and food in particular, has become relatively abundant in China as compared with the chronic shortages of the past. He said: Despite the excellent situation, fluctuations in the market prices of grain, oil, and sideline products occurred in some localities during a period from November last year. The problem has been caused by various factors, the most important of which, I believe, is our failure to thoroughly understand the continued need to exercise macroeconomic regulation and control over the market under the new situation arising from price decontrol. The purpose of the current conference is to achieve unity in thinking and understanding, and to draw on experiences and lessons for further solving the problem of making the "vegetable basket," grain, cotton, and edible oil work meet the requirements of a socialist market economic structure. Premier Li Peng discussed questions in five aspects: 1) Caring for the people and improving their living standards is the first and most important task of governments at all levels; 2) ensuring a sufficient supply of goods and establishing a larger distribution and circulation pattern; 3) building up and managing markets well; 4) strictly enforcing macro-economic regulation and control; and 5) further implementing the mayor's responsibility system. Li Peng said: In our historical advance toward becoming a modern socialist power, we should attach great importance to both feeding the people and economic construction, and properly handle the relationship between the two. Feeding the people, which means caring for and improving their life, is a major task of governments at all levels. We must bear in mind this major task in unifying our thinking and understanding, striving to do a good job in the "vegetable basket," grain, cotton, and edible oil work and ensuring ample supply and relatively stable prices in the market. He said: As current incomes of most rural and urban residents are still relatively low and food expenses are much higher than for other consumer goods, the prices of staple foods, including grain, oil, meat, and vegetables, can directly influence consumption standards. To effectively solve problems in the production and supply of vegetables, grain, cotton, and edible oil is a matter of grave importance, which should never be treated lightly. Li Peng pointed out: This will be a year in which our country will take a giant step forward in instituting major reform measures. The successful implementation of these major reform measures has a bearing on whether the reform can succeed and on the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. The smooth progress of reform requires that we maintain social stability and set people's minds at ease. We must make great efforts to maintain relatively stable commodity prices in the marketplace, particularly the prices of grain, edible oil, meat, vegetable, and eggs; and we must make great efforts to strengthen and develop the current social stability and unity; and correctly handle the relationship between reform and development on the one hand and stability on the other. He said: In deepening reform, we must consider the interests of the masses of people in all strata, both in urban and rural areas. Our country's reform is compatible with the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of people. However, this does not mean that in the process of reform, every stratum and individual will receive equal interests and tangible benefits all at the same time. In light of this, in conducting our work, we must show particular concern about the masses of people who are not well-off or even have considerable difficulties in their daily lives at present. We must adopt effective measures to earnestly resolve the difficulties encountered by low-income people in their daily lives. Li Peng said: Thanks to the efforts of all quarters, the momentum of excessive increases in the prices of grain, edible oil, and nonstaple food in the preceding period is now under control, and the prices have come down to some extent. We must take further steps to ensure that the high sales prices will continue to drop. Li Peng pointed out: Developing production and enlivening circulation are basic conditions for maintaining an abundant supply of nonstaple food, grain, cotton, and edible oil in the market and for maintaining the relative stability of their prices. Developing production constitutes the foundation for ensuring the supply of nonstaple food, grain, cotton, and edible oil. We must mobilize the initiative of the peasants to carry out scientific farming and vigorously develop nonstaple food, grain, cotton, and edible oil production. He said: On the basis of a vigorously developed production, we must establish a big commodity circulation setup and an operating mechanism promoting overall balance, free flow of goods, and flexible operation. Governments in all localities must attach importance to the construction of transportation, storage, preservation, and other basic circulation facilities to facilitate the shipment of vegetables from the south to the north, and grain from the north to the south and from the central regions to the west. We must truly ensure the free flow of commodities and closely link production regions with marketing regions. Governments in all localities must take further steps to remove all kinds of obstacles to circulation and sternly crack down on gangsters and thugs in the transportation sector. Large and medium-sized cities must create conditions to attract out-of-town vegetable growers to market their produce in the city by ensuring their safety and fair trade. Li Peng said: To do a good job in the production and supply of nonstaple food, grain, and edible oil, it is necessary to pay attention to market construction and the establishment of a network which combines agricultural produce markets, which center on wholesale markets, with retailers. This important experience was gained by some of the large and medium-sized cities which achieved results in building "vegetable basket" projects in recent years. He said: Under the conditions of decontrolled operations, governments at all levels must pay particular attention to market management. Lifting control to enliven operations does not mean washing our hands of the operations. We must sternly crack down on illegal elements who manipulate the market, speculate or jack up prices, produce or sell substandard or fake merchandise, entrap people or swindle them, or commit other illegal acts. Industrial, commercial, public security, railway, and transportation departments must closely coordinate with each other to take concerted action and ensure a notable improvement in market order before the Spring Festival and maintain a good market order indefinitely. Li Peng said: At present, the following three tasks should be grasped in the regulation and control of farm products in our country: First, it is necessary to establish a reserve system of grain, oil, cotton, meat, vegetables, and sugar. Both the central and local authorities should strive to improve administration over the reserve system. Second, it is necessary to establish a risk fund system for grain and sideline products. All subsidies from central and local authorities for grain, meat, and vegetables should be used for the establishment of the risk fund system. Moreover, more capital should be raised from other sources for the purpose of expanding the system to an appropriate scale. Third, it is necessary to establish a monitoring system for the farm products market and improve the farm products information network. In this way, the government will be to rely on scientific information provided by them to make decisions on the implementation of macroeconomic regulation and control. Li Peng said: It is been stressed many times that the "vegetable basket project" should be undertaken by various localities, especially by the governments of large and medium cities, through the implementation of a mayoral responsibility system. Ensuring the people's livelihood needs is the primary function of mayors and is most important for stabilizing the overall situation. This should be included as a target for the personal responsibility system for mayors, and evaluations should be conducted each year. The results of the evaluation should be reported to the city people's congress and the city's people. He said: How can a mayor successfully carry out the "vegetable basket" task? The most important thing for a mayor to do is to ensure a balance between supply and demand in nonstaple foods. All big and medium cities should be responsible for maintaining an overall balance between supply and demand. Under no circumstances should they wait until there are problems before attempting to achieve a balance between supply and demand. If that happens, the loss will be colossal. It is necessary to ensure sufficient land for growing vegetables and to strictly stop the practice of using vegetable land for other purposes. Without vegetable farms, there will be no vegetable baskets. Therefore, we must protect the vegetable basket with vegetable farms. In some cities vegetable land has been used for other purposes to an excessive extent, and vegetable land has not been supplemented sufficiently. This is one of the important causes that led to a shortage of vegetable supplies in the relevant localities. This problem must be solved as soon as possible. Vegetable land that has been used for other purposes must be quickly supplemented. While establishing their own nonstaple food producing bases, various large and medium cities should also, in line with the need, establish nonstaple food producing and marketing coordination zones with other cities. It is necessary to gradually form a vegetable production pattern in which production relies mainly on suburban areas, supplemented by nearby farming areas, and is regulated by products from other cities. Li Peng said: To achieve a balance between supply and demand, we must ensure funds for the construction of bases for producing vegetables and other nonstaple foods, funds for price risks, and funds for the construction of cold storages, the circulation setup, and other infrastructure facilities. Li Peng expressed the hope that when participants returned home, they will conscientiously publicize and implement the guidelines of this conference and adopt measures, in line with actual conditions, to make sure their work is done well. He also hoped that they will, in accordance with the guidelines of this conference, do a good job in ensuring a stable supply of grain, oil, and nonstaple foods during the Spring Festival, so as to enable the people to have a happy and peaceful festival. Leading comrades of the Central Committee and the State Council who also attended the conference were Zou Jiahua, Qian Qichen, Li Lanqing, Li Tieying, Wen Jiabao, Chi Haotian, Song Jian, Chen Junsheng, Ismail Amat, and Luo Gan. Vice Premier Zhu Rongji made a speech on the first day of the conference. In his speech, he analyzed the current economic situation and stressed the importance and urgency of doing the work on vegetables, grain, oil, and cotton well, in order to guarantee market supply, and maintain social stability and the overall situation of reform and opening to the outside world. He also mapped out an overall plan for unifying thinking and understanding, clearly defining responsibilities, and doing work on the"vegetable basket," grain, cotton, and oil still better, and set explicit requirements in connection with this work.
