We are in direct contact with Gary Alfonso in Ulundi. [Begin recording] [Alfonso] Good evening from the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly's building in Ulundi where Justice Johann Kriegler is still being bombarded with questions by the kwaZulu Legislative Assembly members, posing questions on the commission's plans for kwaZulu concerning the election and free political activity in the KwaZulu-Natal region. Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi, King Goodwill Zwelithini, and Justice Kriegler have already addressed the assembly. However, the reception of Justice Kriegler and his members, including veteran politician Helen Suzman, can best be described as cool. The judge was jeered when he referred to statements made by the king, who said that he could not tell his people to vote, and the judge was also interrupted several times by members of the Legislative Assembly when he attempted to explain what he and his council members, stationed in kwaZulu-Natal, are planning for the region. This footage recorded earlier this evening can best describe the reception of the Independent Electoral Commission here in Ulundi and also the addresses by the king and Dr. Buthelezi. [Zwelithini] The kingdom of kwaZulu remains sovereign and now we seek our freedom and we seek social, economic, and political justice from within that sovereign kingdom. Even today, sir, as I address you and your commissioners I cannot advise my people that the correct thing for them to do is to vote in the forthcoming election. [Kriegler] His Majesty expressly did not say it would be incorrect for his people to vote. He said he could not advise them to vote. Mark those words. [laughter from crowd] Can I ask you...can I ask you to afford me the same courtesy that your king and his prime minister afforded me -- to hear me out. Can I be afforded that courtesy, please? [Buthelezi] Your interests are to secure free and fair elections for all those who want to vote in compliance with the law and my interests are to persuade the electorate not to vote in compliance with the decision of our party. How do we deal with each other, sir, across a situation in which what you do serves your interest and works against not what I do, but against what my people do, without me instructing them or without direction. This could mean that in terms of the act under which you work, what my people do and what you do may make me a criminal. [end recording]
