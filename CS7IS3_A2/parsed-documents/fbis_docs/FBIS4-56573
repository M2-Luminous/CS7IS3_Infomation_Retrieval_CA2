This was announced by plant manager Jesus Valdez Torra, who added that on this occasion there will be no need for support from other organizations and that the plant workers will undertake the maintenance program without problems, given that all the required parts are at hand. With the shutdown at the Antonio Guiteras plant, the National Electric System will reduce its electric generation capacity by 10 percent. This will be reflected in a slight outage increase. However, as soon as the gas circulator unit of the boiler is repaired, which is expected to be completed by 8 May, the unit will be ready to produce the 330 megawatts it regularly produces, with low fuel consumption and the highest efficiency to date in the electric sector.
