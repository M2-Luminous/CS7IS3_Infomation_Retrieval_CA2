Not only does he easily bandy about historical data; more importantly, he is also completely familiar with the people and customs there. He was born 62 years ago in the town of Crkveni, near Teslic, in the Usore valley, to a large family in which the father was an industrialist in the lumber business and a Croat HSS [Croatian Peasants Party] politician. In 1945, he and his father had to flee to Austria by way of Bleiburg, then to Italy, and finally to the United States and Venezuela. He ended up studying geology in the United States, after which he was chosen to be a professor at a university in Caracas. After 1945, he first traveled to Croatia in 1990 at the invitation of President Tudjman, and afterward he returned to Venezuela where he was elected chairman of the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community] Coordinating Committee for Venezuela and South America. His second trip to Croatia was in August 1992, when he reported as a volunteer for the National Guard Corps. Since September 1992, he has been the ambassador of the Republic of Croatia to Bosnia-Herzegovina. He is married and has eight children, and his family lives in Venezuela, where they all own property and have jobs. He tells me that the wartime conditions in Bosnia-Herzegovina thwarted his efforts to locate the embassy in Sarajevo back in September 1992, and in Mostar later on, so that the Croatian Embassy was opened in Medjugorje in August 1993. He would like to move with the embassy to Sarajevo as soon as possible. He comments briefly on the visit to Bosnia-Herzegovina by the Turkish and Pakistani prime ministers, Tansu Ciller and Benazir Bhutto. [Sancevic] It is clear that the Islamic countries are interested in everything that is going on in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and that they want to see things firsthand, to talk with the top people. These are normal contacts between countries, although in this case the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina does not exist in the form in which it is internationally recognized; rather, it exists under extremely complex conditions. [Zvizdic] How was the declaration received in Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Sancevic] It is hard to speak on behalf of all of Bosnia-Herzegovina, because there are three sides. [Zvizdic] I mean representatives of the Bosnjak-Muslim republic, which has been generally accepted as the territorial designation for one of the three sides ever since President Tudjman's peace initiative in Bonn. [Sancevic] The Muslims, some of whom call themselves Bosnjaks, have not constituted their republic because they contend that they are the inheritors of the international rights of all of Bosnia-Herzegovina. You see, these Muslims, or Bosnjaks, had almost no public reaction to the Geneva Declaration, because they too are negotiating with the Serbs. If Izetbegovic signed an agreement with Krajisnik saying that the Serbs can secede after two years, then things are clear, although later there were various interpretations of that agreement coming from the Muslim side, and even rejection of the Serbs' right to secede. This comes as no surprise to people who know the situation, because there are several political factions in the Muslim ranks. [Zvizdic] Can you identify the factions? [Sancevic] It is no secret that the line represented by Ganic is absolutely opposed to anything that smells of an alliance with the Croats. That is the Sandzak hard line. [Zvizdic] Does that mean that it is pro-Serb? [Sancevic] I would rather not get into that, because that calls for lengthy elaboration, but I know that it is not pro-Croat. On the other hand, there is the Haris Silajdzic faction that previously demonstrated a partiality for the West, the Croats, and Croatia. However, in recent times that faction has become rather radicalized in a negative sense toward Croatia. [Zvizdic] What caused that? [Sancevic] I think that everyone in Sarajevo is surprised by the tenacity of the defense in central Bosnia, because they expected those Croat enclaves to fall. This was followed by those charges of involvement by the Croatian Armed Forces [HV], but I would rather not go into that because those are military affairs. There is also a third faction, the mojahedin one, which is the most radical one, although perhaps not numerically large, but it is aggressive, violent. [Zvizdic] Who heads up that faction? [Sancevic] Look, with these "secret" movements and organizations, it is hard to decidedly name the actual leader, especially in a situation where a significant share of the Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina do not support mojahedin radicalism. Moreover, the majority of Islamic countries, no matter how strange it may seem to some people, are rigorously opposed to extremists, energetically fighting the mojahedin-fundamentalist faction in their own states. But I maintain that this faction exists in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and it will impose itself on others, with more or less success. [Zvizdic] Is there also an Alija Izetbegovic faction, or is Izetbegovic's policy the end product of all these factions? [Sancevic] It is clearly not an end product, but rather the political acrobatics of accommodation, because Izetbegovic is first with this faction, then with another, and then with a third. That is the source of the elements of inconsistency in his policy and of his positions in general on a number of issues in Bosnia-Herzegovina and beyond. There have been so many times that he has refuted his own words as a result of the momentary power of individual factions. [Zvizdic] What about the Muslim armed forces? Toward whom do they lean? [Sancevic] Everything about the armed forces is extremely complicated for all three sides, because in some places the Croats and Muslims are allies in the war against the Serbs, in some places they are fighting each other, while in other places there is Croat collusion with the Serbs but also fighting between the Croat and Serbs. It is a rather complex situation, with "dog eat dog" being the prevailing rule, but I still think that Izetbegovic has strong influence over his armed forces, although it is clear that some local commanders do not listen to him. People Never See Most of the Dollars [Zvizdic] Where are the Muslims getting arms and ammunition? [Sancevic] Such matters belong in the military domain, but it is possible to say a little something. There are several sources of arms: First, there was plenty left behind in the depots of the former Territorial Defense; second, a significant number of arms and ammunition factories are located on territory held by the Muslims (Konjic, Bugojno, Travnik and Novi Travnik, Zenica, Tuzla); third, the Croats have given the Muslims a lot of weapons; fourth, the Muslims are buying weapons from various sources, inside the country and beyond, because when someone has money they can buy and acquire anything. It should not be forgotten that the Muslim side is getting very valuable aid in dollars from Islamic countries and other sources, and that the people never see most of this money; rather, it remains abroad where it is spent for war purposes. [Zvizdic] What is your current assessment of the balance of power among the belligerents in Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Sancevic] I would say that the Serbs, who have achieved the most militarily, have achieved everything that they set out to achieve, and now they would rather not be fighting, preferring a political resolution according to their criteria. The Croats are also for a political resolution because they have a realistic assessment of the situation. The most absurd thing is that the militarily weakest side, the Muslim one, wants a military resolution, which Izetbegovic declares publicly--they want war! That is why they need weapons, because they have the people. Most of the Muslims' military forces are concentrated in Zenica, 15 km from Vitez, Busovaca, in other words central Bosnia. Their people are dying, but new people are continuously arriving. Not too much value is attached to human life there, especially among the mojahedin, who are fighting in the belief that if they die while fighting for a holy cause, they will live in paradise in the hereafter. Croats Not Indifferent About Border [Zvizdic] It is being said in the foreign press and in the Sarajevo media that an alliance between the Serbs and Croats in the war against the Muslims was agreed to in the Geneva Declaration. [Sancevic] Any affirmative response to that rumor would draw into question the consistency of President Tudjman's policy, would mean that that policy is hypocritical. And that is not true! No one has forced me to follow President Tudjman's policy; rather, I accept that policy as my own conviction, because I am convinced that that policy regarding Bosnia is fully justified. The Croats have agreed to all previous international options on resolving the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, from the Cutileiro proposal to the Owen-Stoltenberg plan, but agreements have faltered primarily on the issue of territory. The military situation today is such that the Serbs have pushed the Muslims out of eastern Bosnia, the Muslims are pushing the Croats out of central Bosnia, so that the Croat resistance to a further loss of territory is understandable. They cannot be indifferent to whether their border with the Bosnjak-Muslim republic, if that is what we call it, is at Lasva or at the upper Vrbas or at the lower Neretva, i.e., at the sea. The Muslims are insistently demanding an outlet on the sea, and a lot of the process has gotten stuck on that point. They Do Not Want the Sea for Swimming [Zvizdic] Do you want to say anything else about this demarcation? [Sancevic] President Tudjman has said all this very clearly, and he consistently puts forward these views, from the demand that the primary goal is to save lives and the need for Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina to have their own territory, such as Herceg-Bosna, to appreciation for the need to find solutions in ethnically mixed areas--and the Croats are almost exclusively mixed with Muslims--that will fully respect all the rights of the three nations. According to the peace initiative that President Tudjman put forward in Bonn, there is also the variant of a federation or confederation with a possible Bosnjak-Muslim republic, in which case issues concerning an outlet on the sea would fall away, because everyone would have the same rights. Izetbegovic does not accept that because he wants his own outlet on the sea, but not in order to go swimming there, but rather for strategic reasons. Fine, an outlet on the open seas could, if necessary, be closed in terms of the adjacent Croatian islands, but what will happen if some stronger force comes along and wants to use this Muslim outlet on the sea, which must be expected in a political-strategic sense! The situation with the Sava basin is also complex. Corridor and Sava Basin [Zvizdic] The biggest problem there concerns the Serb corridor. [Sancevic] There are people in the Sava basin and people from there who are now living elsewhere who think that everything should be as they have conceived of it in their own heads. Others have a realistic view of the situation there, while others still are considering some sort of compromise. Unfortunately, under certain other partition plans the Serbs gained a corridor across the Sava basin, which is a jugular vein for the so-called Serb republic and so-called Krajina, because that is how the people, food, and weapons that Belgrade is sending to Bosnia-Herzegovina and the occupied parts of Croatia are passing. That corridor is wide at the western end, extending from Doboj to Derventa and beyond to the Sava in the north; it is narrowest at Brcko, and then widens again toward Bijeljina. Aside from the Serb towns surrounding Brcko--Pelagicevo, Zabare, and Obudovac--which the Serbs systematically settled with soldiers from the Salonika front back in the first Yugoslavia, and which they reinforced in the second Yugoslavia in order to break up the Croat-Muslim majority there, Serbs are in the minority in this region. The Muslims are in the majority in Brcko, and all around there are plenty of Croat and Muslim towns leading from Majevica toward Brcko. It appears that they are holding open the prospect of the so-called southern route if the Sava corridor does not work out. However, that route passes over mountains, so that it is easier to cut off, while the Sava route is on flat land and is much more suitable to them. [Zvizdic] After everything that has happened and is happening, do you believe in some future alliance between the Muslims and Croats? [Sancevic] I firmly believe in it, because if I did not, I would not be here, I would not be the ambassador. I declare to you that all of President Tudjman's peace initiatives have included the desire for an alliance between the Croats and Muslims, because that alliance is in the interest of Croats from Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. That is the policy of the Croatian leadership, and I am working on it as much as I can. I also enjoy strong support in this, among other things, from the Croats of Muslim faith and from the Muslims who through their political convictions and party affiliation with the Croatian Muslim Democratic Party and the Muslim Democratic Party for Bosnia-Herzegovina clearly show that the SDA [Party of Democratic Action] does not have a political monopoly among adherents of the Muslim faith. My conviction in this regard is very clear. Stalling the Investigation Is Also a Crime [Zvizdic] What is your assessment of the threat of sanctions by the UN Security Council? [Sancevic] Confusion has arisen here surrounding sources of information, because all the secret services are working to pick up something and rush to announce it to their own people without looking at the whole story. Croatia has asked and received permission from the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government to keep its troops on Bosnia-Herzegovina soil in territory above Dubrovnik. As far as the allegation that HV units are in central Bosnia is concerned, that is a tall tale, because that conclusion cannot be drawn on the basis of the fact that HV identification cards were found on several captured HVO [Croat Defense Council] soldiers, while Croatia has said publicly that there are volunteers there who previously fought in HV units. [Zvizdic] What is your interpretation of the tragedy at the Sarajevo market? [Sancevic] Regardless of the results of the investigation, the crimes must be halted. Stalling the investigation, but also stalling an end to the killing, is nothing other than an excuse for the immorality of those who are conducting this investigation and everything surrounding it at a snail's pace. This is clearly not incidental, and that too is a crime.
