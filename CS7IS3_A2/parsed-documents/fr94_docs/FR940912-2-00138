FR940912-2-00138 FR940912-2-00095 DEPARTMENT OF STATE [Public Notice No. 2072] Shipping Coordinating Committee, International Maritime Organization (IMO) Legal Committee; Notice of Meeting The U.S. Shipping Coordinating Committee (SHC) will conduct an open meeting at 10:00 a.m., on Thursday, September 22, 1994, in Room 6103 of U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. The purpose of this meeting is to prepare for the 71st Session of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Legal Committee to be held October 10&hyph;14, 1994. To facilitate the attendance of those participants who may be interested in only certain aspects of the public meeting, the first subject addressed will be the draft International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea (HNS Convention). The second major subject, which will be considered at approximately 11:30 a.m., will be possible revisions to the 1976 Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims ('76 LLMC). The current draft of the HNS Convention imposes strict liability upon the shipowner with an additional international fund (second-tier fund) modeled after the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund. The draft HNS Convention provides compensation for environmental damage as well as personal injury and property damage from a broad range of substances. At the 70th Session, the Legal Committee finalized decisions on several issues regarding the draft HNS Convention and agreed in principle on several others. However, other important questions remain to be resolved, such as: (1) Whether receivers or importers should pay into the second-tier instead of shippers and exporters; (2) whether transshipment receivers will be required to pay into the second-tier; and (3) whether domestic voyages of seagoing vessels will be covered by the draft HNS Convention and similarly be required to contribute to the second-tier. The Legal Committee resumed deliberations on the '76 LLMC at the 70th Session. Several decisions were made, and discussion centered on a draft protocol which provides for raising the limits of liability and a streamlined tacit amendment procedure. Work will continue at the 71st session in October. The '76 LLMC has been in force since December 1, 1986, and has been ratified by 22 nations. Although the United States has not ratified the '76 LLMC, interests within the United States_such as owners of foreign flag vessels and passengers on foreign flag vessels_may be affected by changes to the Convention. The views of the public are requested. Members of the public are invited to attend the SHC meeting, up to the seating capacity of the room. For further information or to submit views concerning the subjects of discussion, contact either Captain David J. Kantor or Lieutenant Commander Steven D. Poulin, U.S. Coast Guard (G&hyph;LMI), 2100 Second Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20593, telephone (202) 267&hyph;1527, telefax (202) 267&hyph;4496. Dated: September 1, 1994.
