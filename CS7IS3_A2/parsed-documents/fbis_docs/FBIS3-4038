Germany increased its exports to the territory by 14 percent last year over 1992 to reach 25 billion H.K. dollars (3.2 billion U.S. dollars), of which more than half were subsequently re-exported to the Chinese mainland and other regional markets. Clothing makes up over two thirds of Hong Kong's domestic exports to Germany. Among other major exports were watches, office machinery, photographic equipment and jewelry. The TDC released the figures following a recent two-day Hong Kong-Chinese mainland business trip by a 24-member delegation from the Nuremberg Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Germany. "The Far East and China are the markets of the future. We are encouraging our members to seek joint ventures in China either directly, or through Hong Kong," said the chamber's President Gusti Drechsler was quoted as saying at the end of the trip. "Labor costs are high in Germany. Our company is considering manufacturing its products in China for sale in the Pacific Rim markets. Hong Kong could be conduit for this activity," a delegation member William Sell said.
