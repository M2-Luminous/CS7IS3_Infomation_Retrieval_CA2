FBIS4-56364 "drlat085_t_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-085 Daily Report 1 May 1994 Venezuela New President of Banco Central Takes Office New President of Banco Central Takes Office PA0205195194 Madrid EFE in Spanish 1706 GMT 1 May 94 PA0205195194 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Caracas, 1 May (EFE) -- Antonio Casas Gonzalez, who was appointed new president of Banco Central of Venezuela (BCV), took office today, Sunday, and called an urgent meeting of the bank's board of directors. Casas Gonzalez was appointed BCV president after the unexpected 26 April resignation of Ruth de Krivoy, who held that post for the past two years. Krivoy resigned alleging deep differences with the way the government had handled the delicate financial crisis in mid-January when Banco Latino, the country's second most important one at the time, was intervened. After the Latino Bank crisis, an additional eight banks had to receive assistance of the state, which diverted almost 5 billion [currency unspecified] in financial aid to prevent a massive bankruptcy of banks. During the past weeks President Rafael Caldera assigned Gustavo Roosen, intervener of Banco Latino, to design a plan that will restore confidence in the financial system and lower the ceiling on interest rates, which is over 60 percent. This decision by Caldera and other decisions by Roosen to carry out the assigned task were viewed by Krivoy as state interference in monetary policy affairs, which Venezuelan laws reserve for the BCV and, therefore, shows a lack of respect for the bank's autonomy. After learning of Krivoy's resignation, the government and Senate agreed to appoint Casas Gonzalez, who up until that time had represented the state-owned Venezuelan Petroleum before the British Government and other European countries. Following Krivoy's resignation, the local stock market got out of control "completely, and the Venezuelan bolivar suffered" a heavy devaluation compared to the U.S. dollar. This will be the first problem the new BCV authorities will resolve. Economists Domingo Maza Zavala and Miguel Ignacio Purroy and Casas Gonzalez were sworn in as new BCV directors. Casas Gonzalez, an economist, was deputy minister of development between 1969 and 1972 and planning minister between 1972 and 1974, both times under the Caldera administration. The Senate unanimously supported his appointment as BCV president.
