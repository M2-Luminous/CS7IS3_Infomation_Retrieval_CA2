(14) Each survey shall be conducted at a time and in a covered area selected by EPA no earlier than two weeks before the date of the survey. (15) The procedure for seeking EPA approval for a survey program plan shall be as follows: (i) The survey program plan shall be submitted to the Administrator of EPA for EPA's approval no later than September 1 of the year preceding the year in which the surveys will be conducted; and (ii) Such submittal shall be signed by a responsible corporate officer of the refiner, importer, or oxygenate blender, or in the case of a comprehensive survey program plan, by an officer of the organization coordinating the survey program. (16) (i) No later than December 1 of the year preceding the year in which the surveys will be conducted, the contract with the surveyor to carry out the entire survey plan shall be in effect, and an amount of money necessary to carry out the entire survey plan shall be paid to the surveyor or placed into an escrow account with instructions to the escrow agent to pay the money over to the surveyor during the course of the conduct of the survey plan. (ii) No later than December 15 of the year preceding the year in which the surveys will be conducted, the Administrator of EPA shall be given a copy of the contract with the surveyor, proof that the money necessary to carry out the plan has either been paid to the surveyor or placed into an escrow account, and if placed into an escrow account, a copy of the escrow agreement. ยง80.69 Requirements for downstream oxygenate blending. The requirements of this section apply to all reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygenate blending, or RBOB, to which oxygenate is added at any oxygenate blending facility. (a) Requirements for refiners and importers. For any RBOB produced or imported, the refiner or importer of the RBOB shall: (1) Produce or import the RBOB such that, when blended with a specified type and percentage of oxygenate, it meets the applicable standards for reformulated gasoline; (2) In order to determine the properties of RBOB for purposes of calculating compliance with per-gallon or averaged standards, conduct tests on each batch of the RBOB by: (i) Adding the specified type and amount of oxygenate to a representative sample of the RBOB; and (ii) Determining the properties and characteristics of the resulting gasoline using the methodology specified in ยง80.65(e); (3) Carry out the independent analysis requirements specified in ยง80.65(f); (4) Determine properties of the RBOB which are sufficient to allow parties downstream from the refinery or import facility to establish, through sampling and testing, if the RBOB has been altered or contaminated such that it will not meet the applicable reformulated gasoline standards subsequent to the addition of the specified type and amount of oxygenate; (5) Transfer ownership of the RBOB only to an oxygenate blender who is registered with EPA as such, or to an intermediate owner with the restriction that it only be transferred to a registered oxygenate blender; (6) Have a contract with each oxygenate blender who receives any RBOB produced or imported by the refiner or importer that requires the oxygenate blender, or, in the case of a contract with an intermediate owner, that requires the intermediate owner to require the oxygenate blender to: (i) Comply with blender procedures that are specified by the contract and are calculated to assure blending with the proper type and amount of oxygenate; (ii) Allow the refiner or importer to conduct quality assurance sampling and testing of the reformulated gasoline produced by the oxygenate blender; (iii) Stop selling any gasoline found to not comply with the standards under which the RBOB was produced or imported; and (iv) Carry out the quality assurance sampling and testing that this section requires the oxygenate blender to conduct;
