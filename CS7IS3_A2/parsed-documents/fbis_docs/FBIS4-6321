FBIS4-6321 "dreas076_d_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-076 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 South Korea IAEA Inspection `Basic Obligation' IAEA Inspection `Basic Obligation' SK2004102494 Seoul YONHAP in English 1013 GMT 20 Apr 94 SK2004102494 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 20 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the United States are still willing to suspend this year's joint military exercise "Team Spirit" if North Korea allow satisfactory nuclear inspections, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said Wednesday. "Whether Team Spirit will resume this year depends entirely upon North Korea," he told a press conference with foreign correspondents, "whether North Korea allows necessary inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) or not." The remarks came immediately after defense ministers of the two countries agreed to go ahead with the annual maneuver in November if the inspection issue is not settled by then. Seoul and Washington had announced last month Team Spirit suspension for 1994 on condition that the IAEA inspection on North Korea concludes in satisfaction. But IAEA inspectors reported they were hindered from full monitoring activities and were denied access to critical sites necessary in guaranteeing nuclear safeguards. Han held Pyongyang responsible for the delayed North Korea-U.S. high-level talks, blaming the Stalinist state for not keeping its end of the bargain. "The meeting with the United States on North Korea's part is not simply a right it has but a favor U.S. can give," said Han, "IAEA inspection obligation is a basic obligation." Pyongyang cannot expect the favor without fulfilling this basic obligation, he told the correspondents. There are two types of necessary inspections, one necessary for maintaining the monitoring equipment such as cameras in operation, and the other for guaranteeing continuity in safeguards, the part that was left incomplete in March. "One of the key conditions not met for the 3rd round (of North Korea-U.S.Talks) is the completion of the March inspection necessary for continuity of safeguards," he said. "Inspection itself or promise of inspection will have to take place before any discussion between United States and North Korea." But despite all the frustrations, the international community still insists on diplomatic settlement of the crisis, he noted. "...Despite our frustration caused by Pyongyang's intransigence, we must continue our on-going efforts to settle the issue through dialogue," said Han. Asked about any guarantee of China's consent when the matter is referred to strong action by the U.N. Security Council, the foreign minister emphasized that the North Korean ally has played a positive role in the past through the process of diplomatic efforts. "If such efforts all fail, then China will cooperate with the rest of the international community in trying to pursue whatever means possible to make North Korea comply," he said.
