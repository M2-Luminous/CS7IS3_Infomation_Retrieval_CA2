FBIS4-58863 "drnes089_a_94006" FBIS-NES-94-089 Daily Report 9 May 1994 ARAB AFRICA Algeria Authorities Must Admit `Illegal' Status Authorities Must Admit `Illegal' Status LD0905100094 Paris Radio France International in French 0630 GMT 9 May 94 LD0905100094 Paris Radio France International French BFN [Text] The failure of yesterday's demonstration for dialogue in Algiers is doubtless partly due to the fact that some of the legal political circles did not take part, but mainly to the fact that it was boycotted by the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS]. According to the daily AL-WATAN, the reason is that the slogans chosen were a concession to the authorities, and the organizers did not enjoy credibility. Furthermore, the FIS apparently blamed these organizers for refusing to call for the release of its leaders and for the rehabilitation of the movement. Evidently the proclamation by the new Algerian authorities of dialogue without exceptions is not meeting with much response from the Islamists of the FIS. It must be said that the FIS is setting very hard conditions before agreeing to hold discussions. For the FIS, before any discussion, the authorities have to admit that they themselves are illegal. Hachemi Sahnouni, a founding member of the FIS, explains: [Begin Sahnouni recording] In December-January, the authorities contacted us via the dialogue commission. They contacted several Islamist tendencies of the FIS [as heard], and then nothing. They did not contact me or people in contact with me. We can negotiate, in the hope of arriving at the following goal: Namely that the authorities admit that they are illegal, that they do not represent the Algerian people, and they must give in to the demands of the people. Otherwise there is no point in negotiating. If we negotiate in order to allow the current authorities to remain in power, so that the problems of the people remain the same, or perhaps get worse, I see it as being pointless to negotiate.
