[Akashi] Yes, and I had no illusions. In peace-keeping operations, there are no easy missions and each one is unique. It requires patience, obstinacy, and flexibility. The record in the former Yugoslavia is fairly positive. Problems remain, but I can see light at the end of the tunnel. [Lasserre] You are accused of being conciliatory toward the Bosnian Serbs. What is your answer? [Akashi] People think that the United Nations can impose its will on the warring sides. That is not true. Moreover, the sad fate of negotiators is that they are not able to choose those with whom they negotiate, or to display their preferences. We have spent the most time with the Serbs, and we have shown an extremely firm attitude. We can be proud of what we have done. [Lasserre] Why did you refuse to use force in Gorazde? [Akashi] The threat of air strikes was enough and very useful to the negotiations. We succeeded without having to use force. [Lasserre] Do you not have the impression of being used by the Serbs and serving their interests? [Akashi] Not at all. The United Nations has its own viewpoint. We are the bridge across which the different sides continue to talk. It would be the end of the UN mission if it were seen as a participant in this war. [Lasserre] What do you think of Radovan Karadzic? Do you regard him as a man of peace? [Akashi] You will read that in my memoirs... The leaders with whom I am negotiating represent their populations. I make no difference between them. I try to be as objective and impartial as possible. [Lasserre] You have been strongly criticized. The Bosnian Government has called for your resignation. Are you affected by that? [Akashi] Not much. I am calm and not very sensitive to pressure. The UN secretary general has expressed his complete confidence in me. I have enough strength not to listen to rumors, most especially those coming from people who know nothing of the situation. It is easy to simplify matters. But the real situation is never black or white, but somewhere between the two, in a gray area. [Lasserre] So, you do not question your method, i.e., negotiation, and its limits? [Akashi] No. Why always be so pessimistic and overdramatize things? We must fight against the simplistic solutions demanded by impatient people. Negotiations must be carried out with everybody and must succeed in the long term. The Serbs are not unmoved by our arguments. [Lasserre] Will the United Nations emerge unchanged from the former Yugoslavia? [Akashi] If we succeed, the United Nations will emerge from here stronger than before. If we fail, it will suffer a setback from which it will be difficult to recover for 10 years. But peace here cannot be built without the United Nations. Here, we sometimes show signs of weakness, but we are indispensible. In the final analysis, it is the aspirations of the peoples of Bosnia which will determine our success or failure. [Lasserre] Has your action in Cambodia and then in the former Yugoslavia served Japan and its ambition to join the UN Security Council? [Akashi] I have not served Japanese interests and I am embarrassed by my country's timidity. I have urged my political friends to send troops to the former Yugoslavia. I criticize them for not having done so yet. If my work one day makes it possible to arouse more active participation in the peacekeeping operations, I will be happy.
