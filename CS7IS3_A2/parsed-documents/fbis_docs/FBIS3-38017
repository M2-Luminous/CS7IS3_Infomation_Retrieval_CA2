The latest confirmation of this is the news "double" just seen in Japan -- YOMIURI SHIMBUN has informed the Japanese about what Yeltsin intends to say in his message to parliament at the end of the month, and KYODO has told them where Chernomyrdin will be leading the country when he presents the new budget. The Japanese agency got its hands on a copy of the speech which Prime Minister Chernomyrdin is expected to deliver soon in parliament. According to the document acquired by the Japanese, the Russian head of government will announce a strengthening of state control of the economy, prices, and the process of the economic management of enterprises. At the same time Chernomyrdin will declare his intention to continue the reforms, but he will emphasize that, if need be, the state will intervene actively in economic matters. Price control will be revived in sectors where state enterprises dominate. This control is expected to entail enterprises' signing price agreements on government recommendations. Apart from that, enterprises will be obliged to coordinate with the government the price levels for their output, the level of wages, and ways in which the profit obtained will be disposed of. This coordination will be a basic condition for enterprises to receive state subsidies and credits. As far as privatization is concerned, Chernomyrdin will promise to continue it but will note that, when it leads to increased prices, the need for a monopolized market will remain. As the Japanese, now familiar with a document that has yet to be delivered, are observing, in general the premier's report stresses that the reforms will continue, the planned economy is not being revived, and what is intended is merely a question of strengthening elements of state administrative control which, in fact, are routine throughout the rest of the world. With the help of these elements Chernomyrdin will promise to knock inflation down to a level of 7-9 percent by the end of the year. For the uninformed it is interesting to know that in his future speech the Russian president will devote a whole paragraph in the section on international policy to relations with Japan. As YOMIURI reports, citing reliable sources close to the president in Moscow, there are as many as five different versions of this paragraph. All of them note that Russia and Japan must develop mutual relations, particularly in the economic sphere, basing themselves on agreements reached during Boris Yeltsin's visit to Tokyo last year. The differences among the five versions are small in principle and concern the formulation of the most delicate question in bilateral relations -- the territorial question. Moscow sources have revealed to YOMIURI that in some versions the territorial question is not mentioned at all, in others it is not mentioned "by name," while in the most "specific" version it is designated as existing but linked to Russian domestic difficulties. The sources stated in addition that Russia cannot neglect relations with Japan but that the president's speech will, as far as possible, give the subject short shrift in order not to "upset nationalists at home." In short, Tokyo is already studying our leaders' upcoming speeches while we here continue to follow Russian events through foreign sources. News here is clearly fresher and more up to date....
