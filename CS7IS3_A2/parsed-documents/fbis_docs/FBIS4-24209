FBIS4-24209 "drafr123_c_94020" FBIS-AFR-94-123 Daily Report 27 Jun 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 27 Jun South African Press Review for 27 Jun MB2706111494 MB2706111494 BFN [Editorial Report] BUSINESS DAY ANC Internal Rivalry -- The editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 27 June on page 8 begins by stating that the recent restructuring of the ANC shows that "the phenomenon of parliamentary versus extra-parliamentary politics...will continue long into the future." The editorial suggests that "the development of `people's power' outside the Parliament...strengthens the hand of ANC secretary-general Cyril Ramaphosa in the contest for ANC leadership" once Nelson Mandela resigns. While, noting that the extra-parliamentary forces have opportunities "to restrain government excesses," the paper warns against efforts "to advance shortsighted, populist causes by, say, opposing attempts to impose fiscal discipline or liberalise the economy." SOWETAN East Rand Violence -- "We urge the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] regional government of Tokyo Sexwale to make East Rand townships a top priority in the unfolding of the Reconstruction and Development Plan [RDP]." So says an editorial on page 12 of Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 27 June. The editorial charges that the causes of violence in East Rand townships are the badly deteriorated infrastructure and high unemployment. To combat the problem, the paper urges "haste in ensuring that ordinary people begin to see tangible results of the RDP." "Upgrading of Reef townships," the paper argues, should take priority over projects such as refurbishing the Johannesburg City Hall. BEELD President's Example "Worthy of Emulation" -- "The days are obviously past when the ANC pampered rebellious youngsters who refused to go to school," says an editorial on page 6 of the Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 20 June. "Hence President Mandela's blunt words last week to the youth on the anniversary of the 16 June uprising: Roll up your sleeves, forget about protest, and tackle the country's problems in a culture of education and reconciliation. The message is not new. The difference is that this time it comes from a democratically elected president whose government has to deal with the enormous problems arising from the disruption of schools in the townships in recent years.... President Mandela emphasized his concern over the youth by adding that he will forfeit one-third of his salary to a fund to help street children, and children in detention, and poor children who wish to study. It is an example worthy of emulation by his political colleagues, the youth, teachers, and parents." Concern Over Truth Commission `Not Unfounded' -- The Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 21 June says in a page-10 editorial: "The concern of the Commissioner of Police Services over the damaging consequences of a Commission of Truth on certain ANC members in government will be taken with a pinch of salt in some circles....But his opposition to such a commission could possibly have more to do with the reasonably general fear in the inner circles of the old regime -- in political and security circles -- that only the sins of apartheid will be exposed, and that they alone will have to pay the price. If that is what the commissioner fears, he should say so outright. His fears are apparently not totally unfounded. By spelling out his opposition to the commission honestly, he will achieve more and hopefully ensure that the commission exposes the whole truth and, more important, achieves genuine reconciliation. The commission will only succeed in its aim if it is seen to be fair and just towards all parties, and if it probes in all directions impartially. If that is what the police chief is aiming at, then he ought to be given support." Child Health and Care -- A second editorial on page 10 of the same issue of BEELD says: "It is disturbing that South Africa has fallen so far behind in the provision of health and other care to its children....According to the UN Children's Fund, 16 African countries have attained a better standard of living for their children than South Africa, the continent's most prosperous country. Part of the solution lies in the provision of more and better health services, particularly among the neglected part of the population." But this, together with "the provision of specialized treatment where necessary," is not the whole solution. "To improve the living standards of the children, it is further necessary to persuade parents that smaller families are in everyone's interests.... The legitimacy of the new government offers it a golden opportunity to tackle this sensitive issue."
