Three times as many people wanted a referendum on further constitutional change in the European Union [EU] -- the subject for discussion at the next intergovernmental European conference in 1996. That left 60 per cent in favour of a constitutional referendum, compared with 21 per cent favouring a referendum on a single currency, due to be introduced by other EU states from 1999. When ICM asked people whether they would be more or less likely to vote Labour if it made a firm commitment to a single currency, nearly half said they would be less likely to do so, while 18 per cent would be more likely. A quarter said it would make no difference. The most marked antipathy towards a single currency, on the basis of that question, was shown by Conservative supporters, but even 58 per cent of Liberal Democrats said it would make them less likely to vote Labour. compared with only 38 per cent of existing Labour supporters. The stronger support of Labour voters for Europe was also shown when those interviewed were asked whether they would be more or less likely to vote Labour if the party made a firm commitment to closer political integration. Among Labour voters, that question scored a positive rating of eight points (34 per cent more likely to vote Labour; 26 per cent less likely). While the overall negative rating was 31 points on the single currency question, that fell to a negative rating of only nine points on closer political integration, with 29 per cent more likely to vote Labour; 38 per cent less likely. That ambivalence became more pronounced when ICM asked whether people would be more or less likely to vote Labour if it made a firm commitment to halt any further shift of sovereignty from Westminster to Brussels: 35 per cent said more likely, 35 per cent less likely, and 23 per cent that it would make no difference. With the European parliamentary elections taking place on 9 June, the debate between the Government and the Opposition parties revolves around two questions -- the public hostility towards Brussels centralisation, and the fear of being left behind in the second division of a two tier European Union. The Conservative campaign centres on the charge that Labour favours socialist centralisation, while Labour argues that the Tories will opt into the second division. ICM asked: "If all members of the European Union cannot agree to a timetable for economic and political integration, do you think those willing to proceed should go ahead anyway, or should all countries proceed together even if it means slowing down the process?" While a fifth (21 per cent) said those willing to go ahead should do so, almost three-quarters (73 per cent) preferred a united, slower pace -- compared with just over a half (56 per cent) when the same question was put in October 1992. That increase in the fear of isolation could help Labour when the Conservatives are playing up John Major's Maastricht opt-outs, and senior Tories are mooting withdrawal or use of the veto to block further integration -- a move that could lead to a two-tier development. But when people were asked whether further economic and political integration should be accelerated or slowed down, 63 per cent wanted it slowed down, while 23 per cent wanted it accelerated -- an eight point increase on the 15 per cent wanting acceleration in October 1992.
