FR940831-0-00064 FR940831-0-00025 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Research and Special Programs Administration 49 CFR Part 172 [Docket No. HM&hyph;145J; Amdt. No. 172&hyph;135] RIN 2137&hyph;AC56 Hazardous Substances AGENCY: Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule; decision on petition for reconsideration. SUMMARY: On June 20, 1994, RSPA amended the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) by designating 15 hazardous substances as hazardous materials and amending the reportable quantity (RQ) for 34 other hazardous substances already designated as hazardous materials. Petitioners, metals mining and refining companies, requested that the rule modify the HMR to except from the hazardous material designation copper, molybdenum and zinc concentrates containing small amounts of lead sulfide, a hazardous substance. Alternatively, petitioners asked that the effective date of the rule be stayed to allow for the docket to be opened for public comment. The petition is denied. The effective date of that part of the rule that reduces the RQ for lead sulfide is extended for 90 days. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 31, 1994. The effective date of that part of the rule, published on June 20, 1994 (59 FR 31822) revising Table 1 in Appendix A to §172.101 that reduces the RQ for lead sulfide is extended from August 29, 1994 to November 29, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background On June 20, 1994 (59 FR 31822), RSPA amended the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR), 49 CFR parts 171&hyph;180, by revising the ``List of Hazardous Substances and Reportable Quantities,'' an Appendix to the Hazardous Materials Table at 49 CFR 172.101. The rule added 15 hazardous substances to the Appendix and, for 34 other hazardous substances, reduced the ``Reportable Quantity'' (RQ), the amount of a hazardous substance in a single package that, under 49 CFR 171.8, subjects it to regulation under the HMR. The rule implements the mandate under section 306(a) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. 9656(a). Section 9602(a) of CERCLA directs the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), through rulemaking, to: (1) Designate as ``hazardous substances'' materials that ``when released into the environment may present substantial danger to the public health or welfare or the environment''; and (2) establish the RQ for each hazardous substance. The RQ is the amount of a hazardous substance that, if released, requires notification of the National Response Center. 42 U.S.C. 9603(a). Section 9656(a) directs that each hazardous substance designated by the EPA ``shall .␣.␣. at the time of such listing or designation .␣.␣. be listed and regulated as a hazardous material'' by the Secretary of Transportation under Federal hazardous material transportation law (Federal hazmat law), 49 U.S.C. 5101 et seq . The Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) carries out the rulemaking responsibilities of the Secretary of Transportation under 49 U.S.C. 5101 et seq . RSPA's June 20, 1994 rule revised the HMR to incorporate additional hazardous substance designations and RQ modifications made by the EPA in five rulemakings between November 1990 and June 1993 (55 FR 46354, Nov. 2, 1990; 55 FR 50450, Dec. 6, 1990; 57 FR 37194, Aug. 18, 1992; 57 FR 47376, Oct. 15, 1992; 58 FR 35314, June 30, 1993). The final rule was issued without public notice or an opportunity for comment. The preamble stated: In accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), RSPA has determined that a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment and review are impracticable and unnecessary. [CERCLA] mandates that the Department of Transportation list and regulate, as hazardous materials under 49 CFR Parts 171&hyph;180, hazardous substances designated by the EPA under CERCLA. The EPA is the sole agency authorized to designate hazardous substances and their reportable quantities [RQ's]. Therefore, public comment and review are unnecessary because: (1) The public was afforded time to comment when the EPA published its notice of proposed rulemaking concerning that agency's change in the subject RQ's; and (2) RSPA does not have the authority to designate hazardous substances or determine their reportable quantities. A hazardous substance listed in the Appendix to 49 CFR 172.101 is regulated under the HMR as a Class 9 hazardous material, when an amount equal to or exceeding the RQ of the substance is transported in a single package. 49 CFR 171.8. If the hazardous substance is in a mixture or in solution, it is regulated only when the concentration of the hazardous substance equals or exceeds a concentration that depends on the RQ of the substance, as follows: ␣ 1RQ, pounds (kilograms) 1Concentration (by weight percent) 5000␣(2270) 10 1000␣(454) 2 100␣(45.4) 0.2 10␣(4.54) 0.02 1␣(0.454) 0.002
