A panel of all the Constitutional Court judges, headed by Judge Hwang To-yon, handed down the ruling in an appeal filed by Rep. Pak Chan-chong of the new Political Reform Party and others. Pak and his colleagues argued that the Government Organization Law violates the Constitution by putting the intelligence agency under the president, not the prime minister. "The NSP could not be included in administrative ministries and offices' as specified in the 86th provision of the Constitution," the ruling said. "It is a matter of course, therefore, that the NSP could not come under the control of the prime minister," it added. Rep. Pak and 56 lawyers including practicing attorney Chang Ki-uk filed the appeal in May 1989 when Song Chong-tae, an aide to Rep. Yi Chol, was arrested by the NSP on charges of violating the Military Secret Protection Law. They claimed that the NSP, which the government had no constitutional ground to establish, violated the Constitution when it arrested Song.
