Sharp Dispute Among Clergy Over Sick Mothers' Abortions'] [Excerpts] According to the World Health Organization's [WHO] figures, the number of AIDS cases is rising constantly, and in just six years, that is, in the year 2000, the number of those infected with the virus will reach approximately 40 million, with 90 percent of these cases in the developing world! In the face of these dreadful figures, the Islamic Medical Sciences Organization organized its sixth juristic symposium, entitled "An Islamic View of the Social Problems of AIDS." It was held in Kuwait and attended by representatives of 35 countries of the world, among them Egypt, which sent a medical delegation headed by the Minister of Health and a number of Muslim ulema, led by His Excellency the Mufti of the Republic. They discussed extremely sensitive topics and issues, such as: The isolation of AIDS patients; the position on someone who spreads the virus intentionally; the rights and duties of an infected husband; the admissiblity of performing an abortion on an infected mother; the extent of her nursing and breastfeeding her healthy child; the right of a healthy spouse to seek separation from an infected spouse; the nature of the marital intimacy under these circumstances; and whether AIDS may be considered a fatal disease. The conference spent three days in study and lively discussions, and ended its closing session with a number of important proposals and recommendations. At the beginning of this symposium, which is the Islamic Medical Sciences Organization's first since the liberation of Kuwait, and held in cooperation with the Kuwaiti Ministry of Health, the Academy of Islamic Jurisprudence in Jeddah, and the regional office of the WHO in Alexandria. One hundred and thirty medical and Islamic figures representing 35 Islamic and non-Muslim countries set out, at the outset, the global AIDS situation with the last WHO reports prepared by Dr. Muhammad Hilmi Wahdan, WHO's Director of Disease Prevention and Treatment, followed by Dr. Muhammad Haytham al-Khayyat: In the space of just a decade, AIDS has become an epidemic affecting millions of men, women, and children on every continent. Despite the early cases that appeared among "sodomite" men in several industrialized countries, it has since then become a wide-ranging plague. [passage omitted] Disaster of the Developing Countries It is indeed strange that approximately 90 percent of expected AIDS cases are in the developing countries. The situation is critical in the sub-Saharan region of Africa, where the number of adults infected with the virus exceeds seven million. About a third of pregnant women who have visited pregnancy clinics in the cities are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. As a result, WHO now expects that by the year 2000, between 5 and 10 million HIV-infected children will have been born; by the mid-1990s--about one year from now--the anticipated increase in juvenile AIDS deaths will be equal to the decrease in deaths achieved by the Save the Children program over the last two decades! The average life expectancy at birth in these African countries before the spread of the AIDS virus rose 20 percent, but it will actually drop 5 to 10 percent by 2000, instead of rising, had it not been for the AIDS virus. Egypt participated in this symposium with a high-ranking medical delegation led by Minister of Heath Dr. 'Ali 'Abd-al-Fattah al-Makhzanji and a host of Egypt's medical notables: Dr. Ibrahim Badran; professor of pediatrics Dr. Ahmad Mustafa 'Isa; dean of medicine at 'Ayn Shams University Dr. Salah 'Id; Dr. Hasan Hathut, a native of Egypt who held the highest post in the Kuwaiti Ministry of Health; Dr. Hamid Shatlah, professor of pediatrics at 'Ayn Shams; Dr. Usamah Ruslan, secretary general of the Egyptian Doctors' Syndicate; Dr. 'Abd-al-Mun'im Abu-al-Fattuh; and the "dynamo" of the conference, Professor Dr. Ahmad Raja'i al-Jundi, the second man in the Islamic Medical Sciences Organization serving as assistant secretary general after Professor Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman al-'Awadi, the secretary general and former Kuwaiti minister of health and planning. A number of senior Muslim ulema from Egypt also took part in this juristic and medical symposium, most prominently His Excellency the Mufti of the Republic Dr. Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi, Muslim preacher, Dr. Yusuf al-Qardawi, and rector of al-Azhar University Dr. 'Abd-al-Fattah al-Shaykh. Islamic Medical Cooperation The fact is that the scientific, medical, and Islamic interaction was clear during the symposium's heated debates. The topics were not the traditional ones, as is the case in many conferences. Specific topics were brought up, relating to AIDS victims, which required decisive judgements from the ulema, researchers, and physicians taking part, on every case separately. Among the cases upon which judgements were made, were the ruling on isolating AIDS patients; on the intentional transmission of the virus; the rights and duties of an AIDS-infected spouse; performing abortion on an AIDS-infected mother; the admissibility of an infected mother nursing her healthy baby; the right of a healthy spouse to request separation from an infected partner; and the right of marital intimacy. These are all, as we can see, thorny and sensitive issues many ulema would hesitate to approach, but in this instance they talked with frankness and clarity, on the basis that there is no shame in science and religion. They discussed the issue of isolating AIDS patients, and the senior physicians participating said that the AIDS virus is not transmitted through cohabitation, touch, breathing, through insects, sharing food, drink, toilet facilities, swimming pools or chairs, nor even through sharing eating utensils, or other aspects of living together in normal daily life. The virus is transmitted, however, chiefly through sexual contact of any kind, the transfusion of contaminated blood or its derivatives, the use of contaminated needles, especially among drug users, or transmission from an infected mother to her child. In accordance with all this, the ulema in the symposium resolved that there was no justification for isolating infected pupils, workers, or others from their healthy colleagues. The symposium dealt with the issue of intentional transmission of the AIDS virus to healthy persons by any means, which the ulema viewed as forbidden and as gravely sinful and criminal, requiring temporal punishment. This punishment should vary to suit the degree of seriousness of the deed and its effect on individuals and society. Combatting Those Spreading the Virus Intentionally The purpose of those intentionally spreading this deadly disease in society, and this deed, is a type of war and corruption on earth; one of the punishments stipulated for it in the [Koranic] Verse of the al-Harabah--if the purpose in intentionally spreading the virus is harm to a specific person, and the virus actually is transmitted, and leads to the death of the one to whom it was transmitted--would be retaliatory death, or execution. If the purpose in intentionally spreading the virus is to harm a specific person, but the virus is not transmitted to him, then the perpetrator must receive a restraining punishment. The symposium also touched on the issue of abortion for an AIDS-infected mother. On this issue there was a clear difference among the ulema, but they cited a judgement reached by the Islamic Medical Sciences Organization in a previous conference on Childbearing in Islam, which ruled on abortion that the fetus is alive from the beginning of conception, and that its life is inviolable at all stages, and that there could be no harm inflicted on it by abortion except in cases of extreme medical need. Some participants, however, sharply disagreed with this judgement, saying that abortion is permissible before the fortieth day of pregnancy, especially when there are good reasons. Participating members of the symposium discussed the issue of AIDS-infected mothers nursing their healthy babies, citing the views of pediatrics professors, among whom, as we have mentioned, from Egypt, Dr. Ahmad Mustafa 'Issa, professor of pediatrics and president of the Egyptian Friends of Mothers' Milk Society, Dr. Hamid Shatlah, professor of pediatrics at 'Ayn Shams, pointed out that according to current medical data there is no certain danger in an AIDS-infected mother nursing her healthy baby. This is an instance of normal cohabitative intercourse. The view of the ulema in this symposium, based on this data, is that in Islamic law there is no impediment to the mother's nursing. Prevention for Child of an Infected Mother While the likelihood of a healthy child being infected by his AIDS-infected mother through breastfeeding is extremely rare, when it has been found to be the case, it was due to the presence of the virus in the mother's milk or the mother's blood, transmitted to the baby's mouth due to a crack in the nipple. The mother may breastfeed for its many benefits, and she must take care to reduce the likelihood of infecting her nursing child. She may refrain from breastfeeding if she can find a wet nurse to suckle it, or to give him alternatives to mother's milk to nourish him. They discussed the right of a healthy spouse to request a separation from an AIDS-infected partner, and concluded that either spouse may request a separation from an AIDS-infected partner, as it is an illness whose virus is transmitted chiefly through sexual contact. The topic of this unique symposium, held in Kuwait under the sponsorship of His Royal Highness Shaykh Jabir al-Ahmad al-Sabah, the Amir of Kuwait was the clarification of the rules of Islam on the effects of the spread of AIDS, and so the ulema and physicians found no embarrassment in discussing a sensitive topic, which was the right of marital intimacy in cases of AIDS infection. They concluded that if either partner were to be infected with this disease, then the uninfected partner may refrain from marital intimacy, because sexual contact is the major mode of transmitting the virus. If the healthy partner wishes to have sexual intimacy, then prudence requires him to use a condom, which reduces the likelihood of the virus and pregnancy, if he knows how to use it properly. The members of the symposium did not consider AIDS to be a fatal disease, until its symptoms appeared fully, and the patient was no longer able to pursue a normal life, and died. Ten Years of AIDS Addressing the importance of this symposium, and the Islamic view of the social problems of AIDS, Egyptian scientist Prof. Dr. Ahmad Raja'i al-Jundi, assistant secretary general of the Islamic Medical Sciences Organization spoke to AKHIR SA'AH. He said: "For 10 years the world has been devastated by this plague of our time, whose like the world has not yet seen. Before this sickness research is helpless to offer treatment, with those infected condemned to death, even though that may be after some time. This great threat to humanity confirms the words of the Prophet: "`If fornication spreads among a people, and they flaunt it, pains and illnesses that they never had before will appear on them.' If we consider this saying of the Prophet, we see that it speaks of fornication and the flaunting of it. "Now, with a passing glance, we find that the Western and Eastern worlds take pride in the absolute freedom which has given people sexual freedom so that they are more like animals than people, to the point that in the last conference on human rights, one of the points of conflict between the advanced countries and the Islamic group was complete, unrestricted freedom, including sexual freedom, in which they take pride, disdaining our Muslim countries. And now they are reaping what they have sown, with this calamitous plague sweeping the world, which may annihilate it if science does not find decisive solutions to this problem in the very near future. "The poor countries of Africa, and those of East Asia, are today seeing some villages being wiped out of existence by this dangerous disease. One of the common sights now is to see whole villages whose young people are gone, those who would been producing or working, while the overwhelming majority still alive are old men and children! "Fortunately, in our Islamic region the effects of the virus are still under control, and far less than in other, Western countries. Perhaps the most important difference between us is our adherence to the teachings of Islam. Virtue and chastity still have their place among Muslim peoples; right and wrong have their roots in our peoples' consciences. Adultery is still a major crime in our societies. We must commit ourselves even more to the Koranic verse, `Approach not adultery; it is an abomination and an evil path.'" Protection from Vice "If we consider this verse carefully, we see that the ban on adultery came with a warning not to approach it; approaching it means the ways leading to it, whether by way of the woman taking the steps necessary to protect herself by wearing modest Islamic clothing, and saving her adornments for her husband; or with men avoiding temptation, so that Satan will not seduce him into vice. "The Prophet, God's peace and blessings be upon him, said, `O community of young men, let those of you who can provide, get married, and let those who cannot, fast and abstain.' Thus we are all asked to facilitate marriage for the young, to safeguard the resources of the Islamic community from being lost, for the young are the pillar of the community. "It is not, however, merely a question of marriage. How many married men and women do we see betraying the vows they made to God? So the important thing, the more serious thing, is to raise our youth and the new generation in a purely Islamic way, for God's sake. They should know the limits God has set, and have certain knowledge that God is watching them, and that He knows what the eyes betray, and what is hidden in their hearts. They must learn to judge themselves before others judge them. If we can plant these virtues in them, we can guarantee them a safe, serene, secure life, no matter what modern challenges face them, sexual or non-sexual. "It is expected that by the year 2000 the number of AIDS cases will grow to 40 million, and this staggering number will cause a great many social problems. There are many groups, including AIDS groups, which have been able, through their political influence, to politicize the disease. Perhaps most of these are in America, England, and France; they do not hide their infection with AIDS, but help to spread it in order to reap many political and social gains. There are human rights groups that sympathize with these infected people, and there are groups of scientists interested in ethics who have all used their own reasoning, and made legislation, and given the sick and the infected many, many rights, at the expense of the well-being of their societies. "All this omits the Islamic view, with individual reasoning to fill the need of the Islamic community, which is `the best community raised up for mankind.' It is the first to lead with legislation, and the reasoning of its ulema and jurists is from known sources, which does not bring evil upon itself, from the holy Koran and the traditions of the Prophet. This is the main motive behind the holding of this symposium, "An Islamic View of the Social Problems of AIDS," under the sponsorship of His Highness the Amir of Kuwait, and the participation of men learned in Islamic jurisprudence, and the medical, social, and legal sciences from more than 35 Islamic and non-Islamic countries." Declaration of Conference Resolutions In the closing session held in the Islamic Medical Center in the Islamic Medical Sciences Organization, its secretary general, Professor Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman 'Abdallah al-'Awadi, announced the resolutions of this important conference: - It is the right of a person infected with the AIDS virus to obtain the treatment and health care required by his health condition, regardless of how he became infected with the virus. He must inform his doctor and the competent authorities of his infection, as a precaution against transmitting the virus to others. The doctor must treat him and take precautions against being infected himself; he must make the AIDS patient aware of ways of keeping his health from deteriorating, and keeping the virus from others. He must not be oppressed, slandered, or abandoned because of his illness. - To protect youth from sexual perversion, early marriage must be encouraged, and the obstacles to it, which cause the age of marriage to be delayed, should be removed. - It is the duty of official and popular bodies to take action to make members of society aware of the danger of AIDS, the ways in which the virus is spread, and methods of prevention--especially abstinence and an adherence to virtue. - Islamic precepts must be made part of the school curriculum at all educational levels, to complement the other subjects in building character, for the good of individuals and society, and to ensure the prevention of this plague. - The media has a significant role in making the public aware of the dangers of AIDS, and methods of preventing it, especially in promoting abstinence. The media must also avoid showing anything that might inflame the passions or sinful temptations. - Official agencies must offer the facilities needed to diagnose the AIDS infection on a widespread basis, as early detection has a real effect on preventing the spread of the disease. - This conference calls upon all religious and rational people throughout the world to join their ranks and efforts with Muslims in their call for abstinence, and combatting all means of sexual contact outside legal marriage.
