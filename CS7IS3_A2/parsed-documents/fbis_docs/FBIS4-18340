Giosue Calabria, a barrister in the central northern city of Bologna, claims the comments that Mussolini was "the greatest statesman of the this century" breach a 1952 law banning any public apology of fascism. Calabria said the 1952 law could lead to prosecutions against "anyone who publicly exults the officials, the principles, the facts or the methods of fascism," and should therefore apply to Fini's comments. Fini, whose National Alliance was in the three-party rightwing coalition which swept to a landslide victory in historic general elections on March 27-28, made the comments in an interview published Friday. In the daily LA STAMPA newspaper, Fini said Mussolini was "the greatest statesman of this century," adding that Silvio Berlusconi, whose Forza Italia dominates the winning alliance, was no match for Il Duce. "Berlusconi will have to run hard to show he is part of history like Mussolini," he said in the interview.
