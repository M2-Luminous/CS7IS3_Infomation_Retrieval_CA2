When flying over the target on the first occasion, the aircraft lost touch with the ground and had to drop their bombs and return in a hurry; on the second occasion, a 500-lb bomb was again mistakenly dropped into the city center of Gorazde, causing casualties among the civilians. The Pentagon assessed the results of the air raids as "very unsatisfactory" and cited "foul weather" as the cause. Having a firm belief in the operational functions of its aircraft, the Pentagon could only "blame the weather" and not the "aircraft." People might as well associate this with the political climate in the Bosnian situation, which is at least equally "foul": The ethnic relations are intricate and the historical resentments are entangled. In the face of such a situation, is not taking such military action as an air raid equally "irrelevant to the subject" and an act of mistakenly hitting "another target"? Viewed from the Bosnian situation after the air raids, this is not a groundless worry. Ground fighting in Gorazde has not stopped so far and shots are again being heard in Sarajevo, which has had a cease-fire for quite some time. The Serbs claim that, in future, they will hit back at NATO aircraft conducting the air raids and they have also detained UN peacekeeping personnel as "hostages." Apparently, the air raids conducted by NATO aircraft have failed to achieve the original intention of "attaining the greatest political objective with limited military action."
