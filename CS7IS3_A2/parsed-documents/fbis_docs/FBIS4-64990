He had talks yesterday with Edmond Alphandery, his French counterpart, and was the guest at a dinner given by the treasury chief, who is also chairman of the Paris Club. He is due to continue his tour in Brussels, London, Washington, and Tokyo. His aim is to prepare for his country's appearance before the Paris Club, probably at the end of May, with the aim of rescheduling Algeria's debt, which is estimated to be around $26 billion. The appearance before the Paris Club is now possible because Algiers signed its letter of intent with the IMF on 10 April, making provision in particular for a 40-percent devaluation of the dinar, the elimination of some subsidies on basic products, the liberalization of foreign trade, and the autonomous management of public enterprises. This agreement still has to be ratified by the IMF. In financial circles, it is estimated that this point should shortly be settled, thus opening the doors of the Paris Club. It is only after the rescheduling of the debt that Algeria can rely on bilateral or multilateral financial support. France could extend an agreement totaling 6.3 billion francs for 1994, like the one which was granted in 1993. The European Union is due to release ECU150 million, the residue of a package of ECU400 million granted in 1991. The decision in principle to release this money was made on 16 April. This should be implemented technically on 16 May during the council meeting of the Twelve's economy and finance ministers. On the same day, the Commission should make complementary proposals regarding financial aid.
