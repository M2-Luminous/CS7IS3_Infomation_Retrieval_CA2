The president's statements were made after he was asked to give his opinion on the report presented yesterday to Congress by Jorge Mario Garcia La Guardia, the human rights ombudsman. De Leon Carpio answered reporters questions shortly after swearing in Marithza Ruiz de Vielman, the new foreign minister who replaces Arturo Fajardo Maldonado. Here is what President de Leon Carpio said: [Begin recording] [De Leon Carpio] I am very pleased with this report, particularly regarding the right to life, which is a fundamental right. I have been unable to read it all, but, according to the comments I have read in the press and the document that I have--although I have been unable to read it all--there is a marked disagreement in the number of extrajudicial deaths, in the number of missing individuals, in the number of illegal arrests. Even though it has been spotlighted that there are more violations--that is, more accusations, 13,000 as opposed to 9,000 last year--half of the year or seven months correspond to the current government. As far as the numbers are concerned, I am satisfied. I can say sincerely that I am satisfied that the most credible institution--the institution that within the state is in charge of the defense, protection, and fostering of human rights--has issued a report in which although reality has been highlighted, it demonstrates progress; it demonstrates effort in these first seven months of my government. The numbers, as I said, are very satisfying. True, there are still serious problems with individual human rights; there are multiple accusations of human rights abuse, of violations of human economic, social, and cultural rights. Nevertheless, the current government does not want to be satisfied with the fact that out of those thousands of accusations, a lesser number of violations were proven regarding the previous year. The current government has the political willingness for the nonviolation of human rights in Guatemala; this is considering the qualitative side of human rights. At this phase and given that the former human rights ombudsman is now the president of the Republic, we cannot be satisfied that quantitatively we are better off than last year. Now is the time to consider the issue qualitatively. One cannot say human rights are being violated more or less; this is why we must prepare the necessary measures this year, after having consolidated the nation's institutions, after having consolidated the democratic system, which is still fragile. Nevertheless, we have made great progress. For example, one of these is the return of Communities of Resistance People under commissions that will be made public to you subsequently. Another example is the peace agreement that will be signed this year, in keeping with the framework agreement signed in Mexico. In this agreement both parties have agreed to sign a peace agreement this year. This demonstrates the political willingness that has to be made reality. We must eliminate the main source, something I always mentioned as human rights ombudsman; that is, the internal armed conflict which has been ongoing for more than 30 years. Once this armed conflict ends this year, fulfilling our commitment, the main cause, the main source of human rights violations will disappear. This is particularly true of the violations of the right to life, integrity, physical integrity, dignity, liberty, security and so on; therefore, there is progress. Yesterday you witnessed the fulfillment of another commitment: the departure of the military detachment from Tercer Pueblo. They departed from the urban area, leaving it for those who returned after being refugees for so many years in Mexico; that is, we are progressing, fulfilling our commitments. This does not mean we are not objective, that we do not accept the reality that exists in Guatemala. I reiterate: I am pleased with the report. We will analyze the report, read it more carefully; nevertheless, in principle, given the quantitative data, we are satisfied. This does not mean we do not have to initiate many actions and efforts so that Guatemala is not only analyzed if human rights are respected more or less here. Qualitatively, the situation should reach a level of absolute respect; this respect first should be of individual human rights, followed by the respect of economic, social, and cultural human rights. This is more difficult and does not depend totally on the government's political willingness, as their violations are the result of legal, political, economic, and social structures that have prevented the respect of these human rights. Meanwhile, I want to say that now that the study and analysis of Guatemala by the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva is drawing near, our goal is for Guatemala not to moved from one point to the other on the agenda. Our goal is for Guatemala to be considered as a nation where human rights are going to be fully respected. [Unidentified reporter] The report, it appears, has asked for or requested the dissolution of the Self-Defense Patrols. What is your position? [De Leon Carpio] This has a great advantage. In practice we are already doing this. In those areas in which these are no longer required--that is, the self defense committees or patrols--they have been converted into peace and development committees. Given their organization, once they do not have to have weapons, it is convenient, if they wish, to continue organizing, developing, and helping the community. This is part of what is being done this year, and I have issued orders in this regard. We will make public the number of patrols that have already been turned into peace and development councils; subsequently, this will continue to take place. In addition, there is the advantage, or we have the advantage, of the resumption of peace talks, where the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity and my government will definitely broach this issue. Given the commitment we have to sign peace this year, at this time there will have to be a demobilization, a disarmament of all the patrols that could still exist at that time. You will recall that in Huehuetenango a leader of the Civilian Self-Defense Patrols handed me a rifle that meant, in his words, that the moment the peace agreements are signed, he, in a symbolic gesture, would hand me the rifle because it meant there was no longer a need for them to be armed. In the meantime, following recommendations not only by the human rights ombudsman, but by the independent UN expert adviser Dr. Monica Pinto, we have instructed that the full force of the law be used in cases where patrolmen break the law or abuse power through the patrols and that impunity not be encouraged or made easy, which is often the case with these types of abuses committed by certain patrolmen. [Unidentified reporter] [question indistinct] [De Leon Carpio] I appreciate the question because right here I have a note from the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] requesting that the president of the Republic give Monday off because many public employees are working at the polling tables. It also allows many public employees who do not vote here, but in other municipalities instead, to cast their ballot. Regarding this, the presidency secretary general has sent the TSE a reply note to that request and suggestion. Not only will special permission be granted for Monday for those who work at the polling tables, but for all public workers. This will facilitate the comfortable move without problems, to their respective municipalities on Monday, in addition to celebrating the yes vote. [passage omitted] [Reporter] [Words indistinct] that you have been in direct contact with President Salinas. We want to know if there has been an official communication; if the Guatemalan Government has offered military help, in this case [words indistinct] in Chiapas? [De Leon Carpio] The relationship between President Salinas de Gortari and myself has always been very direct. This situation was strengthened even more at the meeting we held in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, at the Ibero-American presidential summit. Given the situation the Guatemalan, sorry, the Mexican people are suffering, I immediately contacted him to express my solidarity, to express through him to the Mexican people, the Guatemalan people and their government's grief. We know about this because we have been suffering these consequences for more than 30 years and we believe it is regrettable and unfair that the Mexican people now must endure the consequences of an insurgent force, of an armed conflict that only leaves behind widows, orphans, destruction, death, desolation, hate, and hostilities. We think it is unfair that the Mexican people should endure this, as in the end it is the people who suffer the greatest consequences. Therefore, we have been in contact; we have indicated to him that we have full faith in his capacity, we have faith in his government's ability. We hope that shortly, through dialogue and measures taken by the government, those who have mistakenly taken up arms will reconsider their position and realize that road is obsolete here, in Mexico, and in any part of the world. The road for changes, the peaceful, silent revolution, is that of the struggle, although no longer between brothers. Rather, now it is the struggle against corruption, the struggle against poverty, the struggle for economic and social development, and the struggle for an overall peace with social justice for all. We hope that this road can be reached. In this regard, there is a close relationship. There is no offer on the part of the Armed Forces or of the government to participate. We are very respectful of nations' sovereignty; in this case, a neighboring, friendly nation such as Mexico. What is certain is that we are prepared on our side of the border, on the Guatemalan side, to avoid any incursions by the subversive groups that have sprung up in Mexico. [end recording]
