This was reported by Yuriy Baturin, an aide to the Russian president for national security, in an interview to ITAR-TASS. According to him, the opposition groupings rejecting the Memorandum proposed by President Boris Yeltsin are preparing to hold major rallies and demonstrations in Moscow in May. To prevent a repeat of the events of May 1993, it is envisaged to use a number of technical contact-free means, including water-cannons. Yuriy Baturin stressed that in case of public order violations, legal mechanisms will be put into effect without delay, especially against those to whom the political amnesty was extended.
