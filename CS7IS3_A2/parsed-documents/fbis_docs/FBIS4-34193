[sentence as heard] Speaking before the heads of state attending the summit in Cartagena, Frei urged his colleagues to achieve economic development on the basis of social development and to combat poverty. The following is a report by our special correspondent. [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] All the heads of state attending the Fourth Ibero-American Summit are lodged at the Cartagena Hilton Hotel. Four thousand policemen and soldiers have been entrusted with the security of the visiting dignitaries. For this purpose, they have been detached throughout the hotel building and the city where many of them have to endure intense heat and humidity. Because of extreme weather conditions, the visiting heads of state arrived at the convention center wearing informal clothes. President Eduardo Frei was accompanied by his wife, Marta Larraechea. Sitting next to Cuban President Fidel Castro during the first work session, President Frei broached the subject of open regionalism. [Frei] We must expand our trade on realistic and specific terms and without exceptions. In economy, like in politics, exclusion is not only unjust but also dangerous. The number one priority issue of my administration is to combat poverty. No matter how important it may be, however, government action is not enough to combat this scourge which is affecting over one million Chileans. All national groups must, therefore, join efforts to overcome this situation. In view of this, it is imperative today to establish a culture of solidarity which makes people and development the main target of both government action and private business. [Reporter] The Ibero-American Summit is the only regional group that allows Fidel Castro's attendance. Cuba has been excluded from the OAS since 1962 and only countries with democratic regimes take part in the Rio Group. [passage omitted] Although this issue is not on the summit's agenda, there are informal talks about Cuba's eventual return to the OAS. Asked his opinion about this, President Frei said: [Frei] This decision is now up to Cuba. We want Cuba's return to the Latin American system. This obviously will be achieved by taking steps toward democracy, implementing a democratic process, and upholding human rights, which we believe is of utmost importance.
