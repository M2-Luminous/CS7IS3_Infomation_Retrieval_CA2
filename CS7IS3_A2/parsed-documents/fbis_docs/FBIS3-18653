The group opposing Swedish membership is still clearly the largest, and it increased by 2 percent to 42 percent. The yes grouping increased by 3 percent to 35 percent. The number of undecided voters fell, consequently, and now totals 23 percent. According to SIFO, different groups of voters have reacted very differently to the negotiation result. Upper-middle-age men are very satisfied, while younger voters have instead become more negative toward Swedish membership in the EU.
