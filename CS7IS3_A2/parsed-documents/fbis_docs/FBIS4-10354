The actions of the group headed by Deputy Adolfo Jarquin Ortel have been real shows of strength. A total of 29 of the 50 members of the National Directorate (DN) appeared at the meeting called by Jarquin to straighten out the political course of the party previously headed by Cesar. Ortel's followers reaffirmed their support for the proposed constitutional reforms, the incorporation of PSD deputies into the National Assembly, and reorganization of the National Executive Council (CEN) as a result of the sanction which the Disciplinary Council imposed on Potoy, Cesar, and Adan Morales, who were removed from their posts for one year. The National Directorate decided that new party leaders would be elected in June and that those disciplined would not have the right to run. The unanimous resolution of the National Council of Political Parties (CNPP) to resolve the conflict in favor of Jarquin's group was the coup de grace for Cesar's bunch, which was to be expected since the latter group's allegation was extremely weak. After all, it was easy to see that the majority--no fewer than 29 members of the National Directorate--were on Jarquin's side. Thus it is that Cesar and Potoy's faction exhibits a significant weakening, not just within the PSD, but in the UNO [National Opposition Union] itself, where leadership will now pass to the liberals of Virgilio Godoy's PLI [Independent Liberal Party] and Arnoldo Aleman's PLC [Constitutionalist Liberal Party]. Cesar apparently ends up alone in the National Assembly, without any party or bench. The defeat has crushed his aspirations to become head of the UNO bench now led by Luis Sanchez. The CNPP resolution virtually creates a new social democratic party in Nicaragua. There is a potential opportunity to stand out as a party that takes decisive steps to consolidate the National Assembly's stability and its contribution to the process of constitutional reforms could make it a party of the future. Adolfo Jarquin granted the following exclusive interview to EL SEMANARIO. [Lacayo Guerra] What are your impressions of the CNPP resolution recognizing you as the legitimate president of the PSD and removing Guillermo Potoy? [Jarquin] The National Council of Political Parties acted in keeping with our party statutes because as soon as the illegalities and arbitrary acts mainly committed by Guillermo Potoy and Alfredo Cesar began, we went before national and international public opinion to condemn that antidemocratic outrage and violation of the statutes. A minority opposed a decision of the majority to support the reforms of the political constitution and not raise such false banners as the Constituent Congress. The CNPP is the body that governs and controls the activities of political parties and we must abide by its decision. We logically expected the ruling to go in our favor because we had the majority of the members of the National Directorate behind us. Likewise, the majority of the rank and file supported the movement, which has been seeking a way to rescue social democratic ideals and ensure that our efforts in Nicaragua would actively support democratization and the establishment of a state of law. We also wanted laws to be passed or adapted for society within an acceptable legal framework enabling us to develop along the lines of social justice and in a manner promoting sustained development of the economy rather than merely grope our way along. We maintain that in order to win we must judge, and the democratic struggle lies in strengthening the institutions of government. [Lacayo Guerra] Deputy Alfredo Cesar has claimed that the ruling was rigged because the UNO is not properly represented on the CNPP even though it won the elections. What comments do you think such an observation merits? [Jarquin] Cesar's claim is incongruous. He has been saying that it is he who gives the new board legitimacy and now he wants to maintain that the composition of the CNPP is not in keeping with the nation's laws. What is incongruous is that they did appeal a ruling by the CNPP to the Supreme Election Council. I say that by lodging an appeal, they are tacitly recognizing the validity of the Council of Political Parties. They have the right to appeal, but Cesar has been saying that since there is an appeal, the CNPP resolution is suspended. It is they who are suspended, not us. One must abide by the law and the CNPP is the body that governs and controls political parties in Nicaragua. We must be respectful of such bodies and not resort to the tactic that whenever something does not go in favor of any one person, then one is accused of belonging to or being allied with the government or the Sandinists. Such a tactic cannot continue in Nicaragua. Here we must have sectors of national life that want to advance and implement a national program to further the democratic process. [Lacayo Guerra] Have you had contact with the members of the Supreme Election Council in order to defend yourselves, as you have the right to do, and what resolution do you expect from that body? [Jarquin] We intend to pay the Supreme Election Council a courtesy visit and hope the judges will review everything done and the evidence provided by those of us who abide by the law. There are absolutely no human rights violations or violations of the political constitution. We continue to be right because we have abided by the law. The problem is that when someone does something wrong, he always ends badly. From the standpoint of our organization, we have statutes that must be respected. [Lacayo Guerra] The UNO recently issued a bulletin stating that the real authorities in the PSD are Guillermo Potoy, president of the PSD, and Alfredo Cesar, secretary general. [Jarquin] It is not comrade Eli Altamirano, coordinator of what is left of the UNO, who decides who has legitimacy. We have government institutions for that purpose. They determine who the legitimate officials of a party are and they must be respected. [Lacayo Guerra] What does the future hold for the PSD? What will happen to the group of leaders sanctioned by the party's disciplinary council? [Jarquin] We have entered a phase of strengthening our structures. We maintain that what we are trying to determine is how to get back on the social democratic path. The PSD had shifted to the right and lost its identity. We have a role to play in building the history of Nicaragua. When this party was conceived, it was conceived as a party of the center left, a viable alternative for Nicaraguans with aspirations to resolve the problems of the country, which is facing social injustice. We are going to put out a political manifesto defining our lines of action, which basically number four. [Lacayo Guerra] What are the four lines of action that you have defined? [Jarquin] The first must be to strengthen our country's political stability. Second, we must contribute to Nicaragua's economic takeoff. Third, we must expand and activate the social democratic rank and file. Fourth, we must renew and broaden our international relations. On this last point, I would point out that we recently acted as observers for the general elections in Costa Rica. We met with the president of the National Liberation Party, Dr. Carlos Manuel Castillo, and even with President-elect Jose Maria Figueres. We also met in the Dominican Republic with Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, vice president of the Socialist International. We have made different international contacts so that this project will not be confined to the organizational strengthening of the party and active participation in parliamentary debates and specific political tasks. Rather, on the international level, we want to find help and support of social democratic friends abroad. [Lacayo Guerra] What is the situation of your bench in Parliament and its programs? Will you be integrated into the Political Council of Benches? [Jarquin] We will join the Political Council of Benches because we have a great deal to contribute. We must not forget that Parliament is going through a new phase in which we must participate with solid criteria so as to strengthen that institution of government which the Legislative Branch is, drafting acceptable laws for the people of Nicaragua and helping to strengthen the other branches of government. The political action line in Parliament will be to seek reforms of the political constitution. In that sense, while my party was part of the UNO, we participated in a commission that engaged in a dialogue with the Sandinist Front and we hope to participate in the Political Council of Benches in a like manner. We want to make our best contributions with respect to the Law of Military Organization and other important laws that will be debated and passed this year. We shall also continue to contribute to the country's stability. [Lacayo Guerra] Could you sum up your experiences in the political battle that you have won over the other sector of social democrats led by Alfredo Cesar? [Jarquin] The members of this movement are young and courageous members who, despite all manner of schemes used against us, have held fast and put up a good fight. It was not easy to face a group that is self-governing and that sets itself up as the owner of truth when anyone opposing what they consider to be the truth is accused of being allied with the government or the Sandinist Front. I repeat: It was not easy. We were looking for a way to contribute to the sustained development that is so essential to the country. We shall be guided by the thought that it must be Nicaragua that emerges as the winner. [Lacayo Guerra] In quantitative terms, what is the composition of your bench? [Jarquin] Right now we have four deputies, without counting the two persons sanctioned by the party, Alfredo Cesar and Adan Morales, but we shall soon increase that number to six. [Lacayo Guerra] Who are the other two? [Jarquin] We are waiting for the right time to move ahead. We are involved in talks with them and for the time being I prefer not to divulge their names. [Lacayo Guerra] You have said that the crisis in your party occurred because a majority group wants to make reforms in the constitution. Do you have a proposal? [Jarquin] No, we have no proposal, but I personally participated in the drafting of a joint proposal between the Sandinist Front and what was the UNO at the time. [Lacayo Guerra] That FSLN-UNO proposal was thwarted and only the Sandinist Front signed it. Do you still agree with the spirit of that document? [Jarquin] I agree with the document. I believe there are certain points requiring further discussion since we cannot close our minds to any potential debate. I am specifically referring to international economic agreements. Their approval must be subject to the participation of other sectors, not just the National Assembly. [Lacayo Guerra] What is your view of the impossibility of reelecting the president and the ban on relatives of the president being candidates? [Jarquin] I do not think we can give first or last names to a restriction because we are talking about legislation for the nation, for the future. Let us remember that the constitution governs all Nicaraguans. It is not a matter of closing the door to other persons because of political desirability. Some groups say there must be no reelection at all. I am of the opinion that it should be allowed in alternate periods, but I would like to hear all opinions and learn the experience of other countries. Costa Rica has no reelection, but I realize that there is a struggle to reform the constitution in that country to allow such reelection. It is argued that four years is a very short time for a president to carry out his platform. That is why I agree that the term be five years, but I do not have a closed mind on the subject. In the National Assembly, we must be open to public debate, with all groups saying what they think. We are building for the future and we cannot erect obstacles. [Lacayo Guerra] It is said that Antonio Lacayo is a potential presidential candidate and that the Democratic Social Party that you head would support him. Your comments? [Jarquin] It is too soon to speak of such a possibility, first of all because Antonio Lacayo is not a member of the PSD. [Lacayo Guerra] But many ministers and government officials are members of the PSD National Directorate. [Jarquin] Well, we must start from the fact that the PSD participated actively in Violeta Chamorro's campaign. Our party supplied the activists, and many of the president's bodyguards and chauffeurs come from the PSD. Some ministers are also from the PSD because we believed and continue to believe that the process which began on 25 February 1990 must have continuity. There must be a national program to further democracy in Nicaragua. Right now we cannot talk about any candidacy of Antonio Lacayo. The opponents of our decision are the ones supporting that view. We could talk in the future, but right now we face the task of strengthening our structures. [Lacayo Guerra] What future do you envision for the group of social democrats headed by Alfredo and Guillermo Potoy? [Jarquin] They have three options: to form a new party, and it is already being rumored that they are thinking about forming a party called the Nicaraguan Democratic Party or something similar. Their appeal to the Supreme Election Council is an attempt to gain six months, the time they think they need to win our rank and file. Second, they can ally themselves with the right and adopt a policy of confrontation. They would need such a party in order to do so. Third, another party could take them in, but I do not know which party would. It is said that the Communist Party would take Alfredo Cesar. That could happen, right? (Laughter)
