Some Results of Four Months of the Work of the National Economy"] [Text] The republic's economic situation is characterized by the same crisis phenomena that prevailed earlier. The State Committee for Statistics [SCS] reports that the national income generated in the four months comes to only 66 percent of last year's, and the same problems persist in regard to sales of finished goods and mutual settlements. As of 1 May, the value of stocks of finished goods stood at 3 trillion rubles (other estimates put the figure somewhat higher). Our enterprises' indebtedness to enterprises of other countries of the near abroad, chiefly Russia, for goods shipped and services rendered, is growing. Profitability is falling--i.e., the cost of producing goods is rising faster than profits from their sale. In January-March, profitability in industry stood at only 12.7 percent, and the lowest level was in instrument making--6.2 percent. In the first quarter, 995 enterprises and organizations--12.3 percent of the total number--made losses. Losses totaled 930.5 billion rubles. According to the results of four months, production output declined by 62.2 percent in the fuel industry (including by 66.2 percent in oil refining), 43.3 percent in the building materials industry, 42.9 percent in light industry, 35 percent in machine building, and 31.2 percent in the woodworking, pulp and paper industry. The smallest decline was 15.6 in the food industry. In industry as a whole, production volumes declined by 33.3 percent. In April, 17 enterprises did not work at all, and 264 reduced their work week. The SCS reports that work time losses for various reasons in January-April--including due to lack of material resources and difficulties with sales--were equivalent to a 13.6-percent rate of idleness of the average number of workers on roster (add to this a few percentage points of the official unemployment level and we may get a figure close to its actual level). Inflation hit hard once more in April. In February and March it rose by 18.7 and 10.2 percent, respectively, but in April it hit 28.6 percent (by the way, some sources put it even higher). Undoubtedly, as might be expected, the inflation was made worse by unsecured "seed" credit. The republic's economy started this month under conditions of the proclaimed common customs space with Russia. Our anticipated gain from this is the lifting of Russian duties on energy, in particular. But it must be kept in mind that even duty-free Russian resources, however cheap, still have to be paid for with money earned primarily on the Russian market (or currency), money earned under conditions of competition in the market with other foreign producers and Russians too. Sometimes, moreover, we fall prey to that old over-confidence and say, If the price of energy were equal, Russian producers couldn't compete with us. We say, The Russian farmer would only buy our tractors. Meanwhile, Russia is swiftly reforming its economic relations and, accordingly, "educating" strong potential competitors with whom our producers will inevitably clash. Our measures in response, and the results thereof, are much more modest. The recent mission of the International Monetary Fund that surveyed our economy pointed out that our economic policy in general is characterized by a situation of uncertainty which, among other things, is also being greatly influenced by persistent uncertainty regarding the uniting of monetary systems. We can agree with this assessment, but it is worth adding that this situation has clearly gone on too long.
