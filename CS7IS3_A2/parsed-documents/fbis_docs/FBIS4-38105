Muhammad Hasanayn Haykal said in a lecture at Cairo University: "The US navy in the Red Sea recently intercepted and requisitioned two Egyptian boats transporting Saudi arms to south Yemen." AFP obtained Monday [27 June] a copy of Haykal's lecture, given Wednesday 22 June]. But the US naval command centre based in Florida, covering the Middle East, told AFP they were unaware of any incident and had not received any internal report on the matter. Haykal was close to former Egyptian President Jamal 'Abd al-Nasir, and has many Arab and western contacts. An Egyptian source, who asked not to be named, said he could not confirm or deny the claim. "Egypt's position in principle is not to contribute to any effort to supply arms to either of the Yemeni parties," he said. Opposition newspaper AL-'ARABI said Monday the two boats intercepted by the US navy returned to Egypt with their cargo. Egypt's President Husni Mubarak recently criticised northern Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih for his "insistence" on trying to maintain unity, saying it could not be achieved by force. But Cairo has not recognised the breakaway Yemen Democratic Republic, declared by the south on May 21. War broke out between Salih's forces and those of his southern rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid on May 5.
