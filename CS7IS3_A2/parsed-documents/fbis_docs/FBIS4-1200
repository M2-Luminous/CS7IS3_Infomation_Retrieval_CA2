Rees] [Text] Bloemfontein April 24 SAPA -- SA Defence Force [SADF] troops have been sent to Viljoenskroon in the [Orange] Free State to ensure rightwingers do not disrupt elections this week, the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] said on Sunday [24 April]. This follows the erection by the rightwing-controlled town council of watchtowers and roadblocks at entrances to the northern Free State town. Work on the "security measures" had been completed, though the rightwingers have assured police they do not plan to disrupt the historic poll, SA Police spokesman Adj Rudi van Zyl said. All three access roads to the town now have two booms in place, and two watchtowers have been erected at the entrance to the Rammulotsi black township, which was reported Sunday to be very tense. None of the installations were staffed on Sunday night. The rightwingers have said the security measures were simply precautions in case white Viljoenskroon needs protection from violence during or after the election. The council was reported last week to have said the SADF was responsible for the roadblocks and watchtowers, though police sources on Sunday said this was a transparent attempt to transfer responsibility for their actions. Military commando members had approached the town council in their private capacity and the town clerk and council had gone ahead with the security installations, the source said. Police said members of the town council had made themselves unavailable for consultations on Sunday.
