After carrying its first launch assignment with a large carrier rocket, Shanghai sent 16 artificial satellites into space on 13 occasions, either independently or through joint efforts, with a 100-percent success rate. This has stunned the world's space industry. The first and second stages of the "Long March-3" rocket, which won a special state award, were developed by Shanghai's space industry base with the New China Machinery Plant -- the main assembly plant -- as the core. For several years after that, scientists, engineers, and technicians from the space industry base's 300-plus research departments, institutions of higher learning, and production enterprises dedicated themselves to the independent development of the large "Long March-4" carrier rocket of advanced world standards, as well as the new, two-stage liquid- propellant "Long March-2d" rocket. Since the initial stage of large carrier rocket research and development, Shanghai's space industry base has leapfrogged through four stages. During the first stage, which began on 26 July 1975, Shanghai designed and developed the "Windstorm-1" rocket with the support and assistance of other concerns at home, and then used it to send the "Sky-1" satellite into space. During the second stage, which began on 20 September 1981, Shanghai and other domestic concerns jointly completed our country's first assignment of launching three satellites into orbit on a single rocket. During the third stage, which began on 8 April 1984, Shanghai and other domestic concerns jointly sent our country's first geostationary experimental communications satellite into orbit on the "Long March-3" rocket. During the fourth stage, Shanghai splendidly accomplished the assignment of launching "Asiasat-1," the first foreign satellite launched by our country for commercial purposes. The satellite, which was manufactured by the U.S.-based Hughes Aircraft Company, was an "extraterrestrial visitor." Sent into space by a U.S. spacecraft in 1984, it could not enter the predetermined orbit due to engine trouble. Nine months later, it was retrieved by the mechanical arm of a U.S. spacecraft. The satellite immediately began communications and broadcasting services after it was successfully sent into orbit by the "Long March-3" rocket. Toward the end of the sixties, Zhou Enlai, then-premier of the State Council, advanced the idea of developing space technology in the old industrial base of Shanghai, citing its strengths such as a sound industrial base, extensive academic disciplines, cooperation-friendly conditions, and a plethora of scientific research institutions. By now, Shanghai has trained and groomed a specialized technical corps capable of designing entire space vehicles and various subsystems, developed a complete research and development system for carrier rockets and artificial satellites, and established a space industry cooperation network comprising more than 300 institutions of higher learning, research departments, and factories. Moreover, Shanghai has installed testing apparatus and equipment of fairly large scale, such as rocket engine and cold-flow test beds. Shanghai's space industry is converting its technological strengths into tremendous social and economic benefits. It has used its technology to build space-related systems, such as satellite television ground receiving systems and large radio and television acoustics systems, some of which have made their way onto the international market. Moreover, it has produced more than 1 million iceboxes for use in space.
