Attaching importance to the issue of intensifying unemployment and focusing on the central theme of "growth and employment," the participants will discuss measures to stimulate the macroeconomy in such nations as Japan and Germany, as well as labor issues, including unemployment insurance and immigration connected with various nations. Other issues to be discussed include "trade and labor," which concerns problems connected with the export of products through cheap labor. With regard to aid for nations shifting to the market economy, participants will focus on aid for Russia and Ukraine as well. Suffering from serious economic stagnation, Ukraine has requested financial aid amounting to $20 billion. It seems most likely that the United States and European nations will strongly request Japan to expand its domestic demand, and the minority administration under Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata will be forced to overcome difficulties in coordination to work out concrete measures such as tax cuts beginning in fiscal 1995. Various nations have come to share the common understanding that the top priority task lies in overcoming unemployment which may lead to social unrest. Discussions will be held on the strategy of creating jobs to promote global economic growth. And as part of this strategy, consultations will be held on requesting those nations that are rather slow in business recovery -- Japan and Germany, for instance -- to take additional financial measures such as tax cuts as well as economic stimulus measures such as monetary relaxation. To control increases in long-term interest rate which are detrimental to economic growth, the participating nations intend to request such nations as the United States to take measures to steadily reduce their financial deficits. For the purpose of creating new jobs, discussions will be held on technological cooperation among various nations in the fields of information and communications, including development of multimedia. Among other topics for discussion is how to overcome structural problems connected with immigrants and the system of excessive insurance for unemployment. All these problems are detrimental to the creation of new jobs. Now that GATT will become the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995, the participating nations will discuss the issue of "establishing a new world trade system." Since no decision has been made as to what issues connected with WTO will be discussed, the theme for coordination at the summit remains fluid. However, topics for discussions are likely to include policies for competition, environmental protection, development, and investment. With regard to aid for nations shifting to market economies, the first priority will still be given to Russia as decided at the Tokyo summit last year. However, the issue of providing aid amounting to $20 billion to Ukraine will be brought up at the upcoming summit. Due to the fact that economic stagnation has become more serious in Ukraine, it has become an issue of common interest to all industrialized nations to prevent an outflow of refugees from Ukraine and the repetition of nuclear power station accidents.
