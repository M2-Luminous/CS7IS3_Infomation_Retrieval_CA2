Xizang is rich in geothermal resources and data support State energy development criteria for the creation of 10,000-kilowatt-class geothermal electric power plants. The Yangbajain deep well project would make use of a single-unit 12,000-kilowatt geothermal power plant that draws on deep-well high-temperature, high-energy underground heat sources. The project could be completed and in operation in 1995.
