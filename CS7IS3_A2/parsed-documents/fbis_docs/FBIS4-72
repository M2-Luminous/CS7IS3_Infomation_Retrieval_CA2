Brigadier Zirk Gouws was reacting to renewed criticism by the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] that the search had been canceled on the grounds that it could've been politically detrimental. Brig. Gouws said the regional commissioner of police on the Witwatersrand, Major General Koos Calitz, and Mr. Nelson Mandela held talks before the planned search, and the ANC leader had undertaken to cooperate fully with the police. However, the warrant remained effective.
