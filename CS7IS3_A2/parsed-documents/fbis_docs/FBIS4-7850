Dr. Zoran Popov, member of the coordinating body for implementing the anti-inflation program, who is responsible for social welfare issues, laconically stated that those who go back to agriculture will be far better off than those who stay in the city. He added that 250,000 out of the 2 million employees in the socialized sector of the economy possess an average of seven hectares of land. And that, it seems, is that: The half-breeds should simply pack their suitcases and go back to their native village. Dr. Dragoslav Avramovic, professor, whose team includes Dr. Popov, never misses a chance to say that no one will be left without a job and put out on the street. Jovan Zebic, federal deputy prime minister (responsible for carrying out this program), has said that amendments of the law will soon be examined making it possible for enterprise directors to rid themselves of technological redundancies more easily, but only to a maximum of 20 percent of the total labor force. The Serbian Government (whose task it is to put the measures in its domain in operational terms) has extended the validity of the current decree on mandatory leave to 31 March and left it to the new government to rack its brain and leave office because of the worker dissatisfaction that is in the offing. In the meantime that part of Avramovic's program which said that the surplus of employed persons in the economy is estimated at a million people has been "edited." Forecasts are now being mentioned stating that in the second half of the year 300,000 people would be on mandatory leave, as many again would be the "employed redundancy," accompanied by the cloudy remark that in the first half of the year that ratio was somewhat less favorable. The suitcases of the half-breeds, then, can stay where they are at least two months more. The Mistake Just as a law was passed a few months ago whereby everyone who has a private firm and works in the socialized sector must urgently give up one or the other fired up the "small fry" (owners of firms that exist on paper) and caused a stampede in front of the registration courts, so this idea of purging the "sluggish socialist economy" has caused static. The half-breeds--fearing to lose their jobs, are saying that the land is not actually theirs, and the "city dwellers" are exulting in secret. There is some economic and social basis for referring to the half-breeds as a category that can be "displaced" from the factories most easily and painlessly. An analysis done in the Economics Institute in Belgrade shows that in the dramatic stratifications of population over the last 15 years, and especially over the last three years, the nonfarm and purely agricultural households have been impoverished the most, while the half-breeds suddenly escaped poverty. Most of the half-breeds come from households that have at least the average landholding, and very few of them have small parcels. A few other figures support the position of the government: In the breakdown of the income of these households, 45 percent comes from regular employment, while the remainder is income from a shop or from a farm. Ergo, the half-breeds have already created a second and stronger source of income. Third, the half-breeds by and large have lower qualifications, so that it is easier for the firm to do without this kind of manpower. Finally, the government (and society), in view of investments in their education, is losing less by their return to the country than through the "brain drain" of highly trained personnel. "The return of the half-breeds to the country is a frivolous idea and completely unfeasible if we preclude repression," is the categorical assertion of Dr. Mladen Stojanov, professor of rural sociology at the School of Agriculture in Novi Sad. "The half-breeds are people who work somewhere and have a bit of land or some tie to the country. It is certain that they will strengthen their ties to the country, but they will not leave the city." The Misunderstandings The hard logic of capital, Dr. Stojanov explains, says that agriculture has been and still is a subsidized sector, and there is no chance of its becoming so profitable that it would "outstrip" the city. "It is only the airheads and the burghers in the city who tend to think: `You have carrots, you have potatoes, life is easy for you.' Those are misunderstandings." Professor Stojanov is given indirect support for his position by Dr. Petar Markovic, another professor who teaches in the School of Agriculture in Belgrade. In an open letter sent to Prime Minister Kontic, he warns that "rural life is being extinguished because for decades income has been taken away from agriculture and because of a number of unresolved issues related to the status of farmers, land policy, and settlement," and in demographic terms rural areas are being depopulated. So, there is no economic interest in going back to the country. "All our experience last year," says Dr. Mirosinka Dinkic of the Economics Institute in response, "shows that those workers who were sent on mandatory leave and had land in the country have themselves and without pressure turned to farming, behaving in accordance with their own sound economic interest, and thanks to that they have preserved their standard of living." When she speaks about the return of the half-breeds to the country, Dr. Dinkic is primarily thinking of the smaller cities in Serbia and their industry, which was in fact conceived in order to employ the rural population. That "subspecies," as we might call it, of half-breed (by contrast with those in Belgrade, for example, who have built houses on the outskirts of the city, but their farms are somewhere in the south of Serbia) already lives in the country, has up to now been commuting to a nearby city to work in a factory (Gornji Milanovac, Kragujevac, Cacak, Backa Palanka), so that it was engaged in production work in the first part of the day and farm work in the latter part. "Why should these people not devote themselves exclusively to farming, at least temporarily, now that the situation in industry is so difficult? The idea of the program is not repression nor distributing pink slips, but for the person who is receiving the minimum compensation from the budget and has social security to decide himself whether he will go into the private sector, say, or to what is perhaps closer to him--farming. In that case, the government could stimulate this process by exempting those who return from the tax on cadastre income," Dr. Dinkic said. Because the average mixed household has four members and in a third of such households both adult members are employed in a socialized firm, it would be enough for only one to return to farming, while the other could maintain ties to the city. In the opinion of Dr. Dinkic, there is no reason to overlook Belgrade either, because most of the half-breeds are mainly employed seasonally on construction work, they usually do not bring their family to the capital (so the problem of educating the children is not raised), or at the least they have parents in the country. "In order to create space for those people to go back to the country, they would have to have plots larger than 50 hectares, not three hectares, which is the average for Serbia, and a great deal of startup capital, which they do not have," Dr. Stojanov said. Prof. Jeremija Simic of the School of Agriculture in Belgrade points to another dimension of this problem: 60 percent of the manpower in Yugoslavia comes from mixed households and for precisely that reason they have been able to withstand the crisis, and the entire society thanks to them. "Why would any of them at this point want to change that position of theirs, which is not good, but tolerable, for a position that is worse?" Professor Simic asked. "So long as the process of going back to the country is a spontaneous and individual act, that is fine. But a large-scale return to the country is a process that has not been recorded anywhere in the world. Any directive from the government, however well-intentioned it might be, would be dangerous. Here is why: Let us assume that a worker in a firm has high qualifications and land, while another does not have a farm and has low qualifications. In that case, is the firm supposed to get rid of the expert, only because he has some other income, and commit itself to the social welfare approach and hold on to the one who is not contributing to the work process, but would be a welfare case if he left the firm?" Contrary to the proclaimed goal of the anti-inflation program--to move social welfare out of the economy, Professor Simic believes that both the firm and government must conduct some kind of social welfare policy. He cites Sartid 1913, which has turned from castings to raising mushrooms, as an example of how the technological surplus can be employed, but in close relation to agriculture. "Other firms might also lease land for their workers and engage in the production of medicinal herbs, the raising of mushrooms, or fish farming," NIN's informant proposed. "Aside from the natural factors, live manpower is our only resource, and instead of the idea of a return to the country, we should turn toward production programs which seek intensive activation of manpower."
