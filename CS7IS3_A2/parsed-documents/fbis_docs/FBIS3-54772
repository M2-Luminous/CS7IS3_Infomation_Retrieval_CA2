The consumer has been given an opportunity not just to take whatever is offered but to meticulously choose exactly what he or she needs from the dozens of models and companies available. Unfortunately, in the battle to win the customers' hearts and consequently their cash, our producers, spoiled by the former scarcity and unlimited demand, often do not look especially attractive. The workers of the "Zarya" industrial commercial footwear firm in Moscow have had a good taste of the first fruits of competition and the openness of the domestic market. Their factory has been visited by First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets who is in charge of light industry. This factory served as the base for an exhibition-fair where contracts were signed with industrial enterprises and commercial organizations for the production and sale of footwear in 1994. And even though the goods on display at the show were the best that this country's cobblers have to offer, it was clear that they still face major marketing problems. "There must be an on-the-spot investigation to find out just why all the stores are crammed with foreign goods at a time when we are unable to sell the goods produced by our plants," Oleg Soskovets said, explaining the purpose of his visit. [passage omitted] After visiting the "Zarya" factory's shops and talking with workers and foremen, Oleg Soskovets held a short conference with the directors of Moscow textile and footwear enterprises. There was just one topic of discussion: What must the government do in order to remedy the situation in light industry and prevent a further slump in production which has reached almost 60 percent in the past three years. The package of measures proposed by the directors were, generally speaking, not distinguished by their variety. It was the general opinion of enterprise directors that the overstocking of the Russian market with cheap but not always high-quality imported consumer goods is jeopardizing the very existence of the country's light industry. "There must be protective customs barriers against the import of finished goods into Russia and the export of unprocessed agricultural raw materials from the country," the production specialists stated. "We will take care of our enterprises and create normal conditions for their work. There is no doubt about that. However, government-based protectionism must have reasonable limits. Ultimately only the customer with his rubles can properly assess the results of production collectives' work. Not just to make things but to make things that will sell -- that must be the slogan of today," the first vice premier believes. The situation in Russia's light industry was the subject of the discussion at a session of the Council of Ministers Commission on Topical Questions.
