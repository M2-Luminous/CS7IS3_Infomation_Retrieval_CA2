FR940622-2-00012 FR940622-2-00006 [C&hyph;428&hyph;812] Notice of Court Decision: Certain Hot Rolled Lead and Bismuth Carbon Steel Products from Germany AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 22, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kristin Heim, Office of Countervailing Investigations, Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;3798. SUMMARY: On June 7, 1994, the United States Court of International Trade (``CIT'') overturned the determination by the Department of Commerce (``the Department'') that the benefit of Saarstahl AG's subsidization, by reason of forgiveness of debts, was passed through to Dillinger Hutte Saarstahl AG (``DHS'') after Saarstahl was privatized. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In its Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain Hot Rolled Lead and Bismuth Carbon Steel Products From Germany, 58 FR 6233 (January 27, 1993), the Department determined that subsidies previously bestowed on Saarstahl in the form of debt forgiveness passed through to DHS, a newly formed holding company of which Saarstahl became a subsidiary. The Department's determination was challenged. The Department subsequently requested, and was granted, a remand in order to reconsider its final determinations. On remand, the Department adopted its reasoning from Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain Steel Products From Germany, 58 FR 37315 (July 9, 1993), in which it determined that a portion of the price DHS paid for Saarstahl represented repayment of prior subsidies. On June 7, 1994, in Saarstahl AG v. United States, Slip Op. 94&hyph;92, the CIT overturned the Department's determination that previously bestowed subsidies continued to benefit a company privatized in an arm's-length transaction. In its decision in Timken Co. v. United States, 893 F.2d 337 (Fed. Cir. 1990), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1516a(e), the Department must publish a notice of a court decision which is not ``in harmony'' with a Department determination, and must suspend liquidation of entries pending a ``conclusive'' court decision. The CIT's decision in Saarstahl on June 7, 1994, constitutes a decision not in harmony with the Department's final affirmative determination. Publication of this notice fulfills the Timken requirement. Accordingly, the Department will continue to suspend liquidation pending the expiration of the period of appeal or, if appealed, upon a ``conclusive'' court decision. Absent an appeal or, if appealed, upon a ``conclusive'' court decision affirming the CIT's opinion, the countervailing duty order will be revoked effective June 17, 1994. Dated: June 16, 1994. Paul L. Joffe, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;15178 Filed 6&hyph;21&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;P
