"The EC not only shows its admiration for China's development, but is willing to promote it through trade and economic cooperation with China," said Brittan. "it is unreasonable to exclude China, the 11th largest trade country in the world in 1993, from GATT," Wu said. The China-EC Joint Committee exchanged views on GATT matters and expressed its satisfaction regarding the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round. A release at the press conference said that the EC supports the successful conclusion of the negotiations on China's status as a contracting party to GATT as soon as possible. China reaffirmed its intention to continue the reform of its economic and trade regimes to meet the internationally accepted rules, in particular those of GATT. The two sides agreed to intensify their efforts, both bilaterally and multilaterally, to achieve a satisfactory outcome in these negotiations. China and the EC decided to launch bilateral discussions for the liberalization of non-tariff measures in China. The first meeting will take place next March in Geneva in the framework of the GATT working party on China. The EC side insisted on the elimination of the discriminatory provision on automobile joint ventures of the Sino-U.S. Memorandum of Understanding on market access of October 1992. China stated that the provision on imports of auto parts does not affect the production of Sino-EC joint ventures. Both sides agreed to continue discussions on this issue.
