According to statistics, Shanghai's total value of import and exports reached $30.93 billion in real terms last year, representing an increase of 23 percent over the previous year, and holding a leading position among cities nationwide. Shanghai Customs, which is responsible for supervising and controlling goods going to and from Shanghai's port, has played an enormous role in promoting the functional development of Pudong New District and the Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone, supporting Shanghai's export trade, and expediting the construction of municipal infrastructure facilities and the development of new hi-tech industry. Last year, they helped over 2,200 enterprises, who took care of customs declaration work themselves, go through the formalities of customs registration and handle tax reduction or remission procedures for 10,000 consignments with a value of $890 million, and 2.96 billion yuan in taxes was reduced or remitted, which represents an increase of 257 percent over the corresponding period last year. Using the normal practices of free trade zones overseas for reference, Shanghai Customs has successively formulated eight measures for managing the Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone and practiced a new model of supervision and control, which is both simple and flexible, in the closed area of the zone, thereby achieving the objective of handling matters within the zone and pushing forward the comprehensive development of business in the bonded zone. Shanghai Customs has also taken the initiative in helping to boost Shanghai's foreign trade and vigorously broadening the scope of business in the bonded zone. A total of 21 new bonded factories and 34 bonded warehouses were approved last year. At present, Shanghai boasts eight bonded groups, 187 bonded factories, and 297 bonded warehouses, which have initially formed a bonded zone supervisory and management system characterized by comprehensive categories, multiple levels, and great adaptability.
