During the ceremony, the activist student organization issued pro-North Korean statements and called the Korean war "the war for fatherland liberation," echoing Pyongyang's definition of the conflict. Worried about activist students' pro-North Korean bent when the Stalinist state's nuclear program has become the focal point of international concern, the political circles are urging the government to do something about the students. The ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) expressed deep concern over Hanchongnyon's pro-communist line at a high-level meeting on Tuesday. Rep. Yi Se-ki, chairman of the policy committee, called the students' meeting "a worrying development" while giving a briefing on what happened in Kwangju. Chairman Kim Chong-pil, unable to conceal his shock at the students' describing the Korean war as having been fought to liberate the fatherland, said, "They denounced our system and supported North Korea's communist system. Other participants in the meeting were also surprised at the display of a miniature mockup of "the cultural palace of the people" in Pyongyang during the students' gathering in Kwangju. Emerging from the meeting, spokesman Pak Pom-chin said, "communism has now become a tested legacy of history, and I can't understand how college students, as intellectuals, can call the Korean war the war for fatherland liberation, echoing the North Koreans' theory." He then called on the students to drop "the anachronistic behavior." Secretary-general Mun Chong-su said, "I was told they put on display some miniature mockups of the house where Kim Il-song was born and the Cultural Palace of the people. What should I think of this display? It's beyond common sense and understanding, however hard I might try to understand in view of their status as students." Chief policy coordinator Kang Sam-chae added, "It's shocking to hear them crying for the downfall of the civilian government despite the times having changed. It appears that they have now reached a dangerous level and we should not let them remain at this level." Chairman Kim recently produced evidence that an apparent pro- North Korean organization has distributed leaflets to important figures which support Kim Il-song's planned power transfer to his son, Chong-il, under the chuche (self-reliance) ideology. Hanchongnyon then declared a pro-North Korean line. Faced with these developments, the DLP plans to call a meeting with the government shortly to call for action against pro-North Korean elements in society. Chongwadae [presidential offices], though shocked by Hanchongnyon's declaration of a pro-North Korean line, is moving to increase the people's sense of national security. The combination of the nuclear issue having entered a critical phase, the inscrutability of North Korea's leaders and Hanchongnyon's abrupt move toward Pyongyang is causing Chongwadae officials great concern about pro-North Korean elements in the South. In addition to thoroughly investigating communist sympathizers, the government should paint a true picture of Hanchongnyon so that the organization cannot take root in society, one official said. "Those students, though small in number, denounce the legitimate civilian government based on popular support, while blindly supporting North Korea's chuche ideology and communism though their fictitiousness -- this has already been proven. I'm just surprised that such students are still leading the student movement. The situation now requires us to increase our sense of national security, in addition to judicial action against them." He added, "The North Korean nuclear issue is now facing a critical moment and there is the possibility that food shortages and other economic ills will force North Korea into abrupt action. These and Hanchongnyon's pro-North Korean line make us worry about national security." He then called on South Koreans to cooperate in the government's investigation of Hanchongnyon leaders. The opposition Democratic Party is critical of Hanchongnyon's pro-North Korean line, while attributing the student organization's stance to the confusion in the government's unification policy. Supreme Councilor Cho Se-hyong said, "It's true that Hanchongnyon's inaugural statement contains some improper words and phrases. Nonetheless, I can't understand why the government is making a political issue of Hanchongnyon, rather than dealing with it according to the law. "The government is heightening the people's unease by creating a tense atmosphere over the North Korean nuclear issue, and I demand that the government announce what measures it has to deal with the nuclear issue." Soldier-turned politician Rep. Yim Pok-chin said, "Students had not been such activists until recently and I can't understand why and how they have changed into such activists." Deputy spokesman Kim Yong-sok said, "It appears that students' radical demands and extreme acts have shocked citizens. But the government should be held partially responsible for the undesirable acts of students because it has monopolized information on North Korea on the pretext of its being the sole agent of carrying out unification policy. "The government should guarantee the freedom of unification policy debates and present its blueprint for unification to the people so that students will wake up from the illusion that they alone can achieve unification."
