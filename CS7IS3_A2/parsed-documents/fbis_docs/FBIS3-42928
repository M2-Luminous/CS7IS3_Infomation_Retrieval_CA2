Unfortunately, our capital is long been such a disposal site. Employees of the Radon Scientific Production Association cleaned up 1,160 radioactive contamination sites in Moscow and vicinity from 1979 to 1992. So-called "historical" radioactive wastes account for a large part of these nonplanned radioactive waste sites. According to secret instructions issued by the People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs, spent radioactive substances were buried underground (in undeveloped areas, refuse dumps, ravines, and ditches) at what was considered a safe depth--one at which gamma radiation at the surface would not exceed 300 microroentgens per hour. But yesterday's outskirts and undeveloped areas are now being built up. There was no system to track migration of radiation emitters. No one kept a map of the burial sites, which was simply impossible. Today these radioactive remains are "surfacing" in the most unpredictable places--flowerbeds, children's sandboxes, bomb shelters, beach restrooms, private apartments, garages, basements, military compounds. In addition to the "historical" radioactive waste sites, new "pirate" dumps are being discovered from time to time. Two instruments with ionizing radiation emitters were recently found in a pile of construction refuse on Shcherbakov Street. A container of thorium ore was found at the building at 6 Donskaya Street, and a one-kilogram cobblestone emitting a small amount of radiation was found on Saykin Street. A metallic emitter giving off 630,000 microroentgens per hour was accidentally found by an electrician in a basement at the Hammer and Sickle Plant. (Average background radiation in the Russia's central belt 10 to 15 microroentgens per hour, and 15 to 20 in cities.) A "radioactive" private garage was discovered this winter on Fersman Street. The wood floor and metal covering were "glowing" in places at up to 900 microroentgens per hour. Just three months ago, workers finished clearing up the notorious 26th kilometer of the Moscow Ring Road, where nearby vacant lot occupies the site of a former refuse dump. The operation took almost seven years. That's how long it took our wise city fathers to just to solve some simple organizational matters and to come up with the best plan for containing the site. There were some spots emitting abnormally high radioactivity at up to 720,000 microroentgens per hour. Now the radiation has been reduced to the standard average European level. A parking lot will be built on the site. A building housing a former hydropathic treatment facility at Hospital No. 54 in Eastern Okrug was giving off 72,000 microroentgens per hour. The heating battery was especially contaminated. The radiation emitted by some construction refuse, books, and abandoned equipment parts was somewhat lower. Initial measurements in the yard of an apartment building on Chernyshevskiy Street in Elektrostal revealed surface radioactivity of up to 600 microroentgens per hour. Almost 60 metric tons of low-radioactive soil and slag was removed from Noginsk and Ramenskiy. And it's still not certain that no more remains. The main radioactive items that the clean-up crews have found in Moscow are chemical vessels, phosphors, foil, ruberoid, ore specimens, reference ionizing radiation emitters, and parts of various instruments and smoke detectors containing radioactive elements. Thefts of radioactive materials for resale made their "season premiere." A container with 16 kilograms of thorium sand was found by a police patrol right outside the Kursk Train Station. According to the markings, the contraband was being sent from India to Japan. Our customs service is sometimes simply unable to identify radioactive materials. In addition to those in Moscow, "pirate" radioactive waste sites have been found in St. Petersburg, Irkutsk, Izhevsk, Kansk, Maykop, Iskitim, and Gatchina. Not a single fundamental issue relating to radiation safety has been solved in the form of legislation as yet. We're going to start dying not from food shortages, but from contaminated foods.
