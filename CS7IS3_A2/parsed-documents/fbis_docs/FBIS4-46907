Sobolev, chief of the department of securities, investment funds, and holding companies of the Republic of Tatarstan Goskomimushchestvo (State Property Committee) and candidate of economic sciences, published by PRIVATIZATSIYA, joint publication of the Republic of Tatarstan State Property Committee and the newspaper RESPUBLIKA TATARSTAN: "The End of Voucher Privatization? What Now?: On the Development of a Stock Market and Investment Policy in the RT"] [Text] The end of voucher privatization in Russia and accordingly in Tatarstan substantially changes the situation on the stock market: a high volume, highly liquid security disappears and a large quantity of not very liquid stock of privatized enterprises appears. Using the voucher, both the stock market and the nonstock market, although they were underdeveloped, drew away a large amount of private capital, thereby supporting the basic turnover of capital. There were 650 check investment funds of Russia, a large number of the population, and stock structures engaged in exchanging securities whose basis was the voucher. Today an enormous task has appeared, the task of developing the investment process. The performance of this task is made harder by the disastrous drop in production and the inability of the state to allocate or increase capital for investments. It is obvious that in these conditions investment policy must also be changed and its mechanism must be based on the primary and mandatory participation of nonstate capital in financing investment projects. Changing over from the direct allocation of state investments on a centralized and outright basis to distribution of these resources on the principles of payback and income-production in the form of state guarantees for particular investors and particular investment projects can be proposed as one of the ways to accomplish the above. According to the predictions of analysts, a situation of free-falling crisis and investment stoppage in its classic variant (United States, 1929) may occur in Russia by fall. A solution to the situation which has taken shape, starting up the investment process with minimal state participation and creating a system of state guarantees, is possible on the basis of stock market instruments using market methods for attracting additional capital of private investors (including the population). In creating and developing a liquid securities market as a most important regulator of investment processes in a market economy, we initiate an influx of private investments guaranteed by the state in the form of securities. A packet of documents on this mechanism needs to be formulated. The essence of them can be reduced to the following: the state interested in developing priority sectors invests in a project. The emissions body issues its stock and transfers to the government (in the person of the agent) a block of stock in exchange for investments, but with the guarantee to subsequently buy it back at a price, say, indexed in relation to the dollar's rate at the moment the transaction is registered. In addition, transferable bills in the amount of the state's annual interest rate set for investment credit are transferred. A transferable bill is written out for every year. The state transfers this block of securities in trust to the government's agent, in doing so delegating the state guarantees to him. The trust agreement stipulates that the securities be distributed among private investors, including the population. The agent structure accepts the state securities on its balance and issues its own bonds which ensure the attraction of additional investments of private investors and the full return of the capital to the state. It is obvious that the government's agent can be either a state or a nonstate structure with which a trust contract has been concluded. These structures are needed to attract the capital of the population, nonstate pension funds, socially oriented funds, and so forth. They reduce the risk of long-term investments for them given an unstable economic situation. Nonstate agents issue their bonds either in the form of mandatory payment of fixed dividends, or the issuance of securities at a specific fixed rate after a particular time, or, finally, in the form of the purchase and sale of securities on investment projects with the state's share participation. In this way, the risk is redistributed and the interests of the participants in ensuring the success of the investment project (AVVA, for example) are combined. The government's agent, a general investment fund, is interested in the quick return of state capital, since this raises its income on securities expressed as long-term bonds, which stimulates investment activity. In this way, the general investment fund can operate on a fundamentally new level of participation in the investment process: not only as a guarantor but as an active investor with an interest in a higher exchange value of the securities, that is to say, in the long-term development of enterprises. The return of investments to the state and accelerated turnover of investment capital are ensured, substantial amounts of capital of private investors can be attracted in a short period of time, and state capital is released to turn over again. The best prepared nonstate agent structure today is the system of investment funds which has taken shape (there are 16 of them in our republic). They are the ones who are able in a short time to change from an apparatus for accumulating and redistributing checks and IPV's [personal privatization deposits] into a mechanism for efficient redistribution of real capital. We already have large and stable funds: the National Fund, the Zolotoy kolos [Golden Grain] Fund, the Obrazovaniye [Education] Fund, and the Doveriye [Trust] Fund, which are the largest holders of stock of privatized enterprises. They integrate their capital and could act as specialized institutions to realize state investment policy in the republic. Especially since the funds must be integrated to join the all-Russian and world securities markets. The end of voucher privatization does not rule out the continued operation of check funds. According to the Statute on Investment Funds, they may not be liquidated as check funds for 3 years, especially since in our republic they must continue to work vigorously until the effective period of the IPV's is up. But at the same time, new trends in the development of check funds have been noted, taking into account the coming crisis of the stock market, the threat of bankruptcy, and the need to accept the new forms of work which have become established in world practice. Some funds specialize in creating a universal diversified portfolio (stock, deposits, and short-term investments). Another group is oriented to long-term investments and "know-how" and is reviving sectorial directions of investments. Finally, a considerable number of funds will merge or change their status. The funds appear to be ready for transformation into investment companies, investment banks, affiliates, and branches of investment banks and are being transformed or are creating investment funds with deferred payments related to pension and insurance support, payment for the future education of children, and savings for building housing. It would be right to support this aspiration of theirs and use them as the basis to create the necessary structure of agents of the Government of the Republic of Tatarstan. This must also be done in order to prevent a social explosion: the crisis of organizations which have hundreds of thousands of stockholders among the population as their investors puts responsibility on the state for their stability and the reorganization of funds; therefore their activity should be put on a civilized track. Continued state support of check funds is needed, fund departments must be created in every joint stock company, and support in developing the whole stock market in Tatarstan and Russia must be provided. The All-Russian Fifth Conference of Check Funds held recently in Izhevsk, where the problems of post-voucher privatization were discussed, confirmed that our position in regard to state support and the creation of better conditions for the activity of check funds on the republic's territory was right. The first annual meetings of stockholders of check funds showed that funds like the following are most trusted among the population and have the greatest potential to pay the largest dividends: Zolotoy kolos (400 percent annually), the National Fund (250 percent annually), Obrazovaniye (210 percent annually), APK-Invest [Agroindustrial Complex-Invest] (200 percent annually), and Doveriye (200 percent annually). We understand that the least protected categories of the population (pensioners, disabled persons, budget sphere employees, and employees of the military-industrial complex, public organizations, and other enterprises which are not to be privatized) are the stockholders of check funds. The issuance of some of the stock of privatized enterprises to stockholders of check funds at face value and their exemption from tax on profits and dividends, even for just the first 2 years (or until the effective period of the IPV's runs out), will be the minimum support needed for this group of the population. Funds must allow transactions practiced in the West and remove the enormous number of restrictions. This was also discussed at the all-Russian seminar. Among other things, the use of debt obligations must be permitted. For example, the bills of exchange ["veksel"] of Tveruniversalbank [Tver Universal Bank] suggest that such a category of securities is promising. The opportunity to buy back one's own stock must be granted and there must be the possibility of changing into other investment forms, merging must be promoted, and the most important thing, the offices of check funds must be extensively used in the councils of directors of joint stock companies. The egoism of labor collectives must be overcome and private capital and the development of a civilized stock market and a secondary securities market must be set in motion. The first results of the work of the National Investment Fund, which has more than 5 billion rubles in assets and integrates capital of other funds under conditions of consolidation, shows that we have the potential for entrepreneurship. Today the National and a group of other funds have created an investment bank and a nonstate pension fund and have formulated a number of interesting, socially oriented investment projects and are forming an insurance company. All this increases the turnover and stability of personal investments. The question of protecting the rights of all stockholders and insuring their investments is becoming most important. In our republic we have not had cases such as those involving Tekhnicheskiy progress [Technical Progress], Privat-Invest [Private Invest], and Neft-Almaz-Invest [Oil and Diamonds Invest], but that does not mean that we should lessen control in this direction. It is also important to create conditions to lessen the difficulty of transactions with securities in the work of check funds. So, we will support check funds, but we are for tougher control over the capital of the collective investor, the stockholders of the funds.
