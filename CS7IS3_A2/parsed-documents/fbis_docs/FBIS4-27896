FBIS4-27896 "dreas108_c_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-108 Daily Report 4 Jun 1994 North Korea Cilreco Issues Memorandum on Nuclear Issue Cilreco Issues Memorandum on Nuclear Issue SK0406153094 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1522 GMT 4 Jun 94 SK0406153094 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, June 4 (KCNA) -- The International Liaison Committee for the Reunification and Peace in Korea (Cilreco) in the "Memorandum on the Nuclear Issue of the Korean Peninsula" published on May 11 cited concrete data to refute the false argument of the United States and its allies about "nuclear threat" from the Northern half of Korea and laid bare the truth behind it. The lengthy memorandum is made up of the foreword, concluding words and "1. The origin of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and U.S. nuclear weapons deployed in South Korea," "2. The United States' deployment of nuclear weapons in South Korea is the dangerous source of nuclear war," "3. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is taking the attitude of discriminating against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. U.S. interference and intrigues with IAEA are a gross discredit to the IAEA," "4. Attempt to impose `sanctions' upon DPRK through the U.N. Security Council is a breach of the U.N. Charter and meant to use the international community as a tool of the United States for executing its policy of strength," "5. The U.S. alleged 'nuclear threat' from the North is a new excuse based on the fiction of `threat of southward invasion' from the North," "6. In order to achieve a peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula without foreign interference, an environment favorable for a solution to all conflicts in the region should be created and the confederation formula laid down by the DPRK be realized." The memorandum says the aim sought by the United States and its allies against the DPRK, raising a hue and cry over the fictitious "nuclear issue" of the North is to perpetuate the existence of nuclear weapons worldwide and push ahead with their modernization and ensure continued monopolization of nuclear weapons by big powers, and to draw public attention away from the U.S. nuclear weapons deployed in South Korea on the pretext of the "Korean issue". According to the memorandum, the United States began shipping nuclear weapons into the Korean peninsula in 1957 in violation of the Armistice Agreement and turned South Korea into a vast nuclear base from the mid-1970s. The fact that nuclear weapons were deployed in South Korea was confirmed officially when it was made public at the 125th session of the South Korean "National Assembly" in 1985 that the number of various types of nukes deployed in South Korea reached 1,720. The DPRK, a non-nuclear state, in its government statement June 23, 1986, proposed to the United States and South Korea to turn the Korean peninsula into a nuclear-free peace zone, and urged the United States to reduce the nuclear weapons in South Korea on a phased basis for the complete withdrawal of the nuclear weapons therefrom and to cancel all its operational plans. The United States, together with South Korea, is conducting a campaign against the North over its "nuclear arms development". The DPRK advanced new detailed proposals, paying heed to the "declaration on denuclearization" of the then South Korean "President" No Tae-u November 8, 1991 and, as a result, the "joint declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" was adopted. The DPRK concluded with the IAEA the safeguards agreement pursuant to the [Nuclear] Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) on January 30, 1992 and accepted the agency's five consecutive inspections of its facilities. The IAEA, however, under pressure from the United States, has further spread the "nuclear suspicion" about the North, trying to force a "special inspection" of military sites of the DPRK. The IAEA's unreasonable demand for a "special inspection" of military sites of a sovereign state contravenes the principles of neutrality and impartiality of the agency. The unfair attitude of the IAEA is manifested in the fact that pressure has not been put on the countries whose production and stockpile of nuclear weapons are kept secret. Japan has promoted its nuclear program from long ago, and South Korea has stockpiled above ten tons of plutonium enough to manufacture 1,500 Nagasaki-type nuclear bombs. While negotiating with the North, the United States has made the U.N. Security Council put pressure on it. If the United Nations truly wants a fair solution of Korea's "nuclear issue", it must take measures to get all the foreign forces out of South Korea, dissolve the "U.N. Command" and to help realize the principles of independent and peaceful reunification of Korea, as clarified in the resolution adopted at the 30th session of the U.N. General Assembly in 1975. The North's "nuclear threat" clamored about by the United States and the successive South Korean authorities is nothing more than a sophism invented to justify the U.S. military occupation of South Korea and the deployment and reinforcement of its military equipment and "protect" South Korea under its "nuclear umbrella". The June 11, 1993, DPRK-U.S. joint statement supported the North-South joint declaration on denuclearization, and it declared that Armed Forces including nuclear weapons shall not be used, threat not be made with such forces and the denuclearization, peace and security of the Korean peninsula be ensured and each other's sovereignty shall be respected mutually. It also expressed support to Korea's peaceful reunification. Nevertheless, the United States again launched into a campaign against the DPRK, expressing its intention to resume the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises, and the U.S. President blared that any North Korean attack on South Korea would be regarded as an attack on the United States. The agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. New York contact for a negotiated solution of the problem was published on February 25, 1994, but the United States negated the agreed conclusions by threatening to resume the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises and not to come out to the third round talks but take the North's "nuclear issue" again to the U.N. Security Council. The deployment by U.S. war-thirsty elements of 192 Patriot missiles and 84 ground-to-air Stinger missiles in South Korea in April this year has caused apprehensions of the entire Korean people in the North and the South and touched off ceaseless demonstrations in South Korea against the United States' escalated arms buildup. The open deployment of latest-type weapons in South Korea is a crude violation of the Armistice Agreement. The United Nations, with heavy responsibility for ensuring peace on the Korean peninsula, should discharge its role and duty. To this end, the unstable Armistice Agreement signed in 1953 should be replaced by a peace agreement in accordance with the resolution of the 30th session of the U.N. General Assembly. The confederacy formula laid down by President Kim Il-song of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is a realistic and fair one which makes it possible to achieve Korea's reunification under the conditions where two different systems exist in the North and the South. To achieve the national reunification is the aspiration and legitimate right of the entire Korean people. It is also an important factor for the elimination of nuclear weapons, for the security in this region and the security and peace of the world people. The memorandum stresses that the international community should call for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and that the United States must not use such international organizations as the U.N. Security Council and the IAEA to gratify its interests but respect the joint statement adopted with the DPRK, resume negotiations with it and thereby create favorable conditions for peace and detente.
