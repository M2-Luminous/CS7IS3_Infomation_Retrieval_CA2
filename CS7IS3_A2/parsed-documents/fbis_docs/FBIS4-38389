An ITAR-TASS correspondent learned this from Viktor Mezhak, deputy chairman of the Crimean Parliament. Today is the deadline of the 10-day period during which, at the demand of the Ukrainian Parliament, the Crimean Supreme Council was to have brought the Crimean Constitution into agreement with the Ukrainian Constitution currently in force and with the law on the division of powers between the state power bodies of the two republics. Mezhak said that common sense should prevail at the session of the Ukrainian Supreme Council, which is opening tomorrow [31 May], and that the Ukrainian Parliament should not empower the president of Ukraine to "act stupidly" with regard to Crimea, as he called it. All the more so, he said, that not a single statement in the restored Constitution violates territorial integrity or leads to existing borders being redrawn because, under the Constitution, Crimea remains part of Ukraine. However, it would henceforth develop its relations with Ukraine on the basis of treaties and agreements through delegating power. According to the deputy chairman of the Crimean Parliament, a working group is to be formed from deputies of the Ukrainian Supreme Council and it is to come to Sevastopol no later than Friday [3 June] in order to continue the talks previously held in Kiev. Mezhak said the situation in Crimea is reasonably quiet and there are no grounds for concern. However, in his opinion, attempts to destabilize it from the outside depress people and introduce a note of anxiety into their everyday life and work.
