Only 34 votes were cast against the program. According to the program, a total of 20,000 small businesses, 1,400 unfinished construction projects and 8,000 medium and major industries will be privatized in 1994. As a result, Ukraine's private sector will amount to 28% of the country's economy. The state will receive over 21 Tn [Trillion] karbovantsy and over $230 Mn. The properties of state bodies, National Space Agency, TV and radio broadcasting centers, publishers' and port facilities are not subject to privatization. The chairman of the state privatization fund, Vladimir Pryadko, did not rule out that the adoption of the privatization program on the eve of the future parliamentary elections scheduled for March 27 was a measure of political character. In his opinion, "the Supreme Soviet's conservative nature hampered the process of privatization in the republic."
