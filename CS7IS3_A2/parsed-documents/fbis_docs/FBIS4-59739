[Hashemi-Rafsanjani] [passage omitted] In the cities we visited, we saw the people at the highest point of Islamic and revolutionary zeal. This makes me happy and I pray for these people who are showing their presence on the scene in this way; it gladdens the friends of the revolution and disappoints its enemies. Of course this presence is something the mass media should show for everyone to see. I cannot describe it. Satellites should carry reports on this so that those who think there is a distance between the people and the officials in Iran can see the real situation and review their assessments. [passage omitted on meetings with the disabled, the 'ulema, academicians, teachers, and other provincial officials, and on some of the projects inspected] We inspected the reconstructed areas in Rudbar and Manjil. It is a great source of pride that in four years this extensive area in Qazvin and Gilan, where around 240,000 units, including factories, plants, big bridges, dams, and so on, were destroyed or badly damaged by quake, have been reconstructed. Some 85 to 90 percent have been reconstructed. Some say 30 percent of the area has not been reconstructed. But that is not what we saw. The two cities of Rudbar and Manjil have become two modern cities with modern boulevards, streets, and strong antiquake buildings. The people there were extremely happy and satisfied. [passage omitted] We visited an exhibition in Rasht organized for our visit. Over 200 agricultural, animal breeding, fishing, industrial, handicraft, and other units participated in the exhibition. [passage omitted] Many of the participants said they are exporting and cited big export figures. Interesting is that during the past two years-- since we declared our new foreign exchange policies--most of these units have stopped meeting their needs abroad and are supplying their needs from domestic sources. Some of them still depend on iron smelting and so on but are waiting for these plants to become operational at home. Some also complained of a shortage of foreign exchange and raw materials. But I think that this year they will have no problems with these. I was extremely impressed with the industrial face of Rasht. [passage omitted] In Astara we inaugurated the new building of the Free Islamic University. We inspected the cargo-unloading project for trains arriving in Astara from Azerbaijan. We also inspected the railway that will link Azerbaijan with Astara and provide a link with a multipurpose port being built by the Reconstruction Jihad. This port will be used both for fishing and trade. Astara is a border city to which we should grant significance. These projects are necessary there. We are also constructing a large bridge over the Astara River. [passage omitted] In Anzali we saw the Mirza Kuchek Khan ship, now forging a strong passenger route between Iran and the other northern countries. This ship raises the Islamic Republic's prestige in the Caspian Sea. I advise our compatriots to seize the tourist opportunity being offered there. We also named a protected area at Anzali, next to the sea and near the existing port. Earlier we approved the plan for this region at the Supreme Council for Free Trade Zones. The designation of this area as a protected area needs no Majles approval. This area can be like one created in Sirjan. But this one may be stronger because seven or eight countries in the north can also use it and complement it, since a trade link between the north and the south needs such an area in the north. Our second center will be around the gulf of Gorgan and between Bandar-e Gaz and Bandar-e Torkaman. This plan has been approved. The only thing that should be done is to designate the area. [passage omitted] I said that the devotion and the national and Islamic sentiment I saw in Gilan was at its peak and could not have been better. And our nation can see the presence on the scene of the people in Gilan. This made me think about why these people's revolutionary zeal is so strong 15 years after the revolution. I was truly surprised. There is great negative propaganda against the government, especially because of the high prices and other problems, which are being raised in newspapers and by speakers and exaggerated by foreigners, so I thought the people would be disappointed. But they were so zealous, happy, and affectionate; this is something I would like to comment on. The people there are alert and literate. They are among the most literate people in our country as far as higher education is concerned. They are very cultured and they can analyze the situation. They also feel the realities. The coordination among the clergymen, the deputies, and the management is also among the effective elements creating this situation. And the security in the province is truly awe-inspiring. The law-enforcement forces, the [Islamic Revolution Guards] Corps, the Basijis, and all those dealing with information and security have truly done a good job there. I would like to cite a professor at Gilan University. The people in Gilan feel that something is being done and that infrastructural activities are being carried out. They also hear that activities are being carried out in the fields of steel, mining, shipping, ports, power plants, and telecommunications. They see what is going on in their own province. The people see that many things are being done. They understand the infrastructural activities and they are hopeful for the future. This university professor told me that a survey has shown that not since the Achamaenids and Medes has so much been done for the country's development. Part of this is natural, since times have changed and more means for progress and development are available. But during the past 30-40 years these same means were not used. The people feel this. Wherever they go they see a development project being implemented and capital being invested for the country's development. And they see this as good will. [passage omitted] The people see that there is no reason for them to believe what the enemies say and to be fooled by what the defeatists say. These are all felt by the people. They understand that there are high prices in the country too. But they themselves produce rice and tea. Before the revolution they used to sell their tea for 35 rials but now we buy tea from them at 570 rials. The same applies to their rice, honey, cattle, and so on. They understand that when something is bought at a high price it is sold at a high price. We are not satisfied with these high prices and we want to stop the profiteers. God willing, we will start our efforts to end this situation this year. But the people understand that the prevailing prices are the solution to the problem. If the price of tea was 30 to 40 rials no one would plant tea. And if rice was 70 to 80 rials no one would cultivate it. The people understand this. The entire nation understands this. At the end of my visit, I thank everyone--the 'ulema, the deputies, the managers, the law-enforcement forces, the Corps, the Basijis, the families of the martyrs, and everyone. I hope we can fulfill the promises we have made during this visit and tend to the people's affairs better. God's peace be upon you.
