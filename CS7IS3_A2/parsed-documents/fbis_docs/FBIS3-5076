FBIS3-5076 "dreas043__a94004" FBIS-EAS-94-043-A Document Type:Daily Report 4 March 1994 ANNEX Japan `Way To Defuse' Friction With U.S. Viewed OW0303115794 Tokyo SANKEI SHIMBUN in Japanese 26 Feb 94 Morning Edition p 9 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0303115794 Tokyo SANKEI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Unattributed article: "The Way To Defuse Japan-U.S. Friction"] [Text] The government has begun to speedily explore ways to break the impasse in the Japan-U.S. framework talks that ended in a breakdown. The government held a meeting of cabinet members in charge of foreign economic issues on 25 February to confirm that the government will map out a package of measures during March to promote imports, relax bureaucratic regulations, promote government procurement and adopt a competitive policy, and also map out a set of measures to expand domestic demand. Bureaucrats still strongly resist setting specific targets for them, and it remains to be seen whether these measures would be able to soften the U.S.'s tough trade stand on Japan. Promotion of Imports The "Market-Opening Issue Headquarters," mandated to examine specific measures to open the Japanese market, held its first meeting on 25 February to confirm that nontariff barriers keeping foreign firms from gaining access to the Japanese market should be quickly reviewed. According to the Economic Planning Agency [EPA], the Secretariat of the Office of Trade and Investment Ombudsman (OTO), the OTO handled 509 cases of business complaints filed by foreign companies. EPA believes that if common barriers hampering foreign firms from gaining access to the Japanese market are identified in the course of handling the business complaints, it would be possible for the government to map out a set of internationally-praised measures on its own to help foreign firms gain access to the Japanese market. The "Market-Opening Issue Headquarters" was created on 1 February with Prime Minister Hosokawa leading the organization. EPA describes the creation of the headquarters as an "indication of Japan's eagerness to grapple seriously with the issue of increasing foreign access to the Japanese market." The old headquarters, established in 1982, has been disbanded. Given the mandate of handling business complaints lodged by foreign companies, the newly established headquarters will have to map out a set of measures during March to resolve the business complaints filed by foreign firms, but it will be difficult to do that within the month under the present situation. EPA Director General Manae Kubota says: "We have no choice but to vigorously publicize OTO for the time being. We are going to send missions abroad within the year to publicize it." Automobiles As for measures to open the Japanese market to foreign automobiles and auto parts, the government's standard for import certification will be reviewed and the business community will be urged to voluntarily work out its own plans to boost imports of U.S. automobiles and auto parts. These actions will form the core of Japan's measures to boost imports of U.S. automobiles and auto parts. As for measures that the government can take to increase their imports, the standard for import certification is likely to be reviewed and the possibility of reducing the remodeling of imported U.S.-built cars which meet both Japanese and U.S. environmental and safety requirements is likely to be studied. The government's measures are likely to include stopping Japanese car repair factories from discriminating between domestically-made auto parts and imported auto parts and promoting the imports of auto parts used by them. Given the frequent occurrence of friction resulting from misunderstanding, the government intends to promote the design-in formula, under which Japanese and U.S. enterprises cooperate with each other from the design stage. The government plans to hold a "Big Three Seminar" (tentative name) to brief U.S. corporations on how Japanese and U.S. enterprises have cooperated with each other so far and what results the cooperation has brought about. U.S. Commerce Undersecretary Garten will visit Japan on 4 March and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] will present him with the government's package of measures to open the Japanese market in an informal meeting and to feel out his reaction to the package. The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, an organization formed by auto makers and the Japan Automobile Dealers Association, an organization created by auto dealers, have begun the joint work of drawing up plans for the purchase of U.S.-built cars and U.S.-made auto parts after 1995. They will compile a document to explain the current level of sales of U.S.-built automobiles in Japan to U.S. automakers. Regarding auto parts, which has become a focus of dispute between the two countries, three major Japanese carmakers -- Toyota Motor Corporation, Mitsubishi Motor Corporation, and Nissan Motor Company -- will unveil their respective plans in early March. Mazda Motor Corporation and other Japanese automakers are expected to unveil their plans. In 1933, Japan purchased only $14.48 billion in U.S.- made auto parts, an increase of 6.3 percent over the year earlier, and meeting the target of purchasing $19 billion worth of U.S.-made auto parts is almost impossible. The view is spreading among Japanese automakers that "the automobile issue should be settled by Japanese and U.S. automakers." Insurance Japan shows no signs of making concessions on opening the Japanese insurance market. The non-life insurance industry is reacting against setting any targets for the share of U.S. insurance firms in the Japanese insurance market. A major insurance firm says, "Japan has run a deficit with the United States in the insurance sector, and we are not concerned about any U.S. sanctions." Some Japanese insurance companies are voicing the need for Japan to take a tough stand on the United States. Given this backlash from the non-life insurance industry, it would be difficult for the Finance Ministry to map out a set of concessions to open the Japanese insurance market. Meanwhile, the Finance Ministry plans to introduce a brokerage system by amending the Insurance Business Law next spring to help U.S. insurance companies strengthen their marketing activities in Japan. The Finance Ministry plans to use the administrative discretion to delay the liberalization of the Japanese insurance market. The ministry, however, will seek the understanding of the United States by explaining to the United States its plans to help maintain the currently high share of the Japanese insurance market held by U.S. insurance companies. Expansion of Domestic Demand Last year, the United States posted a record $59.3 billion trade deficit with Japan. Even if the government decides to put into effect measures, especially the four-point measure to open the Japanese market, those measures can hardly be regarded as a trump card to reduce the huge U.S. trade deficit with Japan. Japan is also under pressure to map out a set of measures in the macroarea. As a target that can be easily understood abroad, presently under study is an increase in the ten-year plan for public investment totalling 430 trillion yen that was incorporated in the final report of the Japan-U.S. Structural Impediment Initiative Talks in June 1990. At a cabinet meeting on 25 February, many cabinet members spoke positively of the increase, and a report compiled by the Economic Reform Research Council (headed by Gaishi Hiraiwa) last December proposed the increase on the condition that the "government secure financial resources." The increase is expected to be approximately 100 trillion yen at the end of the coordination of views within the government. In addition, the "national welfare tax" called for 18 trillion yen in tax cuts over the next three years, but the government has decided on tax cuts for only one year, provoking growing complaints in the United States. Finance Minister Fujii intends to explain to his U.S. counterpart at the Japan-U.S. finance ministerial talks on 26 February that the "tax cuts are Japan's promise to make a sweeping reform of the current tax system," but it is unclear how to secure financial resources to make up for a financial shortfall resulting from the tax cuts. It is also unclear to what extent Japan will be able to obtain U.S. understanding on the tax cuts. In addition to those measures, the idea is surfacing of establishing a target effort to keep Japan's current account surplus at 2.8 percent of its gross domestic product and making the target effort "Japan's commitment." Foreign Minister Hata supports the idea, and there is a possibility that Japan will present the United States with this idea as a voluntarily-established numerical target. However, Administrative Finance Vice Minister Jiro Saito has said, "The government's consensus is that it will not present the United States with anything like numerical targets." In this way, some Finance Ministry officials are voicing their disapproval of the idea. Government Procurement The government will try to put into effect the action program designed to expand government procurement and make it transparent. The government will publicize English-language versions of bidding advertisements and databased bidding information in an attempt to smoothly supply information to foreign contractors that have so far had difficulty obtaining such information. The government plans to announce its plans earlier than ever for the procurement of goods worth more than 800,000 SDR (the special drawing rights of the IMF), improve the current system for settling bidding complaints lodged by foreign construction firms and simplify the current procurement procedure. Relaxation of Bureaucratic Regulations The relaxation of bureaucratic regulations has frequently been mentioned as an effective means to expand domestic demand and open the Japanese market since last September when the government announced a package of economic stimulus measures. The relaxation of bureaucratic regulations requires the amendment of many relevant laws. Most of the deregulation, though incorporated in the September package of economic stimulus measures, will be put into effect after this spring. Even if the government announces a set of new measures to relax regulations, it is doubtful whether this would bring about an immediate effect. In particular, the package of measures to relax bureaucratic regulations will greatly affect the established enterprises, though only temporarily. It seems that the enterprises want to put off deregulation as long as possible. The September package of economic stimulus measures included relaxing 94 regulations, including regulations on housing construction, but relaxation of only 35 regulations out of the 94 has been put into effect. The rest will be relaxed after the Diet amends relevant laws. The Hiraiwa Report proposes that "economic regulation must be confined only to exceptional cases out of principle." The report also points out the need to study the possibility of amending the Large-Scale Retail Store Law and deregulating five areas, including the first-kind telecommunications business. The "Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters" of the government, which was established in early February, has pointed out the need to reduce or deregulate 682 cases of certification and licensure. A February package of economic stimulus measures emphasizes the need to relax 54 regulations as an effective means to stimulate the economy. Some government officials are saying the "government has already taken all immediately enforceable steps to expand domestic demand and relax bureaucratic regulation." The certification and licensure of cases, currently numbering 11,402, show no signs of shrinking, and the United States will incessantly press Japan to reduce its number of regulations.
