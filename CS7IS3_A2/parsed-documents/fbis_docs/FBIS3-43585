However, Issue No. 15 of the newspaper, which was supposed to be published on 6 January, was seized at the printing house by administrative authorities. The paper was then suspended. LE NOUVEL INDEPENDANT has distinguished itself these past weeks by publishing articles denouncing some scandals within the corridors of power. On the other hand, it has been reported that PERSPECTIVE HEBDO, another independent newspaper published in Douala, the economic capital of the country, has also been suspended.
