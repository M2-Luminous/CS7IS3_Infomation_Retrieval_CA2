FR940803-1-00039 FR940803-1-00010 Recommendation by DOT Inspector General As the use of insufficiently qualified personnel by some operators has become known, several sources in addition to NTSB have recommended that DOT take action to regulate the qualifications of pipeline personnel. In December 1982, the DOT Inspector General (IG) recommended in a memorandum to the RSPA Administrator that RSPA require licensing or certification of managers/superintendents of gas distribution systems. The IG said: State safety inspectors have indicated that operators of small municipal and privately owned gas distributors are frequently unaware of the federal safety standards or lack the know-how to implement them. Managers or superintendents of gas distribution systems should demonstrate a basic knowledge and understanding of federal safety standards before they are allowed to operate/manage the systems. Licensing or certification of natural gas distribution operators would improve compliance and enable State safety inspectors to provide greater coverage by reducing the amount of time expended in explaining standards to operators. Many States already require the operators of other utility systems to be licensed. Recommendations by Congress The House Committee on Energy and Commerce in its November 17, 1987, report to accompany H.R. 2266, a bill to amend the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 (NGPSA) 1 and the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 (HLPSA) # stated that DOT ``may establish criteria for a program of testing for pipeline operations employees and include licensing based on that testing if this is appropriate'' (H.R. Rep. No. 445, Pt. 1, 100th Congress, 1st Session, 13). This bill culminated in the Pipeline Safety Reauthorization Act of 1988 (Pub. L. No. 100&hyph;561; October 31, 1988), which, in sections 101 and 201, gave DOT discretionary authority to require ``that all individuals responsible for the operation and maintenance of pipeline facilities be tested for qualifications and certified to perform such functions.'' 1 Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;272 was enacted on July 5, 1994. This Act revises, codifies and enacts without substantive changes certain transportation laws, including those related to pipeline safety. Thus citations to the NGPSA and the HLPSA have been changed to 49 U.S.C. sec. 60101 et seq. Recommendation by Minnesota Commission on Pipeline Safety The need for qualification standards for pipeline personnel has also been recognized at the state level. Following the July 1986 failure of an 8-inch products pipeline in Minnesota that resulted in the deaths of two people and serious injury to another person, the Governor of Minnesota established the Minnesota Commission on Pipeline Safety. This commission examined the safety and reliability of pipelines operating in Minnesota. The commission's December 1986 report included a recommendation that the U.S. Department of Transportation study the need for additional registration, licensing, and certification requirements for pipeline design and construction personnel. Recommendations by National Association of Pipeline Safety Representatives An alternative approach to government licensing or certification of operators or operator personnel was recommended in 1986 by the National Association of Pipeline Safety Representatives (NAPSR), an association of state pipeline safety inspectors. In one of its annual resolutions (1986&hyph;9) submitted to the RSPA Administrator, NAPSR urged DOT ``to initiate a rulemaking to establish regulations which would require natural gas operator personnel qualification.'' NAPSR made this recommendation after determining that ``it would be in the best interest of public safety, and as a general standard for the natural gas industry, that all natural gas system operations be under the direction of a person who is qualified by test, experience, and training in natural gas work.'' Again in 1990, in one of its annual resolutions (1990&hyph;3), NAPSR urged the DOT Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) ``to create specific qualification standards of uniformity across the industry'' and that the rulemaking ``be expanded to include personnel engaged in design and construction.'' Like NTSB, NAPSR has recommended a rulemaking approach rather than Federal licensing or certification. In this notice RSPA has proposed that regulated design or construction functions required to properly accomplish covered operation, maintenance or emergency-response work must be performed by persons qualified as proposed in this notice. However, persons with pipeline expertise and registered as professional engineers in the state where the work is located are qualified for any such engineering design under this proposal. At this time, RSPA does not see the need to extend the proposed qualification requirements to include personnel engaged in all regulated design and construction functions as recommended in the NAPSR resolution. Application of the proposed requirements to only those personnel performing regulated operation, maintenance and emergency response functions is consistent with the intent of the Recommendations by Congress and the mandate contained in the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992 (below). Nonetheless, in response to that NAPSR resolution, RSPA invites persons to comment on whether we should extend the testing and certification requirements to personnel engaged in all regulated design and construction of covered pipelines. Persons commenting in support of such an extension are requested to support their positions with data from related accidents that includes: the quantity of gas, hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide released and any resulting deaths, personal injuries, property damages and environmental damages.
