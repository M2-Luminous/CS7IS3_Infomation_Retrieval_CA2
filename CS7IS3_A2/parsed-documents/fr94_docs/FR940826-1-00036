FR940826-1-00036 FR940826-1-00007 40 CFR Part 131 [OW-FRL&hyph;5058&hyph;2] Water Quality Standards for Surface Waters of the Sacramento River, San Joaquin River, and San Francisco Bay and Delta of the State of California: Notice of Availability AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Notice of Availability. SUMMARY: This notice announces the availability of two documents entitled, respectively, ``Alternative Formulation of the Salmon Smolt Survival Index Criteria'', and ``Setting Goals for Salmon Smolt Survival in the Delta''. The first of these documents presents EPA's proposed alternative formulation of the salmon smolt survival index criteria. The second document is a summary of the 3 scientific workshops held on June 9, 17, and 29, 1994, and prepared by the independent workshop facilitator. This notice also requests comments on EPA's alternative formulation of the salmon smolt survival index criteria. EPA is not soliciting any additional comments outside the scope of this notice. DATES: Copies of these documents are available beginning on August 26, 1994. Written comments on the specific issues raised in this document pertaining to the salmon smolt survival index criteria will be accepted until September 26, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the above documents can be obtained from, and comments on these documents should be submitted to: Patrick Wright, Bay/Delta Section Chief, W&hyph;2&hyph;4, Water Management Division, Environmental Protection Agency, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, California, 94105. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Patrick Wright, Bay/Delta Section Chief, W&hyph;2&hyph;4, Water Management Division, Environmental Protection Agency, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, California, 94105. Telephone: (415) 744&hyph;1993. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background On January 6, 1994, EPA published in the Federal Register a Proposed Rule for water quality standards in the Sacramento River, San Joaquin River, and San Francisco Bay and Delta of California (Bay/Delta) (59 FR 810). The purpose of the rule would be to establish certain water quality criteria for the Bay/Delta as authorized and required by section 303 of the Clean Water Act (CWA). The federally-proposed rule would replace portions of the State of California's water quality standards that were disapproved by EPA on September 3, 1991. Under the proposed regulations, three new sets of criteria would be established: salinity criteria protecting the Estuarine Habitat and other designated fish and wildlife uses, a second set of salinity criteria (measured in electrical conductivity) to protect the Fish Spawning designated use in the lower San Joaquin River, and a set of salmon smolt survival index criteria to protect the Fish Migration and Cold Fresh-Water Habitat designated uses in the estuary. EPA held public hearings on the Proposed Rule during the weeks of February 21, 1994 and February 28, 1994, and the comment period closed on March 11, 1994. Subsequent to the close of the comment period, a number of scientific workshops on the salmon smolt criteria were sponsored and facilitated by a group of water users (including the California Urban Water Users) and environmental organizations (including the Bay Institute). The purpose of these workshops was to consider and evaluate both the Proposed Rule and the major comments received by EPA during the comment period. The workshop sponsors invited EPA to attend the workshops, and EPA staff participated in workshops on June 9, 17, and 29, 1994. The discussions at these workshops are summarized in the August 10, 1994 document entitled ``Setting Goals for Salmon Smolt Survival in the Delta'' by Wim Kimmerer. After reviewing the oral and written comments and the discussions at these workshops, EPA has developed a proposed alternative formulation of the salmon smolt survival index criteria.
