The PDDSH stresses that, since the fall of the dictatorial regime, the role of the state has been to protect and coordinate the interests of the individual with those of society. In the post- dictatorial period, a powerful and rigorous state is needed to implement laws and defend the rights of citizens guaranteed by the Constitution. For the juridical state to function better, the PDDSH will strive to implement the following measures: 1. To restore law and order by waging a bitter struggle against criminals (theft, violation, drugs, prostitution, and hooliganism). In order to achieve this, extensive powers will be granted to the law and order forces to impose extremely severe sanctions against dereliction of duty. 2. To determine the official status of state employees by giving them necessary powers to perform their duties, decent pay according to their functions, and legal protection. Criteria to be met by state employees will also be defined, giving priority to honesty, professionalism, and the strict implementation of state laws. 3. For a better functioning of the legal state, a profound reform in the justice system is necessary. Existing legislation should be amended to include judgments by people's juries. Work will be also be carried out to purge judicial groups of people who, in the past, have participated in political trials or, during the transition period, have compromised themselves while carrying out their duties. A profound reform in the law and order forces and the army will be carried out in order to make these bodies serve the juridical state with allegiance. 4. The PDSSH will firmly struggle against corruption, speculations, and favoritism at all levels. It will persevere with extremely severe lawful measures to discover and punish such cases. Within this framework, a major overhaul of the customs-duty system, financial policy, tariff offices, forestry policy, state inspectorates of electricity, health services, etc. will be carried out. 5. To fully implement these laws, the PDDSH will insist that the legislation on urban area development be further improved and put into practice by guaranteeing buildings and other construction sites in conformity with technical discipline and approved plans. 6. The PDDSH supports a parliamentary republic where the three powers -- legislative, executive, and juridical -- are led along the fulfillment of rights set out in the Constitution. The PDDSH is, at the same time, in favor of a popular referendum on the form of regime to be established. 7. The PDDSH is for a secular state where religion is separate from the state. The PDDSH honors the rights of Muslim, Orthodox, and Catholic believers to freely observe their religious endeavors. The PDDSH will resolutely circumvent any religious sect in their attempt to capitalize on citizens' religious convictions, national interests, or democratic principles defined by the Constitution. Thee PDDSH underscores that it will resolutely fight for the Autocephalous Orthodox Church of Albania. The PDDSH decidedly declares itself against foreign prelates of various ranks overseeing religious organizations in Albania. 8. The PDDSH will make all necessary efforts to secure full equality among citizens, regardless of race, religion, sex, or political views. 9. The PDDSH is for a better coordination of power between central and local government bodies. The PDDSH's policy on the National Question 1. The PDDSH will pursue its foreign policy entirely along the fulfillment and protection of aspirations, the rights and interests of the Albanian nation as a whole, and the Albanian state. 2. The PDDSH proclaims as its benevolent ideal the struggle for the resolution of the Albanian national question -- that is, the unification of all detached parts of the Albanian nation and ethnic territories based on the Albanian nation's right to self-determination in accordance with the Law of Nations. 3. The PDDSH is opposed to all kinds of malicious propaganda, domestic and external, by the speculative name of "Great Albania," and it is definitely in favor of the ethnic Albania as a national state for all Albanians as a factor for peace and stability in the Balkans. 4. All efforts by the PDDSH reagrding foreign policy will serve the fulfillment of the Albanian nation's aspirations for unity. It will not accept any general or partial solution aimed at denying legitimate endeavors for unity. 5. The PDDSH is against any tendencies, political trends, or Albanian political forces that tend to present the Albanian national question as a facultative task for the Albanians, thus trying to replace nationalism with cosmopolitanism. 6. The PDDSH will strive to unite all the patriotic forces of the Albanian nation in the ethnic Albanian lands and diaspora in order to serve the cause of national unification. It will repudiate all kinds of political forces or elements who try to bring into question the Albanian nation's right to and capability for unification or manifest their tendencies to conclude agreements or cooperate with foreign powers to the detirment of the Albanian national question. PDDSH Foreign Policy 1. In its relations with other countries, the PDDSH will pursue a serious, realistic, entirely nationalist, and open policy that firmly relies on the lessons that history has taught us, without preconceptions, or a complex of inferiority toward others, opposing unilateral concessions that are not based on the principles of mutual benefit and justice. 2. The PDDSH will strive to build and develop the Albanian state's international relations on sound and safe foundations in reasonable ways, in accordance with our country's real possilibities, and the attitude of other states and nations toward the Albanian nation and state. 3. Albania as a state and nation should decently take its place in Europe next to the other nations and states. Nationalism should not be considered as an obstacle to Albania's integration into Europe but rather a necessity for the united Albanian nation to take its place in united Europe without any discrimination. 4. The PDDSH will strive to see that Albania, as an European country, maintains broad and cordial relations with other countries and regions of the world, especially those countries with which it has maintained ancient traditional links, spiritual and cultural affinity, and common interests and principles. 5. The PDDSH is in favor of close state relations, particularly those states and nations that are historically or actually inclined to be close friends and allies of Albania, as well as other countries and nations that show signs of goodwill toward us. The PDDSH will never aim to fuel and foment hostility toward any other nation or state, be it big or small, near or far away. What the PDSH wants is only good understanding, friendship, and useful cooperation. 6. The PDDSH will always be ready to develop close and thorough relations of good neighborliness in the Balkans and Adriactic region. It is of the opinion that relations with Italy and Turkey are fruitful and neighborly. Possiblities are increasing for relations with Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania, and Slovenia. Relations can also be developed with nearby countries bordering on the Albanian nation, like Greece, Serbia, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia], and Montenegro, depending on the stand that those states maintain toward the Albanian nation's legitimate rights of the Albanian nation and toward the Republic of Kosovo. The PDDSH will always bear in mind that good-neighborly relations with those states will depend on the policy pursued by their governments. 7. The PDDSH is in favor of Albania's absolute relationship with Kosovo as two states belonging to one and the same religion and having the same political and diplomatic tasks to fulfill in the field of foreign policy and international relations. The policy of the Republic of Albania will powerfully and without any reservations support the recognition of independence and sovereignty of the Republic of Kosovo as a transitory period toward national union. The PDDSH will oppose all kinds of diplomatic plans that try to impose upon the Albanian nation in Kosovo any narrow politico-juridical, state, or juridico-international status that is contrary to the political will already expressed by their votes in the referendum on the occasion of the proclamation of the Republic of Kosovo and the elections held in Kosovo. The PDDSH will resolutely struggle to see that Albanians in Macedonia and Montenegro freely and without hindrance are able to exercise their rights until the ultimate resolution of the Albanian national question is accomplished. The PDDSH will strive that the [word indistinct] population return to their hearths and their property [in northwestern Greece] taken by force, enjoying their rights as an inseparable part of the Albanian nation. 8. The PDDSH desires and will attempt to maintain the Albanian state's close and fruitful relations friendly nations and countries like Austria, Germany, and Hungary, great democratic powers like the United States, Europe's civilized and developed countries, and Arab and all other countries. 9. The PDDSH supports the participation of Albania in universal organizations, important international bodies, and organizations of regional character. The PDDSH attaches importance to the participation of the Albanian state through relevant bodies in activities of cooperation and understanding in the Balkans, the Adriatic Sea, Europe, the Mediterranean and Black Sea, in the Conference of the Islamic Countries, and in other bodies that might be set up in the future. 10. The PDDSH proposes that the Albanian state set up a diplomatic service of genuine national physiognomy, spirit, and professional qualification that is capable of properly performing its duties toward their nation and serving the cause of the Albanian national question and its long-term mission. 11. The PDDSH will always be ready to coordinate efforts and actions and discuss them with all Albanian political forces that are sincerely in favor of a genuine foreign and national policy on the part of the Albanian state on the international policy front. However, the PDDSH will resolutely reject and repudiate any compromise that might undermine and impair the resolution of the Albanian national question, sacrifice the rights and interests of our brothers in their ethnically occupied territories, or damage the sovereignty and dignity of the Albanian nation and state. 12. The PDDSH will strive to see that Albania and the Albanians earn the world's sympathy and respect, thus achieving a good understanding but not pleading for them. It will oppose all practices of various states or international bodies that try to bring Albania under a certain degree of foreign political and juridical tutelage.
