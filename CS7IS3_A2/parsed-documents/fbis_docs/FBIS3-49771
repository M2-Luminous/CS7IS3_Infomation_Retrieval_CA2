After a time of discreet silence on the subject of the feud between the government and local self-government structures, in mid-December it suddenly issued a statement of its position on that subject, a statement in which words like "decentralization," "self-government," and "citizens' society" literally abound. [Kwasniewski] We have never, in fact, kept silent on the subject, and there is nothing paradoxical in the position adopted by the SdRP Supreme Council. Because a large number of misunderstandings have arisen around the questions of self-government and the administration reform, it was necessary to define our position clearly. After a debate on the subject, the Supreme Council adopted an official position that is now binding for us. In all of our dealings in parliament, as well as in internal government negotiations, we will defend the decentralization of power, the modeling of a citizens' society, the consolidation of self-government structures, and the expansion of the range of competence of these structures. These principles also apply to other self-government structures, such as self-government bodies in educational establishments, economic self-management bodies, and trade unions. Our interest in decentralization is not an expediency strategy. We believe that decentralization makes sense from the viewpoint of the new state structure and the new decisionmaking system. [Doering] All of this sounds very fine. By voicing such views in the six months separating us from the planned local self-government elections, you can easily gain the reputation of a keen self-management advocate. At the same time, the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] has come to be seen as against local self-government structures--in a situation where the coalition is supposed to make joint decisions. [Kwasniewski] On what grounds do you base your claim? [Doering] I base it on the silence maintained by the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] on the freeze imposed on the self-government pilot program, the suspension of the transfer of schools to parish authorities' management, and the collapse of the finances act, which entailed the preservation of the income-tax distribution system that is highly disadvantageous to active parishes and the absence of the compensation payments scheme for VAT [value-added-tax] induced losses. Should I go on with the list? All these decisions were made by the government and by parliament. [Kwasniewski] The majority of these cases involved either unfortunate timing or other disadvantageous coincidence. If the government had not been appointed in October but rather, two or three months earlier, maybe we could have avoided a greater number of these setbacks. As it was, however, the government was destined to carry out its work on the budget in great haste. This was compounded by the need to attend to local self-government draft acts--for example, the finance act--which were not even prepared by the present government. Perhaps we should have shown more confidence in the work of our predecessors, but you cannot really deny the new government the right to make its own decisions in such important matters. If the previous cabinet had prepared a draft constitution, surely you would not insist that the new government should pass it on to parliament right away during its first session? [Doering] I am not sure.... If it was a good enough project, I would probably not worry too much that it was not of my own making. But let us return to our main question: When can we expect the SdRP declarations of support for local self-government structures to be shored up by more tangible actions? [Kwasniewski] We are all facing a forthcoming test--the local self-government elections scheduled for the end of May and the beginning of June. Then, all our proposals and decisions will be verified by the voters themselves. It is not as if we could get away with talking nonsense about the self-government system, or with doing nothing about it except making well-meaning noises. Self-government structures are at present controlled by the Democratic Union and other groups of similar political orientation. If it were to become apparent that the present coalition has not only failed to do anything tangible to further the cause of self-government but even halted the progress of certain self-government processes, I have not the slightest doubt that today's opposition would win the elections. On the other hand, if the coalition demonstrates successfully its honorable intentions concerning the self-government system, it will stand a good chance of succeeding. [Doering] You speak as if the coalition were unanimous on the question of a reform of the system. [Kwasniewski] I will not deny that from the very beginning there have been differences between us. The PSL is more cautious, and we in turn have no reason to question their knowledge of the functioning of self-government structures at the parish level. It is, after all, their own ground. The PSL has never questioned the need to decentralize power and to reinforce self-government structures, but it adopts a different viewpoint: We should put things in order first and reform them later. In my opinion, in certain areas this position is quite sensible, but in others it could possibly prove slightly too conservative. We have always believed that we should make decisions in favor of changes. We have expressed our political will and we will try to put it into practice. By mid-January, we will have held our first round of talks with the PSL. I hope that we will be able to decide whose position should prevail before the end of January. We need to make sure that a range of fundamental questions is sorted out first--first, the principles of financing the parishes; then, extension of their range of competence; finally, the issue of whether we should create a new system of districts. [Doering] What if you come up against a brick wall in your talks with the PSL? [Kwasniewski] We will then continue to discuss the same things in parliament. We are not alone there. [Doering] What decisions should you be making in the question of the package of parliamentary bills prepared by Hanna Suchocka's government--that is, the district and voivodship reform, the central authorities reform, the reform of the civil service sector, the government order system, and the reorganization of the Council of Ministers Office [URM]? [Kwasniewski] In all of these areas, changes are urgently necessary: There is no doubt whatsoever about that. The difficulties could begin as soon as we come to argue over the details--and the details fall within the brief of the working group for the public administration reform, appointed in mid-December by the SdRP Supreme Council. The civil service is a most important stabilizing element in the state administration system, and the sooner it is introduced, the better. We must find ways to minimalize corruption, and that goal is best served by a system of government orders. I would exercise the greatest caution toward the URM reorganization project. I always suspect that all reorganization is the result of the need for a radical review of the personal appointments in the given system. Regardless of whether the URM is given a new name and whether it is left as one bloc or divided into three general directorates, it will always be with us because it has three important functions to fulfill: provision of services to the government and the prime minister; legislation and contacts with parliament; and coordination of the operations of local government administration. [Doering] In the latest campaign, the SLD made a firm pledge of support for the district reform. What districts and when? Minister Strak says: Let us first put the local state administration in individual regions in order, and then we can decide whether we should organize self-government elections there. [Kwasniewski] In my opinion, once you have started something, it is advisable to see it through. Stopping a new development as soon as you started seems to me too defensive a strategy. There is no sense in maintaining the regional system today: The regions are, as it were, semidistrict creations, and as such they remain strictly artificial. We must make it quite clear that we intend to finish what we started. The district reform will mean that the number of voivodships will be reduced to about 15-20. This will inevitably cause heated arguments and conflicts because the parliament that approved that formula for the reform was chosen to represent the present configuration of 49 voivodships. We can expect that all conceivable sorts of lobbies will be set up and activated in defense of the status quo. If, say, we return to the original blueprint of 17 voivodships, what do you expect will be the reaction of the deputies from the 32 voivodships that would then cease to exist? They would have to go back to their earlier milieus and local configurations--but many present voivodship centers have already become accustomed to wielding their local power. [Doering] The PSL wants voivodships to function in the self-government system. [Kwasniewski] I do not see justification for the correctness of this concept in our circumstances because Poland functions as a unitary system. If a state is not organized as a federal or individual laender system, voivodships should be linked to the central authorities, and voivodas should represent the central government. [Doering] Because we have come to the subject of voivodas, let me cite your own words spoken before 19 September: "We will not check individuals' party membership cards to assert from which political affiliations people come to us. If they have satisfactory qualifications, they should be placed in those posts where their abilities will be put to the best use." [Kwasniewski] I still subscribe to that opinion. [Doering] How does it square with the announcement that you will replace existing voivodas by people from the victorious coalition? [Kwasniewski] Anyone who charges me with calling for purges will be at serious odds with the truth. I said that a new political situation arose as a result of the election. I may even apologize that the old government lost the election, but that is what happened. Today there are people who say: "We are not interested in politics, but we are at your disposal." If they are competent administrators, they will retain their posts. And there are also others who say: "We do not see a place for us here anymore; our mission is over." That was precisely what took place in Pila, Zielona Gora, and Wloclawek. There are now vacancies there. How do you imagine we should go about finding new candidates to these posts? Pick them off the street? Or from the opposition's ranks? We have adopted the principle that the group that won the election in a given voivodship can assume initiative in this matter. Because that means that that group has at its disposal the most numerous personnel reserves to be recruited from among its broad base of supporters. However, candidates must still obtain approval from the voivodship's self-government assembly. And the candidates from Pila, Zielona Gora, and Olsztyn did obtain such approval. These people are by no means party apparatchiks: They are all competent experts. [Doering] The SdRP December statement contained a mention of a proposed change in the election law, designed to improve representation at parish level. Does this suggest that you agree with Minister Strak when he claims that councils are not representative? [Kwasniewski] The May 1990 elections were won by citizens' committees. But where are citizens' committees today? We have also introduced candidates from a variety of electoral lists into the councils. [Doering] That problem could be resolved in the elections themselves rather than through changes in the electoral law. [Kwasniewski] We are considering a proposal to choose parish elders and town and city mayors in universal suffrage, although opinions on that solution are rather divided. [Doering] What would be the SdRP's interest in such a move? [Kwasniewski] Precisely. I am not altogether sure whether it would be in our interest. That is why we are still hesitating. Local self-government elections do not attract much popular attention, so it could be that such direct choice would enhance their attractiveness and increase the chance of stimulating local communities to greater activity. [Doering] In other words, it would pull those who are as yet undecided toward you? [Kwasniewski] I do not see it in terms of political interest. Let me risk a prediction: The approaching elections will end in a big compromise, and no one will be able to say that they have won an unqualified victory in it.
