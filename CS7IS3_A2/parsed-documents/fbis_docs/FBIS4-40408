"Our principal position is well known and remains the same. Russia stands for a stronger non-proliferation regime and for transparent nuclear programs so that there be no fear of possible attempts to create nuclear weapons," Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Mikhail Demurin said at a briefing in Moscow today. He said it was especially important that a state participating in the non-proliferation treaty and in an agreement with the IAEA fulfill its obligations. "If this was not done or is not done, the world community has the right to an adequate response," Demurin said.
