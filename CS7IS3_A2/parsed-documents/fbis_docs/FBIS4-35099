Meanwhile, teachers union leaders have expressed hope the new appointment will foster a better understanding between teachers and the Education Ministry. Efrain de Leon, of the Association of Independent Teachers, has commented on the issue: [Begin de Leon recording] He represents the executive branch; therefore, he represents a political party and will function with political guidelines. We also know that working against him is his term of almost two months. We hope he will try during this period to correct the many mistakes Alarcon has made and reach an agreement, for the first time during this period of democracy, between the Education Ministry and the teachers unions.
