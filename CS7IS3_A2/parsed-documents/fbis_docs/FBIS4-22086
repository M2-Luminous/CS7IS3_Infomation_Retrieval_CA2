Tal'at Yasin Hammam, the head of the al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah's armed wing, and five other militants were killed in a dawn clash with police at Hammam's apartment in northeast Cairo, the spokesman told AFP. A military court in December 1992 sentenced Hammam, who has been wanted since 1989, and six others to death in their absence for belonging to a terrorist group bent on overthrowing Egypt's secular government. All seven were reported to be veterans of the war in Afghanistan. The raid came two weeks after the police chief heading the battle against the militants, General Ra'uf Khayrat, was murdered in Cairo. Al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah said it carried out the attack. In Asyut police killed four militants suspected of involvement in last Wednesday's killing of the head of security forces in the southern city, which is a militant stronghold. They were all students at Asyut University.
