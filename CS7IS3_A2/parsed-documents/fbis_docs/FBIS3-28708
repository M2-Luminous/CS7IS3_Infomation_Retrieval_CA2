Akitane Kiuchi, who has served as ambassador to Malaysia, Thailand and France, is visiting Washington as a special envoy of Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, they said. Kiuchi conveyed to Clinton a message from Hosokawa pledging he will try to solve issues with sincerity, the sources said. Clinton was quoted as saying it is time for the two sides to upgrade negotiations to the cabinet-minister level. Hosokawa told reporters in Tokyo on Wednesday that the trade negotiations have been deadlocked over U.S. demands for "objective criteria" for measuring the degree of foreign access to the Japanese market. Hosokawa is due to leave Tokyo for Washington on Thursday to hold talks with Clinton on Friday.
