Ulucevik arrived in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC] this afternoon to assess the latest developments on the Cyprus issue. He was received by President Rauf Denktas. In a statement prior to the meeting held at the presidency, Ulucevik said that it is Turkey's national goal to secure the lasting conditions imperative for the tranquil, secure and prosperous existence of the Turkish Cypriot community. He noted that Turkey shares the view expressed by the UN secretary general on November, 1992, that there is a profound confidence crisis between the two sides on the island. Ulucevik recalled that activities aimed at securing an atmosphere of trust between the two sides have been initiated as of May, 1993. He pointed out that the Turkish Cypriot side accepted the principles stated in the UN secretary general's report dated 1 July, 1993, which included the issues of Maras [Varosha] and the Lefkosa [Nicosia] International Airport in the belief that the package was going to be implemented in full. Ulucevik added that as of 9 March, Denktas noted that the package was being distorted and that Turkey assessed the package and concurred with Denktas' observation. He further recalled the Turkish Foreign Ministry announcement concurring with the TRNC observation, adding that the aim of his visit to rectify the damage caused to the package and restore its contents to its original form. In reply to a question, Ulucevik said that the fact that he was visiting the island at the same time as Robert Lamb, U.S. State Department's special Cyprus coordinator, was a coincidence. Noting that Lamb asked to meet him, Ulucevik added that the TRNC is conducting the negotiating process and that Turkey is only trying to help advance the talks. He added that within this framework it is normal for him to meet with Lamb. In reply to another question, Ulucevik said that had the UN Security Council not wished to rectify the damage caused to the package, the issue would have been closed long ago. He concluded by saying that Turkey favors securing an atmosphere of trust between the two sides based on the CBM's agreed upon by both sides.
