I am going to maintain the ties President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo restored, because in this era of pluralism that Latin America -- and we hope Colombia as well -- is living there can be no country with which we do not have relations, Samper said during an exclusive interview with PRENSA LATINA. "My irrevocable decision," Samper added, "is not just to maintain open relations with the island but also not to accept any measure that entails increasing the difficulties the Cuban people are already experiencing." I am totally opposed to the (U.S.) blockade and any measure that worsens the living conditions in that country, Samper, the Liberal presidential candidate in the runoff elections to be held on 19 June, stated. Samper's sole opponent this time is Conservative Andres Pastrana. The two ran in the first round on 22 May in a field with 16 other candidates, but neither one was able to garner 51 percent of the votes, as the Constitution establishes. Samper also said that he will try to bring about a change in the agenda of the Nonaligned Movement to bring it in step with the times. As for his national platform, Samper said the only way to legitimize the economic opening process in Latin America is through social investment. I do not see, he stressed, any other way that it may trickle down and make everybody feel part of the economy. The Liberal leader ran for president in 1990, but current President Gaviria won the primaries. On the eve of those elections, he was the victim of an attack in which he was shot 11 times. Four of those bullets are still lodged in his body. Colombian news media have reiterated that his Conservative adversary in the current elections is using or repeating the programmatic budgets Samper had outlined earlier. "He (Pastrana) has a sort of guilt complex over everything he has copied this past year, but it is sufficient to see what his platform is: pretty reactionary, neoliberal, and prehistoric," he commented. Samper, a lawyer and economist, met with PRENSA LATINA envoys in his main office shortly before leaving for the town of Toribio, some 60 km south of Bogota, the site of a strong earthquake registered on Monday where approximately 150 persons lost their lives, although the tragedy may leave an even higher toll.
