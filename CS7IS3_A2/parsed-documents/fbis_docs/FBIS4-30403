The recent survey results were tallied and announced 19 June. The disapproval rate for the cabinet grew 7.6 points to 35.2 percent over the same period. Meanwhile, those who replied "I have no answer" decreased 7.4 percent. This means that this portion of respondents [who said they had no answer last month] changed their position to that of disapproving the cabinet. As for popularity for political parties, the poll showed the support rate for the Japan New Party fell to 1.5 percent this month. The survey was conducted 10 June -- when just one month had passed since the Hata Cabinet started -- to 13 June with 2,000 men and women across the country through individual interviews -- with 73.1 percent of them responding. Immediately after the cabinet started in May, the prime minister announced measures to appear as the "commoners' prime minister"; for instance, freezing public utility charges and installing fax machines [in the prime minister's office] so that citizens can make proposals to the prime minister directly. He has also been on stumping tours, making speeches on the streets. However, the approval rate for his cabinet has not improved. The people's uneasiness about a minority government has apparently led to an increase in the disapproval rate. As reasons for approving the cabinet, the largest proportion of the respondents, as in May, cited "because there are no other appropriate people." This passive reply was offered by 13.2 percent of the respondents (as compared with 14.1 percent in May). This was followed by 11.8 percent (9.5 percent in May) who said "because he gives a good impression", and 11.1 percent (11.1 percent in May) who said "because we trust the prime minister." As reasons for disapproving the cabinet, the largest proportion, or 18.7 percent (16.5 percent in May), said "because I cannot have expectations for it," 8.8 percent (5.0 percent in May) said "because it lacks leadership," and 7.4 percent (3.8 percent in May) said "because its policies are wrong." In popularity of political parties, the Liberal Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party of Japan gained somewhat, with the former receiving an approval rate of 22.6 percent (21.3 percent in May) and the latter 7.2 percent (6.8 percent in May). The approval rate for Shinseito [Renewal Party] dropped to 3.4 percent (4.6 percent in June). Approval rates for other parties were 3.3 percent (2.5 percent in June) for Komeito, 1.5 percent (2.1 percent) for the Japan New Party, 1.5 percent (1.4 percent) for Shinto Sakigake [New Harbinger], 1.4 percent (1.4 percent) for the Democratic Socialist Party, and 1.2 percent (1.4 percent) for the Japan Communist Party.
