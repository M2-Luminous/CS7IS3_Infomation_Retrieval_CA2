"This contradictions concern the inflation's reference-points, the key aspect of the 1994 economic policy; the thing is that they are not of a quantitative but of a qualitative nature," he underlined during his conversation with journalists on Friday. According to Gaydar, the presidential address "lays hope at least for a relative opportunity to reach monetary stability this year, it gives hope to stabilize volumes of production and create premises for its further growth;" at the same time the analysis of the budget submitted by the government "leaves no hopes for this." Speaking about prospects of the budget's consideration in the State Duma, Gaydar said that "he is absolutely convinced that the branch ministers will themselves, or via their representatives in parliamentary committees, urge to increase appropriations for all possible articles." "I am afraid that this will result in a proposal to increase the budget deficit to 20-30 Tn rubles," he said. As far as Russia's Choice faction is concerned, it will not back the budget during its discussion in the Duma if "serious corrections in the structure and volume of expenditures" primarily aimed at "lowering of the general level of state pressure on the budget" are not introduced into it," said Gaydar. Responding to Interfax, Gaydar said that even after the government's program is made public it will be hard for him to make any political prognosis for 1994. "A political prognosis, as well as an economic one, does not depend upon public speeches but upon concrete economic decision. Decisions adopted by the government even during the last few days surprisingly contradict to each other," said Gaydar.
