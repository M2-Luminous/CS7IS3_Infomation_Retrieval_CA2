Cetin told the TURKISH DAILY NEWS that the Syrian Foreign Minister also indicated that Damascus was in touch with Lebanon on this issue. "Minister al-Shar' unequivocally said that they are not supporting the PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party)," Cetin said. "He added that they would never allow their territories to be used by the separatists." The Turkish Foreign Minister said his Syrian counterpart had even proposed to increase cooperation between the security organizations of both countries and organize more frequent meetings. Developments in neighboring Iraq, Kurdish activities and regional waters were the highlights of a tripartite summit held in Istanbul on Saturday between the foreign ministers of Turkey, Syria and Iran. The meeting resulted in a declaration of support for the continuation of Iraqi sovereignty, a mutual condemnation of terrorism, and a Turkish rejection of Syrian efforts for a water-use agreement for the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. Syria said a formal agreement on the rivers, which al-Shar' described as "international waters," was needed to avoid escalating the dispute. "But I explained how sensitive Turkish public opinion was with regard to terrorist activities, and the impressions that are imbedded in Turkish public opinion about Syria in this context," Cetin said. In his talks with al-Shar', the Turkish Foreign Minister suggested that doing away with this impression was one of the conditions for a better dialogue between the two countries, including on the subject of "regional waters." Cetin and al-Shar' met for talks on Friday when the Syrian foreign minister arrived in Turkey. They also met immediately after Saturday's three-way talks. The assurances al-Shar' gave Cetin in bilateral talks were in line with remarks he made during a press conference on Saturday. He said Syria did not support "any acts which violated the sovereignty of Turkey," and strongly denied allegations that Damascus was supporting PKK terrorism. Diplomatic sources noted that al-Shar' appeared to be sincere in his remarks related to Ocalan, the PKK and terrorism, and that Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati and his delegation had also approached Turkey in friendly fashion. Cetin said he had observed "an atmosphere of understanding" on the Iranian side and repeated that Turkey would cooperate to "heal the wounds" that had arisen from the adverse effects of a recent Turkish air operation in northern Iraq during which nine Iranians were killed. The tripartite summit and the change in atmosphere observed in Istanbul, said one official, who asked not to be identified, indicated a change in attitude by both countries, and implied that there could be better cooperation between the three capitals in the future on the subject of combating the PKK. Turkish officials believe al-Shar's "guarantee" to Ankara is highly significant, but added that this indicates that a change in tactics and alliances by the PKK should also be expected. Equally important is the noteworthy attitude of Iran over the January 28 air raid by Turkey on a major PKK training base in northern Iraq, they say. Although nine Iranians were killed and a further 19 were wounded in the air raids -- reportedly due to shrapnel from a bomb which exploded in mid-air -- the official Iranian reaction was next to nothing. Turkey now expects both countries to give more concrete assurances to Ankara, and wants promises made concerning the fight against terrorism to be kept.
