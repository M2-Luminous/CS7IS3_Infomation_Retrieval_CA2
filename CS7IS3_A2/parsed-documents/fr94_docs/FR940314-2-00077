FR940314-2-00077 FR940314-2-00045 In accordance with 45 CFR 400.146, if a State's cash assistance dependency rate for refugees (as defined in section 400.146(b)) is 55% or more, funds awarded under this notice (with the exception of the political prisoner set-aside) are subject to a requirement that at least 85% of the State's award be used for employability services as set forth in section 400.154. ORR expects these funds to be used for services which directly enhance refugee employment potential, have specific employment objectives, and are designed to enable refugees to obtain jobs in less than one year as part of a plan to achieve self-sufficiency. This reflects the Congressional objective that ``employable refugees should be placed on jobs as soon as possible after their arrival in the United States'' and that social service funds be focused on ``employment-related services, English-as-a-second-language training (in non-work hours where possible), and case-management service'' (INA, section 412(a)(1)(B)). If refugee social service funds are used for the provision of English language training, such training should be provided concurrently, rather than sequentially, with employment or with other employment-related services, to the maximum extent possible. ORR also encourages the continued provision of services after a refugee has entered a job to help the refugee retain employment or move to a better job. Since current welfare dependency data are not available, those States that historically have had dependency rates at 55% and above are invited to submit a request for a waiver of the 85% requirement if they can provide reliable documentation that demonstrates a lower dependency rate. ORR will consider granting a waiver of the 85% provision if a State meets one of the following conditions: 1. The State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Director of ORR that the dependency rate of refugees who have been in the U.S. 24 months or less is below 55% in the State. 2. The State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Director that (a) less than 85% of the State's social service allocation is sufficient to meet all employment-related needs of the State's refugees and (b) there are non-employment-related service needs which are so extreme as to justify an allowance above the basic 15%. Or 3. In accordance with section 412(c)(1)(C) of the INA, the State submits to the Director a plan (established by or in consultation with local governments) which the Director determines provides for the maximum appropriate provision of employment-related services for, and the maximum placement of, employable refugees consistent with performance standards established under section 106 of the Job Training Partnership Act. Refugee social services should be provided in a manner that is culturally and linguistically compatible with a refugee's language and cultural background. In light of the increasingly diverse population of refugees who are resettling in this country, refugee service agencies will need to develop practical ways of providing culturally and linguistically appropriate services to a changing ethnic population. To the maximum extent possible, particularly during a refugee's initial years of resettlement, refugee social services should be provided through a refugee-specific system rather than through a system in which refugees are only one of many client groups being served. When planning State refugee services, States are strongly encouraged to take into account the reception and placement (R & P) services provided by local resettlement agencies in order to utilize these resources in the overall program design and to ensure the provision of seamless services to refugees.
