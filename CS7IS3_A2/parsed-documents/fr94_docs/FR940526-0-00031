FR940526-0-00031 FR940526-0-00013 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;69&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8919; AD 94&hyph;11&hyph;03] Airworthiness Directives; Raytheon Corporate Jets Model DH/BH/HS/BAe 125 and Hawker 800 and 1000 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Raytheon Corporate Jets Model DH/BH/HS BAe 125 and Hawker 800 and 1000 series airplanes. This action requires a visual inspection to determine whether adequate clearance exists between the fan venturi motor casing and the adjacent equipment, and adjustments, if necessary; and a visual inspection to detect signs of overheating, degradation of insulating materials, and ingestion of debris into the motor, and replacement of discrepant parts with serviceable parts. This amendment is prompted by reports of smoke emanating from the lavatory due to overheating of the fan venturi motor. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent smoke or fire in the cabin while the airplane is in flight. DATES: Effective June 10, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of June 10, 1994. Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before July 25, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;69&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Raytheon Corporate Jets, Inc., 3 Bishops Square, St. Albans Road West, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, AL109NE, United Kingdom. This information may be examined at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William Schroeder, Aerospace Engineer, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2148; fax (206) 227&hyph;1320. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Raytheon Corporate Jets Model DH/BH/HS/BAe 125 and Hawker 800 and 1000 series airplanes. The CAA advises it has received reports of smoke emanating from the lavatory in the rear of the cabin while several airplanes were being prepared for departure. Investigation revealed that the venturi fan motor overheated due to insufficient clearance between the motor and the adjacent sound insulation and wiring. This condition, if not corrected, could result in smoke or fire in the cabin while the airplane is in flight. Raytheon Corporate Jets, Inc., has issued Alert Service Bulletin SB 21&hyph;A150, dated February 22, 1994, that describes procedures for a one-time visual inspection to determine whether adequate clearance exists between the fan venturi motor casing and the adjacent equipment (including insulating materials, ducting, and wire looms) and adjustment of the insulating materials, ducting, and/or looms, if necessary. This alert service bulletin also describes procedures for a one-time visual inspection to detect signs of overheating, degradation of insulating materials, and ingestion of debris into the motor, and replacement of discrepant parts with serviceable parts. The CAA classified this alert service bulletin as mandatory and issued a British airworthiness directive in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom. These airplane models are manufactured in the United Kingdom and are type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of ยง21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent smoke or fire in the cabin while the airplane is in flight. This AD requires a one-time visual inspection to determine whether adequate clearance exists between the fan venturi motor casing and the adjacent equipment (including insulating materials, ducting, and wire looms) and adjustment of the insulating materials, ducting, and/or looms, if necessary. This AD also requires a one-time visual inspection to detect signs of overheating, degradation of insulating materials, and ingestion of debris into the motor, and replacement of discrepant parts with serviceable parts. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously. Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days.
