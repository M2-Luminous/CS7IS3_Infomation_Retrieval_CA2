SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect the approval of a new animal drug application (NADA) filed by Merck Research Laboratories, Division of Merck & Co., Inc. The NADA provides for the oral use of ENACARD TM (enalapril maleate) tablets for the treatment of heart failure in dogs. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 14, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Marcia K. Larkins, Center for Veterinary Medicine (HFV&hyph;112), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, 301&hyph;594&hyph;0614. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Merck Research Laboratories, Division of Merck & Co., Inc., P.O. Box 2000, Rahway, NJ 07065, filed NADA 141&hyph;015 which provides for the use of ENACARD TM containing 1, 2.5, 5, 10, or 20 milligrams (mg) of enalapril maleate per (/) tablet. ENACARD TM tablets are administered to dogs once daily at a dosage of 0.5 mg/kilogram (kg) or twice daily at 0.5 mg/kg for a total daily dose of 1.0 mg/kg for the treatment of mild, moderate, and severe (modified New York Heart Association Class II, III, IV) heart failure in dogs. The NADA is approved as of February 24, 1994, and the regulations are amended in part 558 (21 CFR part 558) by adding new §520.804 to reflect the approval. The basis of approval is discussed in the freedom of information summary. In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and §514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21 CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), a summary of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval of this application may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Section 512(c)(2)(F)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act provides a 5-year period of exclusivity to this original NADA beginning February 24, 1994, because no active ingredient (including any ester or salt of the active ingredient) has been approved in any other application under section 512(b)(1) of the act. The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 520 Animal drugs. Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs and redelegated to the Center for Veterinary Medicine, 21 CFR part 520 is amended as follows: PART 520_ORAL DOSAGE FORM NEW ANIMAL DRUGS 1. The authority citation for 21 CFR part 520 continues to read as follows: Authority: Sec. 512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b). 2.
