It is necessary to make "across-the-board advances" [zheng ti tui jin 2419 7555 2236 6651] in the three aspects of fostering the market entities, perfecting the market system, and improving the regulatory and control system, and to make breakthroughs in the two key points of laying the microeconomic foundation and building the macroeconomic structure for the new market economy. The reform measures that have been adopted or will be put into practice this year will extensively touch upon many difficult points in people's concepts and ideas, institutional innovations, the adjustment of interests, and concrete operation at a profound level; so this will be a tough battle. At present, we are facing the most favorable opportunity for launching the tough battle in our reform. We should be courageous and determined enough to overcome all the difficulties in the structural reform; otherwise, we may lose the rare historical opportunity and may fail to ensure the sustained, rapid, and healthy [chixu, kuaisu, jiankang] development of the national economy and to achieve the second-step strategic objective of our national economic and social development; moreover, our economy may even be bogged down in a predicament with the coexistence of high inflation and low-speed economic fluctuation over a fairly long time. We should profoundly understand and consciously grasp the new characteristics of this year's tough battle in the reform. In the objects of the reform, as the reform will change the current dual-track system into the single-track system of the market economy, the pattern of the vested interests formed under the dual-track system will be profoundly shaken. Thus, we need comrades who take an active part in the reform to be brave enough to carry out self-revolution. In the structure of the reform, the spontaneous advances from bottom to top and the devolution of power from top to bottom will be changed from unified coordination and organization from top to bottom. This will be a major change, which requires new adaptability. In the process of the reform, "single-item advances" and batch operation will be replaced with "across-the-board advances" and "making breakthroughs in key points." This will make it more necessary to obey the guidance of the central authorities, to safeguard the authority of the central leadership, and to establish an overall point of view. In the guidance to the reform, as reform will mainly be regularized and guaranteed by the legal system rather than being promoted by various policies, we are required to continuously enhance the sense of law and to learn how to apply legal means to guide the reform and manage the economy. To successfully fight a tough battle in this year's reform, we must be united as one from top to bottom and share weal and woe, and this is the decisive factor. First, we should be really of one heart and one mind from top to bottom in the aspect of approaching and assessing the situation. We must not think that "reform is a matter for the central authorities, and development is my own business" and must not thus become indifferent to reform. Second, we should be really of one heart and one mind in making efforts to create a more benign and more favorable economic environment for the reform, and should thus be determined to resolutely control the level of investment in fixed assets, to maintain a basic balance among the gross economic quantities, and effectively to curb inflation. Third, we should be really of one heart and one mind in using both hands to grasp the work; that is, while carrying out economic reform and economic development, we should also safeguard social and political stability and strengthen socialist spiritual civilization. Leaders at all levels should be good at finding out and stabilizing the people's feelings and resolving contradictions in good time so that a peaceful and stable situation as well as a benign public conduct and opinion environment can be maintained. We should really ensure the supply of foodstuffs and other daily necessities for the masses, and should do solid things closely linked with their daily lives. We must not disregard the people's livelihood while only being keen to raise the rate of economic growth. [end abstract] What will this year be? The leading comrades of the party Central Committee and the State Council have repeatedly stressed that this year will be a crucial year for implementing the "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and for launching a tough battle in the in-depth reform across the board for the establishment of the new socialist market economic system. On 1 January, Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out in his speech at the new year tea party held by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "The year 1994 will be an extremely important year for our country's reform, opening up, and modernization." "In the new year, the key part of our in-depth reform is to carefully and properly organize the adoption and implementation of a series of major reform measures for the establishment of the socialist market economic system." On 28 January, in his speech to the national propaganda and ideological work conference, Comrade Zhu Rongji stressed: "The tasks of reform and development in 1994 will all be arduous, and this is what the people are concerned about and what the world is watching. Whether we can win in this tough battle in the course of reform will be a stern test for us." Later, in his speech at the Spring Festival gala, Comrade Li Peng summarized this year's tough reform battle into three main points: "First, properly organize the implementation of the major reform measures in the fields of the financial and taxation system, the banking system, and the investment system, and establish and perfect the macroeconomic control system. Second, continue to transform the management and operation mechanisms in the state-owned enterprises, and explore an effective way to establish a modern enterprise system suited to the requirements of the socialist market economy. Third, properly advance the price reform and develop and improve the market system on the basis of giving full consideration to the endurance capability of all quarters concerned." All these important speeches conveyed two important messages to us: First, the economic structural reform in our country has entered a new stage of being advanced comprehensively and in a well-coordinated manner in depth across the board. This year will be a year in which most reform measures will be adopted more intensively than in the past more than 10 years since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, and the size, scope, difficulty, and depth of the reform will all be unprecedented. Second, this year's in-depth reform will "be advanced across the board" in the three aspects of fostering the market entities, perfecting the market system, and improving the regulatory and control system. At the same time, breakthroughs will be made in the two key points of laying the microeconomic foundation and building the macroeconomic structure for the new market economy. These reform measures will basically take shape within this year, and will become well-known to the general public next year. In 1996, China will begin to move onto the path of the socialist market economy. With the coming of the new year, the prelude to the tough reform battle was started, and the central authorities announced a series of important reform programs in the field of macroeconomic control and in other fields. The pilot schemes for the establishment of the modern enterprise system, which is the main point of the microeconomic reform, will soon be started in about 100 enterprises selected by the State Council. We should be fully aware of the necessity, arduousness, and complicated nature of this year's tough reform battle, and should be of one heart and one mind in ensuring the across-the-board implementation of all the major reform measures adopted by the central authorities according to the "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. Through our painstaking efforts to organize and guide the operation in various fields, we shall guarantee the smooth implementation of the reform measures, win a victory in the tough reform battle, and further develop the current good situation. I Why do we call the implementation of the major measures for the in-depth reform this year a tough reform battle [gaige gongjian zhan 2395 7245 2396 1017 2069]? This mainly refers to the depth and difficulty of the reform. On the whole, some of the major reform programs to be put into practice this year will extensively touch many deep-level ideas and concepts, as we have often mentioned, as well as some difficult points in the adjustment of interests and concrete operation. For example, the reform program for establishing the modern enterprise system will profoundly touch the issue of defining the property rights in the public economy and the form of the public economy. Being different from the policy adjustments in the eighties in the enterprise reforms, which were mainly devolution of power that enabled the enterprises to retain more profits in their hands, the current in-depth reform will further create a brand-new enterprise system. As another example, in the reform program for the establishment of the market for production factors, the "labor force market" will touch such a deep-level issue as the status of workers in an enterprise under the socialist condition. As for the concept of a "capital market," this is also a major breakthrough from the traditional conception and is a new development of socialist economic theory. As one more example, the reform program for various macroeconomic control mechanisms, especially the tax-sharing system, requires the delimitation of the scope of macroeconomic regulation and control and is related to the scientific demarcation between the economic management jurisdictions of the central and local governments. In economic management, the authority of the central government must be strengthened, and the power of macroeconomic control in various fields must be concentrated in the hands of the central government. At the same time, it is also necessary to bring the initiative of the central and local authorities into play. This is an issue that has not been properly resolved since the foundation of the PRC and has not been thoroughly resolved although efforts were made to resolve it since the beginning of the reform. Therefore, this will also be a difficult point in the tough reform battle. It is also rather difficult to break the departmental and regional monopolies in some economic sectors and to adjust the existing interest patterns. Because the emancipation of people's minds, the renewal of concepts, the innovation of systems, and the adjustment of interests will be carried out at a deeper level and will encounter greater difficulties, we call this year's in-depth reform program a tough reform battle, which means we will have to overcome many difficulties. Why are so many tasks of tackling difficult problems scheduled for this year in a concentrated manner, since tackling difficult problems in reform is so arduous and involves certain risks? Here is the question of the judgment and choice of timing concerning whether or not the tasks of tackling difficult problems in reform, which we have been discussing undertaking for so many years, but for which conditions have not been available, can be postponed. As far as the judgment of timing is concerned, we must tackle difficult problems in reform by resolving contradictions at a deeper level despite various kinds of existing problems in the macroeconomy of our country at present. Also, it is the most opportune time at present for us to tackle difficult problems in reform. First, the 14th CPC National Congress set, in accordance with the spirit of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's remarks made during his trip to the south, the goal of reform of establishing the socialist market economy. This enabled us at one go to get rid of the perplexity caused by concepts concerning whether the market economy is "socialist" or "capitalist." We can now courageously promote various kinds of market-oriented reforms in the same direction at a deep level without any ideological misgivings or obstacles, and we are duty-bound not to turn back. Second, in the course of reform in the past 10 years and more, we have overcome one difficulty after another, have accumulated valuable experience, and have increased our ability to deal with complicated situations. Moreover, all the plans for tackling difficult problems in reform put forward this time have been worked out under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, following meticulous and careful investigation and study over a long period, pooling the wisdom of the people of the whole country, and using as reference the successful experience of the developed countries. They conform with the general laws of the market economy, adhere to the principle of proceeding from the actual national conditions of China, and give as much consideration as possible to the interests of various quarters. Therefore, a consensus on tackling difficult problems in reform can be reached and resistance from various quarters can be reduced. In addition, what is more important is that since the publication of the important remarks made by Comrade Deng Xiaoping during his inspection tour of the south in 1992, a new situation has been opened up in work of all aspects in our country, the national economy is developing vigorously, market supply is abundant, the people's living standard has been further improved, and some problems cropping up in the course of advance have been, or are being, effectively solved. All this has created favorable political conditions and a social environment for comprehensively promoting the tackling of difficult problems in reform. If we miss this rare historical opportunity and do not have the courage and determination to overcome various difficulties in the structural reform, or cannot properly solve various problems cropping up in development, we cannot maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy development [chixu kuaisu jiankang fazhan] of the national economy, nor can we realize the second-step strategic objective for the national economy and social development. We may even land in a predicament of high inflation and low-speed economic fluctuation over a considerably long period in the future. Regarding the choice of timing for reform, could the promulgation of various reformative measures promulgated this year have been further postponed as some comrades suggested? Perhaps these comrades are not aware that technically speaking, financial and taxation reforms and foreign exchange reforms have to start in a rigid and unified calendar year and accounting year. A delay of 10 days or half a month will actually mean a delay of another year. Besides, we should also be aware that at present, the losses in finance and taxes of the central authorities are very serious. The financial revenue of the central authorities accounts for a decreasing percentage of the financial revenue of the country, and the deficits are increasing. If the reform of the financial and taxation structure is not carried out right away, things will get harder and harder. Again, imports are increasing, exports are decreasing, the trade deficit is expanding, the state's foreign exchange income is decreasing, and the outflow of capital is also increasing. If the reform of the foreign exchange structure is not carried out right away, things will be difficult to cope with. Moreover, the long-standing problem of "being overanxious to make investment" of the traditional planned economy structure, the competition in speed, the rapid expansion in scale, and the financial expansion have become the cause of the macroeconomy being out of control. If reform in the investment structure and the financial structure is not carried out right away, serious inflation will lead to serious political problems. Therefore, if, following the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, we do not make a prompt decision, do not quickly make use of the favorable opportunity, or do not take relatively big steps in deepening reform, our political losses will be very great. II What, then, are the new characteristics of the moves to tackle difficult problems in reform this year as compared with various reforms carried out since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee? We think that deepening our understanding of, and consciously grasping, these new characteristics are of the utmost importance to doing a good job in tackling difficult problems. First, as viewed from the targets of reform, there is a transitional period of the "coexistence of the two tracks" in the change from the socialist planned economy to the socialist market economy. This is unavoidable in the course of reform in our country and practice has proved that this period is conducive to reducing shocks and to avoiding the common setback of landing reform itself in a predicament resulting from the accumulation of various kinds of problems caused by radical reform. The structure in which the two tracks coexist has many negative effects which brook no negligence. It induces the marriage of administrative power with activities of the commodity economy, leading to chaos in functions, misplacement of roles, lax binding force, and uncontrollable behavior of various interest entities, and to numerous loopholes and a lack of rules in management. In the course of tackling difficult problems in reform, to gradually change the dual-track structure into the single-track structure of the market economy will inevitably change the pattern of set interests formed in the structure in which the two tracks coexist. This pattern of interests is also linked with some reformative measures of the eighties. Change in the pattern will cause conflicts of interests and will also cause perplexity in concepts and resistance in ideology. Therefore, even comrades who were active in the previous stage of reform also have to further enhance their consciousness of deepening reform, be courageous to make self-revolution, and actively promote on their own initiative the remolding of the economic structure and the functions of their respective departments. Otherwise, it is possible that they will become "half-way reformers" and lag behind the times. Second, as viewed from the methods of reform, the reform of the eighties mainly developed spontaneously from bottom to top, and power and interests were delegated from top to bottom. In that stage, the main propelling force attacking the old structure came from the various localities and the grass-roots level. Various localities, various departments, and various units could, according to their own will, have "optional exercises" in reform and "grope for stepping stones to cross the river," giving play to their own ability. Leading departments mainly delegated power and interests to lower levels. As a result, localities and units which energetically carried out reform were often the first to get the benefit, while leading departments appeared to be "entrenching themselves at every step and retreating in defeat again and again." Things are different in the stage of tackling difficult problems in reform. Since many aspects of work have to be done in the establishment of the new structure and close coordination among them is needed, it is necessary for certain authoritative organs to formulate basic rules for coordination. At the same time, since tackling difficult problems in reform will unavoidably change the pattern of set interests, reform does not necessarily bring immediate interests to each unit or individual to the satisfaction of all. This will inevitably encounter various kinds of difficulty and resistance. It is necessary to organize people to make efforts to remove obstacles before reformative measures can be implemented. Also, in tackling difficult problems in reform, the definition of property rights, the fixing of methods for the management of assets, and the establishment of the new finance and taxation structure, the monetary structure, the foreign trade structure, and the investment structure can never be realized spontaneously from bottom to top. The entire reform process must be coordinated in a unified manner, organized, and carried out from top to bottom by firm and powerful high-level authoritative state organs. If we do not act in this way, but let things drift, each doing what he thinks is right, serious imbalance will occur, the cost of reform will undoubtedly increase, the formation of a unified domestic market will be delayed, and the rapid growth of the entire national economy will be hindered. Third, as far as the reform process is concerned, in the eighties, most of the reforms proceeded separately. Since people did not change their concepts all at the same time and had different degrees of feeling toward the old system, some localities were very enthusiastic for reform, and they took the initiative in implementing reform, even "at their own expense"; but some localities acted slowly without much enthusiasm. For example, in the early days of rural reform, the contract responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration linked to output was implemented and the people's commune system was abolished. At first, only one out of three provinces fulfilled the tasks; in the second year, the number increased to two-thirds; and it was only in the third year that almost all provinces followed suit. At that time, the principle of the central authorities was that "people are allowed to act as bystanders," there would "not be any coercion or campaign," "people could do it as long as they were willing," and they could "do it as much as they liked," while those who were still not convinced and who failed to catch up with others could wait. On the other hand, at a stage in which reform is implemented at full speed, we must achieve overall progress, take joint action, and make breakthroughs in key areas. It is necessary to coordinate the time of introducing reform measures which have a bearing on the overall situation of macroeconomic regulation and to integrate every action and step. For example, in implementing the taxation reform and unifying exchange rates, it is as if athletes must take heed of the sound of the judge's starting gun before they can run at full speed. It is absolutely out of the question for one to implement reform while another does not follow suit. Similarly, people cannot do it when they are ready but stop when they are no longer willing to do so. There is even less room for any wait-and-see attitude. Hence, at the stage of implementing reform at full speed, we must establish a new system, be subordinate to the guidance of the central authorities, maintain the authority of the party Central Committee and of the State Council, bear the overall situation in mind, reach a common understanding, and act in unison. Fourth, as far as reform guidance is concerned, in the eighties, the main form of reform guidance was delivered through policy implementation. For example, in implementing rural reform, the central authorities issued a No. 1 document every year, and the peasants, who spoke of "policies making people rich" and "policies taking the reign," were always concerned about "whether there were policy changes," whereas cadres at the grass-roots level were quite concerned about the "money content of policies" and wished to constantly receive "preferential policies" from decisionmaking bodies. But at the stage in which reform is implemented at full speed, the form of reform guidance has already shifted, and will be more frequently shifted, from policy implementation to implementation of laws. This is because a socialist economy is virtually a kind of legal economy. To establish and perfect the socialist market economic system, it is necessary to have a complete legal system to standardize and protect it, and, as far as reform guidance is concerned, reform policy decisions are required to closely link up with legislative policy decisions so as to use laws to guide and give an impetus to reform as well as ensure its smooth implementation. For example, when the taxation reform program was introduced on 1 January 1994, the "PRC Personal Income Tax Law," which was amended by the National People's Congress," and regulations promulgated by the State Council for interim implementation, including those on value-added tax, consumption tax, sales tax, and enterprise gains tax, were simultaneously introduced (that is, "one law and six regulations"). Before the full implementation of the reform of establishing an enterprise mechanism for a modern enterprise system, the state has already promulgated in advance the "Company Law," the "Stock Law," and so on. In order to adjust to the law-propelled form of reform guidance at the stage in which reform is implemented at full speed, we must, on the one hand, urge legislative organs to pay close attention to drawing up laws on standardizing the main body of the market, maintaining the market order, enhancing macroscopic regulation, perfecting social security, opening up wider to the outside world, and so on, and we must revise and annul laws and regulations inconsistent with the establishment of the new system in a timely manner. On the other hand, we must make efforts to constantly improve the legal awareness and concepts of the whole society and to urge cadres at all levels to learn how to apply legal means to guiding reform and managing the economy. III All of us will certainly reach a common understanding after clearly identifying the difficulties, necessity, and characteristics of the full implementation of reform this year. That is, to achieve success in reform this year, the key lies in making concerted efforts and helping each other. "Tai Shan will move and the battle will be easy if people are of one mind." The party Central Committee and the State Council have repeatedly stressed that the "leadership and the rank and file should be of one mind in order to score a victory" in reform. As far as the current situation is concerned, the unity between the "leadership and the rank and file" should be embodied in the following three aspects: First, we must make really concerted efforts to get a clear understanding of the overall situation and to be subordinate to and serve it. The party Central Committee has repeatedly stressed that the overall situation of party work this year is to seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, promote development, and maintain stability [zhuazhu jiyu, shenhua gaige, kuoda kaifang, cujin fazhan, baochi wending]. The essence of the overall situation is precisely to uphold the principle of "using reform to promote development" and to "treat reform as the theme." Leading cadres at all levels must have a sense of urgency, of responsibility, of crisis, and of worry when seizing the opportunity to deepen reform and take the initiative to devote more energies to reform, and must center on the major orientation and train of thought set by the central authorities with rapt attention. Never can we consider that "reform is a matter for the central authorities, whereas development is our own business" and be merely keen on development rather than on reform. In implementing reform, we must throw away "our small abacus," "not get up to any little tricks," and oppose all sorts of fraud. These kinds of behavior run counter to the principle of achieving unity between the leadership and the rank and file. We must draw inferences about other cases from one instance and check erroneous ideas at the outset. We must sternly criticize and correct negative phenomena in the process of deepening reform. Second, we must make really concerted efforts to create a relatively relaxed and more favorable economic environment for reform. Since reform is gaining momentum and we have a heavy task to implement it in 1994, the economic environment cannot, under any circumstances, be controlled too tightly. There must be some leeway in making plans and arrangements for the pace of economic growth. In this connection, we must be determined to control the scale of fixed-asset investment, insist on matching the scale of construction with our national strength, and prevent the "three breakthroughs" in setting higher targets for growth rate, planned fixed-asset investment, and price rise rate from triggering off overheated economic development and aggravating inflation again. Comrade Deng Xiaoping explicitly said: "One of our experiences is to see emerging problems when development is smooth, and development should be moderate because an overheated economy will easily cause trouble." This is the wise remark of an experienced person as well as a note of caution. Leading comrades at all levels must stay sober-minded, be unconditionally subordinate to policy decisions of macroscopic regulation made by the central authorities, resolutely refrain from thinking negatively, make arduous efforts to keep total supply and demand basically in balance, take practical measures to check inflation, and guard against economic fluctuation. As far as the pace of development is concerned, various localities must proceed from their real conditions and never vie with each other. Third, we must make really concerted efforts to uphold the principle of doing two types of work simultaneously, maintain social and political stability, and strengthen the building of socialist ethical progress. Upholding the principle of doing two types of work simultaneously and maintaining social and political stability is the political guarantee for our smooth reform, opening up, and modernization, and for our endeavor to accomplish economic development. It is also an important component of the undertaking of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Without a stable social and political environment, we cannot succeed in reform and construction. Likewise, only when we insist on reform and development can stability be basically maintained. We are now promoting economic restructuring amid the high-speed operation of our national economy, and we must also maintain the growth of our national economy in a fast and good manner in the process of accelerating system transformation. In this connection, we are required much more to pay attention to maintaining a stable social and political environment. Leaders at all levels must treat the work of maintaining social stability as their own task, be good at taking heed of public feeling, lay stress on redressing grievances, promptly settle conflicts, guarantee safety and peace, and make sure that the general mood of society and the atmosphere of the press is good. We must carry forward our party's fine tradition of caring for the masses in every respect, of relying on the masses under all circumstances, and of always thinking of the interests of the masses. We must attach high importance to every concrete matter which is closely related to the wellbeing of the masses, such as the "shopping basket" and the "rice bag [mi dai zi 4717 5915 1311]" projects, and we should never blindly seek speed of growth at the expense of the wellbeing of the masses. Various key measures for the full implementation of reform have been introduced for more than two months, the overall situation is good without giving rise to any outstanding problem. At present, the market, society, and popular feeling are stable, which strengthens our resolve to fully implement reform to the end. "We must deal with the most difficult things if we want to pave the way to a bright future." We believe that if we succeed in the difficult task of deepening reform at full speed, it is certain that our country will enjoy perpetual political stability and make great strides forward in economic construction. Let us be of one mind and make concerted efforts to march forward in the flush of victory!
