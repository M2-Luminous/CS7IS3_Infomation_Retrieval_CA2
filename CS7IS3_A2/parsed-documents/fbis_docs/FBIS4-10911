Due to those acts of violence, the U.S. Government has issued a travel warning [previous two words in English] advising travelers not to visit Guatemala or to postpone their trips to that country, except for emergency purposes. Consequently, the important flow of U.S. tourists has dropped considerably, and hotels, travel agencies, and other tourist-related services have reported losses and have demanded stronger actions by the police. In his letter to Christopher, de Leon expressed regret over and condemned the events and ensured the courts will "act strongly against the culprits who have already been arrested."
