As the FBRs secure safety, the amount of resources and the economics will sufficiently concur with light water reactors (LWRs), and possibly it will become the main facility for generating electricity. This type of results from research were reported on 8 June at a meeting held by the Atomic Energy Commission of Japan-FBR Development and Planning Specialist Subcommittee. The research made together by Japan Nuclear Power Plant and by the Power Reactor and Fuel Development Corporation (PNC) has concretely shown that their goal is aimed toward future accomplishments in technical development. It points out that in order to materialize such goals it is necessary to devise a long term and a well planned match. The research outline will be introduced in two issues. Preface The development of our country's FBR has been considered as one of the most important subjects concerning the country's nuclear power policy and has been advanced under the cooperation of both government and people. The technology of FBR beginning with basic foundational research goes back to over 20 years of development to reach the present stage where it is now ready to test operate the model reactor, "Monjyu," and it has reached the level to where application is possible. In order to complete FBR as commercial power reactors, it would not only have to be economical but would have to be planned for its utmost safety and reliability. By early 21st century (about 2020-2030), about the time it is ready for commercialization, it is going to be necessary to prepare for the heightening of public acceptance. For this reason, the construction and operation of demonstration reactors following "Monjyu" should be advanced faithfully. It is also necessary to accumulate technology and experience and to perform technical development and demonstrations leading to application. For the application of FBRs, at the same time the technical development of the reactor is being made, the fuel cycle (fuel production and recycle) should also be studied. It is necessary to plan improvements for the complete FBR system including the fuel cycle for its safety and its economy. Assuming the commercial operation of an FBR application plant is possible by early 21st century, in order to make it more attractive than the prevailing LWR, the following must be considered: 1) A need exists to establish goals to improve economical aspects, safety, reliability, operation, maintenance and repair; 2) For a clear view of the future, a construction of an application plant design is needed so a generalized direction can be searched; 3) Technical developments in order to materialize the above has been put together as a concept. The Goals Toward Application of FBR To materialize an FBR plant that would be more attractive than the existing LWR of the same generation would mean recognizing the positive aspects of FBR, overcoming necessary subjects compared to LWR, analyzing the future movements concerning LWRs, and to identify the views of each of the established goals. From the above, the economic characteristics and safety goals toward application was established. The following are main goals for development. Economy 1) Compared to LWR, the largest element contributing to the construction cost would be the nuclear reactor structure, cooling system and fuel handling system. Considering the above, the goal is to make use of the sodium system characteristics as follows: - Simplifying the system; - Reducing and simplifying equipment and structures; - Integrating equipment and structures. 2) By putting into practical use the advantages of FBR, the aim should be to reduce fuel cost and to lower the cost of generating electricity. It can be done by: - Increased combustibility; - Creating high temperature and high heat efficiency in the plant. Safety Assuming conditions where many commercial FBRs will be operating, the goal should be for utmost safety and easily understandable safety procedures for the public. - Core that is highly safe (improvement in the core characteristics). - Safe facilities (passive equipment and system application) having high reliability. Reliability, Operation, and Maintenance-Repair While accepting the advancement and technical developments made for LWRs, and reflecting on the plant designs, construction, and operational experiences made by the model and demonstration reactors, an improvement in reliability, operation, and maintenance-repair can be gained for the FBRs. Together with all these goals set for applications of FBRs, from the viewpoint of making use of the FBR's original characteristics, it is necessary to advance technical development and to establish sophistication of the plutonium utilizing system that includes a total fuel cycle system containing new type fuel and TRU recycle. The Application Reactor Plant Design The application of FBRs can only be accomplished by basing it on future outlook of new technological developments, its applications to plant designs followed by the actual construction of the plant, operation and repairs etc., and through the accumulation of demonstrations and experiments. As an outlook to the future, in order to obtain prospective of the direction to be taken by technical developments and financial aspects of the application of FBRs, the formerly mentioned developmental goals based on economics and safety aspects have been referred to and the designs of application reactors (five types of reactors) have been constructed. (The figures are examples of two reactor designs.) The following considerations were made in the construction of the application reactor design. 1) In regard to the size of power outputs, assuming that a period for applications when many FBRs would be constructed in concurrence with large LWRs will come, similar to the LWR, an economically superior large reactor will be the subject for the plant design. The economical aspect will depend on the scale effect which will depend on the power output size. In addition, it will be affected by the standardization and module effects which depend on the number of reactors constructed. 2) Concerning the fuel form, mixed oxide fuel (MOX) which at this point in time has a record of high experience and accomplishments together with especially high degree of technical proficiency would be the object. Of the newer fuels such as nitrides and metallics, the actual demonstrations will be for future topics and whether to adapt them will only be decided from future technical developments. 3) In regard to reactor cores, assuming the conditions that several commercial FBRs will be built and be in operation, the object will be to aim for a core that is highly safe and easily understandable to the public despite the possibility of an economical impact (improvements to the core characteristics accompanied by an increase in the diameter of the core). 4) About the economical and safety aspects, a renovative technology that would contribute largely to its upgrading is expected, and will be incorporated into the plant design after consideration of its application possibility and time factor is made. The evaluation of the economical aspect up to date is to target a 70% reduction of nuclear reactor and cooling system amount of resources below that of LWR. In order to construct an improved economical plant design, the following points have been listed. - Integration of equipment by adopting large capacity electromagnetic immersion pump; - Simplification and standardization of equipment structure by adopting shock proof technology; - Elimination of secondary sodium system (intermediate heat transfer system). Results from the summarized evaluation of the construction of the plant design are given as follows: 1) In order that FBRs can economically concur with LWRs, it is believed necessary that the plant construction cost would have to be kept at approximately 110% of LWR. FBR plants have large scale merits that accompany its capability for large power output. Furthermore, in contrast to the construction cost of the original reactor (FOAK cost), by introducing several reactors, it is anticipated the construction cost (NOAK cost) will be reduced approximately 20% due to mastery effects. The present demonstration reactor No. 1 consists of large power output of 1.3 million KW and due to the mastery effect gained from commercial introduction, it has been evaluated to be in the area of 110% of LWR. 2) In directing FBR toward application and in order that it establish the utmost highest goals, the achievement of the economic aspects of the first reactor concurred with LWR were investigated and the results were as follows: (i) In the case of secondary sodium system existing plant, it is believed there will be some difference arising in the plant designs following the advancement in future equipment planning techniques. However, the evaluation at this point shows there are no effects from methods used for equipment integration and it remains almost the same. At any rate, the amount of resources for the nuclear reactor and the cooling system was about 70% of LWR and the construction cost was 97-104%. It is anticipated that the construction cost should be around 80% after the introduction of several reactors. In these application reactor plant designs, in addition to the techniques adapted in the plans for the already developed demonstration reactor No. 1, additional improvements in the reactor core characteristics, equipment integration by large volume immersion electromagnetic pump, shock proof, simplification of upper reactor etc. are made using new technology. Already, concerning these reform techniques, they have been realized inside and outside of this country, efforts have begun toward its materialization, and the prospects of development are good. Furthermore, the construction cost can be reduced by the application of FBR's scale merit obtained by enlarging the power output to 1.5 million KW, or by adapting the twin plant formula of common usage of the used fuel handling facility which shares a large portion of the FBR expense. (ii) For the secondary sodium system elimination plant, it turns out that the amount of resource for nuclear reactor and cooling system would be approximately 60% of LWR and 90% for construction cost. The estimate in construction cost would be around 70% after introduction of several reactors. Therefore, even if the three dimensional shock proof and secondary sodium system elimination techniques were not adapted, at the present, the renovation technology (equipment integration through enlarging capacity and using immersion electromagnetic pump) is the only one that can maintain a clear view of the developmental period, and possibly approach facing the accomplishment of the goal set for application of FBRs.
