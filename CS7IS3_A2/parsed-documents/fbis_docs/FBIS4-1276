Last night's abortive coup by several dozen soldiers and officers has failed. Some of those behind the coup have been arrested, others are on the run. Francoise Berlaymont first tells us how the abortive coup started: [Berlaymont] Those behind the coup were arrested last night. According to the interior minister, they are three Tutsi extremists, three officers, namely two captains and one officer cadet of the Superior Institute of Military Officers [Institut Superieur des Cadres Militaires]. They went out yesterday afternoon with one armored car and two trucks as well as some 50 men. They tried to storm the residences of the chief of staff and the defense minister, as well as the president's residence. However, those behind the coup did not manage to convince the other barracks. The abortive coup was not only directed at the government, but also at the army high command. Those officers who have been arrested are believed to reproach the chief of staff for its lack of firmness in the Kamenge clashes. This is the Hutu district of Bujumbura, whose inhabitants have been opposing the Army for two weeks. The Army issued an ultimatum. Yesterday, Sunday [24 April], at 1800, all the inhabitants were to surrender their weapons, which they failed to do. The ultimatum was postponed to this evening, at 1800. Several thousand soldiers came from other regions of the country last weekend to surround Kamenge. This maneuver could have been used as a cover for the coup. Shooting went on all day in Kamenge with guns, grenades, machine guns, and rifles. It is impossible to enter or leave the district. The rest of the capital is calm, but tension is extremely high, despite seemingly normal life. Francoise Berlaymont reporting from Bujumbura for the news bulletin. [Announcer] We have heard that contacts are being established in Bujumbura. Their aim is to prevent a violent confrontation in the northern districts of the town between the Army -- dominated by Tutsis -- and the Hutu gangs of armed resistance fighters who have found refuge there. If these contacts fail, this would in all likelihood lead to more tension in Burundi. In Brussels, the FRODEBU [the Front for Democracy in Burundi], has said that last night's abortive coup is to be attributed to the supporters of the former president, Jean-Baptiste Bagaza, who, for his part, has strongly denied these allegations. The FRODEBU, the majority party in Burundi, has also said that the coup was continuing, that the Army was putting the government under pressure, that the next few hours will decide whether it is double or quits.
