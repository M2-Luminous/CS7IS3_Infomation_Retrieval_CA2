The accord document in the last paragraph of its last page stipulates that the implementation of the document requires a united political will. Second, on the basis of the coalition government and parliamentary coordination document under which the present government was formed, and in accordance with this document the commands of the coalition parties should hold meetings in case [words indistinct] on the topics intended to be discussed at the Council of Ministers to [word indistinct] an agreement in this [word indistinct]. From this premise, it is important in this case to expedite holding a coalition command meeting to discuss the litigious draft agenda proposed by you. Third, the present circumstances in Aden, permeated with [words indistinct] and media clamor do not contribute to the prevalence of a suitable atmosphere for the convocation of a cabinet session. Fourth, while [words indistinct] their readiness to exert all efforts to implement the document of pledge and accord starting from the provisions of the document itself, we believe that your proposals on the draft agenda are in violation of the document and based only on the paper submitted by the Yemeni Socialist Party concerning the measures of implementation of the document. This paper [words indistinct] accepted by the Political Forces Dialogue Committee. Fifth, the bylaws of [word indistinct] Council of Ministers stipulates the need to send the documents on the agenda of the Council of Ministers to the ministers five days before the date set for the meeting. This was not respected [words indistinct] current Council of Ministers. In addition, the Council had agreed to hold two sessions in Ramadan on the basis of the rule that is annually followed. These were actually held. [Words indistinct] an extraordinary meeting only and such a meeting is held only to discuss [words indistinct]. Sixth, in view of the fact that no party within the coalition can unilaterally propose the Council's agenda [word indistinct] the document of pledge and accord, we propose the following: 1. Holding an extraordinary Council of Ministers session in the capital Sanaa not later than 5 March to discuss one topic only in accordance with the Council of Ministers bylaws. This topic is to issue decisions on matters stipulated in the document and which are urgent and cannot be postponed; namely, the plan to arrest the accused who are at large and issuing the decision on withdrawing the Armed Forces from the area that used to be called the border areas, in addition to the decision that enables the Political Forces Dialogue Committee to carry out its follow-up tasks as enunciated in the document. 2. As for the other provisions of the pledge and accord document, we once again emphasize that the adoption of timetables for their implementation and the formation of committees for this is is a joint responsibility to be assumed by the coalition members and which no party can carry out alone. Out of our concern over [words indistinct] expeditious agreement [word indistinct] the Council of Ministers following the blessed 'Id al-Fitr holidays, we propose that the prime minister and his deputies hold meetings during the period that remains from the blessed month to agree on these plans and implementation measures in accordance with what is stipulated in the document.
