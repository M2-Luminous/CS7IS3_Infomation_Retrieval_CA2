To the extent to which party congresses and party congress speeches can influence such developments, however, Halle must be assessed as a success of the party and its chairman and candidate for the chancellor's office. The delegates were wildly determined to give the signal for a new beginning, which was expected by the party leadership, and Scharping not only did not make it difficult for them but, with his speech, he indeed created confidence and even enthusiasm. He demanded discipline and obedience, showed his critics their places with mild, fatherly strictness -- and the delegates thanked him for it. After all, they did not have any other choice if they did not want to damage their already ailing chairman even more. Four months before the elections, the party only has Scharping, and therefore it has to care for him. Scharping did not deviate from his strategic line and from the concept of his election campaign: no statement on a future coalition, restraint regarding social promises, and concentration on the issue of work. He also remained loyal to himself in the noncommittal way in which he brushed over the tensions between ecology and economic growth and in the vagueness of the SPD's foreign policy line. However, more clearly than before, he was looking for a confrontation with the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union. Its 12 years of government have meant not only stagnation, but a step backward. And where the European Kohl is unsuitable as an enemy image, Scharping brings up Bundestag Group Chairman Schaeuble as the "man after Kohl" and describes him as a national-conservative reactionary with horns, a club-foot, surrounded by the stink of sulfur. The SPD, as the guardian of European enlightenment and the shield against the attack of a new, evil nationalism -- this idea became an inspiring common experience at the party congress, even if it does not have much to do with reality. "Now things are getting started," the delegates chorused. The party's sinking into despondency seems to have stopped for the time being. The Social democrats are always great in making a new start. Things usually get difficult as soon as they have arrived.
