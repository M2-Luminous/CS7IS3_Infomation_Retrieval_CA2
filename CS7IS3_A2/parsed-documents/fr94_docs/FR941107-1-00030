FR941107-1-00030 FR941107-1-00007 VI. Cost-Benefit Analysis To assist the Commission in its evaluation of the costs and benefits that may result from the proposed changes to disclosure requirements contained in this release, commenters are requested to provide views and data relating to any costs and benefits associated with these proposals. It is expected that the enhanced legal proceeding disclosure provisions will modestly increase most registrants' costs and compliance burdens. A requirement to provide additional information for longer periods of time than currently required in documents filed under the Securities Act, Exchange Act and Investment Company Act should not significantly increase the burden on company resources, since many registrants and others already are required to gather information regarding the backgrounds of directors, officers and others. It appears, however, that any additional expense may be justified in view of the material information that would be made available to investors. VII. Summary of Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis An initial regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 603 concerning the proposed amendments to Item 401 of Regulations S&hyph;K and S&hyph;B, the Regulation A offering circular (Model B), Schedules 13D, 13E&hyph;3, 14A and 14D&hyph;1, Forms N&hyph;1A, N&hyph;2, N&hyph;3, N&hyph;4, N&hyph;5, N&hyph;8B&hyph;2, N&hyph;8B&hyph;3 and N&hyph;8B&hyph;4, and Regulation E. The analysis notes that the proposed amendments are intended to provide investors with more information regarding the background of those who exercise control over the affairs of public companies. As discussed more fully in the analysis, the proposed changes would affect persons that are small entities, as defined by the Commission's rules. It is expected that increased reporting, recordkeeping and compliance burdens would result from the changes. The analysis also indicates that there are no current federal rules that duplicate, overlap or conflict with the revised legal proceedings disclosure provisions. As stated in the analysis, several possible significant alternatives to the proposals were considered, including, among others, establishing different compliance or reporting requirements for small entities or exempting them from all or part of the proposed requirements. As more fully discussed in the analysis, the alternatives were either addressed in the proposals, inconsistent with the purposes of the federal securities laws, or otherwise without justification. Written comments are encouraged with respect to any aspect of the analysis. Such comments will be considered in the preparation of the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis if the proposed revisions are adopted. A copy of the analysis may be obtained by contacting James R.
