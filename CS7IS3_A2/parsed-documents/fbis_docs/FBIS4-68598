Budgetary federalism presupposes the fulfillment of several conditions. First, allotment to the budgets of federation subjects of enough income to allow them to ensure the territory's viability. Second, budgetary federalism assumes the implementation of a policy aimed at evening out levels of economic and social developmen--if, of course, the federal government intends to preserve its integrity. The 1994 draft budget provides for cuts in the income authorities of federation subjects with a one-time expansion of their expenditures, that is, the principle of correspondence between expenditures and income in territories' budgets has been violated. Thus, if in 1993 territorial budgets received 62 percent of total taxes paid, in 1994 they are getting only 43 percent. Cuts in the income of territories' budgets actually mean cuts in financing for urgent social needs, which account for 80-90 percent of local budgets' expenditures. Moreover, local budgets, unlike the federal budget, cannot take advantage of monetary emissions to cover the deficit being created and will be forced to cut expenditures on the region's social infrastructure, from teachers' salaries to financing passenger transport and upkeep on heating plants. Moreover, the 1994 budget assumes an expansion in the expenditures' portion of regional budgets due to the transfer of housing and social sphere sites from enterprises' balance-sheets to the territorial organs, as well as several other expenses. Thus, if before perestroyka the local budgets financed a third of the investment in the construction of housing and social sites and two thirds of the costs for them, then due to the mounting crisis, enterprises do not have this opportunity. Financing of the social sphere rests increasingly on local budgets. This combination--cuts in income authorities and expansion of expenditures for federation subjects--can lead either to a willful halt in the allocation of taxes to the center on the part of local authorities, which has nothing in common with budgetary federalism, or else to an increase in the already excessive tax burden on economic subjects, which will lead to a cut in entrepreneurial activity, and this process in turn will cut territories' income even more. As for the second principle of budgetary federalism--evening out levels of economic and social development among federation subjects--in the last two years Russia has encountered a sharp increase in regional differences. In 1988, the gap between the territories in per capita income amounted to a factor of 3.5; today this index has reached a factor of 16-17. A country that is determined to preserve its state unity cannot permit this kind of sharp regional differentiation. Otherwise, it will have to reject federalism and democracy both and move from political to police methods for regulating conflicts in the federation. Budgetary policy is above all a means for neutralizing regional differences. The amount of funds redistributed among the regions depends on the degree of differences and on what leveling mechanism society chooses at a given moment. Analysis of the 1994 draft budget shows that the share of funds redistributed through the federal budget has decreased by a factor of 2: if in 1993 the financial support fund (that is, total funds for subventions, subsidies, and transfers) came to 13 percent of federal budget expenditures, 17 percent if the variation in the standard for allocating value-added tax is taken into account, then in the current year this index was a mere 10 percent. This kind of policy is scarcely justified on the backdrop of a sharp increase in regional differences. Actually, it should be noted that the 1994 budget does include substantial accomplishments toward budgetary federalism: in it for the first time an attempt is undertaken to create a single source and unitary rules for financing the regions in place of the faulty practice of regional lobbying and systemless agreements. However, the transfer (subsidy) scheme proposed in the budget requires substantial changes in the principles and criteria for rendering financial assistance. First of all, the method for determining transfers takes into consideration only current expenses. This provides virtually nothing for subsidies for investments in the social and housing spheres, the state of which is what determines regional differences. Secondly, according to the proposed draft, 66 of the 89 regions are subsidized. This result is possible either in the event of an inaccurate scheme for calculating needy regions or else is connected with the political state of affairs: the federal center is establishing clearly elevated standards for taxes going into the federal budget, which in the future will allow it to guarantee the political loyalty of three fourths of the regions with the help of subsidies from the center. Thirdly, the proposed scheme of transfers allows for a change in the "rules of the game" with individual regions. Thus, the financial support fund is divided into two funds: a support fund for "needy" regions and a support fund for "especially needy" regions. Only the apportionment for the "needy" regions is subject to a precise algorithm; there is no such algorithm for the other, which has had an immediate effect on the distribution of funds for this part of the fund, half of which is sent to Kemerovskaya Oblast. At the same time, the list of "needy" regions is made up based on the economic indicators for 1993 and does not provide for expansion at the expense of regions encountering an increasingly strong drop in the standard of living and production in the current year. We are witnessing a repeat of the story of 1993, when on the backdrop of a very strong decline in production, several oblasts in Central Russia (Ivanovskaya, Vladimirovskaya, and others) paid maximum taxes to the federal budget, calculated on the basis of indicators for the preceding year. This intensified the decline in production and the fall in the standard of living and predetermined the voting in these regions for Liberal Democrats. Finally, the source from which the financial support fund for the regions is formed is the value-added tax, that is, financial assistance to the regions is not a defended article of the budget: a shortfall in taxes will lead to a cut in the financial support fund for the regions, which means on expenditures for the social sphere as well. Budget, especially the relationship between the federal budget and the territories' budgets, plays a key role in maintaining a state's social stability and political unity. It is worth remembering that the break-up of the Union began with a budgetary war.
