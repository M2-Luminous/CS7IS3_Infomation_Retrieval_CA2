The issues concerning the republic's domestic and foreign policy are again on the agenda today, the second day of the session. A report by the republican Defense Ministry is also on the agenda. The deputies are also expected to discuss the continuation of the peace negotiations on the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. The negotiations are scheduled to take place in Geneva tomorrow [2 June] and were called by Yasushi Akashi, special envoy of the UN Secretary General. Commenting on his talks with [Russian Deputy Foreign Minister] Vitaliy Churkin yesterday, Momcilo Krajisnik, chairman of the people's assembly of the republic of Srpska, said on his arrival in Pale that the vital interests of the Serbian people are not for sale, and that the contact group and other international community's mediators in the talks on the former Bosnia-Herzegovina have already been made aware of that. Krajisnik stressed that Churkin had said that the delegation of the Serbian Republic would travel to Geneva to attend the two-day talks on the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, but that this did not mean the continuation of the negotiations on the fate of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, which the Serbian Republic is linking to the lifting of sanctions imposed on the Serbian people. The special Russian envoy [Churkin] should arrive in Sarajevo today, where he will probably try to convince Alija Izetbegovic and the Muslim side that it is necessary for them to attend the negotiations in Geneva.
