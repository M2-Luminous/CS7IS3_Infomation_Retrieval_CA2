FBIS4-50637 "drchi098_a_94014" FBIS-CHI-94-098 Daily Report 19 May 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS General NATO Offers Russia `Special Partnership' NATO Offers Russia `Special Partnership' OW1905171194 Beijing XINHUA in English 1559 GMT 19 May 94 OW1905171194 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Brussels, May 19 (XINHUA) -- The 16-member NATO decided Wednesday [18 May] to offer Russia a "special partnership" to encourage the country to join its new military cooperation program for the former members of the Warsaw Pact. The decision was made at a weekly meeting of the NATO ambassadors in Brussels, one week before Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev visits the NATO headquarters. Moscow has refused to join NATO's "Partnership for Peace" program if it was not given a special status. Clearly NATO's offer will enable Moscow to have close consultations with NATO on security and other issues, though its outlines are still sketchy. The relationship would be separate from the "Partnership for Peace", NATO sources said. However, he added that Moscow would certainly not be given a seat in NATO. NATO offered the "special partnership" to Russia because Russia is a big and important country, the sources added. In January, NATO outlined the "Partnership for Peace" program in order to draw former Warsaw Pact adversaries closer. The plan was regarded by most of the former Warsaw Pact nations as the first step towards fully joining NATO. Russian President Boris Yeltsin has warned the alliance against moving its border eastward. Observers notice that the NATO's decision was evidently planned prior to next week's visit of Russian Defense Minister Grachev. He is scheduled to address NATO ministers on Russia's views on "Partnership for Peace".
