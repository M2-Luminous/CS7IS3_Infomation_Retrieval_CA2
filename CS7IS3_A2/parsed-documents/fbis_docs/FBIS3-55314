According to Interfax sources, Dudayev believes that as Georgia's first legally elected president, Gamsakhurdia must be buried with all honors. Groznyy's mayor's office told Interfax that requests were being made for naming a street in Groznyy after Gamsakhurdia. Groznyy's First Vice Mayor Sayid-Magomed Inorkayev said that Gamsakhurdia's name would be given to one of the city's most beautiful streets. He also said that the city administration was ready to organize a funeral ceremony in Groznyy. Earlier, Gamsakhurdia's wife Manana had told Interfax that her husband must be buried in Tbilisi, in the courtyard of his house, near his father's grave. She doubts, however, that the Georgian officials will allow her to do so.
