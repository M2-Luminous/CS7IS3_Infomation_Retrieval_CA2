After years of tranquillity, the hamlet of Faverges, in the north of the Isere region, was peacefully invaded on the morning of Saturday 9 April by the first participants -- some 1,000 people -- in the antinuclear march organized by the Europeans Against [the] Superphenix [nuclear reactor]. (The coordinating group of this group consists of six organizations: the Malville committee (Lyons), the FRAPNA (Rhone-Alpes Federation for the Protection of Nature), Greenpeace-France, the GSIEN (Group of Scientists for Information on Nuclear Energy), and the World Wildlife Fund, from Milan. It also includes some 300 associations or groups, including political parties (the Greens, Generation Ecology, the Greens in the European Parliament, and Red and Green Alternative), and several dozen foreign organizations, predominantly German and Swiss.) Faverges had doubtless seen nothing like this since that dramatic Sunday 31 July 1977 when a major antinuclear rally (over 20,000 demonstrators) degenerated into violent clashes with the police, leading to the death of a 30-year old pacifist schoolteacher, Vital Michalon who was killed by a grenade. Prior to departure [passage omitted] a commemorative plaque was unveiled to his memory. This march, which will take the ecologists to the Paris Science and Technology Park before moving on to the prime minister's office on 8 May, marks the awakening of an antinuclear movement which has lost much of its sting in recent years, in particular in the area around the Superphenix. The local reasons for this are twofold: first, the fast breeder reactor has been shut down since 2 July 1990, and concerns have thus been lulled; secondly, maintenance operations have created some 2,500 jobs. Previously openly opposed to Superphenix, the mayor of a small neighboring town expressed an opinion widely shared in the region: "We all have relatives working in the power station, so now is not the time to be picky, even though I am still aware of the specific risks posed by the reactor." It was the government's decision, made on 22 February, to use Superphenix not as a nuclear power station but as a "reactor dedicated to research and experimentation," that jarred its opponents back to life. Europeans Against Superphenix reiterates that "it was during safety experiments that Soviet engineers caused the worst accident in nuclear history." Throughout the journey the caravan of protesters will hammer out a slogan worthy of [French satirist and comedian] Coluche: "If you laughed at Chernobyl, you mustn't miss Creys-Malville!" Highly Symbolic Stop-Off Points "Pull the plug on Superphenix!" declares the 15-meter long banner leading the procession out of Faverges, indicating that the protest is focused firmly on the only industrial-scale fast breeder reactor in the world and that the ecologists do not intend getting way-laid by more general issues. The whole range of arguments against the use, in whatever form, of the Creys-Malville plant is used, including its high cost and the risk it poses: "In 20 years, this reactor has already cost over 50 million French francs [Fr], has only operated for 176 days and still wastes Fr600 million a year"; and "Superphenix still contains 5 tons of plutonium and 5,000 tons of sodium." (Superphenix cost Fr27.7 billion in today's money to build, Fr7.65 billion of which in interim interest. Maintenance costs Fr650 million per year (Fr750-800 million in 1993). To completely abandon it would cost Fr12billion, to which can be added Fr18 billion in compensation for France's partners. The station operated for 7,400 hours (slightly more than 300 days) since being hooked up to the EDF grid in 1986. Fuels used total 5.5 tons of plutonium, while 3,500 tons of the 5,000 tons of sodium are still contained inside the reactor tank. Encouraged by a precedent -- three days before the scheduled restart date of 2 July 1992, the then-Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy froze any decision -- and guessing that the Balladur government will not make any further decisions on restarting the reactor before the European elections in June, the anti-Phenix movement intends putting this period to the best use by exerting as much pressure as possible. All the more so, of course, since the national energy debate opens at the start of May. The fliers that are to be distributed from Faverges to Paris state: "We must put a stop to this costly, dangerous, and useless experiment... Errare humanum est, perserverare diabolicum [to err is human but to persevere is diabolical]." Abandoning the reactor would be considered "a brave and positive act." The antinuclear lobby has also broken away from its radical attitudes of the past, at least in appearance. In this way, Europeans Against Superphenix is thus again out campaigning for support. Greenpeace-France hoped that "the march can trigger a chain reaction along its route, mobilizing sectors of public opinion reaching far beyond traditional ecologist groups. Everyone understands that, behind Superphenix there is the need for a greater transparency in the debate on energy choices in France." This is why highly symbolic stop-off points have been chosen, such as the Lyons headquarters of the NERSA, the Superphenix operating company; the power stations at Fessenheim (Haut Rhin), Cattenom (Moselle) and, on 26 April (eight years to the day since the Chernobyl disaster), the station at Nogent-sur-Seine; the European Parliament in Strasbourg, and so on. The march will also pass along some Swiss towns (Geneva, Lausanne, and Basle), and, the organizers insist, it will also visit a number of "alternative sites" promoting renewable energy sources. The caravan will also be running a campaign of postcards addressed to the prime minister.
