"We will continue to expect North Korea to take desirable steps in accordance with international opinion," the top government spokesman told a news conference. Takemura also said Japan will keep in close touch with the United States and South Korea to exchange views on ways of tackling the growing threats arising from North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development program. While acknowledging that Tokyo's diplomatic channels to Pyongyang remain closed, Takemura noted that its Foreign Ministry is striving to find ways to persuade North Korea indirectly to remove the suspicions concerning its nuclear development program. Earlier this week, the International Atomic Energy Agency adopted a resolution referring the issue of North Korea's refusal to accept full inspections to the UN Security Council, which may subsequently consider economic sanctions against Pyongyang. North Korea slammed Japan on Wednesday for considering backing such sanctions, saying, "if seditious forces dare to put unreasonable pressure upon us in the form of `sanctions,' we would regard it as something equivalent to `a declaration of war'." Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will confer with South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, who arrived in Tokyo on Thursday for a three-day stay, on possible ways to encourage North Korea to allay concerns that it is developing a nuclear weapon capability.
