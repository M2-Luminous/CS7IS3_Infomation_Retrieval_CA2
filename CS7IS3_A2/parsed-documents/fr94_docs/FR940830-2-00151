FR940830-2-00151 FR940830-2-00066 In addition, the amendments delete provisions relating to orders that are infrequently or never entered. These include (1) limited orders to buy on the offer, sell on the bid, and those marked ``immediate or cancel''; and (2) limited orders to buy or sell marked ``or on close.'' 6 By deleting these provisions, the Amex is discontinuing their eligibility for order entry. 6 See Amex Rule 205(B) (1) and (3). Finally, current provisions relating to ``seller's option'' or cash trades will be deleted and subsumed by new Section C(2) entitled ``Non-Regular Way Trades.'' A differential will be permitted on such executions. The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of Section 6(b). 7 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirements that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public. The Commission believes that the proposal's goal, which is to eliminate odd-lot differentials on all but non-regular way trades and adjust the pricing mechanism accordingly, should increase the quality of execution and accurate reporting of customer odd-lot market and limited orders. The Commission also believes that the proposal should further the Commission objective of ensuring that customers receive the best execution of such orders. As a result of the proposal, the price charged for the execution of systematized odd-lot orders will reflect the market's price without additional transaction charges. 7 15 U.S.C. 78f(b) (1988). It Is Therefore Ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 8 that the proposed rule change (SR-Amex-94&hyph;15) is approved. 8 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988).
