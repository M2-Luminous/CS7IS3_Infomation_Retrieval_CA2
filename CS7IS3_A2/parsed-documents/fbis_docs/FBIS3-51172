However, he said, "there is no specific information" about the subject. The presence of an unidentified activist group was detected, Camilion said. The group took advantage of "a clear, spontaneous, situation" staged by the people who participated in the revolt. In statements to Radio Continental, the minister said the presence of Shining Path activists in Santiago del Estero has not been confirmed and that "if there was specific information about an identified individual he would be expelled from the country." He also said that another report mentioned the presence of a police officer whose last name is Chuk in the revolt in Santiago del Estero. The subject, however, was not mentioned during the internal security meeting held on 12 January with President Carlos Menem. According to Camilion, during the meeting Menem "warned" officials responsible for internal security to "keep their eyes open" and asked intelligence officials to "obtain information and investigate." "It was a sudden meeting, not to analyze an urgent subject, but to be alert," the defense minister said. Camilion also said the government is investigating the origin of the fire in Misiones City Hall and the attacks on installations of privatized public services. The possibility that drug traffickers might be financing the Zapatista guerrillas in Mexico was discussed during the meeting, Camilion said, adding that the national government "does not doubt they received a significant amount of money" from some group. Although he said the internal security meetings will continue to be held, Camilion denied the existence of a predetermined agenda, adding that "in the short term no meeting will be held to discuss so many subjects as yesterday." Regarding the 12 January meeting, Camilion ruled out that the presence of the Armed Forces should have any political meaning "other than that established by the Internal Security Law that states the Armed Forces can be called at the last moment to intervene in extreme cases."
