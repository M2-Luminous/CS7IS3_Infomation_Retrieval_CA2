At least 25 Britons have been arrested in the past six months in Scandinavia, charged with carrying khat, a stimulant that is banned in America and most European countries. Paul Watson, 34, from London, was arrested on Friday in Helsinki, Finland, for possessing 80 kilos of the khat plant leaves. He told Finnish police he was en route to Stockholm and that this was his second trip as a courier. Drugs support agencies fear that London has become the centre for an illegal trade in khat. The Foreign Office suspects that a single organisation is employing the couriers because nearly all the arrested Britons--ranging in age from 24 to 59--have come from the Heathrow airport area in west London. Release, the drug charity, said it had received dozens of calls from Londoners who had been offered £50 to £150 to carry khat abroad, mainly to Scandinavia and the United States. Some had answered small ads in local newspapers. Khat--Catha edulis forsk--is a privet-like plant that produces mild euphoria when its leaves are chewed. It is widely grown in the Horn of Africa, particularly Somalia and the Yemen, where chewing its bitter leaves is part of the culture. Greengrocers sell it in Britain, particularly in areas with Somali and Yemeni immigrants. A bunch of leaves costs £4. It raises blood pressure, increases heart beat and suppresses appetite. Catherine Perez Phillips, a spokeswoman for Release said: "When people are asked to carry the drug they are not being told the truth. They are told that what they are being asked to do is legal." Six Britons are still held in Oslo awaiting trial. Among them are Raymond and Joanne Edwards, from London, who were arrested at Oslo airport on April 7. They said they had been offered £50 each for the trip, and that this was the second time they had acted as couriers for the same agent. Seven others arrested in Norway have been released and deported. Six more Londoners are in prison awaiting trial in Sweden, three in Finland and three in Denmark. British embassies are worried that the trafficking is becoming such a problem that the Scandinavian governments will make an example of some of the Britons by jailing them. Until now the authorities have adopted a relaxed attitude and those found guilty of smuggling khat have only been deported. A 1980 UN report said that prolonged chewing of khat can lead to dental and gastric diseases, cirrhosis of the liver, hypertension, migraine and cerebral haemorrhage.
