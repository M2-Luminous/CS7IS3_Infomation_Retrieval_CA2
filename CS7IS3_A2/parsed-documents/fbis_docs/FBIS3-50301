Spokesman Kris Janowski said the evacuation of 22 patients and 16 of their relatives had to be called off after the Croat forces (HVO) [Croatian Defense Council] failed to give authorisation for it to go ahead. Among the ill was a five-year-old girl with bone cancer who needed urgent medical attention, he said. A spokeman for the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) meanwhile said intense fighting broke out Wednesday between the mainly-Moslem Bosnian Army and the HVO at Fojnica, 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of here. Spokesman Idesbald van Biesebroeck said UN military observers who reported renewed clashes between Bosnian-controlled Fojnica and the Croat-held town of Bakovici, three kilometers (two miles) away, had no further details. The new outbreak of fighting came after Croat forces Monday recaptured the Moslem village of Here, near Prozor, 30 kilometers (20 miles) south of Fojnica. The village has great strategic significance for the defense of Jablanica and Konjic, towns under Bosnian control, and for communication between Sarajevo and central Bosnia. The mountainous village of Here and two others held by Bosnian forces, Kute and Scipe, stand along a road built by Croat forces to link Kiseljak, 30 kilometers west of Sarajevo, to western Herzegovina, which they control. UN observers also reported renewed exchanges of light and heavy automatic gunfire at Gornji Vakuf, in central Bosnia, between the Bosnian Army and the HVO. Serb forces stepped up their bombing of Sarajevo on Wednesday, wounding eight civilians, Lieutenant-Colonel van Biesebroeck added. He said 350 shells hit the Bosnian capital. Of these, 60 percent were aimed at Bosnian positions on Mount Zuc, 30 percent at the southwestern districts of Dobrinja and Mojmilo and 10 percent at the centre of town.
