FR940412-2-00016 FR940412-2-00009 National Institute of Standards and Technology [Docket No. 940386&hyph;4086] RIN 0693&hyph;AB22 Proposed Revision of Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 172, VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL) AGENCY: National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Commerce. ACTION: Notice; request for comments. SUMMARY: This proposed revision of Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 172, VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL), will adopt the standard hardware description language of the ANSI/IEEE 1076&hyph;1993, IEEE Standard VHDL Language Reference Manual. This proposed revision is for use by computing professionals involved in high level digital hardware specification, development and implementation. Prior to submission of this proposed FIPS to the Secretary of Commerce for review and approval, it is essential to assure that consideration is given to the needs and views of manufacturers, the public, and state and local governments. The purpose of this notice is to solicit such views. This proposed FIPS contains two sections: (1) An announcement section, which provides information concerning the applicability, implementation, and maintenance of the standard; and (2) a specifications section which deals with the technical requirements of the standard. Only the announcement section of the standard is provided in this notice. Interested parties may obtain copies of the technical specifications (ANSI/IEEE 1076&hyph;1993) from the IEEE Service Center, 445 Hoes Lane, P.O. Box 1331, Piscataway, NJ 08855&hyph;1331, telephone 1&hyph;800&hyph;678&hyph;4333. DATES: Comments on this proposed FIPS must be received on or before July 11, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments concerning the proposed FIPS should be sent to: Director, Computer Systems Laboratory, ATTN: Proposed FIPS 172&hyph;1, VHDL, Technology Building, room B&hyph;154, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899. Written comments received in response to this notice will be made part of the public record and will be made available for inspection and copying in the Central Reference and Records Inspection Facility, room 6020, Herbert C. Hoover Building, 14th Street between Pennsylvania and Constitution Avenues, NW., Washington, DC 20230. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. William H. Dashiell, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, (301) 975&hyph;2490. Dated: April 6, 1994. Samuel Kramer, Associate Director. Proposed Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 172&hyph;1 (date) Announcing the Standards for VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL) Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) are issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) after approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 as amended by the Computer Security Act of 1987, Public Law 100&hyph;235. 1. Name of Standard. VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL) (FIPS PUB 172&hyph;1). 2. Category of Standard. Software Standard, Hardware Description Language. 3. Explanation. This publication is a revision of FIPS PUB 172 and supersedes that document in its entirety. This publication announces the adoption of the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for VHDL. This FIPS adopts American National Standard Hardware Description Language VHDL (ANSI/IEEE 1076&hyph;1993) as stipulated in the Specifications Section. The American National Standard specifies the form and establishes the interpretation of programs expressed in VHDL. The purpose of the standard is to promote portability of VHDL programs for use on a variety of data processing systems. The standard is used by implementors as the reference authority in developing compilers, interpreters, analyzers, simulators or other forms of high level language processors, and is used by digital hardware designers, and by other computer professionals who need to know the precise syntactic and semantic rules of the standard and who need to provide specifications for digital hardware descriptions. 4. Approving Authority. Secretary of Commerce. 5. Maintenance Agency. U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL). 6. Cross Index. ANSI/IEEE 1076&hyph;1993, IEEE Standard VHDL Language Reference Manual.
