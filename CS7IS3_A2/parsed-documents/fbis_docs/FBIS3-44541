In an interview with XINHUA today, Yan Xuetong noted that commodities exports furnish the best example of what he calls "two- way exchange between the Chinese and world economies." Yan estimated that such exports may reach 91 billion U.S. dollars in 1993, up from 85 billion in 1992 and compared with a mere 9.74 billion in 1978 when the policy of reform and opening to the world became official. "There was an annual average growth of 18 percent between 1978 and 1992," he said. "In 1978, China ranked 32nd among all countries in terms of annual commodities exports and in 1992, it advanced to the 11th." Manufactured goods now account for at least 80 percent of China's exports. In 1978, however, the bulk of China's exports were primary products, he added. China was a pure importer of technologies before 1981 when, for the first time, it signed six contracts on technological exports. Since then, the country has concluded 1,100 contracts, involving 3.4 billion dollars. However, Yan was far from being satisfied, noting that the 1992 transactions -- 1.4 billion dollars -- was only two percent of the country's commodities exports. Export of capital was also something new for China. By the end of 1982, the country had invested 37 million dollars in 43 projects abroad. By the end of 1992, Yan said, China's overseas investment had snowballed to 1.85 billion dollars in 4,117 projects. "Few Chinese-funded projects are in commerce or trade meant for direct profits," he noted. "Instead, 86 percent of the Chinese investment has gone to projects producing iron ore and other raw materials to make up for domestic shortages." At the end of June 1993, 157,000 Chinese workers were working abroad to perform labor service contracts, mostly in construction and other manual labor jobs. Yan, an economist trained at the University of California at Berkeley of the U.S., held that China should start organizing the export of intellectual labor services by making use of its eight million scientists and engineers. "Economically, the country is linked with the world, and has to prepare itself for closer links," concluded Yan, who serves as deputy director of the center which operates under the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations. Since 1985, China has published a series of laws designed in part to promote integration of the Chinese and world economies, including laws on patents, trademarks and copyrights. Also, China has joined the world intellectual property organization and acceded to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property and the Universal Copyright Convention. Meanwhile, China has lowered its import duties.
