Berzin, chairman of the Sverdlovsk Oblast Government Committee for Relations with Public Organizations and the Study of Public Opinion: "Poll: Which Way Will the Voters Lean?"] [Text] On 3-5 February the oblast government's Committee for Relations with Public Organizations and the Study of Public Opinion conducted an express poll of voters. The objective was to reveal changes in the correlation of political forces that have occurred since elections to the Russian Federation Federal Assembly and to examine the overall situation in nine population centers in the Central Urals. Participating in the poll were 904 people, selected to be representative in terms of sex, age, educational level, social status, type of urban area and geographical location. The poll's margin for error is three percent. For the past five years the public's social and psychological feelings and attitudes toward the changes taking place have been conducted on a regular basis. During that period there has been a drop in the number of people who are confirmed supporters of radical economic reforms. Whereas in 1991 50 percent of those surveyed supported such reforms, 27 percent were convinced of the need for partial changes and only nine percent deemed it possible to leave things as they were, in 1992, just three months after the start of reforms, 19 percent of respondents said that new opportunities were opening up for them, while 28 percent were ready to go back to the way things were before. As of February 1994 the situation has to a certainly extent stabilized for the time being, with a substantial number of people -- 44 percent -- of the opinion that although they personally have not gotten anything out of the reforms, they are in fact essential to Russia. However, in comparison to 1992 there has been a decrease by a factor of three in the number of respondents who feel that new opportunities have opened up to them as a result of the economic changes, currently at six percent. Today 33 percent feel that it would have been better not to undertake reforms. The adolescent type of emotional reactions so typical of the mass mentality of Russia's people is also evidenced in the correlation of political forces prior to elections to the oblast duma and local governmental bodies. There has been an increase in the number of voters who are willing as a sign of protest (or perhaps in order to draw attention to their needs) to vote for political parties and movements opposed to the president and the government of the Russian Federation. Survey data indicate that for many people that protest is a subconscious reaction to the events occurring in their lives and does not indicate an increase in the number of confirmed opponents of radical economic reform in our oblast. On the other hand, it is precisely at the level of the common, mass mentality that the prerequisites for the creation of a social base for emerging parties and social movements are created. According to the survey data, prior to the start of the active electoral campaign the public's pre-election sentiments are as follows. Of those surveyed, 25 percent are prepared to vote in the upcoming elections for parties that favor radical economic change (Russia's Choice, Democratic Russia, the RDDR, etc.). In the December 1993 elections those groups won 23 percent of the vote. There are 23 percent prepared to support opposition forces, which received 10 percent of the vote in the last election. This includes the LDPR -- Zhirinovskiy's party -- with the support of 10 percent of voters (formerly 7.6 percent), parties of a communist or socialist orientation, with 10 percent (formerly 2.5 percent) and the patriotic and nationalist movements, with three percent. This is the first time in recent years that an increase in the popularity of communists and socialists has been observed, and though it may be only relative (recall that according to poll results in October-November 1993 similar rates of increasing popularity held true for Zhirinovskiy's party as well) this could indicate emerging trends in the mass consciousness of people in Sverdlovsk Oblast. Of those surveyed, 22 percent are thinking about voting for parties that hold centrist positions, parties which got nine percent of the vote in the December elections. The increase in this bloc's popularity is primarily due to the fact that our survey included among this group Transformation of the Urals [Preobrazheniye Urala], which is headed by E. Rossel, and it received the support of a majority of those surveyed. A significant portion of those surveyed -- 19 percent -- are planning to vote for independent candidates. Another 13 percent remain undecided. Generally speaking, it is clear that the position of Russia's Choice is strongest in large cities, with the opposition and centrist parties having the most supporters in medium-sized and small cities and in rural areas. The voter turnout problem remains serious. Since 1990 voter participation has been decreasing by an average of 10-15 percent in the interval between each election. Survey data indicate that this past trend will continue, with only one in two of those surveyed expressing a desire to go to the polls. As in the past, voters in rural areas are more active. By way of comparison, on 12 December 46 percent of voters in Yekaterinburg went to the polls, while 61 percent did so in rural areas. Considering this, and also taking into account a likely drop in voter turnout among the residents of large cities, the position of those living on the outskirts of the oblast, in those areas where the standing of those critical of the government is better, will be a significant factor in the outcome of this election. The poll also examined residents' attitude toward the local administration, with 48 percent saying that life in their city or rayon is largely defined by the personality of the individual who heads the local administration, with that individual's effectiveness hampered by the following factors: lack of physical resources, lack of budget funding, lack of a clear-cut program of action and insufficient knowledge of the public's interests. Other reasons cited less frequently: a low level of professionalism among those working in the apparatus, and a lack of respect for the administration chief. Only one person in 20 was satisfied with the local administration's actions. The least respect for administrators was found in large cities (Yekaterinburg and Nizhniy Tagil). In rural areas and small cities the public is more loyal to local administration chiefs. Summing up the findings of this latest express poll, one should note the increasing alarm of the public in outlying areas, trends toward change in the system of political and social orientations, and greater social tension among those working in agriculture, machine building and mining.
