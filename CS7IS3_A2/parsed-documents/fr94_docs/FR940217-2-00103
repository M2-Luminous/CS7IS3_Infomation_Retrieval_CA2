FR940217-2-00103 FR940217-2-00059 The ABA, as well as a number of other commentators, requested that the Department expand the proposed exemption to include retroactive and prospective relief for foreign exchange transactions entered into pursuant to a standing authorization, hereinafter ``standing instruction.'' Similarly, many of those commenters also requested that the Department amend the definition of the term ``directed transaction'' by modifying the requirement that the independent plan fiduciary effect the foreign exchange transaction at a specific exchange rate. The commentators represent that the utilization of a standing instruction is an integral component in foreign exchange transactions involving employee benefit plans. They further indicate that standing instructions are necessary to repatriate relatively minor amounts of income such as dividend and interest payments routinely generated by foreign securities which are held by plans. In this regard, they state that obtaining individual directions for each income receipt would be impractical and that plan beneficiaries would lose investment income due to the time that it would take to receive directions from investment managers and convert the payments. In addition, many investment managers who wish to effectuate a foreign exchange transaction do not contact the foreign exchange desk directly, but instead leave their trading instructions with their account managers in the bank's trust or global area. Transactions effected in this manner can be bulked or added together with other transactions from employee benefit plans as well as other trusts and custodial accounts so as to obtain a more beneficial exchange rate. Under the circumstances described above, foreign exchange transactions would not meet the definition of ``directed'' as set forth in the proposed exemption because of the inability to comply with the requirement that the independent plan fiduciary designate a specific exchange rate. The Department notes that a bank or broker-dealer engages in violations of section 406(b) of the Act whenever it uses its fiduciary authority or control with respect to the plan assets involved in the transaction to increase the amount of its compensation by determining the timing or the specific exchange rate for the foreign exchange transaction. The Department did not propose relief with respect to such transactions because it was unable, at the time, to make the findings required under section 408(a) of the Act. Specifically, the Department was unable to conclude that the conditions proposed by the ABA would effectively and consistently address the potential for abuse of discretion by party in interest banks or broker-dealers in setting exchange rates for foreign exchange transactions. The commenters have responded to the Department's concerns by suggesting additional conditions which would limit the amount of discretion that a bank or broker-dealer would have in executing the foreign exchange transactions pursuant to standing instructions. Thus, some of the commenters suggested that the class exemption could limit relief to those situations where the triggering event, such as the receipt of cash dividends, would not be within the control of the bank or broker-dealer. In addition, the exchange transaction would have to take place within a short period of time following the triggering event. As a further limitation on the bank or broker-dealer, a commenter suggested that the exchange rate could be set daily prior to execution of the covered foreign exchange transaction using objective criteria which would be disclosed to and approved by a plan fiduciary independent of the bank or broker-dealer. Finally, it was represented that conditions relating to the information which must be provided or made available to the independent plan fiduciary could require very detailed disclosures which would enable such fiduciary to determine the reasonableness of the foreign exchange rates paid by the plan. On the basis of the comments received following publication of the proposed exemption, the Department believes that it may be appropriate, under certain circumstances, to provide relief from section 406(b)(1) of the Act. Pursuant to the requirements of section 408(a) of the Act, however, the Department is required to offer interested persons an opportunity to present their views and an opportunity for a hearing before granting an exemption from section 406(b) of the Act. Therefore, in order not to delay the publication of an exemption from section 406(a) of the Act for foreign exchange transactions, the Department has decided to grant the exemption described herein while it continues to consider additional exemptive relief for foreign exchange transactions between a plan and a party in interest bank, broker-dealer or affiliate thereof where such transactions are engaged in pursuant to a ``standing instruction.''
