The author, Jaroslav Stracelsky, writing in the 22 February issue of MOSTY, urged Slovak lawmakers to pay close attention to the drafting of the restitution law and, in particular, to oppose the government in its effort to shift the beginning of the period covered by the law from the originally proposed February 1948 to November 1938. Role of Hungarian Leader Stracelsky claims that, while drafting the restitution law, designed to compensate Slovak citizens and organizations, particularly Jewish citizens and the churches, for losses suffered because of political discrimination in the pre-1989 period, the Slovak Government may have been unduly influenced by the demands of Miklos Duray, the chairman of Egyutteles, the largest political party representing the Hungarian minority in Slovakia. Speaking on Slovak television, Duray attacked the so-called Benes Decrees of 1945, which legalized the expulsion of the Sudeten Germans as well as some Hungarians from Czechoslovakia immediately after World War II. Duray insisted that these decrees be invalidated. Implications for Sudeten Claims Stracelsky suggested that "Slovakia's Hungarian citizens apparently felt that what Duray had in mind was redress of old wrongdoings" and that the Slovak Government must have shared that view. This, he said, may explain why, "under the innocent pretext" of wanting to rectify the injustices inflicted on the churches and their property, the government proposed to push back the date for property restitution to the Jewish communities from 1948 to the day of the Vienna Arbitration of 2 November 1938, when Slovakia ceded portions of its territory to Hungary. But, argues Stracelsky, "this innocuous legal move" has serious hidden implications. The government has either ignored or overlooked the fact that, "while on the day of the Vienna Arbitration the Slovak south was not yet occupied by Hungary, Hitler had already annexed the Sudeten territory." Thus, whether intended or not, the recognition of this fact by the Slovak Government, as reflected in the draft of the law, "will make it possible for the Sudeten German Landsmannschaft [the Bavaria-based organization of Sudeten Germans and their descendants] to obtain additional support for its territorial and property claims" against the Czech Republic. The Sudeten Germans will be able to insist that, because the Slovak Government seems now to be willing to compensate those who were dispossessed as early as 1938, the Czech Government should follow suit. "The fact that this can be done in Slovakia should make things easier for the [Sudeten] Germans in their negotiations with the Czech Republic as well." It should be clear, Stracelsky adds, that "the Slovak Government would be committing a major mistake," and he admonishes the Slovak parliamentary deputies to be "vigilant" no matter how "innocent the government documents submitted to them may appear." Link to German Visitor Seen In conclusion, Stracelsky hints that Duray's criticism of the Benes Decrees may have been related to a visit to Budapest by Klaus Franke, a Christian Democratic deputy in the German Bundestag. Franke's trip, he points out, took place shortly before Duray's television appeal. During that trip, according to Stracelsky, Franke allegedly tried to induce Gyorgy Csoty, the deputy chairman of the Hungarian parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, "to make sure that the Hungarian minority deputies in Slovakia appeal, in the Slovak National Council and the Slovak media, for the cancellation of the Benes Decrees, which affected the Sudeten Germans." Stracelsky characterizes the Franke-Csoty talks as a "provocative event" that could not but "attract attention in both Hungary and Slovakia" and speculates about the possible existence of "a lobby (endowed with considerable financial means) that may be interested in a deliberate escalation of Slovak-Hungarian and Slovak-Czech tensions and that utilizes, for that specific purpose, its own stable of Trojan horses." The potential impact of such tensions on the course of the early elections that are being planned, he adds, should not be ignored.
