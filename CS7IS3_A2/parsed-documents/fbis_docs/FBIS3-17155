Referring to official data, the newspaper notes that "20 per cent of well-to-do population enjoys now 40 per cent of all cash incomes while 20 per cent of population in the low wage bracket has only seven per cent". "The society's `elite' has formed its closed circle isolated from the popular masses, working for itself and serving itself," the newspaper writes. Noting that such a situation is fraught with a social explosion, the newspaper calls for stepping up state and public control, using economic levers. The same newspaper speaks about "an emerging course for stabilisation" in the country in another article, where premier Viktor Chernomyrdin is called its main herald. According to ROSSIISKIE VESTI, this course should not be rescribed as a rollback on reforms. It means "only a departure from radicalism to more organic development of society". The TRUD, KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA and other newspapers single out a report on the land-crash of an A-310 plane belonging to the Russian International Airlines Company, which flew on the Moscow-hong kong route. All crew members, nine stewardesses and 63 passengers died. In the opinion of the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper, an explosion is a possible reason for the tragedy. The newspaper writes that circumstances of the plane's crash are very similar to those of the Boeing's crash in 1986 over Scotland blasted by international terrorists (notorious "Lockerbie case"). The TRUD newspaper carries an interview with Russian Minister for Nationalities Sergey Shakhray who explains reasons motivating his faction (Party of Russian Unity and Accord) in the lower house to vote for the much publicised amnesty. "One cannot be a judge at his own house," he says. "The logic of civil clashes knows only one way out: an attempt for civil reconciliation." The same newspaper features an interview with acting Ukrainian Premier Yefim Zvyagilsky, saying that some Western media fan up "a conflict" between Ukraine and Russia. "These are ravings of a madman," he stresses. "Some people are evidently very eager to direct our relations according to this scenario. But nobody will be able to sow a discord between us." According to Zvyagilsky, "close and equal relations with Russia were and remain the top priority in politics for us". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, ROSSIISKIE VESTI and other newspapers print a report on consultations between Russian and German Foreign Ministers Andrey Kozyrev and Klaus Kinkel in Moscow on Wednesday. Newspapers note that the sides concentrated on the forthcoming visit by President Boris Yeltsin to Germany this May. Writing about a meeting in the United States of the Russian-American commission on the fate of U.S. citizens who had disappeared in the former Soviet Union, the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper carries an interview with a Russian delegation member and legislator Dmitriy Volkogonov. He expressed conviction that the participation of Russians in the commission "works for the prestige of Russia". Newspapers write about talks, which ended in Moscow on Wednesday, between the Russian Government and the International Monetary Fund to bring closer their positions on Russia's economic policy in 1994. Konstantin Kagalovsky, member of the IMF directors board from Russia, said in an interview with NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA that "good personal relations" between Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin and IMF managing director Michel Camdessus were a decisive factor for the successful completion of the talks. According to the newspaper, the IMF wants the Russian side "to rationalise production" which means higher rates of privatisation and bankruptcies. Continuing this topic, the SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA daily reproduces a cartoon from the English-language MOSCOW TIMES newspaper where our country is depicted holding holey hat, into which the IMF tosses "the so-called system credit of 1.5 billion U.S. dollars which immediately falls through".
