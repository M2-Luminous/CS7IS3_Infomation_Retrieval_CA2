Director Choko Takayama of the Okinawa Governor's executive office said on 17 January the information came from U.S. Representative Neil Abercrombie, 55, a Democrat from Hawaii. At the house committee, Representative Abercrombie is expected to question U.S. military and government officials on "why U.S. Forces maintain such huge military bases on Okinawa rather than returning the land to the local people." As part of a follow-up to Governor Masahide Ota's Washington visit seeking a breakthrough on the U.S. bases issue, the prefectural government last year invited Representative Abercrombie and other U.S. officials to visit Okinawa. Representative Abercrombie is known for his work in campaigning for cutbacks to military bases in Hawaii. After observing bases on Okinawa, Representative Abercrombie stressed the need to review U.S. policy on military bases on Okinawa, saying: "We should now review the significance of the military bases, because the significance was determined 50 years ago. My duty is to provide appropriate advice based on necessary information. I promise I will fulfill the duty." Mr. Gene La Rocque, a retired naval officer who is known in Japan because he confirmed the possession by U.S. Navy vessels in Japanese territorial waters of nuclear weapons, also visited Okinawa at the invitation of the prefectural government. He has produced television programs on U.S. base problems on Okinawa. Representative Abercrombie has obtained three video recordings of Mr. La Rocque's programs to show to other house Armed Services Committee members. A 30-minute program produced by Mr. La Rocque was broadcast in the United States through the PBS Network, a nationwide television network which has access to about 100 stations. Viewers in Washington watched the program at the end of last year, New Yorkers saw it on New Year's Day. A videotape of the program has been sent to the prefectural government, and it reportedly focuses on the financial burden of maintaining military bases on Okinawa, saying: "Redevelopment of returned U.S. bases would benefit the local community (Okinawa), and U.S. taxpayers could save a lot of money."
