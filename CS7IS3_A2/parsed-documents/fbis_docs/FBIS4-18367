The Soviet Union is dissolved. The Warsaw Pact is annulled. The West-East Cold War is over and communism has collapsed; but NATO, devoid of its functions, remains. On 18 February 1952, Turkey joined NATO, which was established on 4 April. Turkey trusted NATO and has come out a loser. Turkey, which maintained the largest number of soldiers to defend against the Soviet Union after the United States, remained underdeveloped because of the burden NATO's military expense placed on the country. While Turkey fulfills all its responsibilities toward NATO, NATO has not fulfilled most of its responsibilities toward Turkey. NATO member countries have not supported Turkey but in fact acted antagonistically toward it. Turkey's extremely West-oriented policy and support of NATO has left it isolated in the world. Turkey which pinned its hopes on NATO has been let down. Superpowers can never have friendships. They can only relate to self-interest. Turkey, which made extraordinary sacrifices for NATO from 1952 to 1990, was stabbed in the back by NATO members who supported the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] and deployed the Poised Hammer. The West betrayed Turkey which receives little aid from NATO but carries the Alliance's heavy load. And this is a characteristic of the West. The West is no different from a scorpion or from a snake. Countries which side with the West are bound to get its poison at their weak moments. The West sees its interest in Turkey's disaster. The U.S. and European Union [EU] policy toward Turkey is to destroy it mainly economically and morally and then to use it. In short, the Western policy toward Turkey can be described as "collapse it and use it." The United States and the EU supplied the basic intrigue to begin the chain of Turkey's disasters. The West remained silent when the Greeks massacred Turks in Cyprus with NATO arms. However, when Turkey saved its brothers in Cyprus in line with existing agreements and international law, the West imposed an arms embargo on Turkey. President Lyndon Johnson gave Turkey a memorandum, saying: "I would like to tell you in all sincerity that the United States will not agree to the use of U.S.-supplied military equipment in any intervention Turkey might undertake in Cyprus." Unfortunately, intellectuals and politicians raised in Western culture pinned their hopes on the United States and Europe. However, had we tried to stand on our own two feet with our own resources we would have found our true identity, our true place in the world. Following in the footsteps of the West (the formula of the late Ismet Inonu) has been the reason for our disaster. According to the United States, all the world's resources are the common property of mankind, but the sources of the United States belong to the United States only. There is no basic difference between 1945 Yalta and 1990 Malta. The only difference is in the method. In Yalta, the United States and Russia [as published] divided the world into their areas of influence. They divided the world into East-West, Warsaw Pact and NATO, thereby preventing progress for the developing countries and continuing to exploit developing countries by selling arms to them. They deceived the world through Cold War scenarios. When the world realized how deceitful the scenarios were, Bush and Gorbachev decided in Malta to go on with the Cold War, but this time to disband the Soviet Union and replace it with Russia. The United States and Russia, who were enemies in the past, are now in the same ranks. The only superpower in the world today is the United States, and its greatest supporter is Russia. The West which did not allow Russia to come down to the Adriatic for centuries, has just placed it in Bosnia-Herzegovina which the West prepared. Do not be surprised if, soon, through U.S-Russian cooperation, Russia is placed in Turkey's straits. Maybe the East-West Cold War ended in Malta, but a cold war between the North (Christianity) and the South (Islam) was decided on there. The new enemy of the West and of NATO is Islam which is hiding behind a fundamentalist mask. At the time, NATO's enemy was red, now it is green, in other words, the color of Islam. NATO's true face emerged when it remained a silent observer before the Serbian cruelties in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Today, NATO has adopted a front against the Islamic world.
