FR940111-0-00012 FR940111-0-00004 After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register because: (1) The Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis; (2) the fiscal period began on August 1, 1993, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment for the fiscal period apply to all assessable onions handled during the fiscal period; (3) handlers are aware of this action which was unanimously recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and is similar to that taken for the 1992&hyph;93 fiscal period; and (4) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will be considered prior to finalization of this action.
