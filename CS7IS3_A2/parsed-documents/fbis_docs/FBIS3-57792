Berne has said that it was very surprised and that it regretted the French decision. The two men are suspected by the Swiss authorities of having assassinated Kazem Rajavi, Iranian opposition figure and brother of the leader of the People's Mujahidin. Behzad Naziri, spokesman of this movement, has also protested to the French authorities and spoke to (Olivier Dalage): [Begin Naziri recording] Above all, we would like to register a strong protest, which was in fact addressed by Mr. Mas'ud Rajavi, leader of the Iranian resistance, to the French Foreign Ministry, for not handing over the murderers of his brother, Professor Kazem Rajavi, to the Swiss authorities, and sending them back to Iran. This is a very great concession to the mullahs in power in Iran. The Swiss magistrate investigating the murder of Mr. Kazem Rajavi, representative of the Iranian resistance at the United Nations, was seeking 13 terrorists who had been dispatched by Iran. Out of these 13, these two were in prison in France. This decision is a flagrant violation of the decision of the French courts, which had decided to approve the extradition, and of the Swiss courts, which had requested the extradition of these murderers to bring them to trial. [end recording] Former Iranian President Bani Sadr has also reacted. He has expressed his shock and indignation at the decision. He accused Interior Minister Charles Pasqua of being, I quote, hand in hand with the Iranian mullahs.
