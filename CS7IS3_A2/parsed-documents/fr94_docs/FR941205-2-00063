FR941205-2-00063 FR941205-2-00042 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gary H. Lefkowitz of the Department, telephone (202) 219&hyph;8881. (This is not a toll-free number.) Stratus Computer, Inc. Employees' Capital Accumulation Plan (the Plan) Located in Marlboro, Massachusetts; Proposed Exemption [Application No. D&hyph;9823] The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990). If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of sections 406(a), 406(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(A) through (E) of the Code, shall not apply to (1) the proposed extension of credit by Stratus Computer, Inc. (Stratus) to the Plan in the form of a loan (the Loan) with respect to Guaranteed Investment Contract, Number 62456 (the GIC) issued by Confederated Life Insurance Company of Canada (CL); and (2) the Plan's potential repayment of the Loan (the Repayments), provided: (a) all terms of such transactions are no less favorable to the Plan than those which the Plan could obtain in arm's-length transactions with an unrelated party; (b) no interest and/or expenses are paid by the Plan; (c) the amount of the Loan is no less than the accumulated book value of the GIC as of August 12, 1994; (d) the Repayments are restricted to the amounts, if any, paid to the Plan after August 12, 1994, by CL or other responsible third parties with respect to the GIC (the GIC Proceeds); (e) the Repayments do not exceed the total amount of the Loan; and (f) the Repayments are waived to the extent the Loan exceeds the GIC Proceeds. Summary of Facts and Representations 1. Stratus manufactures and sells fault-tolerant superminicomputer hardware, develops and licenses computer software, and provides computer consulting services. Stratus is a public company, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, and had revenues of approximately $525 million for 1993. Stratus currently sponsors the Plan for the benefit of all its United States employees and employees of its United States subsidiaries. The Plan is a defined contribution plan with an employer matching feature. The Plan has approximately 1,200 participants and beneficiaries, and as of June 30, 1994, the approximate aggregate fair market value of the Plan's assets was $68,679,205. 2. Under the Plan, participants are able to self-direct their savings contributions as well as Stratus matching contributions into seven diversified investment funds, which are a Money Market Fund, a Fixed Income Fund, a Balanced Fund, a Growth and Income Fund, two Growth Funds and an International Fund, all of which are managed by Fidelity Investments (Fidelity) of Boston, Massachusetts. The investment options under the Plan are all mutual funds. The Plan no longer acquires individual guaranteed investment contracts, but rather participates through Fidelity in a GIC ``Fund'', which is the Fixed Income Fund. As of January 1, 1994, contributions and/or transfers into the Fixed Income Fund are invested in Fidelity's GIC Fund. 3. The Fixed Income Fund contains five Investment Contracts which are issued by various insurance companies. These five Investment Contracts were purchased prior to the Plan's participation in and offering of Fidelity's GIC Fund. One of these five Contracts is the GIC, which was issued by CL. The GIC was issued on April 1, 1991 and is due to mature on March 31, 1996. The stated interest rate on the GIC is 8.52%. The total contributions made to the GIC have been $5,031,214. Withdrawals have been made in the amount of $2,001,214. As of August 11, 1994, the GIC had a balance of $3,119,540. 4. However, on August 12, 1994, CL was seized by Canadian governmental authorities, and all CL assets were frozen. To ensure the financial viability of CL commitments in the United States, the State of Michigan froze all assets of CL in the U.S. until a Rehabilitation Plan (the Rehab Plan) can be secured. 2 At the time CL was seized, a segregated fund (the Segregated Fund) was established within the Fixed Income Fund of the Plan. Participants with assets in the Fixed Income Fund had approximately 13.5% of that amount allocated to the Segregated Fund, which represents the percentage of assets attributable to the GIC in the Fixed Income Fund. 2 The Department notes that the decisions to acquire and hold the GIC are governed by the fiduciary responsibility requirements of Part 4, Subtitle B, Title I of the Act. In this proposed exemption, the Department is not proposing relief for any violations of Part 4 which may have arisen as a result of the acquisition and holding of the GIC. 5. The applicant represents that the Segregated Fund component of the Plan poses various administrative problems, including the fact that investment transfers, loans and hardship withdrawals, as well as distributions for terminated and retired participants are precluded. Approximately 54% of the Plan participants are affected. 6. Stratus has accordingly requested an exemption to permit it to make the Loan to the Plan. The Loan will be made pursuant to a written agreement, in which all Loan terms will be stated. The Loan will be an interest-free, unsecured loan in an amount equal to the Segregated Fund balance (i.e., the accumulated book value of the GIC_deposits, plus interest at the contract rate, minus withdrawals) as of August 12, 1994. Any future interest credited in accordance with the Rehab Plan will be allocated to Plan participants. The purpose of the Loan is to facilitate distributions, participant loans, hardship withdrawals and investment transfers from the portion of the participants' account balances that are allocated to the Segregated Fund. Such distributions would otherwise be at best delayed due to the uncertainty of the terms of the Rehab Plan. The applicant represents that the Plan's Repayments of the Loan will be limited to the GIC Proceeds, will be waived to the extent the Loan exceeds the GIC proceeds, and in no event will exceed the amount of the Loan.
