FR940513-2-00076 FR940513-2-00039 Information and assistance or information and referral as it may be more commonly known, is a mandated service under the Older Americans Act. Each Area Agency on Aging must provide this service either itself or through contract to serve the older population in its planning and service area. In a 1988 study of Information and Referral (I&R) systems funded by AoA, two problems were identified. First, significant variation was found in both the quality and quantity of I&R services available throughout the country. Second, people in local communities and particularly long-distance caregivers had difficulty in finding out about available services in the community in which their loved one resided. This feasibility study found strong support among State and Area Agencies on Aging for a national locator service to build on and not duplicate or replace the existing I&R services, a national locator service which would target long distance caregivers. In response to these concerns, the Administration on Aging in 1990 funded the development and implementation of the Eldercare Locator. This national 800 telephone number is designed to help direct both local and long-distance caregivers to the appropriate source of information about services in every locality in the United States. Callers identify the county, city or zip code in which the older person lives and describe the type of services they are looking for. The operator then directs them to a local Information and Referral number, an Area Agency on Aging or the number of the particular service which has been identified and the caller makes the local contact. The Eldercare Locator began service in December 1991 on a limited basis in the Northeast States. Over the next year, the Locator service was expanded in stages to other parts of the country, becoming nationwide in December 1992. The Locator serves all 50 States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the American Trust Territories. It is operational from 9 AM EST until 11 PM EST. In January, 1994, additional operators and telephone lines were added to increase the ability of the Locator to serve additional clients with reduced waiting times. Prior to January, 1994, the Locator was able to serve an average of 4000 callers a month. This figure will be significantly increased with the addition of the new operators and lines and expanded times, although no figures were available at the time of publication of this announcement. The Eldercare Locator is a part of an AoA Initiative begun in 1990 to improve access to and quality of I&R assistance that older people and their caregivers receive. The I&R Initiative focused on heightening recognition of the pivotal role this service plays in a comprehensive and coordinated system of community based long term care services. The AoA Initiative focused on enhancing: the quality of I&R systems; the professionalism of staff operating I&R systems; the visibility of I&R systems for older persons; access to existing I&R services; and the availability of I&R services to those elderly at risk of losing their independence. Under the Initiative, AoA funded both the Locator and a National Information and Referral Support Center which provides training and technical assistance to State and Area Agency on Aging Information and Referral programs and assists them in strengthening and expanding their services. The Administration on Aging is soliciting proposals, under a new competition, to continue the Eldercare Locator and the National Information and Referral Support Center. Continued support for the Locator is aimed at strengthening and expanding its services, increasing public awareness and understanding of the Locator, and enhancing the access of older people and their caregivers to community based long term care services. In addition to the continuation and expansion of the basic Locator service, the following activities should be undertaken by the grantee: •Continuous update of the database with a new survey of the Area Agencies on Aging to determine whether the database should be expanded and if so, how. The results of this survey should be reflected in further refinements of the database. •An evaluation of the Locator service should be conducted within the first year. A previous evaluation of the service conducted prior to implementation of nationwide service indicated that 78% of users were satisfied with the service and would use it again. Since the service will have been operational for over two years by the time a new evaluation is undertaken, it is necessary to look at consumer satisfaction at this point in time as well as how the service could be improved. Other factors that should be examined are the efficiency and effectiveness of the services compared to the overall cost per average call. •Either as part of the evaluation or as a separate study, an investigation should be conducted on the impact of changing technology on the future of information-based services particularly as it would impact on the Eldercare Locator. For example, in the future, might it be feasible and what are the cost implications of patching callers directly through to local I&R services.
