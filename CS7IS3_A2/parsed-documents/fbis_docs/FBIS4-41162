But there is one more point in the program for his U.S. visit. At breakfasts and lunches in a narrow circle to which the press will not even be allowed to come close, the most informed members of the U.S. Government will listen eagerly to the Moscow guest's answers in the hope of learning what is actually happening in Russia. In a half-hour meeting with President Bill Clinton scheduled for Thursday Chernomyrdin's assessment of the "current moment" will take no less time than Russia's application to join the "seven," Kim Il-song's bomb, or problems of friendship with NATO. The main thing is the economy. On the eve of Viktor Chernomyrdin's arrival several respectable newspapers have published items which say for the first time that it is quite likely that the Russian recession is close to an end and Russians will start to live better. It is important for Chernomyrdin to place the correct emphases, to maintain faith in the Russian reforms, but to avoid exultation which naturally makes creditors anxious to get their money back. This is the third session of the "Chernomyrdin-Gore" commission, named for its two cochairmen. The U.S. vice premier's duties are of a strictly protocol nature while our premier is still the all-Russian head of enterprise. That reflects the two sides' approaches. The U.S. Administration has virtually exhausted its potential for giving us money. The verbal resources with which the administration, to give it its due, has done everything to attract its businessmen by speaking highly of Russia's boundless resources, are also on the verge of depletion. So Washington is interested in a selfless, platonic exchange. Premier Chernomyrdin, concerned with problems simply unknown to his partners, is still worried about the eternal question: What will they give? They will give what they promised, but no more than there is. The administration does not have that much at its disposal: space, nuclear power, environmental protection. Joint Russian-U.S. committees and commissions have long been wandering around all these glades and there is much here which is already well trodden. Anything new comes hard. A treaty on the use of the Sakhalin island shelf, the so-called "Sakhalin-2," was expected. But instead of the treaty there will be a joint statement whose commercial value may only emerge at some time in the future. And may not emerge at all. Actually, the latest helping of treaties on space and rockets will be signed. Fierce competition is under way to take part in the world telecommunications system and our specialists are rushing to extract as much benefit as possible from the fact that we still make quite good rockets. But the agreement on halting plutonium-producing reactors will very likely not be signed although congratulations on the subject have been heard since late March. But money is louder than applause. The Russian side claims that the stopping of the reactors is in the interests of the world public for which the public should pay. The United States, guessing by some seventh sense that it is once again a case of dollars from its budget, does not object to raising the issue, but says there is no money. At a preliminary press conference a spokesman for the prime minister's apparatus noted that "half the government is moving to the United States." He has in mind the fact that Viktor Chernomyrdin is accompanied by six leading ministers for whose transportation a whole two aircraft were required. Russian soccer fans will probably approve the arrival of both aircraft in Detroit, where we play Sweden on Friday. It is planned that Viktor Chernomyrdin who in general does not go to soccer matches ("because of a lack of time") will on this occasion visit the locker room and give our professional soccer players additional encouragement. To judge by their game with Brazil only a presidential decree will help here. Actually, Bolivian President Sanchez de Lozada, a long-standing and passionate fan, did not enter the locker room on the eve of the first match of the championship in which the national team he worships was taking part. Either they did not let him in or he was shy. As for Premier Chernomyrdin he will go, his staffers report, to congratulate the players after the match -- if they win. If they lose the cortege will go straight from the rostrum to the airport to return to Moscow on Saturday morning. The Russian premier will spend all the first half of the day at the Chicago headquarters of General Motors. The Russian automobile association plans to create capacities for the production of new passenger vehicles in conjunction with Opel, General Motors' European junior partner. Formally the deal is being concluded between private enterprises and the government leader would seem to have nothing to do with it. But the Western partners realize how dependent any Russian enterprises remain on top officials. So his hosts will await with practical interest V. Chernomyrdin's reaction to one of the new models. The premier will test its quality in motion, getting behind the wheel himself.
