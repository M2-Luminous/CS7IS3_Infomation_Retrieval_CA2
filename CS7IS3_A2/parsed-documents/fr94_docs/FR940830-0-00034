FR940830-0-00034 FR940830-0-00006 The emission inventory shows that the emissions are seasonal, with re-entrained road dust the primary source in spring and summer. Industry is the most important source category in the fall and winter. However, fugitive dust accounts for a large portion of the industrial emissions: 56.6% in the summer, 48.2% in the fall, and 18.2% in the winter. Re-entrained road dust is the major area source during the spring (83.7%), summer (53.9%), and fall (41.7%), and residential wood combustion is the major area source in the winter (27.3%). EPA is approving the emissions inventory because it is accurate and comprehensive and provides a sufficient basis for determining the adequacy of the attainment demonstration for this area consistent with the requirements of sections 172(c)(3) and 110(a)(2)(K) of the Act. 6 For further details see the TSD. 6 EPA issued guidance on PM&hyph;10 emissions inventories prior to the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments in the form of the 1987 PM&hyph;10 SIP Development Guideline. The guidance provided in this document appears to be consistent with the amended Act (see section 193 of the CAA). 3. RACM (Including RACT) As noted, the initial moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas must submit provisions to assure that RACM (including RACT) are implemented no later than December 10, 1993 (see sections 172(c)(1) and 189(a)(1)(C)). The General Preamble contains a detailed discussion of EPA's interpretation of the RACM (including RACT) requirement (see 57 FR 13539&hyph;13545 and 13560&hyph;13561). Five sources/source categories were identified as contributing to the PM 10 nonattainment problem in Libby. The following table contains an outline of these sources/source categories, their control measures and associated emissions reduction credit, and effective dates. ␣ 1Source/source category 1Control measure 1PM 10 emissions reduction 1Effective date Re-entrained road dust Lincoln County Road Dust Control Regulations 03/01/93 ␣ Regulation 3: Materials to be Used on Roads and Parking Lots 38% ␣ Regulation 4: Street Sweeping and Flushing 58% ␣ Regulation 6: Limiting the Application of Sanding Material 7% ␣ Combined controls 460.7 tpy 38% (annual) or 48% (24-hr) Prescribed burning Lincoln County Open Burning Regulation: Regulation 7 (No credit taken) 03/01/93 Residential wood combustion Lincoln County Solid Fuel Burning Regulation: Regulation 2 53 tpy 31% (annual) or 1196 # /day 66% (24-hour) 03/01/93 Industry Stimson Lumber Company permit modification # 2627&hyph;M 07/25/91 ␣ Boilers & Dryers 449 tpy, or 55% ␣ Haul Road Fugitive Dust 220 tpy, or 70% Motor vehicle exhaust Federal tailpipe standards 12.2% 1988&hyph;1994 time period or 1.0% 1995&hyph;1997 time period (1) 1Ongoing due to fleet turnover. A more detailed discussion of the individual source contributions and their associated control measures (including available control technology) can be found in the TSD for this action. EPA has reviewed the State's documentation and concluded that it adequately justifies the control measures to be implemented. The implementation of Montana's PM 10 nonattainment plan for Libby will result in the attainment of the PM 10 NAAQS by December 31, 1994. By this action EPA is approving the Libby PM 10 plan's control strategy as satisfying the RACM (including RACT) requirement. 4. Demonstration As noted, the initial moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas must submit a demonstration (including air quality modeling) showing that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously as practicable, but no later than December 31, 1994, or the State must show that attainment by December 31, 1994, is impracticable (see section 189(a)(1)(B) of the Act). Montana conducted an attainment demonstration using receptor modeling (CMB) and rollback modeling for Libby. The 24-hour PM 10 NAAQS is 150 micrograms/cubic meter ( m g/m3), and the standard is attained when the expected number of days per calendar year with a 24-hour average concentration above 150 m g/m3 is equal to or less than one (see 40 CFR 50.6). The annual PM 10 NAAQS is 50 m g/m3, and the standard is attained when the expected annual arithmetic mean concentration is less than or equal to 50 m g/m3 (lid.) The demonstration for Libby indicates that the 24-hour PM 10 NAAQS will be attained by December 31, 1994, at 139.2 m g/m3. The demonstration indicated that an annual concentration of 47.6 m g/m3 will be achieved by 1995, 7 showing attainment of the annual PM 10 NAAQS. The control strategies used to achieve these design concentrations are summarized in the section titled ``RACM (including RACT).'' For a more detailed description of the attainment demonstration and the control strategies used, see the TSD for this action. 7 The Clean Air Act calls for attainment by December 31, 1994. Section 188(c)(1). EPA interprets the State's demonstration as providing for attainment by January 1, 1995. EPA is proposing to approve the State's demonstration on the basis of the de minimis differential between the two dates. The State should promptly inform EPA if EPA has in any manner misinterpreted the date by which the State has demonstrated attainment in the Libby nonattainment area. 5. PM 10 Precursors
