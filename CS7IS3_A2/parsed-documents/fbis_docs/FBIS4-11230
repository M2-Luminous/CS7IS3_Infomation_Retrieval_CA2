The executive branch believes such an important decision, from a political and legal standpoint, can only be made if there is a certain degree of consensus among the possible beneficiaries: M-19 [19 April Movement], EPL [Popular Liberation Army], PRT [Revolutionary Workers Party], and Quintin Lame Commando Unit. Government Minister Fabio Villegas explained that because of this situation, the government cannot accept a Senate proposal to give back the seats to the movements, which struck an alliance with the M-19 Movement Democratic Alliance [AD/M-19], which they lost in the 13 March elections. "We do not wish to create more differences and political confrontations," the minister pointed out. The government position was adopted for several reasons. First, Presidential Candidate Antonio Navarro opposed the Senate proposal, although he clarified that he did so on a personal basis. Second, militants of former guerrilla groups, such as Bernardo Gutierrez and Gerardo Ardila, criticized the proposal and described it as "shameful for democracy." Although Navarro criticized the media for having consulted people who are no longer AD/M-19 members, they are former guerrillas however. AD/M-19 President Carlos Franco said he personally opposes political favoritism, which is the name commonly given to the concession of seats by decree, because the Senate is not the only political forum that exists and because he is convinced that his movement suffered an electoral defeat on 13 March due to its own mistakes. He, nevertheless, thanked the government and Congress for "their gesture of admitting that the peace process, which has not yet concluded, and although it produced a Constitution, had a high cost of about 400 dead." He, however, pointed out that the Congress, with the same disposition with which it proposed the application of provisional Article 12 of the Constitution, should consider the possibility of giving to the opposition some watchdog organizations (Office of the Attorney General or Office of the Comptroller General)," because it is not logical for the traditional parties, which are the ones that govern, to supervise themselves. The government minister said the position assumed toward the Senate proposal in no way affects a political agreement that was just signed with the Socialist Renewal Movement [CRS]. The CRS secured two seats in the Chamber of Representatives and the government will soon make them available.
