When they took to the streets, they did so not merely to express the aching grief they felt from the murder of their brothers but also to throw stones, assault Jews, and inflict heavy losses--by setting fire to houses, parking lots, and cars. Some acted with loud calls for "Death to the Jews," which, for some odd reason, were "overlooked" by Israel's state-run media. Security forces, including police and border patrol troops, spent long hours battling mobs of rioting Arabs even as Israeli leftists attempted to rationalize them as "a display of emotions" while openly stating their approval of what happened. The Arabs of Israel, residents of the state of Israel, have never expressed anger at or disapproval of the murder of Jews. That may be their right. But they were obliged to restrain themselves this time and not riot so wildly that it is almost impossible to remember anything like it since the founding of the state. That applies especially to the Arabs of Jaffe, who led the disturbances, spurned calls from the police commanders and the mayor, Roni Milo, and ran amok; they even threw tear-gas canisters at police officers, not to mention rocks and other dangerous objects. These are the same Arabs to whom the Jewish community in Philadelphia, USA, has donated large sums for the restoration of their youth clubs and renovation of their homes as part of Project "Neighborhood Renewal." Their brothers in Arab nations did not do that. Like them, the Arabs of Nazareth and Ramalla, Tira and Taibe, like the entire Arab area of the Galilee, in the Triangle and in Wadi 'Ara, many would have rejoiced at killing Jews if they had not been contained by the Israeli Police, whose members, as in Jaffe, for example, did not always display the necessary degree of force. It has always been necessary to deal with the Arabs of Israel with a policy of "respect but beware them." Some have argued that they constitute Israel's "soft underbelly." Others complain about the presence of a "fifth column" among a portion of Israel's Arabs. The recent riots have strengthened that suspicion to some extent. Indeed, people have long suspected stores of arms and secret "firing practices" usually conducted at night, in dry river beds and hidden caves, as preparation for the "appointed day." Are we gathering information about these secret organizations? Has anyone, for example, looked into the complaints made by residents of "Mi 'Ami," a settlement in Wadi 'Ara, about bullets whizzing past their homes and shots fired at night, frequently outside the nearby town of Um al-Fahm? Are we waiting for the day when these Arabs will go out not only to exhibit their rage but also to attack Jews out of obviously nationalist motivations? And how, as a general matter, would the Arab-Israeli street view a future possible war? Such a tragic event as occurred in the Cave of the Patriarchs was exploited by the Arabs of Israel in an extreme, dangerous, and outrageous way. That now requires a thorough and fundamental examination of how to treat the Arabs of Israel.
