According to local officials, over the past few years various items of economic co-operations have generated an additional output value of 23.4 billion yuan for the province, which has netted an extra 3.1 billion yuan of profits and taxes from such efforts. The province now has more than 300 economic co-operation organizations or agencies of various kinds which are scattered across the country and have launched over 60,000 projects of economic co-operation, involving a total investment of 17.38 billion yuan. Economic co-operation organizations have changed the past practice of goods exchange into the establishment of regional or trans-regional markets and specialized networks, all resulting in the enlivening of commodity collection and distribution. Take the grand economic co-operation zone involving 38 counties and cities in Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan and Guizhou Provinces as an example. Last year, this zone carried out co-operation projects, and lent and borrowed money worth more than 300 million yuan, while forming conglomerates to produce and market industrial products, tea and tung oil, which sell well in many foreign countries. At the same time, different localities in the province have taken the initiative and set out to collect market information, promote the marketing of products and launch investment promotion events. Last year Hubei established more than 50 economic co-operation agencies in coastal and economically-developed areas. These agencies have promoted the establishment of 40 foreign-funded enterprises in the province.
