This makes a total of six bodyguards who have been interrogated and placed under provisional arrest. Bodyguards Jose Marino Medina Alvarez and Arnoldo Enrique Morales Montes were interrogated on the morning of 23 February, after which they were notified of their provisional arrests and then transferred to La Granja on km 14 of the road to Masaya. Coinciding with previous depositions given by four bodyguards, both Medina and Morales said that on 28 October 1990 at approximately 1400 they left Las Colinas in a Renegado jeep and two white Toyota Cressidas and went to the General Command, returning to Military Complex 003 located at Gen. Ortega's residence at approximately 1800. Nothing Abnormal on the Day of the Incident Marino Medina said the EPS chief's caravan uses a silver Renegado jeep and that the day of the incident everything was normal when they left: "There was nothing abnormal." In answering a question from the prosecutor, Medina said that the bodyguards "only fire if they are attacked first. We have never fired at a suspect," he stressed. Meanwhile, Morales Montes did not provide any new information and only reiterated what the other five bodyguards who were interrogated before him had said. Mario Barahona Portocarrero, the defense lawyer for four of the bodyguards, said on 23 February that the arrest warrant issued for the bodyguards contained "serious flaws." For instance, "we have not yet seen a witness who can identify them or truly prove their participation in the action." Prosecutor Daniel Olivas, however, claims he has "the necessary evidence" to prove the bodyguards are guilty. "The empty cartridges belong to their rifles, and there was a Bengal light which is only used by them," he stressed. Olivas said that the bodyguards' weapons were not confiscated immediately after the crime but several days later, and "now the rifles have disappeared," which could mean that they were intentionally hidden. In that regard, Barahona said that investigations "established that the empty cartridges were from AK rifles, but the report never said that the shots were fired by Gen. Ortega's bodyguards." The Rifles Were Not Fired "The rifles were never fired," Barahona said, adding that "the forensic experts did not find traces of gunpowder in the bodyguard's rifles." Barahona gave little importance to the investigation conducted by a Venezuelan mission in 1990, "because from the beginning they started accusing Gen. Ortega's bodyguards without considering other possibilities. They did not come here to investigate but to accuse," he noted. Military Prosecutor Lester Gallo Sandoval said that no further actions have been scheduled since the two bodyguards' depositions because no requests have been received from the plaintiff's side. He added that it is possible that the case could be resolved in the next 10 days, when he should have enough material to reach the necessary conclusions. He added that he will summon all the witnesses in order to have more evidence to work with when passing judgment. At the end of the hearing Raymond Genie insisted on disqualifying the military court and the Supreme Court of Justice's decision to transfer the case to that court. In a document presented at noon on 23 February, Genie referred to the sentence issued on 31 January 1993 by Judge Boanerges Ojeda ordering the "provisional arrest of the soldier or soldiers implicated in the case" and in which Gen. Ortega and Captains Jose Orozco Pavon and Lorenzo Martin Romero Betanco were mentioned as "concealers." Based on that sentence Genie requested that provisional arrest warrants be issued for the presumed "concealers" Judge Ojeda mentioned in his sentence.
