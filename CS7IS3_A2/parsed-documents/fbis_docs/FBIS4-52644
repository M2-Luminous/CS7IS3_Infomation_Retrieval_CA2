This could materialize if speculations about an impending amendment to the less than a year old national constitution is executed. Senior government ministers who demanded anonymity said: "Both senior members of the Royal Government, the FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] and the CPP [Cambodian People's Party] have reportedly agreed to such a move." "The amendment will see His Majesty assuming full powers under a wide ranging decree for a limited period of time." "This is designed to give King Sihanouk, on behalf of the beleaguered Royal Government, some measures of respectability to come out with concrete solutions to the numerous problems currently faced." "The Royal Government, as widely suspected, is unable to solve the many problems such as social unrest and instability because of Khmer rouge elements and defeats at their hands, as well as lack of numerous visible developments and progresses." "This move seems to be the only way to restore the credibility of the Royal Government and the Kingdom of Cambodia. His Majesty is the only one capable of restoring peace, prosperity and stability to this nation." "As such, the members of the National Assembly, when called upon to vote for their amendments are bound to say yes as they too want to see continued peace and the restoration of stability." "His Majesty Sihanouk will bring back a semblance of order to this nation and this will also suppress the internal feuding among members of both parties amongst themself as well as with each other," the officials said. Foreign diplomats, although sceptical of such a wide sweeping move, are nevertheless convinced that the amendments, if raised and passed, will indeed see an introduction fresh ideas from a stateman and a political leader who has survived and persisted throughout the turmoil. "The King seems convinced that the Khmer Rouge issue should be resolved through peaceful negotiations although he supports the military action by the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces." "The Kingdom of Cambodia needs the services of His Majesty and the co-Premiers should not feel belittled by the move to give the King full powers, as it could be only for a limited period of time and not eternal," the diplomats said. The King has reportedly delivered stinging criticism to the Royal Government for its reported inability to resolve issues which have been arising of late, including the seemingly rampant insecurity and instability, even within the city here. However, some other senior ministers although confirming such speculations, has cast doubts as to whether it will be passed by the National Assembly, let alone get sufficient support.
