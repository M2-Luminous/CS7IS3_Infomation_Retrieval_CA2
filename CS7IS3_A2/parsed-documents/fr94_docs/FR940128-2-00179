FR940128-2-00179 FR940128-2-00117 DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Employment and Training Administration Job Corps: Finding of No Significant Impact for the Relocation of the Detroit Job Corps Center in Detroit, MI Pursuant to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations (40 CFR part 1500 to 1508) implementing procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration, Office of Job Corps, in accordance with 29 CFR 11.11(d), gives notice that an Environmental Assessment (EA) has been prepared and the proposed plans for the relocation of the Detroit Job Corps Center in Detroit, Michigan, will have no significant environmental impact. The proposed site, located in the area of 1800 Tuxedo Street, Detroit, Michigan, is comprised of 13.9 acres, and is made up of three parcels, which are designated A, B, and C for reference purposes. Parcel A is comprised of 6 vacant lots (totaling 0.87 acre), located on Webb Street between 12th Street and Woodrow Wilson Boulevard; Parcel B is a 3.2 acre vacant lot located between the John C. Lodge Freeway and Woodrow Wilson Boulevard, just south of Elmhurst. Parcel C, comprised of 9.83 acres (currently utilized as a community-oriented outpatient health-care facility) has several structures: a main building constructed in 1935; three additions built between 1960 and 1972, and two auxiliary buildings built in 1966. The campus includes paved asphalt parking lots, concrete sidewalks, and a well maintained lawn with trees and vegetation. A 6-foot chain link fence, topped with barbed wire, surrounds the perimeter of Parcel C. Within the buildings there are operating and treatment rooms, a dining hall served by vending machines, a library, conference rooms, an optical laboratory, an emergency room suite, a gift shop, a pharmacy, auxiliary spaces, and administrative space converted from patient rooms. The purpose of the proposed action is to convert the Metropolitan Hospital into the Detroit Job Corps Center for 320 resident and 50 non-resident students. The original patient hospital is adaptable to dormitory accommodations and offers the necessary facilities for the Job Corps program to provide basic education, vocational skills training, work experience, counseling, health care, and related support services. This new center will provide dormitories, recreational, medical/dental, administrative services, educational and vocational training, and storage space that is consistent with Job Corps guidelines and center needs. Establishing a Job Corps Center at this location will require some constructive change to existing buildings. To meet recreational needs, based on the Job Corps prototype for recreational activities, some construction is needed; e.g., a recreational building, a new ball field to be constructed on Parcel B, outdoor basketball courts on existing parking areas, and modification of the existing fencing to extend completely around all three parcels. The proposed project will be constructed in accordance with local fire, building, and zoning code requirements and will not adversely impact the City of Detroit police, fire or emergency services. The site is located in an urban setting and is currently zoned R6 (high-density multiple-family residential); however, over the years residential occupancy has declined substantially. Prior to proceeding with the acquisition of the Metropolitan Hospital, the Department of Labor secured a letter from the City Planning Office and Community & Economic Development Department that states that the proposed Job Corps Center is an allowable use under the existing zoning, thus, no zoning conflict will result from the proposed change in occupancy and rehabilitation of the former Metropolitan Hospital. The site is bordered on the east by an expressway. The northern boundary is occupied by some multi-dwelling structures, commercial business, and a store-front type church facility. The western boundary is comprised of a soup kitchen, a bible missionary center, vacant lots, vacant store fronts, and a large medical supply company. The southern border includes minimal residential dwellings, a nursing home, a foster-care center for children, and an apartment building for teenage mothers. The portion of the site identified as Parcel B (which is presently owned by the State of Michigan but will be transferred to the City of Detroit in the first quarter of 1994) is vacant land and is presently used for illegal dumping of waste, vehicle tires, roofing and building materials, concrete, and miscellaneous rubbish. It is unknown whether an abandoned underground storage tank, identified as present on this parcel, has been properly closed. In addition, an underground tunnel is known to exist at the site but its closure status is not known. Based on the Environmental Assessment, it has been determined that neither of these site conditions will adversely impact the proposed activities. Conversion of this part of the site to the Detroit Job Corps Center through environmental restoration would be a positive asset to the area and would alleviate the State or City of Detroit of a substantial burden and liability.
