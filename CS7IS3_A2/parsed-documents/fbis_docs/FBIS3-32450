FBIS3-32450 "drlat026_r_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-026 Document Type:Daily Report 8 Feb 1994 Peru Police, Agents Evaluate PA0702140594 Lima Panamericana Television Network in Spanish 1240 GMT 7 Feb 94 PA0702140594 Lima Panamericana Television Network Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [From the "Good Morning Peru" newscast] [Text] Policemen and Special Services Unit agents are still at the site of the explosion evaluating the situation, trying to determine the exact amount of explosives that were used for the car bomb and assessing the resultant damage. The bodies of the two newspaper and magazine distributors who were killed are still at Air Force Headquarters. They were in a light blue Datsun which bore license plates SG-6691. I am going to speak with individuals who live across from the Air Force installations to see the condition of their homes, to ask them what they observed and how it was possible for a car bomb to explode at the headquarters. Certain residents have already informed us the explosion was possible, because at exactly 0600 the Air Force opens the street to allow vehicles to circulate freely in the area, and the subversives took advantage of that opportunity to place the car bomb. [Madrid EFE in Spanish at 1314 GMT on 7 February carries a 150-word report on the incident which adds: "The explosion took place on `8 July' Avenue, Santa Beatriz District. Broken glass injured an undisclosed number of pedestrians as well as individuals who were inside their homes. The explosion also damaged a bank, the Peruvian Telephone Company, and several homes. The police have made no disclosures regarding the possible perpetrators of the attack. The vehicle used for the car bomb has been described only as a Datsun."]
