The government of Moscow notes that as a whole the tasks defined by the program for 1993 were resolved successfully. The main systems of the city administration worked in a stable manner (power industry, transport, water supply, and housing and municipal services). Sufficiently high investment activity and volume of housing and social-cultural construction were continued in the city. Housing area input totaled 3 million square meters, and 25 schools, two elementary class units, 27 kindergartens, 15 polyclinics, and five hospital buildings were put into operation, 68 stores and 218 public catering establishments were built and have started to function, 12 hothouses were put into operation in the sovkhoz of the Moscow Soviet, the Palace of Justice building was built, and the crackers plant was put into operation. Moscow celebrated Victory Day on Poklonnaya Hill, where the first section of the memorial complex was built. The Kazanskiy Cathedral was reconstructed on Red Square in 1993. Construction began on the center of the city, where more than 800,000 square meters of buildings were put into operation. The volume of capital repair of roads, which totaled 18.5 million square meters, was overfulfilled by 23.3 percent. Major repairs were accomplished on 2.0 million square meters of living space, and the volume of construction and reconstruction of engineering networks increased. Social protection of Muscovites was a subject of special attention on the part of the Government of Moscow. In accordance with a special purpose program, various types of social assistance were provided to 3,614,500 persons. This is every third Muscovite. On the whole in the last year more than 92 billion rubles [R] was expended for these purposes (of this amount, R62 billion came from the budgetary resources of the city). The largest sums were directed to differential supplementary pension payments to nonworking pensioners--R25 billion, and to food subsidies for pupils of grades 1-11 at Moscow schools--R15 billion. During the year, expenditures on the conduct of sanitary measures with children increased substantially in comparison with the initial proposals, totaling more than R7 billion. Assistance unprecedented in scale was rendered in 1993 to organs of internal affairs. More than R45 billion and $8 million were expended on reinforcing the material base of the militia and fitting it out with modern equipment. Thirty-seven facilities were built, including 21 militia offices, which makes it possible to require that personnel of the GUVD [Main Administration of Internal Affairs] make qualitative changes regarding the fight against crime and control over public order. Economic reforms were conducted more actively than in 1992. The share of nonstate enterprises at present totals more than 85 percent in trade turnover and motor vehicle freight shipments, in construction--more than 90 percent, and in industrial production--50 percent. With all the complexities of the budgetary-financial situation, the Government of Moscow financed all the measures planned in the 1993 program. II. The conditions for the development of the economy of the city and the functioning of city services will be more complicated in 1994. The economic crisis and drop in production continue, and inflation is being maintained at a high rate. However, the Government of Moscow believes that the city has a stable system of administration, resources, and reserves for continuing and developing positive trends, stabilizing the city's economy, and resolving worthwhile socioeconomic tasks. The measures outlined by the program of the government of Moscow for 1994 are directed to this end. III. In the social sphere, the government intends: --to develop the system existing in the city for social support of the low income strata of the population by indexing, in accordance with inflation, the scales of allowances for pensioners, students, and children, and subsidies for food and medicine in schools, preschool institutions, and hospitals. It is planned to increase the share of the budget allocated for these purposes by a factor of 1.5; --to assign 1.3 million square meters of housing area in new home construction sites for the free improvement of housing conditions for those on waiting lists in prefectures and the city administration; --starting 1 January 1994, to begin the conversion of city health services to the principles of budgetary-insurance medicine on the basis of the medical insurance fund established in 1993. At the same time, to increase expenditures on the maintenance of medical institutions. --to develop the projected trend in reducing the gap in the wages of workers in public education, health services, and other branches of the city economy; --to continue the policy on rendering financial support to cultural institutions and also implement a program for the restoration and reconstruction of the Bolshoy Theater, the State Fine Arts Museum, the Russian State Library, the Tretyakovskaya Gallery, and the Victory Monument on Poklonnaya Hill; --to render every kind of support to law enforcement organs in the fight against crime and continue implementation of the program for the development of their material base and technical equipping; --despite the significant increase in expenditures and reductions in budget capabilities, to continue subsidizing a large part of the costs of the operation of the housing fund, passenger transport, and municipal services. IV. In the investment complex, provision is made to ensure continuation of the scope of housing construction and also social facilities and engineering infrastructure associated with it. Three million square meters of housing area, 20 schools, 25 kindergartens, 11 polyclinics, and three hospital buildings will be built. Work will be continued on reconstruction of the center of the city, where it is planned to erect a building with a total area of 1.5 million square meters, including 200,000 square meters of residences. It is planned to continue reconstruction of the buildings of the Moscow Kremlin, construction of a business center on Stankevich Street, reconstruction of Manezhe Square and buildings of the Manege with the organization of an underground space, a multifunctional business center on Tverskaya-Yamskaya Street, and reconstruction of Stoleshnik Lane and zoo facilities. Construction will be continued on new subway lines. In the first half of the year, the Bibirevo-Altufyevskaya line will be put into operation, and construction of the Lublinskaya and Mitinskaya lines will be accelerated. For the purpose of increasing the amount of telephone numbers and improving the quality of telephone communications, it is planned to build four ATS [automatic telephone exchange] buildings in the Central, Southeastern, Western, and Southwestern administrative districts. To finance the investment program under conditions of an acute shortage of budgetary resources the government intends to expand the use of nonbudgetary sources. For these purposes there will be continuation of the practice of selling at investment auctions parts of newly built housing areas, "unfinished" sites, and also trade and everyday service facilities whose construction has been completed. For the purpose of reducing the periods and lowering the cost of housing construction, competitions will be conducted between contracting organizations for the right to perform the work. The government is actively starting to implement the concepts of the administrative districts to replace obsolete housing assets at the expense of investor resources, first of all five-story buildings. V. The government believes that an increase in the reliability of the life support systems of the city is the paramount task of municipal services. For this purpose, it is planned: --to increase the volume of major housing repairs and complete up to 2.5 million square meters (including 0.5 at the expense of investor resources); --to increase the volume of major and routine road repairs, and to complete up to 20 million square meters; --to conduct repair, reorganization, and reconstruction of engineering networks: heating system--350 kilometers central heating centers--300 units waterline system--89 kilometers sewer system--93 kilometers gas system--100 kilometers streetcar lines--70 kilometers --to acquire not less than 680 units of rolling stock for the system of overland passenger service. In the consumer market sphere the government plans to support the ongoing system of providing incentives for delivery of basic food products to the city, to strengthen direct ties with regional producers of agricultural products, and to switch to a system of contracts with wholesale suppliers of foodstuffs. Through its tax, credit, and investment policy, the government intends to promote stabilization and a reduction in Moscow's industrial slump. The food industry, the production of building materials and building structures, and the production of consumer goods will remain priorities. Economic incentives will be implemented to attract nonstate investors to these branches. The fund for support of small business will be used to stimulate small business, first and foremost that which produces goods and services for the population. It is planned to continue implementation of the city program "Conversion," shifting emphasis to financing the preparation of production of machines and instruments developed in the defense complex of the city of Moscow for municipal services. VI. The government will strive in 1994 to make changes in the conditions of privatization of state enterprises so that privatization will promote an increase in the efficiency of production, improvement in the efficiency of services to the population, and attraction of additional resources for stabilization of the economy and the reconstruction of production. The Government of Moscow also intends to actively use its right to retain for itself part of the package of shares of stock (including "gold" shares) of enterprises being privatized that are most important to the city. In the sphere of lease relations and land payments, a complex of measures has been outlined to increase the profitability of these budget articles. In the sphere of tax policy and the budget process, it is planned to prepare a number of legislative initiatives aimed at reducing taxes on profits and increasing taxes on real estate and resources, and also at achieving more just proportions of distribution of city and federal incomes and expenditures. In the sphere of improving administration, it is planned to continue the policy for further optimization of the distribution of functions between city and territorial organs of administration for the purpose of reducing the share of administrative decisions on the part of the government. It is planned to develop and conduct measures for the development of local public self-government. VII. In adopting this program, the Government of Moscow believes that in the course of its implementation there must be a continuous search for reserves to improve city development indicators, first and foremost in the resolution of social tasks. The Government of Moscow, realizing that successful implementation of the program in many ways depends on the formation of the income part of the city budget, calls on the Government of Russia to make decisions within its power on immediate support of the economy of Moscow through deductions from taxes being paid by administrative systems on the territory of the city and also payment in full of subventions for the performance of capital functions. Taking into account the preparations for the celebration of the 850th anniversary of Moscow, a special program has been adopted as a supplement to the government's annual program. In the interests of the prosperity of the capital of Russia--Moscow--and the well-being of its residents, and in the interests of social peace, the Government of Moscow calls on trade union organizations and social movements, political parties and blocs, entrepreneurs--everyone who holds a position of creativity and stability in society--to cooperate.
