The newspaper said in an editorial in today's issue that Egypt has relations of friendship and cooperation with the countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea and the Arab, Islamic, and European countries equally. The newspaper adds: If we are aspiring to modern, civilized ties among the countries of the Mediterranean Sea basin that will restore to this region its significance and historical value to the whole world, it is only natural for Egypt to want to form a new kind of relations of cooperation with Turkey--relations that befit Egypt's position and history with Turkey since the latter is undeniably an Islamic country linked to Europe by special ties. The newspaper stressed Egypt's efforts to establish peace in the Middle East. It also stressed Egypt's efforts to forge relations of cooperation and friendship with the countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea and normal and strong relations with the big powers in the northern half of the hemisphere. The newspaper believes Egypt's present and future interests are the ultimate objective of the national leadership's every effort, regardless of the interconnected fronts and national working policies. Mubarak's visit to Turkey is a short one, but a visit that serves the long-term and grand objectives.
