In 1993, the country transferred a net of $1.744 billion to the two institutions, of which $1.467 billion was to the IRDB alone. These transfers represent what the country had to pay in interest and servicing of the debt in exchange for what it received in disbursements by the two organizations. In the case of the IRDB, the situation is worse because its yearly disbursement to Brazil decreased from the already low level of $800 million at the end of the 1980's to about $500 million the IRDB has been disbursing annually since 1992. In 1993, the IRDB disbursed only $471 million to Brazil and received $1.318 billion in debt service and $620 million in interest. The value of the new loans also is decreasing. From the $1.344 billion the IRDB granted Brazil in 1992, the amount dropped almost 50 percent in 1993 and totaled only $636 million. As for the IDB, the loans decreased from $1.117 billion to $514 million. All sorts of problems help explain the deterioration of our relations with these organizations. Brazil has no resources to offer as compensation for these loans, the projects' management is ineffective, there is a lack of continuity in the projects' domestic administration, and there are bureaucratic difficulties that delay the flow of resources.
