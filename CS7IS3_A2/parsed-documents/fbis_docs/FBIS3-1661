When talking about the White Paper -- "Representative Government in Hong Kong" -- he pointed out: The British side's "White Paper" asserts that it explains the process of the Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's institutional structure, but it actually distorts the facts and juggles black and white. Despite all this, people may discover from the White Paper that during the talks the British side repeatedly and seriously interfered in China's internal affairs, with the aim of achieving its inglorious purpose of undermining the talks. It Asked for Discussions on Candidates for the Preparatory Committee This member cited an example by saying: The British side said that during the first stage of the talks, it sought three guarantees from the Chinese side. What were these three guarantees? First, the British side asked the Chinese side to guarantee that both sides would discuss the candidates for the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR]. As everyone is aware, the Preparatory Committee is a special organization formed by the National People's Congress [NPC] for the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR in 1997. How can the formation of this organization be discussed by the Chinese and British sides? Is this not brazenly interfering in China's internal affairs? The British side took the Airport Advisory Commission for comparison. These two issues cannot be compared at all. He added: As we all know, Hong Kong's new airport project will straddle 1997 and involve the SAR's interests. Therefore the British side must consult with the Chinese side on this issue. The formation of the Airport Advisory Commission was raised by the Chinese side, the purpose being to obtain the Hong Kong people's participation and supervision. This member continued: If the construction of the new airport could have been completed before 1997, the Chinese side would not have interfered in this matter, which is Hong Kong's internal affair. Since this project straddles 1997 and requires the SAR to undertake responsibility, it is a matter of course for the Chinese and British sides to consult the candidates for the Airport Advisory Commission. The British side asked the Chinese side for consultations on a matter that cannot be compared with the appointment of candidates for the Airport Advisory Commission and has absolutely nothing to do with British internal affairs after 1997. Obviously, the British side intentionally laid an ambush for the Sino-British talks so that the talks finally would break down. It Attempted To Participate in the Appointment of the Chief Executive Second, the British side asked the Chinese side to guarantee that it would support Hong Kong's general election in the year 2007. Obviously, this is interfering in China's internal affairs. The Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR, ratified by the NPC, provides explicit stipulations on the electoral system to be practiced by Hong Kong in the year 2007, and it also has formulated complete procedures selected and decided on by Hong Kong people. Obviously, this is an internal affair of the Hong Kong SAR. Even the central government cannot interfere in it. How could the British side ask the Chinese side to express its stand? If the Chinese side had expressed its stand, the central government might as well interfere in the SAR's internal affairs in the future. The central government absolutely will not interfere in anything within the SAR's autonomy, nor will it allow the British side to interfere in the SAR's internal affairs, or to determine the orientation and timetable of the SAR's future democratic development. All these should proceed according to the relevant provisions of the Basic Law. Third, the British side asked the Chinese side to guarantee that the electoral committee for the Hong Kong SAR's first chief executive would remain the same committee for the election of some members for the British Hong Kong Government's last Legislative Council in 1995. This is extremely ridiculous. The NPC already has provided a number of principled stipulations on the formation of the electoral committee for the Hong Kong SAR chief executive. The detailed provisions in this respect will be formulated by the SAR Preparatory Committee, which will be responsible for the formation of the electoral committee. The electoral committee will be established by the Preparatory Committee, and the person to be elected will be the chief executive of the Hong Kong SAR. What has it got to do with the British? What has it got to do with the electoral committee for the election of some members for the last not interfering in China's internal affairs? The British Side's Tricks Are Held in Contempt by the People This member said: After Jiang Enzhu provided a briefing on Hong Kong's 1995 electoral arrangements, many members strongly hoped that the details of the talks could be published so that the Hong Kong people would know the truth. In the meantime, they greatly despised the British side for brazenly announcing the details of the talks in the form of a white paper. This member said that many members have understood the following point after the British side's publication of the White Paper: The British side had no intention at all of reaching an agreement through negotiations. From the very beginning, it placed obstacles and laid an ambush for the talks so they would fail in the end, and it prepared excuses so it could blame the Chinese side when the talks broke down. From the several examples we have cited above, we know that the British side even resorted to interfering in others' internal affairs in undermining the talks -- a most despicable practice in international relations. Is it not all too clear where lies its sincerity on the question of maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity, stability, and smooth transition?
