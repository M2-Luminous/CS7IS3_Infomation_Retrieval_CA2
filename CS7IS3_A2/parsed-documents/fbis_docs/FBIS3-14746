Unfortunately, the Geneva meeting [Georgian-Abkhaz talks held 22-25 February] ended without result. Even so, one important thing happened there. When there was talk about Abkhazia's status -- we should also make compromises -- the positions of our delegation, the Russian delegation, UN representatives, and our friends -- the United States, France, and Germany -- coincided. This is very important. It also emerged that separatism is what it is and that a different language would probably be necessary in talking to them. Not only at our level, but also at the Security Council, in Russia and elsewhere. This was very important as far as political settlement and political solution are concerned. By the way, speaking about status, we found Russia's Constitution and experience, as well as the world experience, rather useful. Anyway, the fact that our positions coincided gives us an opportunity to work more actively. To tell you the truth, what interests me most in my visit to the United States is to establish relations with the IMF, the World Bank and, especially, to visit the Security Council. I do not rule out the possibility that a Security Council meeting may be held on 8 or 9 March in which I will participate, provided we succeed in having this issue included in the agenda. Then, it is possible that the issue of peacekeeping forces will be decided.
