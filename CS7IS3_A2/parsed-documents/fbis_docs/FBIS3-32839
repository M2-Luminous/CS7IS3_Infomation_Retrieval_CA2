The Superintendency of Banks and Insurance, in complying with the general law on banking, financial, and insurance institutions and in accordance with its basic law, on 10 February has decided not to authorize the formalization of the Latin American Business Advisory Center, CLAE. 2. It is a known fact that the Superintendency of Banks and Insurance, considering the interests of CLAE investors, has shown a great deal of willingness and flexibility to facilitate the formalization of this enterprise. Nevertheless, this has not been possible due to serious irregularities, of which we will mention the main ones: A. Despite frequent requests from this Superintendency, the CLAE Board of Directors has not clearly explained the destination of the funds received from the public. In the information delivered to this Superintendency as of 31 December 1993, CLAE directors declared that approximately 90 percent of CLAE investments were placed in German government bonds issued between 1924 and 1930 [as heard]. According to CLAE directors, the value of those bonds was reportedly $308 million. CLAE directors have not been able to prove the ownership or authenticity of those bonds, or the way or means used to purchase them, the actual value paid for them, and other conditions. All the missing information, according to German government authorities, are absolutely necessary to confirm the authenticity of those bonds. In addition, CLAE directors have not been able to prove the legality and value of the other assets. The announced investments in lobster and asparagus production are only reported with a value under $800,000, and no evidence is provided of their capacity to generate income. B. CLAE directors have not presented irrefutable proof, as required by law, of the total amount of money they actually received from the public. On 29 April 1993, when they took control of CLAE, its directors reported that the amount received from the public was approximately $206 million. Afterward, on 31 December 1993, in a report sent to the Superintendency on diskettes, the amount reported was $454 million. In addition, that amount did not agree with the balance sheet presented that same day by CLAE directors, who have not explained the differences or supplied the necessary information on the credit accounts in order to directly confirm the amounts with its creditors. C. CLAE has not presented irrefutable evidence, as required by law, proving its real financial situation. Despite the facilities given by the Superintendency of Banks and Insurance, CLAE directors have not satisfactorily proven the real value of its assets and liabilities. Therefore, it has not been able to determine its exact financial situation. Based on the scant information supplied by its directors CLAE reportedly faces a loss surpassing $110 million, which technically and legally places the institution in an obvious bankruptcy situation. 3. In accordance with the law, the Superintendency of Banks and Insurance has issued instructions to its ad hoc attorney to report the situation to the judicial authorities in order to determine the responsibilities in the case. In the same manner, and also according to the law, it has asked the Supreme Court of Justice to order the closure of the Latin American Business Advisory Center, CLAE.
