FR941207-0-00012 FR941207-0-00002 A total of sixteen comments was received on this proposal. In response to the proposal to eliminate the FOB price from the end product data schedule, six commenters agreed that it should be removed from the regulations and four commenters stated that it should be retained. Commenters who supported the elimination of the FOB price stated that there is a great deal of confusion regarding what the FOB price represents. One commenter stated that FOB prices are misleading and believed it would be better to have a processor spell out the pricing mechanism as clearly as possible at the State contract level. Two commenters proposed eliminating all pricing information from the end product data schedule. One of these commenters stated that the FOB price causes confusion among recipient agencies and also reveals sensitive information to a company's competitors should they obtain copies of the end product data schedule. The other commenter stated that the FOB price is irrelevant and unauditable and there is no accurate means to compare price information on the end product data schedule to actual price paid by the recipient agency. This same commenter said that the majority of recipient agencies arrange for purchases through a bid process, and that the competitive market will control the costs. Additionally, this commenter stated that it would be better to eliminate the FOB price entirely and satisfy the audit trail through: 1) payment of a refund which reflects the contract value; 2) documentation that the distributor reduced the commercial price of the end product by the full contract value under the hybrid system; or 3) that the normal commercial price has been discounted by the full contract value for sales made under the direct discount system. Another commenter stated that only value pass-through information should be included on the end product data schedule and that full pricing information, such as delivered price, should be included as a separate attachment to the agreement. Three commenters supported the current requirement and indicated that delivery costs should also be identified on the end product data schedule. Two commenters recommended that FOB price and fee-for-service definitions should be clarified so that they are compatible. FCS is aware that pricing information supplied by processors often represents prices other than the FOB price. Many processors use delivered price to a State warehouse, highest price that can be charged to a recipient agency, delivered price to a recipient agency, etc. Based on this and the comments received, the Department believes that the requirement that FOB price be included as part of the State and NCP processing contracts should be eliminated. However, because the Department realizes that pricing information is very important to recipient agencies, the Department also believes that processors should provide any pricing information requested by the contracting agency, along with a thorough explanation of what this information represents. Regarding the proposal to place price and yield data on separate pages, four commenters were in favor of this idea and seven were opposed. Those in favor stated that a two-part system could result in reduced paperwork and that processors would not be required to submit new yield schedules for contract renewal or pricing changes. Another commenter stated that if preparing a separate sheet for yields will lead to a uniform commodity yield allowances and these are clearly related to end product, then the proposed changes may be desirable. That commenter further stated that the yield data should be cross-referenced on the end product data schedule. Those commenters opposed to the proposed requirement stated that placing price and yield data on separate pages doubles the paperwork required, not reduces it. Several commenters stated that most processors have end product data schedules computerized, so it would be easier and more efficient to create revised yield and pricing information on a single sheet. One commenter stated that the specific reference to a two-part form should be removed from the regulations, but its removal would not prevent the use of a two-part form if this is preferred by the processor and the distributing agency. Another commenter opposed the proposal to have yield and pricing information on separate pages of the contract and preferred to have the gross and net pricing columns eliminated from the current end product data schedule and leave the rest of the end product data schedule as it currently exists. The Department proposed placing pricing and yield data on separate pages because it was thought that this would eliminate the need to update all end product data schedules when changes become necessary. However, the Department finds the arguments made by the commenters opposed to the proposal persuasive, in that placing the information on separate pages would increase the workload and paperwork for processors and distributing agencies. Additionally, with the increased use of computer technology, it would be easier to update the end product data schedule rather than requiring separate pages. This final rule adopts ยง250.30(c)(4)(ii) of the proposed State processing regulations and ยง252.4(c)(1) of the proposed NCP regulations without change, except that the proposal to require that price and yield data be placed on separate pages is not incorporated into ยง250.30(c)(4)(ii) of the final rule.
