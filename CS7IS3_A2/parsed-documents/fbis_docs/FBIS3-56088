In particular, a treaty on the creation of a single economic area (all existing barriers will now be removed) and intergovernmental agreements on regional banks -- a foreign currency bank and a clearing bank -- were signed. These and other documents, as the two leaders pointed out at a news conference, are designed to ensure the free movement of goods, services, capital, and manpower, as well as the implementation of a concerted credit-clearing, budget, tax, price, customs, and currency policy between the two states. A special agreement records Uzbekistan's debts to Kazakhstan, amounting to more than $39 million, as a state credit. It is envisaged that this debt will be repaid this year by means of additional deliveries of natural gas, electricity, and textile products. Kazakhstan in turn will sell to its neighbor 2 million tonnes of grain, 600,000 tonnes of coal, and 260,000 tonnes of rolled metal, cast iron, ferroalloys, and refined copper.
