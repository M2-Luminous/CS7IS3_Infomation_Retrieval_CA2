Grigoryan: "`Azerbaijan Is Not Ready for Peace'"] [Text] May has been unusually rich in all kinds of peacemaking initiatives and meetings and documents on the Karabakh conflict. It is now clear to everyone that Russia has a firm grip on all the "reins" of the mediation process and is single-mindedly and methodically attempting to bring the parties to the common denominator that it has devised. It is just as obvious, however, that this process is proving extremely painful, and this is not surprising, considering the neglect and intricacy of the Karabakh knot. Many people called the last meeting in Moscow at the foreign minister level a most decisive step toward peace. It is as yet somewhat too early to be talking about peace, I believe; nonetheless, certain trends in the development of events may be traced quite clearly. At the paper's request, Larisa Alaverdyan, principal expert of the Special Artsakh Commission of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Armenia, expresses her viewpoint. We have witnessed one further latest stage of the peacemaking process on the Karabakh problem. There have been sufficient commentaries in the press in this connection, and everything has been said, it would seem. But, perusing the press, one odd circumstance may be observed: The process is described in highly positive terms, whereas it ended very unsuccessfully, to put it mildly. It is a question of the fact that we achieved recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh as a party to the conflict at quite a high price: First, Armenia also was, essentially, recognized as a "party," and, second, Azerbaijan, it transpires, no longer now recognizes itself a "party." Thus the situation concerning the subjects of the conflict is once again uncertain. Despite the well-known statement of Guliyev, head of the National Assembly, to the effect that it would appear to be time to recognize Nagorno-Karabakh as a party to the conflict if only to have "someone to hold to account," the mood in Azerbaijan has not changed one iota. It seems to me more important, therefore, to comment not on the document itself, which was never signed by Azerbaijan, but to view events from a somewhat different, but closely connected, viewpoint. For the peacemaking process to become a reality and for any agreement to be converted from paper into actual action the consent and readiness of all parties--recognized and unrecognized--are essential as preconditions. This is an entirely objective condition: They must all be ready for peace. Unfortunately, all that we are observing in Azerbaijan--the press, broadcasting, statements of officials, up to and including the largely strange fuss in the National Assembly apropos Bishkek--in a word, the political aura in this country and the atmosphere and ideology testify that Azerbaijan is not ready for peace. And this applies not only to the "top," what is more--a certain stratum in society that shares in their entirety the views of political leaders is emerging. Azerbaijan was formerly not ready for any compromise even while part of the USSR, although there are more than 30 known instances of agreements having been achieved on issues identical to the level of the Karabakh conflict at that time. Nor was Azerbaijan ready for the start of the war, but started it. It is fitting to recall here, incidentally, that the war began under Mutalibov, with whom many people are today linking their hopes that with a change of regime in Baku there will be change in policy also. Now, however, this country is not ready for peace. It has regretfully to be stated that all that is happening currently on the Karabakh front is merely a precursor of a big war, plans for which are, evidently, being hatched by Azerbaijan's political leadership. Only a radical change not only of the leader but of the entire leading stratum and a change in official ideology could give us hope of peace. Otherwise, it will be difficult to hope for anything, however zealously we express our aspiration for peace negotiations and a readiness to sign any document. Yes, there are in these documents clauses that are unacceptable to Armenia also, about which the speaker of the Armenian parliament has spoken, incidentally, but what is important is the actual will and readiness for peace. It should be considered that the peacemaking process is quite lengthy and entirely allows of all possible kinds of adjustments in the course of the negotiations. It has to be said in connection with all this that many of us linked certain hopes with the formation in Azerbaijan of a civil society. But, unfortunately, there has been no particular success in the plane of systematic and stable contacts of the public of this country with representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia, which is being drawn so actively into a resolution of the conflict, and perhaps we also share some of the blame for this. The shoots of such contacts have simply remained in embryonic state. I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to representatives of political parties and grassroots organizations of all three republics: If the political leadership is incapable of commencing a search for a practicable path toward peace, perhaps it would be easier to do this "from the bottom." Many organizations in Armenia are today prepared for contacts and dialogue with their counterparts in Azerbaijan, and, in my view, the state structures that are involved in external relations should be giving thought to a strengthening of relations between the civil society of Azerbaijan, the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, and Armenia.
