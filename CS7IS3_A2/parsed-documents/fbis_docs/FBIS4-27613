The two countries have agreed to include telecommunications as a "cooperation sector" in Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. A Japan-U.S. roundtable on telecommunications policy may be set up in September to start work on standardizing advanced communications and broadcasting systems and equipment. There have been forums at the governmental level on this subject between Europe and the United States, or between Japan and Europe -- for instance, the "Japan-Europe Telecommunications Forum" -- since the beginning of the 1990's. The start of the planned consultations between Japan and the United States will practically expand international cooperation in telecommunications into a trilateral framework. The "cooperation sectors" in the framework talks, unlike the sector-by-sector negotiations which deal with bilateral economic friction, refer to sectors where the two countries will promote cooperation from a global perspective. This includes such issues as environment and population, and telecommunications has been included as one sector under commercial technology. A concrete step in bilateral telecommunications cooperation is the standardization of next-generation communications and broadcasting systems and equipment. The two countries are presently working on a number of large-scale projects to build next-generation communications networks, including the Global Information Infrastructure (GII), the National Information Infrastructure (NII) of the United States, domestic networks for Japan, and the Asian Information Infrastructure (AII). Standardizing systems and equipment used in these projects will facilitate mutual participation of companies from both countries and prevent bilateral friction. Furthermore, standardization of equipment will enable mass production to cut costs, and will give the two countries a technological advantage in similar projects in other regions. In discussions on communications cooperation, the Ministries of Posts and Telecommunications and Foreign Affairs will be the government offices in charge on the Japanese side, while the Departments of Commerce and State, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and the Office of U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), and others will participate on the U.S. side. Telecommunications and broadcasting companies, and communications equipment makers will also be invited to participate when necessary. Cooperation in telecommunications was suggested by Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa to President Bill Clinton during the Japan-U.S. summit in April 1993, and the President agreed to the proposal. However, the United States postponed discussions due to the intensifying economic friction. The two countries now plan to begin preparatory meetings in early June, and hold the first official meeting around the time of the plenipotentiaries' meeting of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) in Kyoto from mid- September to early October. Since inauguration of the Clinton administration, the U.S. Government has given much emphasis to information policy. Apart from working on building a national information network under the NII program, it proposes building an international computer communications network under GII. On the other hand, the Japanese Government has proposed the AII program covering the Asian countries. It has started to invite Asian countries to get involved in this plan by sounding out the ROK government on possible participation in early May. Japan and the United States want to accelerate building the infrastructure for the multimedia age by promoting information policy coordination.
