"Those refugees that lost everything they had in Croatia and Bosnia should be settled in Kosova," he said, adding that "this should be carried out with a simultaneous expulsion of some 700,000 Albanians to Albania." He emphasized that "Mr. Rugova should no longer be allowed to live in Serbia, therefore he must be deported to his alternate mother country, Albania." A new citizenship law underway in the Serbian Parliament, he said, will enable this ethnic cleansing. Speaking on the deployment of Serbian army forces near the Albanian border and the presence of American troops in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], criminal-accused Arkan said "Serbs are never scared. [Word indistinct] will be cut off."
