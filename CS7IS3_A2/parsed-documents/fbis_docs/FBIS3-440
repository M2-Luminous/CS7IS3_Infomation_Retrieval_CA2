The Congolese president will hold talks with French President Francois Mitterrand and Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin. Before his departure, President Lissouba was a guest of "Africa Midday" progam, during which he took the opportunity to give details on his political initiatives and also on the setting up of a national union government which he says is a difficult task: [Begin Lissouba recording] I am willing to set up a union government, but people are still in possession of weapons. Imagine appointing someone who the representatives of the other factions disagree with. What would that minister do? Do you think he would be able to cross Bacongo, Diata, or other areas safely? It is not an easy task. I thought it would be possible and I tried to do it, but from the very start each member of government wanted a party government and not a national union government. However, a party government, which we experienced for about four to five months, was a mess. No minister was answerable to the head of government. I would summon some of them for a meeting, and they would not come. They would first seek advice from the leader of their party before answering to the invitation of the head of state. And you call this a national union government? No, this is not the case. Those who are dreaming of a party government will have to wait for a review of our Constitution, and we will do just that when the time comes. Believe me, we still have a long way to go. I come from the forest part of the country. I know that the growth of a tree is a slow process, but that should not prevent me from either felling that tree or immediately thinking of replacing it.
