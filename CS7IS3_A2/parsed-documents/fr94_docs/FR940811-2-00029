FR940811-2-00029 FR940811-2-00022 [Docket Nos. RP94&hyph;96&hyph;007 and RP94&hyph;213&hyph;003] CNG Transmission Corp.; Notice of Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff August 5, 1994. Take notice that on August 2, 1994, CNG Transmission Corporation (CNG), filed for inclusion in its FERC Gas Tariff, Second Revised Volume 1, the following tariff sheets: Sub. First Revised Sheet No. 31 2nd Sub. Alt. Third Revised Sheet No. 32 2nd Sub. Alt. Third Revised Sheet No. 33 First Revised Sheet No. 37 The proposed effective date of these tariff sheets is July 1, 1994. CNG states that these tariff sheets have been revised to correct inadvertent errors on sheets filed by CNG on June 30, 1994. CNG states that it has: corrected the rate for Wheeling Service on Sheet No. 31, to properly mirror CNG's IT rates; corrected the maximum volumetric surcharge for capacity release transactions, stated on Sheet Nos. 32 and 33, to include the Section 18 (Transition Cost Adjustment) surcharge; removed note 6 from Sheet Nos. 32 and 33, which had addressed CNG's proposed changes to gathering rates; and updated the surcharge applicable to incremental services set forth on Sheet No. 37, to reflect the proper differential from CNG's revised Part 284 rates. CNG states that copies of this letter of transmittal and enclosures are being mailed to CNG's customers and interested state commissions. Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commissions Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 CFR 385.211. All protests should be filed on or before August 12, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Linwood A. Watson, Jr., Acting Secretary.
