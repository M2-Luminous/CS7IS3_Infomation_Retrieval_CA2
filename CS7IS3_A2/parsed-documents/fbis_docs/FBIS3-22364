The method is a combination of compression, electromagnetic radiation, and thermal dissection. The owner of the process, Pieke Beheer in Eindhoven, is presently trying to find interested parties for an installation which can turn an annual 60,000 tonnes of chicken feces into a carboniferous end product. Artificial fossilization speeds up the conversion of organic materials into carbon, oil and gas. This conversion process can achieve in about an hour and a half what nature does in millions of years. This is achieved through a combination of existing techniques which have never been combined before. Pieke Beheer has patents for its process in Europe, Japan and the United States. Homogeneous One of Pieke Beheer's employees, engineer R. Eggink, worked together with the late W.J.H. Schippers on the development of the fossilization process. He believes that the procedure and the accompanying three-stage reactor can convert all organic materials into "Pieke Black", the patented name of the resulting carboniferous end product. "The best results are obtained with a homogeneous material such as chicken feces," according to Eggink. In a first stage, research was focused on the conversion of domestic waste. But because domestic waste consists of extremely varied components, preference was given to organic materials such as semi-liquid manure. The University of Amsterdam researched the conversion of chicken feces into Pieke Black. "The results were encouraging," says Eggink. From the various research projects it became apparent that the manure must have a dried consistency of at least 45 percent. In the Pieke process, the first stage is compression. A special press reduces the feces into vacuum blocks under high pressure (280 kilograms per square centimeter). During the second stage, an industrial microwave triggers off a biochemical reaction which is needed to start the disintegration process of the feces by means of bacteria. The blocks are sent in a continuous line through the tunnel-shaped microwave, and are exposed to microwaves at three points. In the microwave, the temperature rises to about 70 or 80 degrees Celsius. The evaporating moisture is sucked out and condensed. The third and last stage is the thermal dissection (gasification) of the feces. Before the organic material enters the reactor, it is crumbled into small pieces. The temperature of the reactor is first raised to 250 degrees, whereby a large part of the moisture evaporates. Then the dung is gasified at 480 degrees maximum. Any inorganic material in the feces is separated and collected into a special tube. The released gases are suitable for two applications; the production of electricity, or separation into oil and gas by means of condensation. Finally, following cooling (during which the temperature drops again to 20 degrees) the desired end product, Pieke Black, is obtained. Eggink says: "Tests have shown that our product is very suitable as a filling material in rubbers and various polymers." No Orders Yet It seems, according to Eggink's own feasibility study, that an installation with a capacity to treat 60,000 tons of chicken feces annually, divided over two production lines, has the best chance of success both technically and commercially. Such an installation would produce 20,000 tons of Pieke Black, with a value of 1,250 Netherlands guilders per tonne. The conversion costs are 850 guilders per tonne. According to Eggink, the energy balance of the procedure is also promising, in that the installation produces more energy than it consumes, although there are considerable internal differences for the applications mentioned. "The combination of our process with the dehydration of waste material gives a higher total yield than when electricity is produced with the remaining gases." According to Eggink, various authorities in Western Europe have shown interest in the Pieke Beheer process, though no orders have yet been placed. He is very confident, however, that orders will come: "Artificial fossilization is a valuable alternative to the present animal waste conversion installations."
