The proposed medium contains splenic autolysate with the addition of wheat bran protein hydrolysate, 0.0005 percent of twin 80, 0.0005 percent of twin 60, 0.0001 percent of thiourea and 0.001 percent of Ca[.sup]2+[/]. Cells of vaccine strain of Yersinia pestis that reproduce on this medium have high virulence and resistance to the lyophilization process.
