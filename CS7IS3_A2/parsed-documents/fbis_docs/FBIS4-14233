They discussed various issues of interest to bilateral relations. They also discussed developments in the situation in our country in light of the regrettable events at the 'Imran camp. The brother chairman expressed profound regret and sorrow for the chaste Yemeni blood spilled as result of the reckless practices of some irresponsible elements. He said these practices aim to implement hostile designs to push the situation toward a military explosion, to circumvent the pledge and accord document, and to drive the people and their Armed Forces into the furnace of bloody fighting in order to destroy unity. He stressed there is no alternative to unity, democracy, security, and stability, no matter what the price. He expressed appreciation for the U.S. friends' interest in our country's security and stability and for their support for unity and democracy.

The brother chairman stressed his eagerness to contain the situation and thwart all designs to stir up sedition and infighting among the children of the same homeland. He said dialogue and resorting to reason and wisdom are the only way to tackle all issues and problems. He expressed appreciation for France's efforts to support our country and its unity and democratization.
