FBIS4-6937 "dreas080__a94024" FBIS-EAS-94-080-A Daily Report 11 Mar 1994 ANNEX Japan Fair Trade Commission Criticized Fair Trade Commission Criticized Political Influence Cited 942A0088A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 11 Mar 94 p 5--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0088A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Unattributed article: "Coalition Era Is an Excellent Chance To Become Autonomous"] [Text] The autonomy of the Fair Trade Commission [FTC] is being questioned over the issue of the arrest of former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura, who is suspected of applying pressure in connection with the "Saitama Doyokai `dango' [bid-rigging by collusion] incident." Regarding Nakamura's repeated requests that the FTC withdraw its indictment, the FTC stresses that it rendered its judgment independently on the basis of "insufficient evidence." However, given the fact that the FTC was about to strengthen its enforcement of the Antimonopoly Law, some voices of apprehension are heard concerning a decline of its image. At a time when the United States is demanding stronger competitive measures and stepping up its criticism of Japan, attention is being focused on the FTC's role. Despite a Decline in Intervention "We politicians ourselves must seriously consider how to stop political intervention in public bidding." SDPJ [Social Democratic Party of Japan] Diet member Tatsuyo Matsumoto thus expressed her sentiment in listening to explanations concerning the public bidding policy offered by the FTC on 9 March to the coalition parties' project team on reform of the bidding system. Political intervention in public bidding could lead to political intervention of the FTC which tries to prosecute "dango." As a certain Diet member of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] insists, "We must eradicate the `dango society'"; the sense of crisis regarding the problem is growing within the coalition parties. According to FTC sources, in conjunction with the transfer of ruling power from the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] to the coalition parties, occasions for the FTC--which is moving toward a stronger antimonopoly policy--to receive political pressures are reportedly becoming extremely infrequent. It is said that "there has been virtually no opposition" regarding the recent policy which would certainly have encountered some reaction during the era of the LDP administration with the industrial circles as a backdrop, or during the on-the-spot inspection of the Shiseido Company on suspicion of obstructing discount sales. However, among the coalition parties is the beginning of a new trend to form Dietmen leagues by industries and to seek "vested interests." Although "destruction of the government-bureaucratic-industrial alignment" is the slogan of the Hosokawa administration, the possibility of renewed strong pressures toward the FTC cannot be ruled out if the coalition era lasts for a longer period. The FTC has steadily achieved results such as the prosecution of violations since the Japan-U.S. Structural Impediments Initiative talks (1989-1990) which advocated stronger enforcement of the Antimonopoly Law. However, a question remains as to whether it can respond adequately to the environmental changes. "Bitter Experiences" of the LDP Era A certain FTC veteran points out that he "suffered bitter experiences a number of times during the LDP era." For example, when it was decided to exempt certain items from the resale price system, some cosmetic and pharmaceutical items were reportedly left intact due to opposition by LDP welfare zoku Dietmen, although several studies were made for total abolition. In 1984, the policy on public bidding targeted the construction industry because of a "dango" incident (1982) among the construction contractors in Shizuoka Prefecture. The construction industry, alarmed by the prosecution of the violations, reportedly negotiated with the LDP construction "zoku" Dietmen, and the indictment was watered down to omit any clear reference to any violation of the law. Of course, regarding such an accusation, one member of the LDP construction subcommittee at the time declared emphatically as follows: "Unlike the United States, Japan does not have a climate of sheer competition. Setting aside decisions on the recipients of orders and bid prices, some form of coordination should be necessary. It is not wrong to hold a meeting for simple exchange of information." It is said that there was a time when such political pressure served as a function to revise the Antimonopoly Law. While the penalty for violations under the 1992 revision was raised from the previous maximum 5 million yen to 100 million yen, the FTC was considering a hike to several hundred million yen. A certain politician of the LDP Antimonopoly Law Investigation Committee, who learned about this, reportedly called an FTC executive and strongly demanded a change in policy. Professor Toshimasa Tsuruta of Senshu University, who serves as chairman of the FTC's distribution problems research group, makes the following appeal: "Although the FTC is trying its best to strengthen its prosecution administration, it has been the victim of politics under the LDP's 1955 system. Freedom from politics is now necessary." Short of a Criminal Indictment However, it is true that self-help efforts are demanded of the FTC itself. Dietman Tadashi Kuranari, who once served as chairman of the LDP Antimonopoly Law Investigation Committee, declares: "Indictments in the industry are often limited to minor cases. Why does it [FTC] not fight against such colossal evils as the general constractors scandal?" There have been construction "dango" incidents in Saitama, Yokosuka, and Shizuoka, but they have all fallen short of being criminally indicted. It has been cynically pointed out that, under the long rule of the LDP, the FTC has been "a watchdog that has been trained not to bite," rather than "a watchdog that does not bite" (an FTC veteran). Its true worth as an independent agency which is not trifled with will be demanded in the future.
