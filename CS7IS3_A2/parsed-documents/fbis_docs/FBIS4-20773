Opposition members in the Lok Sabha today launched a blistering attack against the Government, accusing it of "blindly aping the west" and being "insensitive" to the pressing problems, including unemployment and poverty, confronting the nation. Participating in the resumed debate on the motion of thanks on the President's address, Mr. Chandrajeet Yadav (JD) (Janata Dal) charged that by indiscriminately opening its doors to multinationals, the Congress Government had pushed the economy on the path of destruction. He said this had also drastically affected the public sector and the cottage industry, with lakhs of people facing the gloomy prospects of unemployment. The Janata Dal member said a "sense of uncertainty" prevailed throughout the country. The number of persons living below the poverty line had crossed 50 crores but little was being done to ameliorate their condition, he said. `IMF Dictating Policies' Mr. B.N. Reddy (CPI-M) (Communist Party of India-Marxist) attacked the Government for, what he called, bartering national interests, saying that the economic policy was being dictated by the IMF. The (CPI-M) member wanted the Government to come out more firmly to tackle Pakistan's continued support and encouragement to terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir. Mr. A. Charles (Cong-I) made a strong defence of the Government policies and said it was to the credit of the Prime Minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, who had managed to retrieve the economy which was in bad shape when the Congress(I) took over the reins of power. He complimented the Government for its handling of the Hazratbal crisis which, he said, had been praised both at home and abroad. Mr. D.D. Khanoria (BJP) (Bharatiya Janata Party) made a strong plea for Central assistance to Himachal Pradesh to promote development. `Credibility Restored' Dr. Ravi Mallu (Congress-I), supporting the motion, said the Government, under the Prime Ministership of Mr. Narasimha Rao, had restored the international credibility of the country as well as the economy. He said the President's address covered the various achievements of the Government and outlined the priority area of action in the coming years. Mr. Ramesh Chand Tomar (BJP), opposing the motion, described the President's address as "directionless" and said the Government should not go ahead with the implementation of the Dunkel proposals as they would severely affect the farm economics and farmers. He also criticised the Mulayam Sing Government of Uttar Pradesh, which, he said, was following casteist policies. Mr. Tomar also attacked the economic policies of the Government, saying that it would breed large scale unemployment. `Strategies Needed' Mr. Sharad Yadav (JD) said the Government should plan long term and short term strategies to meet the challenges facing the nation. He spoke of economic and social inequalities and said that unless the nation was rid of poverty, communalism and casteism, it could not face the threat to its integrity and solidarity. Mr. Yadav chided the Government for not responding adequately and immediately to the U.S. Government's provocative statements which had a bearing on the unity of the nation. Mr. Haradhan Roy (CPI-M) criticised the Government's liberalisation policy and said this would totally eliminate the indigenous industry, whether in the public or private sector. The status of India would be reduced to that of Hong Kong as the internal market would be flooded with foreign goods, he said. -- PTI
