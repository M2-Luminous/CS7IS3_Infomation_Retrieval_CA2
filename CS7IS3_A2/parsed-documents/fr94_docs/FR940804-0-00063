FR940804-0-00063 FR940804-0-00022 Lastly, the rule also provides that, following a SIP disapproval or a finding of failure to implement, if EPA proposes after both sanctions clocks have expired to fully or conditionally approve a plan or proposes to find that a State is implementing its SIP, application of the offset and highway sanctions is stayed unless and until EPA's proposed positive finding is reversed. The offset and highway sanctions reapply on the date EPA's preliminary determination is reversed. (This scenario is provided for in the rule at ยง52.31 (d)(2)(iii), (d)(3)(iii) and (d)(4)(iii).) The following discussion and Figure 5 provide an example of how this process functions for a SIP disapproval. The process functions the same for an initial finding of failure to implement. Suppose EPA disapproves a SIP, initiating the section 179 sanction process. Suppose that the State submits a revised SIP which EPA, at 25 months, proposes to fully or conditionally approve. The EPA would simultaneously issue an interim final rule, finding that the State has corrected the deficiency. In that case, the application of both sanctions would be stayed on the date of the positive action. Now suppose that, at month 30, EPA reverses its proposed positive finding. The reversal would be a proposal to disapprove the SIP in whole or in part or a final disapproval of the SIP in whole or in part. At month 30 (or, for final actions, on the action's effective date), both sanctions reapply. BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P E:GRAPHICSER04au94.004 BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;C
