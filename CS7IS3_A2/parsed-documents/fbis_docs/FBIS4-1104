The CSTC, one of the country's leading labor unions, signed the agreement, which has already been endorsed by four other labor unions, but expressed reservations about certain issues, especially that of civil servants' salary arrears. This agreement stipulates: A gradual reimbursement of nine months' salary arrears to civil servants, which will be converted into internal debts and; a social truce which will enable the government to implement the social and economic redress measures demanded by the International Monetary Fund. The agreement makes no mention of salary increases for the public or private sectors, the CSTC's main demand. The CSTC organized a "warning" strike from 5 to 7 April, demanding a 70 percent salary increase, but the strike was not followed. The CSTC also decided to join the ad hoc committee set up by the government and the four labor unions which had earlier signed the agreement. The committee will examine the government's economic adjustment measures, notably the privatization of part of public enterprises.
