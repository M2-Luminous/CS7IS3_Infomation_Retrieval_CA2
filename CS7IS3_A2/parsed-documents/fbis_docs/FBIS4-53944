Hata told the budget committee of the House of Representatives that the tax burden should be spread thinly and shouldered by as many people as possible in order to secure fiscal resources in the face of the rapidly aging society. He said the tax rate on consumption in Japan is the lowest among the 25 nations belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The remarks are the latest signal of the government's intention to boost the ratio of indirect tax in the taxation reform that the government has pledged to realize by the end of the year. The draft bills for the reform are scheduled to be compiled by the end of June. Hata also reiterated the next general election should be held under the new electoral system. A government panel is drawing up a new electoral map in line with the political reform law passed in January, which stipulates the replacement of the current multiseat constituencies with a system of combined single-seat constituencies and proportional representation. Hata, who leads the first minority government in four decades, has repeatedly dismissed opposition calls for snap polls under the old system to restore stable government. Over questions of the economic conditions, Yoshio Terasawa, Economic Planning Agency director general, said the nation's economy has yet to get back on a recovery path. Terasawa, while pointing to some bright signs, said the economy is by and large in a slump, with capital investments, corporate earnings and the employment picture remaining weak. Asked about his view on the political realignment, Hata said he is looking for a change to a bipolar political landscape with the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and a counteralliance as the two major players. He said the policy gap between the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan, SDPJ] and its partners in the ruling coalition under former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has narrowed through policy discussions. With the LDP being one major power, it is hoped that the two leading players will control the political scene, Hata said. The SDP walked out of the coalition after it was infuriated by the formation of a new Diet group by some coalition members without consulting the SDP.
