The first French forces are inside Rwanda, but the first mission that was due to be carried out today could not, in the end, go ahead. The first troops were due to enter Rwanda from Zaire to the south, to go to Cyangugu and set up a first protection zone. Here in Goma, on the Zairean side of the border, where the headquarters of Operation Turquoise have been set up, the soldiers now say they are ready for this mission. They are just waiting for the green light from Paris. This will probably be given tomorrow morning. Around 60 paratroopers and marine commandos will go to Cyangugu to protect Tutsi refugee camps. The Tutsis number some 8,000 in this region, under threat from the Hutu militias. This will be a first intervention to show the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] quite clearly that the French have come on a humanitarian mission. The soldiers will then try to expand their protection zone, but all this will take a lot of time. For now, Operation Turquoise is above all a logistical operation. Here in Goma, for example, only 150 men have actually arrived. Nicolas Poincare in Goma for France Inter. [end recording]
