Thorvald Stoltenberg, another co-chairman of the conference, is expected to arrive later. The two international mediators are scheduled to have talks with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev on Russia's participation in adopting political resolutions on the war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina, one of the six former Yugoslav republics. Before his departure from London, Lord Owen said Russia should not only take part in drawing a chart dividing Bosnia-Herzegovina and attend talks on lifting sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, but also join the adoption resolutions on what military actions should be carried out by the world community in this area, according to the ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY. On Tuesday, Kozyrev told a news conference: "I would strongly recommend the Serb side not to try patience of the international community." His deputy Vitaly Churkin said on Wednesday that "all Serbs (in Bosnia-Herzegovina) are on the brink of catastrophe, which may have grave consequences for the world." Moscow's recent tough statements on Bosnian Serbs should not be viewed as backtracking on its previous policy, Churkin said, adding that "if Serbs find strength to turn to peace," Russia will continue acting as a "channel of communication between Serbs and the world community."
