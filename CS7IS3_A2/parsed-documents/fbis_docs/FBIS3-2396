This is the first time that Wuhan city has withdrawn the business permits from joint ventures. The 26 companies were engaged -- or supposed to be -- in operations in food-stuffs, catering services, fashion, video tapes, medical instruments, car repairs and leather processing. Sources said that some of the shut-down joint ventures had not started operating even three or four years after they registered with the local administration for industry and commerce. Others had suspended trading for several years after some conflicts within the enterprises. A few of the enterprises even had no permanent location and had disappeared from the city. Sun Shiyu, director of Wuhan Foreign Investment Office, said that a few of the joint ventures failed to meet the demands of the market and their products could not be sold at home or abroad. He said that there were also some overseas businessmen who had no capital at all and ran their operations entirely by borrowing money from banks in the city. When the local banks refused to lend them loans, they failed in their attempts. Now Wuhan Foreign Investment Office and Wuhan Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce are jointly tightening up supervision of the operations of registered joint ventures so as to help overseas-funded enterprises to function normally.
