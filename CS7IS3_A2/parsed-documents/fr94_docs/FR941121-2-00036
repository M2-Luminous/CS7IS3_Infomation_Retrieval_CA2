FR941121-2-00036 FR941121-2-00029 [Docket No. RP95&hyph;1&hyph;001] Colorado Interstate Gas Co., Notice of Tariff Compliance Filing November 15, 1994. Take notice that on November 10, 1994, Colorado Interstate Gas Company (CIG), tendered for filing revised tariff sheets to its FERC Gas Tariff, First Revised Volume No. 1. The new tariff sheets are filed in accordance with the November 2, 1994 letter order in this proceeding. In the November 2, order, the Commission conditioned acceptance of CIG's October 3, 1994 filing on a compliance filing by CIG to reflect the tariff modifications approved by the Commission in its September 14, 1994 order in Docket No. RP94&hyph;342 (68 FERC (CCH) ¶61,295). CIG has filed revisions of the tariff sheets listed in Appendix A of the order in connection with this directive with one exception. Second Revised Sheet No. 101 in CIG's October 3 filing already reflected the modifications approved by the Commission in Docket No. RP94&hyph;342. The compliance filing also abides by the Commission directive in the November 2 order in connection with the provision allowing CIG to permit (on a case-by-case basis) storage customers under Rate Schedules NNT&hyph;1, NNT&hyph;2 and FS&hyph;1 to exceed the limitation on end-of-season gas inventory. The revised tariff sheets indicate that CIG will grant waivers on a non-discriminatory basis. Accordingly, CIG submitted for filing the following tariff sheets to become effective on November 1, 1994: Substitute Second Revised Sheet No. 34 Substitute Second Revised Sheet No. 56 Substitute First Revised Sheet No. 84 Substitute Second Revised Sheet No. 112 Substitute Second Revised Sheet No. 126 Substitute First Revised Sheet No. 145 Substitute Second Revised Sheet No. 159 Substitute Second Revised Sheet No. 228 CIG states that a copy of this filing was served upon all parties in this proceeding. Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with §385.211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211). All such protests should be filed on or before November 22, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room. Linwood A. Watson, Jr., Acting Secretary.
