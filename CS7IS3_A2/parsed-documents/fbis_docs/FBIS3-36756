Minister Announces Creation of Pro-Government Coalition"] [Text] Sergey Shakhray, chairman of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, minister for nationalities and regional policy affairs, intends to create, on the basis of his party, a centrist coalition to form firm support for Viktor Chernomyrdin's government. That the creation of such a conservative association was necessary was stated by Shakhray at a meeting of representatives of regional organizations of his party on 5 February. The creation of the new political structure has already begun. Yesterday, Sergey Shakhray held first talks on this topic with leaders of the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia. In the wake of radical democrats' actually having joined the opposition to the present government, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, led by two ministers -- Sergey Shakhray and Aleksandr Shokhin -- became a loyal ally of Viktor Chernomyrdin's cabinet. The political weight of this party in the present parliament, however, is not too great. Its faction currently is made up of as little as some 30 deputies -- all members of the party at that. The New Regional Policy faction is the main political ally of Shakhray's party in parliament, but so far they have not fully agreed to coordinating their positions. Still, Shakhray does not seem to have given up hope that it would soon be possible to create a coalition of 110 to 130 State Duma deputies, including members of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord faction, to form a reliable support for the present government. At any rate, this was what Sergey Shakhray declared on Saturday at the meeting with representatives of his party's regional organizations. To all appearances, Sergey Shakhray intends to form the pro-government coalition at a rapid pace both inside and outside the parliament. Already yesterday, these questions were discussed in his meeting with chiefs of the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia. This haste is quite understandable. Indeed, some leaders of Russia's Choice -- Mikhail Poltoranin, for example -- are on record as having stated that the fall of the current government is a matter of months. Last week's meeting of the Democratic Russia coordination council discussed the possibility of holding mass actions to demand the resignation of Chernomyrdin's cabinet. The key task of the new centrist entity is supposed to be to avert the threat, in the coming spring, of yet another political crisis. Meeting representatives of his party's regional branches, Shakhray issued a warning that by spring the readiness to strike in many regions would create a political background that would cause a sharper crisis in the government and the State Duma. On the other hand, Shakhray thinks, there may develop a political confrontation between the State Duma and the president which would most likely pick up depending on the decisions and laws made by the Duma. All these factors, as well as the "interethnic situation," Shakhray thinks, are going to create a "cumulative effect" in May. It is for this reason that the new centrist pro-government bloc should take final organizational shape by that time.
