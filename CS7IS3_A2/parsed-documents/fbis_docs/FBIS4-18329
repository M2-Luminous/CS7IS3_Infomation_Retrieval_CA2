On Wednesday, he is to meet with President Mitterrand at the Elysee [office of the president] and Prime Minister Balladur at Matignon [prime minister's office], and also with European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure and Foreign Trade Minister Gerard Longuet. The Paris agenda also includes meetings with, among others, OECD Secretary General Paye; the Belgian ambassador to France, the Belgian ambassador to the OECD, and the Belgian ambassador to UNESCO. Mr. Van Den Brande is to meet many business managers and representatives of major companies. [passage omitted] The minister-president of Flanders, accompanied by his colleagues and about 20 Flemish journalists, outlined the aims of this visit. It comes after visits already made to the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Great Britain, and will probably be followed by a visit to Germany. He evidently intends to acquire international status. In addition to the economic and cultural contacts established by these meetings, he also expects to win political recognition for himself at the European level. It is in a spirit of "good neighborliness" that he has headed south as, as he puts it: "Flanders is France's newest and youngest neighbor." He also wants to indicate that France is Flander's second most important trading partner after Germany (202000060100f Flemish exports). Concerning recent takeovers of Flemish companies by major French groups, he intends to remind his interlocutors that Flanders believes that "certain sectors must remain in Flemish hands," and that cooperation with foreign companies must be done "on an equal footing." He will also add that : "The Belgian facade presented by a number of these companies does not constitute a certificate of safe conduct allowing them to operate in Flanders." [passage omitted]
