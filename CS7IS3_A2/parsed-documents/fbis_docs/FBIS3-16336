In a statement circulated Tuesday [15 March], the conference said Lithuania is flooded with various religious cults and sects that "reject the teaching of the Christian Church, disseminate the ideas and superstitions of `the new age,' which are extremely dangerous to those who do not have deep Christian fundamentals. "We regret that even priests sometimes irresponsibly use public communication means and spread ideas that cannot be reconciled with the Christian doctrine." The statement mentions a case when a priest on television spoke about contacts with extraterrestrials. The Episcopal Conference urged media sources to be more responsible and not to dig up sensations about "travels in space" and other miracles, "which deliberately or unintentionally ruin the true faith and contradict the teaching of the Church."
