This agreement is the first step to renew foreign debt renegotiations. "We already have the backing for our economic program," Central Bank President Augusto de la Torre said after concluding his Washington meetings with the IMF, the World Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank. An IMF delegation will visit Quito in March, and it has not been ruled out that at the end of the Quito meetings the respective letter of intent and a biannual "standby" [preceding word in English] agreement could be signed. This agreement would allow the government to renew negotiations on the commercial portion of its foreign debt. Both the renegotiation as well as the service of this $6.5 billion portion have been suspended since August 1992, when the liberal government of Sixto Duran-Ballen took office. The total Ecuadoran debt, according to the latest official reports, amounts to $12.6 billion. The letter of intent will include the Ecuadoran pledge to continue its structural reform programs with a government reduction, a public spending reduction, and greater reduction of the inflation rate that is currently at 29 percent a year. Nevertheless, the constitutionality of the fuel increase, in effect since 29 January, is the subject of an appeal before the Supreme Court of Justice which could suspend the increase. According to the government that "would topple the whole economic program."
