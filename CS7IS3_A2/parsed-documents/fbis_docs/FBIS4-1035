FBIS4-1035 "drafr075_c_94044" FBIS-AFR-94-075 Daily Report 19 Apr 94 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 19 Apr South African Press Review for 19 Apr MB1904135494 MB1904135494 BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR Prisoners in ANC Offices `Highly Disturbing' -- "Reports that five men were detained in a cell at the ANC's regional headquarters in Johannesburg are highly disturbing," notes a page-20 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 19 April. "They compound fears that the ANC believes it is a law unto itself and that a malignant authoritarianism lurks beneath its declared love of democracy." The detention of the men in ANC regional headquarters "follows the ANC's refusal to allow police to search their national headquarters at Shell House after eight Zulu royalists were gunned down outside the building on March 28. At the time there were allegations that the marchers had been killed by snipers operating from rooftops of Shell House and nearby buildings." "Doubts have been cast on its claim that it was an innocent party in the Shell House massacre and that is guards fired only when the marchers tried to invade the building. Ballistic tests could have established the facts but the ANC chose to thwart the police investigation and, arguably, the due process of law. These signs do not augur well for the future." BUSINESS DAY IEC Spending Public Money -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 19 April says the Independent Electoral Commission's (IEC) budget is "commendably frank about how it intends to spend R700m [million rand] by the end of May, detailing everything from salaries to stationery." However, "taxpayers are entitled to know not just where the money is going, but what is being done to contain costs and ensure value for money." "Neither the IEC, nor the Transitional Executive Council which drew up its rules, can regard themselves as too important to cut costs. They are dealing with the public purse, not a bottomless pit." Peacekeeping Force To `Provoke Conflict' -- A second editorial on the same page says the death of journalist Ken Oosterbroek on the East Rand on 18 April is "a shocking reminder of the tenuousness of life in South Africa." The shooting "could well be put down to a stupidly naive decision of our political leaders. The National Peacekeeping Force is the product of a legitimate political desire to establish a multiparty, politically non-partisan force in the run-up to the elections. In principle, a good idea. In practice, as numerous experts warned, there was insufficient time to recruit and train a force which would be able to carry out that function competently. It has been guilty of indiscipline. Worse, with Inkatha's non-participation, it was always going to be seen as a partisan force, and therefore more likely to provoke conflict in some areas than contain it."
