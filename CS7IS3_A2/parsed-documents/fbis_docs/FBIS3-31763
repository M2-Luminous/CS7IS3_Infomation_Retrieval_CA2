The fifth round of talks, which took place on Tuesday [22 February], ended the negotiations," Iwo Byczewski, deputy foreign affairs minister of the Polish Republic, and his Lithuanian counterpart Vladislavas Domarkas announced on 22 February. Both parties reached a compromise on the controversial issue concerning the evaluation of past Polish-Lithuanian relations. According to the negotiators, the treaty will not include any dates or references to historic figures. The problem, of course, was about the so-called rebellion of General Zeligowski and the invasion of Vilnius, which the Lithuanians wanted condemned during the negotiations which lasted more than 12 months. Poland firmly rejected these demands and argued that the evaluation of the past should be left to historians. It was eventually decided that a few general sentences concerning the past would be written in the preamble to the treaty. Characterizing the wording of the preamble, Deputy Minister Byczewski said that it was stated there that "both nations had easier and more difficult times in their history. The point is that good conclusions be drawn from this bad past for a good future." Lithuania is currently the only neighboring country with which Poland has not signed a treaty. "The treaty, which was agreed to yesterday, might be signed as soon as March, during President Lech Walesa's visit to Vilnius," say the Lithuanians. The visit of the president to Lithuania has recently been discussed in the talks between Minister Andrzej Zakrzewski, Walesa's envoy, and Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas. However, the information on the visit has not yet been confirmed by the President's Chancellery.
