FR940524-0-00043 FR940524-0-00011 Response: The FAA appreciates the NTSB's acknowledgement of the ramifications of enforcing the May 26, 1994, compliance date and stresses that the minimum feasible extension was sought. The proposed rule already requires the submission of a list of aircraft covered by this extension. In accordance with the NTSB request, the lists will be submitted to the Flight Standards Service at FAA Headquarters (AFS&hyph;200). With regard to the operator's compliance with the ATA exemption, the FAA notes that not all covered operators have chosen to take advantage of the exemption; operators that do not choose to use the exemption are not required to submit retirement schedules. Further, there was some confusion on the part of some operators as to which airplanes were allowed to appear on an ARS; that confusion has been eliminated after much discussion between the affected operators and the FAA, and the subsequent issuance of an amended exemption. The FAA is not aware of any operators that have chosen to use the exemption and failed to submit the required retirement schedule. Comment: The ATA states that, as proposed, the amendment ``may help some U.S. operators,'' but suggests several modifications to the proposed rule. •Expand the applicability of the extension to include certain Stage 3 airplanes for which there currently is no supplemental type certificate or DFDR kit approve for installation. The ATA states that there will be significant service impacts on the affected operators, and suggests that the operators of these airplanes be required to submit documentation as to the anticipated STC approval or retrofit kit delivery dates. The FAA disagrees. The proposed extension was intended to make the DFDR rule more compatible with the Stage 3 transition rule of part 91 and its first compliance date of December 31, 1994. No Stage 3 airplanes are affected by the transition rule. Operators have had 7 years' notice in which to plan for DFDR retrofit of Stage 3 airplanes, a fact not changed by adoption of the Stage 3 transition rules in 1991. Operators that have failed to use the 7 years to plan for Stage 3 DFDR retrofits cannot now claim a hardship brought on by their own inaction. The FAA stated to the NPRM that it recognized the economic impact of the effects of the DFDR and Stage 3 transition rules combined. There is no similar argument to be made for airplanes unaffected by the Stage 3 transition rules, and to date the FAA has not made any DFDR retrofit exceptions for Stage 3 airplanes. The ATA does not justify why these operators that failed to act in a timely fashion after adequate notice should be allowed an extension of the compliance date. Further, the ATA comment does not take into account the safety benefit of DFDR retrofitted airplanes, or state any public interest in extending the amendment to these operators. Further, the ATA suggestion includes a requirement for those operators to show only when they anticipate STC or kit approval and does not mention an installation date. Finally, the FAA has no reason to expect that the same nonapproved equipment argument could not be made at the time of the 1995 compliance date as well. Accordingly, no change will be made in the final rule to expand the applicability of the extension. •The ATA states that any Aircraft Retirement Schedule (ARS) approved under its exemption should remain valid. The ATA is concerned about a statement in the NPRM about the FAA's proposed reexamination of the exemption terms. The FAA has no plans to withdraw the approval of any ARS already submitted and approved. In fact, the FAA is considering whether the closing date for the submission of an ARS should be extended to allow for reevaluation of fleet plans based on this amendment. However, the FAA must retain the ability to ensure that the rule and the exemption are not inconsistent or that their combined or separate effects do not unfairly harm or benefit individual operators subject to them. While the FAA currently is not aware of any such circumstances, the agency recognizes its continuing obligation to ensure that such inequities do not exist. No change to the final rule was suggested by this comment. •The ATA disagrees with the definition of ``heavy maintenance check'' as being any time the aircraft is taken out of service for 4 or more days. The FAA notes that a normal service check of 1 to 2 days can be extended to 4 days because discrepancies that are found during the scheduled check require additional time to rectify. It argues that an operator cannot always foresee the need for such unscheduled maintenance and have the parts or personnel immediately available to accomplish the DFDR retrofit when such circumstances arise. The ATA proposed that the definition be revised to ``any occasion which an airplane is taken out of service for a planned heavy maintenance check that is 4 days or longer in duration.''
