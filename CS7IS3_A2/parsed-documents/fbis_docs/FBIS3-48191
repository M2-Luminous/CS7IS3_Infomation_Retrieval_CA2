"I will do all I can to restore the suspended bilateral relations at an early date and promote new relationship based on the principles of reciprocity and equality," Lin said on arrival at Kimpo Airport. He said closer cooperation between the two countries will serve mutual interests and also contribute to stability and prosperity in Asia. South Korea and Taiwan severed formal diplomatic ties in August 1992 when Seoul entered ambassadorial relations with mainland China. Late last year, the two countries agreed to exchange semiofficial resident missions. Seoul opened its mission in Taipei on last Nov. 25.
