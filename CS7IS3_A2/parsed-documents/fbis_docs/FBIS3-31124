After the meeting, the Slovenian diplomat told journalists that Prime Minister Pawlak had expressed interest in closer cooperation with Slovenia, in particular in the economic field. According to Peterle, both sides spoke in favor of strengthening economic cooperation in the whole of Central Europe, at the same time admitting that there was still a lot to be done "with regard to economic reforms." The Slovenian minister confirmed the willingness to conclude an agreement on free trade with Poland. Slovenia already concluded similar agreements with the Czech Republic and Slovakia and will soon sign one with Hungary. "It seems that the expansion of the free trade zone is necessary, as it makes our access to the European Union easier," he said. Peterle announced that Polish-Slovenian political cooperation would concentrate on the forum of the Central-European Initiative. He said that there were good foundations for this cooperation, as both states had similar views on Europe and the issue of security.
