During a meeting with Kenneth Derr, chairman of the Chevron Corporation of the United States, Li said that China would like to cooperate with foreign petroleum companies, including Chevron, in this regard. Li told the U.S. guest that since China began its exploitation of offshore oil fields in the 1970s, the industry had taken shape, and its prospect were very bright. With development of the economy and improvement of people's living standards, China's demands for petroleum products would rise, Li said. Therefore, the country will accelerate the development of the industry. He described the oil field in northwest China's Tarim Basin as one with great potential, and he extended a welcome to foreign oil companies to join in its development. Li hoped that Chevron would be successful in the exploration for oil in East China Sea. Chevron and China signed an agreement on the development of oil in that area last year. Derr said that as one of the largest energy companies in the United States, Chevron had advantage in terms of capital and technology. The corporation has decided to strengthen the cooperation with China, in which it had confidence. Derr and his party arrived here to participate in the strategic plan meeting from April 11 to 18, which is sponsored by Chevron Overseas Company. Among those at today's meeting were Gan Ziyu, vice minister of the State National Planning Commission, and Wang Yan, general manager of the China National Offshore Oil Corporation.
