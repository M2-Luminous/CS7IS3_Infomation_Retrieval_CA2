Our military contacts are regular and go back a long way, Pavel Grachev stressed. Franco-Russian combat fellowship developed during World Wars I and II. The signing of two intergovernmental agreements -- on defense cooperation and military-technical cooperation -- came as fresh confirmation of the further strengthening of Franco-Russian friendship. They make provision not only for collaboration between our states' military departments and armed forces, but also exchanges of experience in the field of defense enterprise conversion, for instance, and the development of certain arms. The agreement on military-technical cooperation envisages the implementation of 20 specific projects in total. For Russia the signing of these agreements is all the more important in that they have been concluded with a NATO state. And it was underlined during the conversation that this is evidence of the new level of relations between Russia and the North Atlantic alliance and represents our country's concrete contribution to the implementation of the "Partnership for Peace" program. A considerable part of the conversation was devoted to Russia's peacekeeping activity. I must be blunt and say, Pavel Grachev stated here, that the world is still not sufficiently objective in its perception of the Russian Armed Forces' peacekeeping efforts. People there often forget that the former Soviet republics are autonomous states. That is why the armed conflicts on their territories and the Russian Army's peacekeeping operations go unnoticed. Furthermore, our country is accused of not displaying activity in the republics of the former Yugoslavia, acting under the UN flag, and that its troop contingent there is very small. However, Pavel Grachev said, our Army is carrying out peacekeeping operations in Moldova, the Transcaucasus, and Tajikistan. Over 16,000 Russian servicemen have been deployed to carry out these tasks alone and that is more than any of the national contingents involved in UN peacekeeping operations. At present the question of the preparation and introduction of peacekeeping subunits of the Russian Armed Forces into the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone with the participation of UN observers is being studied. Touching on the settlement of the Bosnian crisis, the head of the Russian military department pointed, in particular, to Russia's commitment to finding a most speedy political solution to this problem. In the opinion of the Russian side, combat use of aviation would cause hostilities in the region to escalate. Therefore aircraft can only be used if UN troops are directly attacked. What is more, the possibility of using force in Bosnia should be decided by the UN Security Council, and not other organizations. Russia's defense minister also opposed lifting the embargo on arms shipments to the conflict zone. Francois Leotard and Pavel Grachev visited the Taman Guards Motorized Rifle Division 4 February, where they inspected arms and combat hardware and were briefed on personnel's life and living conditions.
