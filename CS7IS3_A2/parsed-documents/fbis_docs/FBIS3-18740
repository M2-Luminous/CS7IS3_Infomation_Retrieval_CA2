FBIS3-18740 "drweu045_j_94007" FBIS-WEU-94-045 Document Type:Daily Report 8 Mar 1994 ITALY & VATICAN CITY Weekly Analyzes Political Right, Leaders 94ES0254A Milan PANORAMA in Italian 18 Feb 94 pp 17-21 94ES0254A Milan PANORAMA Language: Italian Article Type:CSO [Article by Umberto Brindani, Stefano Brusadelli, and Renzo Rosati: "How Strong Is the Right?"] [Text] This is a report on an expanding area of the political scene: the area represented by Berlusconi, Bossi, and Fini. Many things--such as the use of the term "right"--serve to divide them, but united they could win the elections. At 1230 hours sharp on Sunday 6 February, Silvio Berlusconi--attired in a presidential double-breasted jacket with a Forza Italia rosette in the lapel--began to speak from the stage of the Palafiera in Rome. He was delivering the official preamble of the Forza Italia movement and his speech was a "call to arms" in opposition to the front of the Left. At the same time, at the Augusteo Theater in Naples, National Alliance [AN] leader Gianfranco Fini--with Alessandra Mussolini at his side and 2,000 fans [preceding word in English] in the audience--was concluding the speech that opened the election campaign in the South with an attack on the center and the left. Also at 1230 hours, in a room at the Hotel Tre Vecchi in Bologna, Umberto Bossi was waking up with sleep-filled eyes. Always several hours late even for his appointments with history, it was not until around 1700 hours that the Lombard warrior would fire his broadsides against the "communists," in a triumphant speech at the party convention that opened "the year of the Samurai, the year in which the League's enemies will have their throats cut from ear to ear." These three snapshots--taken within minutes of each other--record a historic moment in Italian politics: the birth of the Italian Right. Or rather, of an area that is conventionally referred to as the Right: an area that on the political map is distinct both from the Center and from the Left and that for the first time in Italy will be able to fight a leftist coalition on equal terms. In other western countries this area is already established and is called variously moderate, conservative, Tory, Republican, Giscardian, Reaganism, Thatcherite, and so forth. In Italy the first steps are being taken today, on the basis of two assumptions: the sharing of certain values and interests (ranging from free enterprise to a less burdensome tax structure) and the mutual desire to prevent an election victory of the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] and its allies. The three leaders are certainly as different--in terms of language, culture, and social origin--as one can possibly imagine. Their respectives staffs [preceding word in English] and rank-and-file activists fight each other, and not just metaphorically. Their traditions, customs, and myths seem to belong to separate worlds. And just as in some science fiction novels, these three political areas were until yesterday orbiting side by side without coming into contact, as if they were three parallel universes. At 1230 hours on Sunday 6 February, a window was opened among the three galaxies: a window through which a torrent of votes could pour on 27 and 28 March. The most recent poll taken by the CIRM [Italian Center for Market Research] for TMC [expansion not given] gives Forza Italia 24 percent, the League 10 percent, and AN 10 percent for a total of 44 percent, compared to 34 percent for the progressive coalition. The survey conducted by Diakron (which works for Berlusconi's party) gives Forza Italia approximately 30 percent--a virtual absolute majority under the single-member system, which rewards a party that has a well-established presence in a given area, such as the League in the north and the AN in many parts of the center-south. Despite the technical sleight of hand that the leaders are using in an effort to gloss over their reciprocal vetoes, the extent to which the three pillars of this new right are compatible remains to be seen. Three representatives of PANORAMA accordingly made an incursion into the three universes, which they describe in an unusual way--the only way possible in the case of three services that function in parallel. Their aim was to discover whether the generals, strategies, and armies of the neoconservatives will ultimately be able to get along in a single universe. Style of the Leaders: Silvio Berlusconi The lights are dimmed, the background music begins, and spokesman Antonio Tajani announces that "in a few moments Silvio Berlusconi will be here!" When he arrives, the party's anthem bursts forth ("Forza Italia, it is time to believe...."), the stage lights up, and the leader's first words are: "How could anyone not be moved?" Then he seizes the microphone and begins to pace back and forth "in the Frank Sinatra manner." Rome, 6 February: Smiling, attired in a double-breasted jacket with a Forza Italia rosette in the lapel and a megascreen that multiplies him by sixteen, Berlusconi displays his style in public. He does not hold conventional political meetings; the scenography is too involved, the alternation between the pacing and the pauses at the podium too studied. The great communicator knows that the scene has to be changed every 10 or 15 minutes. He never indulges in show [previous word in English], however: he expounds a program and delivers clear political signals. Berlusconi speaks extemporaneously, after memorizing the outline and key points of his speech. He does not gesticulate: his hands are anchored to the podium, and when he walks they are clutching the microphone. His left hand slips fleetingly into his jacket pocket, and during the solemn passages his right hand is placed over his heart. Supported even by the Doxa [polling agency] ("He is the best equipped to solve the nation's problems"), Berlusconi uses the pronoun "we" unabashedly. "We know how to revive Italy," he says. "No one can make this promise with more credibility and prestige." But he also strives for simplicity. "Do not be shy," he says, "we are now singing in unison." He looks first one way and then another, without moving his shoulders; it is a habit that perhaps comes from too much familiarity with the friendly television cameras. He has agreed to face-to-face confrontations but only under definite conditions: he says no to noisy audiences and to moderators who are mediocre or who are too cunning. Bob Lasagna, the public relations consultant with the picturesque last name, explains. "What is so shocking about that?" he asks. "In the United States, such confrontations are few and are regulated down to the smallest detail." Umberto Bossi "Our concept of freedom does not come from Hegel, but from Fichte." But who says this? Rocco Buttiglione, the philosopher who has lent his services to politics? No, sir; it is Umberto Bossi, speaking from the platform of the convention center in Bologna on Sunday 6 February. It is inevitable: every time a sprinkling of culture issues from his mouth, the League's people do not understand but applaud anyway, and the journalists--who even though they too may not understand--smile as they are thinking: "Miglio told him that half an hour ago." This is because Bossi is that fellow from the Radio Elettra School, the bogus student of medicine, and the coarse, vulgar, and ignorant head of the coarsest, most vulgar, and most ignorant political movement that has ever been seen in Italy. True. Unfortunately, this is also the person who by dint of dubious allegations and repeated extravagant posturing is attempting--with a fair chance of success--to take over the national government, even if in cohabitation with the slick postyuppie [preceding word in English] Forza Italia. Bossi also pleases his followers because of the fact that he has not changed his style since the days when he personally pasted up his homemade manifestos. Although the League has gone middle-class, its leader has not. He lives in a little house that appears to have been furnished with factory rejects from a big furniture supermarket. He dresses like an employee at a company dinner. He is unable to fasten the bottom button on his shirt, because it restricts him. He does not care about the look [preceding word in English] but rather--in his own words--"the substance of things," so that even though oratory is his strong point, he sometimes takes off on improbable mental tangents. He then appears to rouse himself from his catalepsy, after which he fires a cannonade that excites the crowd. Careless and instinctive, apocalyptic and macho, heavy-handed and assertive: this is the Bossi the public sees. If he has been successful until now, it is because underneath the mask of a ham actor there is a genuine politician who is as cold as a computer. Gianfranco Fini "Fini has been tempered by the solitude of the rejected, of the outcast. By dint of finding himself opposed to everyone, he has learned how to demand respect. He is at his best in difficult confrontations with an adversary, because he strikes first and strikes harder." The person depicted thus by Luciano Cavalli, an expert on political charisma, is a typical leader of the right. Fini is a leader who is tough, cold, accustomed to unpopularity, devoid of timidity, and in no way inclined toward sentimentality. "He is a Giorgio Almirante," Cavalli adds, "who is even more secure in his beliefs, because the MSI [Italian Social Movement] no longer has any guilt complexes to expiate." Giuliana, Gianfranco Fini's nine-year-old daughter, is the only person he will allow to make fun of him. She mimics to perfection her father's performance on the speakers' platform: the way he points his index finger horizontally toward his face and twirls it--the only demagogic variation he will make in a speaking style that is otherwise dry, rational, and unemotional. Fini speaks in the style of the traditional political meeting, but without the progressions and modulations of voice characteristic of Almirante or Bossi. He speaks with a distinct Bolognese accent, drinks a lot of water, keeps his head and shoulders steady, and--as a rule--uses a handwritten outline. He has the habit of resuming his speech before the applause has ceased, and he likes to fill his speeches with disdainful quips at the expense of his adversaries. Communications expert Bruna Pustetto attributes Fini's persuasiveness to his degree in teaching. There are other secrets, however: Fini always strikes first, never loses his calm, and has an extraordinary memory. We also know that he has never cried in public, tells jokes, and can imitate all the dialects; his rendition of Bossi's Lombard dialect is especially successful and amusing. He is 42 years of age, is a practicing Catholic (although married to a divorcee), eats dinner alone, is a fan of the Bologna and Latium soccer teams, lives in Boville at the gates of Rome, and has his wife Daniela select his suits for him. The Platforms: Forza Italia The slogan--"I promise you a new economic miracle"--had been ready for weeks. Rather than a miracle, however, the platform of Forza Italia--45 points on 100 pages--is the classic free enterprise formula: reduction of taxes and government spending, and elimination of the restraints on the labor market. It promises "a tax schedule consisting of a single rate that is no higher than 30 percent, with progressivity ensured by deductions. The poor would be completely exempt from payment of the IRPEF [personal income tax]. Taxes would be cut from the present 200 to no more than 10. Spending would be reduced, and the state would perform only those services not provided by the market. Debt would be rescheduled under a system whereby those who are able would pay for the services they receive--by their choice--from the public or the private sector, contributing in either case to social solidarity. Employment would be stimulated by removing taxes on hiring, apprenticeships, adapting education to the requirements of business, and eliminating--by offering legal and flexible forms of employment--what today is illegal labor." Nor is the social aspect overlooked: it ranges from a proposal to lower taxes for large families to offering women part-time work and company-sponsored day care. The League The platform that Bossi got approved at the party convention in Bologna is approximately nine pages long. The last five and a half lines of the document are devoted to the plan for governing: "The federal congress shall order the federal secretary to prepare a plan for governing the country: a plan that will take into account the necessity of increasing freedom at the institutional level until federalism is achieved, and increasing freedom in the economy until a market economy is achieved." End of program. Whoever says he votes "in accordance with the platform" is well served, for what you have here is a nonprogram that meets one very simple requirement: that Bossi be given a free hand, in accordance with the usual League system of giving a blank check "to the only person who knows how to use it." Federalism has become a "should be"; in the document, Bossi even allows the word "potential" to slip by him. One thing is certain, however: The League regards the coming legislature as a constituent assembly. What are the key words in the Lombard lexicon? Free enterprise, lower taxes, wage caps, and privatization. In short--as Bossi said in Bologna--"let the state get out of the way." As for the media, Marco Formentini adds, "we will not accept any information monopoly, and we will defend Berlusconi against the attack by the RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation]." National Alliance "Tax breaks for investments that create jobs," was Fini's somewhat generic response on TV when asked where he would begin if he headed the government. Perhaps because not even the MSI people believe such a scenario is possible, no real scale of priorities exists. One has to search the MSI platform, which presents a strange mix of pro-efficiency and pro-solidarity advocacy. For the economy, the platform recommends privatization, provided it does not give an advantage to foreign corporate groups. For the League it offers bureaucratic and fiscal decentralization through the creation of macroprovinces of the Polesine or Cadore type. For Berlusconi it offers a promise not to dismantle his TV empire, together with a package of measures designed to reassure moderate voters. The platform calls for a five-year moratorium on non-EC immigration into Italy; abolition of the concept of "small quantities" as applied to narcotics; a sterner attitude toward prostitution; a pro-life position on abortion; and laws to prohibit genetic engineering experiments. In the area of politics, if the coalition of the Right is victorious, the MSI will resume its harassment of Oscar Luigi Scalfaro--who is accused of being a hostage of Achille Occhetto--and will reopen the campaign for the direct election of the head of state or--at least--of the head of government. What Each Says About the Other Two: Forza Italia A CIRM poll conducted for PANORAMA shows that the Forza Italia voters--with zero representing the center of the political spectrum--place themselves 19.5 points to the right, compared to 28.5 for the League and 63 for the MSI. These samples, moreover, show that the supporters of Berlusconi's party regard the League as being closer to them politically but socially inferior, and they place little trust in Bossi. They believe they are politically more distant from the MSI, but regard Fini as a competent and sincere interlocutor. The League What about an alliance with Berlusconi? "Like chewing on a nettle," says Erminio Boso of Trent. "It would be like a confirmed bachelor who gets a proposal from a woman," adds Uber Anghinoni of Mantua. "He risks a heart attack. Better to continue to live alone." As for an alliance with the MSI, "no" in any case. "Never! Never! Never!" Bossi thundered in Bologna. "We will never have anything to do with the fascists!" On the other hand, "Berlusca"--according to Bossi--"is a Milanese with whom it would be easy to reach an agreement." National Alliance The Fini people have said no: 52 percent of them do not want an alliance with Bossi, and not just because he insists on calling them fascists. "That fellow," says MSI partisan Teodoro Buontempo, "intends to form an institutional government with the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], or even to bring about the secession of the north." Relations with Berlusconi are better. "The Knight," Fini explains, "has a national image, and within an anticommunist coalition he could serve as a bridge between north and south." Anthropology of the Party Members Silvio Berlusconi's People Homo berlusconianus made his initial appearance in a Fininvest uniform: blazer [preceding word in English], gray pants, shoes the color of brierwood. The only exemptions are for external luxuries: General Luigi Caligaris in tweed and sleeveless sweater, and the economist Antonio Martino in the vest of a liberal gentleman of the south. And the blue soldiers have begun to wear civilian garb, but without making any concessions to the slovenliness of League types. The Forza Italia partisan is self-confident; drives a medium- to high-powered car; and often is self-employed. Thirty percent are professionals; 12 percent are owners of small or midsized businesses; 10 percent are university instructors; 15 percent are merchants or craftsmen; and 4 percent are public employees. "We should not ask for anything; we are not paid politicians," Stefano Podesta, professor at Bocconi University, proudly states. Politics is viewed as a mission, as a mass transposition of Berlusconi's "bitter cup." The values of the Forza Italia activists are the family and private enterprise. "I view Italy as a nation of respectable people," their leader says. Their key words are honesty, competence, and optimism. Partyocracy, consociativism, and statism are proscribed. Communism is the great enemy. Their bible is Praise of Folly by Erasmus of Rotterdam, often quoted by Berlusconi, as for example the passage: "The most courageous decisions do not derive from reasoning but from farsighted, visionary folly." For them, the party represents politics in the office, in the living room: just like Berlusconi in his Arcore villa. It represents the rediscovery of the national anthem, the fatherland, holding hands, the Christmas tree. Paolo Garimberti, manager of Tg-2 [TV news], calls it "the culture of Beautiful [preceding word in English] and Mike Bongiorno." But Gad Lerner, assistant editor of LA STAMPA, disagrees. "It represents an individualistic Italy," he says, "that is kept on the fringes of the establishment [preceding word in English], just outside the protection of political patronage, the circles of big business, and the financial sanctuaries. It is an Italy that is conservative, hard-working, and roguish: an Italy that is intuitive and--above all--self-confident." Umberto Bossi's People It is one o'clock in the morning on Saturday, 5 February, at the Holiday Inn hotel, in the faded gray outskirts of Bologna. In the dining room, 100 or so happy League partisans--their eyes blurred with fataigue--are beginning to leave. A few people are still dancing. Gipo Farassino, the Piedmontese leader [preceding word in English] and cabaret singer, who is slightly intoxicated, attacks his final two numbers: Besame mucho and--unexpectedly--Roma nun fa' la stupida stasera. Umberto Bossi is sitting in a corner. Is he talking politics? Hardly. He is surrounded by half a dozen female admirers and is dispensing predatory smiles. Shortly thereafter he bids farewell to the assembled guests, and the mood turns gloomy. These are the League's people--the same ones who the next day were hurling catcalls and insults at the mayor of Bologna, who dared to speak that dirty word, "solidarity." They are the same ones who buy undershorts imprinted with a caricature of Rosy Bindi and the gentlemanly caption, "Make me a Lega [League]." The same ones who rush to buy the videocassettes of their leader's wedding (20,000 lire), the aiguillettes bearing Miglio's likeness (5,000 lire), and the Bossi brand of red wine (3,500 lire). The same ones who listen enraptured to the new League anthem, which is a cross between the Marcia trionfale from Aida and the sound track from Freccia nera. And then there is the latest model of League supporters, who are gathering up everything and packing it away, because, they feel they are grownups now and should avoid the appearance of being just a bunch of hotheads. These are the League people, in their Sunday best, with their medium-powered sedans and L'INDIPENDENTE under their arm (although they read it somewhat apprehensively ever since Bossi said that "at times it reads like the newspaper of the fascists"). These are the League people, with the serialized encyclopedia in the Alazzone living room, and the wives with their cult of the fur coat. Their key words: federalism, free enterprise, self-government, "the common people," and "of the people." Their hated words: journalists, the government, welfarism, and solidarity. The word "solidarity" has in fact been struck from the official documents of the Municipality of Milan. Gianfranco Fini's People Although at the MSI party congress in Rome in late January the word "comrade" was never heard and scarcely a dozen Roman salutes were given, the political scientist Piero Ignazi, the leading Italian expert on the Right, does not believe such a miraculous transfiguration has taken place. "In my opinion," he insists, "the former ideological position has changed only slightly. Convincing evidence of the acceptance of capitalism and the free market is lacking. As for the liquidation of fascism, I have not yet heard anyone speak the word error,' which the PDS has used in reference to communism." The MSI people--the only ones who have been willing to define themselves as rightists--are suspended between nostalgia for an identity that has not been renounced and the temptations of a virtuous and attractive modernism. Blue has replaced black as the official color; the feminist group "The Bees" has been formed; and there are also two new plush mascots, Fiammino and Fiammetta, that will even have their own comic books. There are fewer gray or blue suits, more slacks, and more sports jackets. The impression is one of a machismo that has been abandonend--without too many regrets--to the Bossi zealots. The party spirit remains strong, however: the nomenklatura on the speakers' platform, sections, a central committee, and party membership cards, together with a radicalism that is primarily of the lower middle class and the middle middle class. According to data gathered by Ignazi, 26 percent of the delegates at the MSI party congress were professionals, 18 percent white-collar workers, and 12 percent teachers. They were molded--still according to the survey--by the following authors, listed in the order of their importance: Evola, Mussolini, Codreanu, Gentile, Spirito, and Nietzsche. Something is changing, however: Fini has introduced the economic liberalism of Bobbio into the MSI pantheon. And Adolfo Urso, the moving spirit of the AN--which was born of a meeting between the MSI and moderate elements outside that party--recommends Prezzolini and Albert Michel, popularizer of the Rhineland model of a corporate market economy. Where the Leader Commands Forza Italia If Forza Italia is to change its policy line, elect new leaders, and deal with internal dissent, it will perhaps not be a party convention or a national executive council that will do the job. The creation of the party, the entry into politics, the alliances, and the platform: Berlusconi did it all either entirely by himself or with a few trusted advisers. The Fininvest and Pubitalia organization created the movement. The outsiders--the experts--developed the platform: Giuliano Urbani, Martino, Caligaris, the constitutional expert Gianfranco Ciaurro, the judge Tiziana Parenti, and the attorney Raffaele Della Valle. It is a kind of crown council--a club [preceding word in English] of patricians who are often installed at the highest levels of the state but are not defiled by contact with active politics. Berlusconi assembles them araound the dining room table at Villa San Martino in Arcore. In Forza Italia, oval tables are de rigueur. You will find them in the Milan headquarters on Viale Isonzo and in the luxurious headquarters on Via dell'Umilta in Rome. And what of the rank-and-file? The clubs [preceding word in English] number approximately 7,000, located principally in Lombardy, Latium, Campania, and Sicily. After the elections a streamlined organization will be retained, modeled after the American political committee. For the time being Berlusconi is the titular president of Forza Italia, but when the movement has a parliamentary group, it will appoint its leadership just as the traditional parties do. The League Bossi's party, amid the proclamations of the various movements, is the only one of the three parties to be rigidly structured in the Leninist manner. Here are its numbers: 79 members of Parliament (there were 80, but one was lost along the way); 130 mayors; 700 headquarters in the north; 4,000 members of municipal councils; 120,000 party members; 3.4 million votes in the parliamentary elections of 1992; and one leader. Yes, one leader, because Bossi is master in his own house, just like the boss of an ironworks. He has absolute control over his followers, and is not afraid to banish them or to destroy their credibility. And he does not accord special treatment to the faithful. Bossi is always reelected by acclamation, and arranged for the grandfather of the League--Luigi Rossi, the "pianist" who voted as his proxy in the Chamber of Deputies--to be elected honorary president, also by acclamation. "Like Caligula with his horse," said one League member, rubbing his hands together. The decisionmaking process, in short, is quite simple. It operates as follows: Bossi thinks it over, listens to a few people, selects the policy line, convenes a party congress or a federal council, and arranges for a rather generic document to be approved--one that will allow him, if necessary, to change his mind. The document approved in Bologna orders--in a threatening manner--the secretary "to ascertain whether there are any independence-minded factions within the League." Translation: someone will soon have to leave. National Alliance In the case of the incautious Alessandra Mussolini, who had publicly accused him of the crime of "defascistization," Fini undertook--behind closed doors--a bantering but very stern historical examination of fascism. Soon thereafter, the Granddaughter was tamed. In dealing with the case of Pino Rauti--an opponent with a following--he invented a more subtle treatment. When the "Black Ingrao" challenged him for the leadership of the AN, Fini was completely unruffled; but the Rauti supporters were threatened, one by one, with the loss of their places on the electoral lists. Having weighed the risk of being left alone, even Rauti fell into line. Fini has cracked down. His MSI now resembles Craxi's PSI [Italian Socialist Party]; its leadership meets only rarely. Whoever objects is invited to get out. The various factions have been de facto dissolved. "Fini," his spokesman Francesco Storace says, "learned his lesson during his first secretaryship, from 1987 to 1990, when he was forced out precisely by the maneuverings of such groups." In making decisions Fini listens to only four people--"the summit," as it is called within the party--namely, Giuseppe Tatarella, leader of the bloc of deputies; Francesco Servello, the coordinator; Mirko Tremaglie, in charge of foreign relations; and Altero Matteoli, in charge of organization. One also senses the beginnings of a personality cult: there are Fini watches, paid cruises with Fini, and books on Fini, one of which consists of interviews and another--just published--of letters to the party secretary.
