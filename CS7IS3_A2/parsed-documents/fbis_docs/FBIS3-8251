Assessing that "Romania's authorities are not observing these amendments and are not displaying the political will to accept and implement them," the signatories of the declaration reassert the ethnic minorities' right to have their own local self-administration bodies and a special status in the areas where they represent the majority of the population, and recommend that local administration bodies should be summoned within two months to decide upon the forms of autonomy that should be applied, as formulated in the UDMR program and in its draft bill on the status of the ethnic minorities and autonomous communities. The declaration also protests the draft bill on education, which has already been accepted by the Education Commission of the Chamber of Deputies, as well as the measures taken by certain county prefects annulling the decisions of local bodies regarding bilingual inscriptions, and requests that in the areas preponderantly inhabited by ethnic minorities they should be allowed to use their mother tongue in justice and administration. In that context the declaration asks Romania's Parliament to sign the European Charter on Local Self-Administration, accept the UDMR amendments to the education bill, and put on the agenda the draft bill on the status of ethnic minorities and autonomous communities.
