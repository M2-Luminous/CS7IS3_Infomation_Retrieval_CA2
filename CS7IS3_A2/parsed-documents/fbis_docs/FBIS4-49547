The reports disclosed the results of the committee's deliberations of the draft Foreign Trade Law, the draft State Compensation Law, and a draft decision on meting out punishment for offenses in connection with company and enterprise management. The Law Committee states: Following the preliminary deliberations of these three draft bills by the fourth and fifth meetings of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee, the Law Committee distributed copies of the drafts to all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government, as well as to relevant central departments. It also held informal discussions with relevant central departments, specialists, and foreign trade enterprises to canvass their opinions. The committee amended the drafts in accordance with the views of NPC Standing Committee members as a result of deliberations, as well as the views of people in other sectors. Believing that formulation of the three statutes was necessary and the drafts were basically feasible, the Law Committee would like to propose the NPC Standing Committee examine and approve them. Xiang Chunyi, Cai Cheng, and Wang Shuwen, vice chairmen of the NPC Law Committee, today submitted three separate reports to the Standing Committee on the results of their deliberations. The reports contained the Law Committee's suggestions for amendments. On the draft Foreign Trade Law, Xiang Chunyi said: The NPC Financial and Economic Committee and some localities have called for encouraging localities to engage in foreign trade, saying the law may not provide for such issues as not exercising management through mandatory planning, integrating industry with trade, and implementing the agency system. To this end, we would like to propose the draft be amended to read: "The state shall implement a unified foreign trade system, safeguard the order of free and fair foreign trade in accordance with the law, inspire local governments' enthusiasm, protect the operational autonomy of foreign trade operators, and promote the development of foreign trade." Some departments have expressed the hope the draft will be amended to reflect the fact that economic organizations are not the only units engaged in foreign trading activities in our country but quite a few scientific research institutes have been granted the right to engage in foreign trade pursuant to relevant state provisions. To this end, we would like to propose the draft be amended to read: "The foreign trade operators referred to in this law are legal entities and other organizations engaged in foreign trading activities in accordance with the provisions of this law." Xiang Chunyi said: The NPC Financial and Economic Committee and some localities have noted that although the requirement for obtaining the permission of competent departments before securing the right to engage in foreign trade confirms the practice currently in effect, a registration system should be established in light of the long-term demand for reforming the foreign trade system. Also, we would like to propose the law specify the qualifications of foreign trade operators in order to increase its own transparency. Some members and localities prefer the draft's provisions on obtaining the permission of competent departments before securing the right to engage in foreign trade. After canvassing the views of relevant departments, the Law Committee concluded that more provisions should be introduced regarding the qualifications of foreign trade operators. However, considering our country's reality, we would like to propose retaining the provisions in the State Council's draft regarding the licensing system, and amending the draft to read: "A foreign trade operator engaged in the export and import of goods and technologies must possess the following qualifications, and may only engage in foreign trading activities with the permission of the authorities under the State Council in charge of foreign economics and trade: 1) having its own name and organizational setup; 2) having a clearly defined operational scope within which to conduct foreign trade; 3) having the premises and funds for carrying out its foreign trading business; 4) having professional personnel needed for its foreign trading business; 5) possessing actual export and import credentials or sources of export and import goods; and 6) other qualifications as specified by law and administrative rule." "The State Council shall enact implementation measures provided for in the preceding paragraph." Speaking on the views about amending the draft State Compensation Law, Cai Cheng said: Certain departments pointed out that, for administrative compensation, there should be a specific clause noting that the state shall bear the responsibility of compensating for the damage caused by unlawful compulsory measures taken on property. We propose this clause be added: "When compulsory administrative measures were taken to seal, withhold, or freeze property and damage has been made," the victim is entitled to compensation. Some Standing Committee members noted the draft should have the specific clause that authorities obligated to make the compensation should take the initiative to pay the victim according to this law. Thus we propose a clause should be added to each of the relevant articles. Cai Cheng said: Some Standing Committee members pointed out that it is not enough simply to make state organs personnel -- whose wrongdoings were intentional and serious -- bear economic liabilities, but that they must also have their administrative and criminal responsibilities investigated. We propose, therefore, that this clause be added to the draft law: "Relevant authorities shall discipline these personnel according to law; and if their wrongdoings constitute a crime, their criminal responsibilities shall be investigated according to law." Cai Cheng said: Some departments pointed out that compensation for detainees, whose legitimate rights and interests have been violated as result of the lawless exercise of power by authorities in charge of prisons, should also be specified in the part about criminal compensation. Some departments pointed out that the part about criminal compensation should have provisions governing the power of the People's Liberation Army's security departments to investigate criminal cases in the military. We propose these words in the draft law -- "public security organs, security organs, and procuratorial organs as well as their personnel" -- be amended to read: "Organs exercising investigating, prosecuting, trying powers as well as their personnel." Cai Cheng said: Some Standing Committee members and some departments pointed out that more flexible rates should be set so that they can adapt to wage and price changes in the future. We propose the draft version be amended to read: "When a citizen's personal freedom has been violated, the daily compensation shall be calculated according to the average daily wage the state paid him in the preceding year." Many experts and local people's congresses and departments pointed out that, to facilitate operations, a ceiling should be set for state compensation. Some comrades pointed out that the ceiling should be set in such a way that it can adapt to future changes. On the basis of these views, we propose that a ceiling of compensation should be set. The ceiling should be assessed according to the state's average wage for workers during the preceding year as announced by the State Statistics Bureau. Specific rates can be set according to three kinds of situations: The reduced amount of income as result of physical injury "shall be calculated according to the average annual wage which the state paid the worker in the preceding year, and the ceiling should be five times the worker's average annual wage in the preceding year"; compensation for physical disability "should be set according to how much the working capability is lost, and the ceiling should be 10 times the worker's average annual wage in the preceding year; and in the case of death, the total compensation, including funeral expenses, should be 20 times the average annual wage of the worker in the preceding year." Some Standing Committee members, legal experts, and departments proposed that the reputation of those whose reputation and honor have been infringed upon should be reinstated. We propose this clause be added: "When a person's reputation and honor has been infringed upon, the organ liable for compensation shall, within the area in which the conduct of infringement has produced influence, remove the influence on the victim, reinstate his honor, and apologize to him." Wang Shuwen reported on the NPC Law Committee's views about amending the draft decision on punishing offenses in connection with company and enterprise management. He said: In addition to prescribing punishments for the offenders -- such as fixed prison terms, criminal detention, and deprivation of personal freedom -- the draft also provides that "fines may also be imposed." Some departments and local authorities pointed out that punishments should be based on the offenses' characteristics, and the offenders should be deprived of their personal freedom and penalized economically. Certain offenders may only be fined. Thus, we propose the phrase be amended to read: "Fines may be imposed together or separately." Wang Shuwen said: Some members, local authorities, and units pointed out that the Company Law's Article 214 provides that when a company's directors, supervisors, or managers accept bribes, or seize or misappropriate the company's assets, and that their acts have constituted a crime, their criminal responsibilities shall be investigated according to the law. Since the draft decision has no provisions governing bribery, it should be supplemented. Thus, we propose this provision be added: "When a board director, supervisor, or worker of a company uses the convenience of his office to solicit or accept bribes, and the amount is quite substantial, he shall be sentenced to prison, or criminal detention, of up to five years; and if the amount is enormous, he shall be sentenced to prison for longer than five years and also have his property confiscated. If state functionaries, workers of collective economic organizations, or other personnel performing public duties commit the aforementioned crime, they shall be punished according to the Supplementary Regulations For Punishing Corruption and Bribery." He said: Some local authorities and units pointed out that the criminal elements stated in this law should not only be punished in terms of their personal freedom and economic interests, but their credentials for continuing to assume the company's leading offices should be restricted. Thus we propose this clause be added: "For those who have committed the crimes stated in this decision, the people's court may also impose on them the additional sentence that they may not assume offices as the company's directors, supervisors, or managers, as well as other senior supervisory offices for a period from three to five years."
