One of the alleged key figures in the hashish case, the 49-year-old TJ has since 1990 been running the company Tarco Co. Ltd., which is registered in Banjul in Gambia. In the village of Tanjae on the West African coast the Dane has build up a business of preparing, drying, and exporting fish, which both he and local fishermen had caught in the ocean outside of Gambia. "TJ has been particularly popular among African fishermen because he got many things started and furnished local employment at his fish-drying business on the coast," we were told by the shipping agent Steen Hedemann who lives in Gambia where he received the news yesterday concerning the arrest of TJ in connection with the biggest hashish case in Denmark. "I have helped TJ by keeping an eye on his operation when he was out fishing or at home with his family in Denmark, and I find it totally surprising that he has been arrested for smuggling hashish. He is not that type at all," Torben Hedemann says, having no idea as to what kind of people TJ has been in contact with in Denmark. "If he really is involved in this, he has either been enticed into it or pressured. His business in Gambia could not finance such a large investment.'' ``Many Danish sailors have been down here to help TJ with the fishing part of the business while he built up the project on land. It is my impression that these were people he knew from his time as a fisherman in Denmark.'' About six months ago, TJ got the idea of investing in a coastal vessel, and on 1 November he took over the Hela through his company Tarco Co. Ltd. from a captain from Bornholm for 1,050 million Danish kroner [as published]. Large Market for Coastal Vessels "There is a large market for small coastal vessels here where there is money to be made by carrying goods between the cities along the coast. The Hela has had many trips up and down the coast," Hedemann says. The coastal vessel was built in 1952 in Lubeck where she was launched with the name of Stellaria, but the ship was registered with Svenska Lloyd under the name Salome. In connection with the purchase in November the Hela's Danish flag was exchanged for a flag of convenience from the Latin American nation of Belize.
