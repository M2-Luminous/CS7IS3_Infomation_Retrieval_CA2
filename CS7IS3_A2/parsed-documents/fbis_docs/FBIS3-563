Important articles, about which the opposition and the parliament had disagreed before, were finally adopted in Kinshasa yesterday. Herve de Guelinck reports: [Guelinck] An agreement was reached yesterday on the autonomy of the Central Bank -- and this is no mean feat -- on the way regional governors are to be appointed, and on the government's responsibility. The transition rules are gradually getting clearer. Another eight articles remain to be debated, including the famous 76, which makes provisions for the way the prime minister should be appointed. That just shows how both sides are preparing for the final showdown, for which it will be necessary to know who is on which side, since good accounts make good friends. Each side is accusing the other of attempted corruption. The Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition and its allies say they possess a damning file indicating that the presidency has 120 million new zaires to convince some opposition counsellors to vote in favor of the ideas of the Political Forces of the Conclave. On the other hand, some newspapers have said that France and Belgium would pay those voting for Tshisekedi. Information or indoctrination? Monsengwo, the HCR-PT chairman, has forbidden counsellors to attend the debates with more than 5,000 new zaires in their pocket; that is, about 300 French francs. One is never too careful.
