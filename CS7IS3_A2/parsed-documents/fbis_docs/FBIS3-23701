Gerchik, V. Galyayev, V. Bryushinin, N. Lukovkin and V. Savinskiy, Council of Veterans of Baykonur Cosmodrome; "Space Mementos Under the Hammer"] [Text] The veterans of the Baykonur cosmodromes were shocked by the news of the sale of mementos of our cosmonautics at the Sotheby's auction in London. The fact that today cosmonautics is in decline and Baykonur for the time being is in a deep crisis are not reasons for consigning our space achievements to oblivion. The auction which was held caused us a feeling of bitterness and bewilderment. And gave rise to many questions. How could such a thing happen? Who gave permission for selling the national heritage of Russia? It is said that most of the 200 space rarities belonged to private parties. Is this so? But is the spacesuit of A. Leonov his own personal property? And the notebooks kept by S. Korolev and the manuscripts of K. Tsiolkovskiy? Whose are they? Neither Korolev nor Tsiolkovskiy can any longer exert control over them. Who then put them up for sale? At the auction Aleksey Leonov declared that the "history of Soviet cosmonautics should belong not only to the Russian people, but also to all world civilization." Yes, this is so. But is it necessary to sell our space mementos for this purpose? Was it not the pursuit of ready cash which darkened the reasoning of some Russian auction participants? Throughout the world norms have been adopted with respect to the monuments of literature, history, science and technology. These norms also exist in Russia. For example, a project is underway for the facsimile publication of Pushkin's rough notebooks. This will make it possible not only to preserve for centuries a national treasure of Russia, but also will broaden the numbers of researchers concerned with research on the creativity of the great poet. Was it not possible to act in the same way with the manuscripts of Tsiolkovskiy, the diaries of Korolev, Mishin and Feoktistov? It also is possible to exhibit our space mementos abroad... Is this not an example of displaying and publicizing our attainments and a means for rectifying the sad situation of the former designers, cosmonauts and their families? It seems to us that it is not only our cosmonautics which is in crisis, but also our moral values. After all, only this can explain the foreign sale of space vehicles, spacesuits and lunar ground by some space companies. This will scarcely save the space branch in Russia. And if we want to think about the future, a national space museum should be established.
