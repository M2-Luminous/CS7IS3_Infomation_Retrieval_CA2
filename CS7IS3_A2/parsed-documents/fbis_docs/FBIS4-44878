Naoaki Aizaki, Ken Nakajima, Satomi Hirasawa, and Yoshikatsu Kojima, pp 4-9 An 0.25 �m electron-beam direct writing technology has been developed for 256 M bit DRAM test fabrication. The following three key techniques have been improved and optimized: (1) a pattern data preparation technique for correcting proximity effect and reducing data conversion time; (2) a resist process technique for fabricating reliable fine patterns; (3) an electron-beam writing system technique for improving overlay accuracy. The overlay accuracy was improved to under 0.075 �m (average + 3 _s_), which is sufficient for the required alignment tolerance. Utilizing these techniques, a 256 M bit DRAM in a feature size of 0.25 �m was successfully fabricated. 3.3 V Single Power-Supply 64 M Bit Flash Memory. Toshio Takeshima, Hiroshi Sugawara, Hiroshi Takada, Yoshiaki Hisamune, Kohji Kanamori, Takeshi Okazawa, Tatsunori Murotani, and Isao Sasaki, pp 10-14 A 3.3 V single power-supply 64 M bit flash memory has been developed by using 0.4 �m CMOS technology. 50 ns access time and 256 bit erase/programming unit-capacity have been achieved by using hierarchical word-line and bit-line structure. Dynamic Bit-line Latch (DBL) programming scheme, which enables 256 bit simultaneous programming, has been developed. The chip measures 19.3mm by 13.3mm. Development of the Low Cost and High Voltage CMOS Process. Ken'ichiro Takahashi, Kousuke Yoshida, and Hideaki Horii, pp 15-18 EL (ElectroLuminescence) display, VFD (Vacuum Fluorescent Displays) and PDP (Plasma Display Panel) need a high operating voltage of more than 100 V. The junction isolating technology has been usually used for the EL, VFD and PDP drivers. However, the junction-isolating structure requires more process steps than self-isolating structure, such as buried layer formation, epitaxial layer growth, and isolating layer formation. Accordingly, the junction-isolating type IC is more expensive than the self-isolating type. NEC has developed the manufacturing process of self-isolating type for the EL, VFD and PDP driver ICs. The maximum rating voltage of this process is 150 V. Until NEC develops the process, NEC's maximum voltage of self-isolating type ICs was 80 V. From now on, most EL, VFD and PDP driver ICs will be supplied with inexpensive self-isolating technology. 500 MHz 32-Bit CMOS RISC Process. Hachiro Yamada, Yoichi Yano, and Isami Sakai, pp 19-25 NEC has developed a 500 MHz, 32-bit RISC microprocessor LSI using triple-level aluminum 0.4 �m CMOS technology. Its 32-bit data-path is designed with 8-stage pipeline architecture, which includes 2-stage 1 KB cache memories, 2-stage adders and a 2-stage barrel shifter. NEC has also developed several key technologies for high-speed LSIs, such as a level-short clock tree circuit, a low noise high-speed interface circuit, a low-bounce stacked power line, a high-density standard cell method, and a 500 MHz low jitter PLL circuit. About 200,000 transistors are integrated into a die area of 7.90mm x 8.84mm. The power dissipation is 6 W at a 3.3 V power supply and 500 MHz operating frequency. Multi Chip Module for the RISC Microprocessor. Mikio Baba, Teruhiko Konno, Yuichi Yoshida, Tsuneo Koike, Yumi Yoshida, Takahiro Fukui, and Ichiro Yoshida, pp 26-30 Needs for Multi Chip Module (MCM) are rapidly increasing, as electronic products are required to have size-reduction and high-performance. NEC has developed MCM technologies based on single-chip packages. This paper describes the technologies of the MCM containing a RISC microprocessor and cache memories in a conventional package. Miniaturized LCC Type Hybrid IC With Chip Capacitor and Resistor Components. Masao Ushigome, Osamu Ohnishi, Yoshifumi Moriyama, Futoshi Hosoya, and Yoshihito Kataoka, pp 31-33 LCC (Leadless Chip Carrier) type hybrid IC is a package which is established by joining COB (Chip On Board) assembling technology and manufacturing technology of epoxy-glass printed wiring boards. To meet requirements for high-frequency and high-performance, NEC has developed a new type of LCC package. This paper describes the new LCC type hybrid IC which contains chip capacitor and resistor components. Development of Ultra Fine Pitch (0.4, 0.3mm pitch) QFP. Takayuki Uno, Masato Aiba, Satoshi Takahashi, and Yasuhiro Suzuki, pp 34-37 NEC has developed ultra fine pitch (0.4, 0.3mm pitch) QFPs to satisfy the requirements of size-reduction and high-performance of electronics. This paper discusses the ultra high pin count QFP for higher density and performance LSI devices. These QFPs have been developed by realizing new technologies: the design method using simulation, and the package structure using TAB tape. As a result, NEC has developed 376 pin QFP (0.4 mm pitch, [square] 40 mm, 3.2 mm[.sup]t[/]) and 504 pin LQFP (Low-profile QFP, 0.3mm pitch, [square] 40 mm, 1.4mm[.sup]t[/]). Development of On-Line System for Wafer Sort Process. Haruo Amano, Tetsunori Maeda, Yuji Miyagi, Michio Honma, Toshihiko Kikuchi, Yoshihiro Miyajima, Masahide Ozawa, Kenichi Nagatome, Mamoru Maki, and Shigeo Fujino, pp 38-42 As wafer sort process becomes multiple processes, such improvements as the reduction of mis-operation, the achievement of high efficiency in operation, and higher accuracy in test data collection have been required. For these improvements, NEC has developed a wafer sort on-line system as NEC's standard system. The system, called WITS, has been installed in Roseville plant of NEC Electronics Inc. (U.S.A.). In the WITS system, all the test and sort equipment are controlled through Ethernet by the line control system, which is connected to the production control system and transacts data with each other. Regarding operation, the worker's job is only to input the LOT-ID barcode. Receiving the data, the system can set the testing parameter automatically, and testing can start easily. As a result, mis-operation and pre-operation time can be greatly reduced, and low yield trend or causes can be detected early. This wafer sort on-line system has increased production efficiency, and is currently operating well. Acquisition of ISO9000 Certification in NEC Semiconductor Group. Tsutomu Igarashi, Teruo Muroya, Teruo Hidaka, Mineki Fukumoto, and Takenori Kanasaki, pp 43-48 ISO9000 quality assurance system was enacted in 1987 and more than 50 countries have already implemented it. In Japan, it was implemented as Japan Industrial Standard (JIS), and in 1993 the Japan Accreditation Board Quality System Registration (JAB) was established. Under these status, as for all NEC semiconductor business unit in Japan, divisions with design functions have been qualified for the ISO9001 and subsidiary companies with manufacturing functions have also been qualified for the ISO9002. In the acquisition period, we specified the job area promoted in terms of both the whole group and each unit, then we encouraged assigned members. This paper describes troubleness, usefulness or effectiveness by examples from the divisions and subsidiaries. Development of Radiation-Hardened HCMOS Logic ICs in Excess of a Total Dose of 10 kGy (Si).

They have the total dose tolerance in excess of 10 kGy (Si) and conform to NASDA-QTS-38510A. They will be used for the Japanese Experimental Module (JEM) to be attached to the space station that will be launched and assembled on orbit from 1998. NEC Semiconductor Device Information System. Ichiro Miyazawa, Yoichi Shikata, Tomihiro Ishihara, Tohru Kamisaki, Hiroshi Yamamoto, Akio Tanaka, Hiromi Yokoyama, Syuji Suzuki, and Seiji Miyamoto, pp 55-60 NEC uses a variety of methods to provide technical information on semiconductors both inside and outside the company. Among a large amount of information, product information is provided as printed material, including data sheets, user's manuals, and regular publications. However, due to the quick technical innovations in the field of semiconductors, the volume of information is rapidly increasing, and information is greatly varying. There has thus arisen the need on a computer-based retrieval system for efficiently retrieved specific information from a mass of information available. This paper describes the technical information support system, especially NESDIS (NEC Semiconductor Device Information System), and also gives an outline of the future trend in information services. On-Line Japanese Character Recognition on a V810 RISC Microprocessor.

This recognition system employs a hierarchical classification technique based on flexible template matching, which frees users from the constraints of stroke order and connectivity in handwriting. Handy pen-based computing with highly user-friendly Japanese recognition can be realized using the V810, with its high cost-performance and low power consumption. Development of 64 M Bit DRAM. Yoshinori Matsui, Akihiko Kagami, Shyuichi Tsukada, Toru Chonan, Shigeo Chishiki, Yoshiaki Yamada, Takaho Tanigawa, Haruo Iwasaki, Hiroki Koga, Shozo Nishimoto, Shinichi Kuwabara, and Yasuhito Takeuchi, pp 69-73 NEC has developed the world's latest commercial 64 M bit DRAM. This paper discusses the new process and circuit techniques in the 64 M bit DRAM. Bit organization is x 4/x 8/x 16, packed in SOJ and TSOP(II) by LOC (Lead On Chip) technology. The Triple Well process technique and new boost circuit scheme have achieved the fastest access time of 38 ns at Ta = 70�C and VCC = 3.0 V. Regarding spec value, RAS access time is 50 ns, cycle time is 90 ns and operating current is 100 mA. The dual wordline scheme with distributed wordline driver circuit has made it possible to use the conventional lithography technique, rather than complicated lithography schemes like multi-layer photo resist and phase shifting technique. Thus, it has successfully reduced the manufacturing cost. High-Speed DRAMs. Toshihiko Sato, Toru Ishikawa, Shoji Kaneko, Hiroshi Nakayama, Yasuhiro Nonaka, and Tomoko Kobayashi, pp 74-83 NEC has developed three types of high speed DRAM. They have been revolutionarily improved in the data transfer rate by using 0.45 �m CMOS process as the most advanced fabrication technology and the latest circuit technology. One is hyper page DRAM.

These high-speed static RAMs comprise the following types: �PD46258/9/8L/9L (256K bit), �PD461008/9/8L/9L/16L/18L (1M bit). In consideration of the high density in mounting; the �PD46258/9/8L/9L are packed in 32 pin-300 mil width plastic SOJ, the �PD461008/8L in 32 pin-400 mil SOJ, the �PD461009/9L in 36 pin-400 mil SOJ, and the �PD461016L/18L in 44 pin-400 mil SOJ or TSOP. These high-speed BiCMOS static RAMs use an 0.5 �m double layer aluminum process, high-performance transistors, an optimized layout plan, and a voltage regulator that keeps the internal circuit voltage constant. 288 K Bit Ultra High-Speed Synchronous ECL SRAM. Hiroyuki Takahashi, Hisamitsu Kimoto, Masahumi Mitsuishi, Masakazu Sasaki, and Takahisa Migita, pp 89-92 NEC has developed a 32 K x 9 bit synchronous static RAM with the cycle time of 6 ns and the access time of 3 ns, which are the world's fastest. This high-speed SRAM family with the ECL I/O interface consists of two types of product, which have the different synchronous circuits of register and latch. A low power consumption of 0.9 W has enabled the adoption of plastic package, that is 52 pin PLCC. This performance has been achieved by 0.5 �m BiCMOS process technology, new circuit technology (for instance, the differential BiCMOS register), and layout technology for noise reduction.
