He said his country is waiting to see what the UN Security Council and other international quarters concerned with peace, security, and rights, will do, especially since dialogue and talks between Iraq and the United Nations are proceeding in a good and objective manner. In a statement to the JORDANIAN NEWS AGENCY in Baghdad, Ramadan denied the accusation leveled at his country every now and then that it is obstructing the work of international inspection teams. He said: What we want to see first is an evaluation of things within the framework of UN Security Council Resolution 687 despite its unfairness as it was imposed in the time of tyranny and hegemony. He noted that Iraq accepted Resolution 715 which was not mentioned previously, adding that this resolution calls for installing long-term monitoring cameras. He said: We believed that this was the only thing that would obstruct the talks and settlement of differences with the United Nations. He stressed that the maneuvers and accusations against Iraq, which usually precede reviewing the decision to lift the blockade, are false accusations. Ramadan said that the imposition of the blockade was not just a punishment for an act of encroachment; namely, entering Kuwait, but is aimed against Iraq, its entity, accomplishments, potentials, and resources. He added that the sanctions imposed on Iraq -- which encroached on every inch of its land and which deprived its people of food, water, medicine, and all basic needs -- also aim at creating confusion and chaos in addition to fabricating lies one time after another. The objective, he added, is to implement their schemes and fabricate accusations that Iraq dropped chemical weapons on the shiites in the marshlands, southern Iraq. Iraq has called on the inspection teams and the states of the world to visit the area and verify our statements. Asked about a scheduled visit by Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz to the United Nations during the next few days and the issues to be focused on during his talks, Ramadan said that the essential point in Iraq's program is to reach a formula to fully lift the economic embargo on Iraq, whether all at once or gradually. He said: Our stand vis-a-vis this matter is firm. We do not accept partial things, because the economic embargo is not on oil only. We categorically reject the formula which they are trying to impose on us. He said: They want us to sell limited quantities of oil. We consider this a blatant interference in our national sovereignty and with our potentials. This is one of the most controversial points. Furthermore, we firmly believe that this unjust formula which they are trying to impose on us will become a curtain for them to hide behind while continuing to impose the embargo. Although we do not deny the importance of oil as one of the major pillars of our country's economy, the other economic potentials, which existed in the past and which will appear in the future, are not less important. In addition to the natural resources which exist in Iraq, we became capable of production in the industrial, agricultural, mineral, and human fields. Ramadan denied the rumors that Iraq possesses a number of long-range nuclear missiles installed by the United States in Kuwait to strike at the Soviet Union before it was divided. He said that these baseless rumors aim at showing that Iraq still possesses such weapons, and consequently, it should be pursued and pressure on it should continue. He stressed that a number of countries such as Spain, Greece, Switzerland, Britain, and Australia have released part of the Iraqi assets to finance the purchase of food and medicine supplies. He expressed his regret, however, that some Arab countries have not yet released the Iraqi assets they hold. He announced that his country is willing to forget the past, to deal with and normalize relations with any party, even with the United States, based on its principles and convictions and according to new calculations that take everything that has happened into consideration.
