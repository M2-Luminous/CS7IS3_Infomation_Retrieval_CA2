Sanusi, who was jailed for subversion, was released from the Cipinang Correction Center in Jakarta on Friday. His release followed the earlier release of A.M. Fatwa, Abdul Qadir Jaelani, Rahmat Basuki, and a number of other political detainees. Sanusi was released in a very simple and quiet ceremony at 1045 West Indonesian Standard Time yesterday in contrast to the earlier release of a number of his friends. "I am very happy," Sanusi told REPUBLIKA last night. Present during the ceremony yesterday were Alamsyah Bur, head of the Jakarta Regional Office of the Department of Justice; Suharto, head of the Cipinang Correction Center; his five sons and six grandchildren, and his friends Dr. Anwar Harjono and A.M. Fatwa. Sanusi himself learned of his imminent release on Thursday morning. "I intentionally did not inform my friends about it," he said. Sanusi had undergone the resocialization process since November 1993. He was sentenced to 19 years in prison by the Central Jakarta District Court in 1985 for allegedly masterminding the explosion of a number of Bank Central Asia offices. He was later sentenced in the same year to 20 years for alleged involvement in the explosion of the Borobudur Temple. The second verdict was, however, annulled by the Supreme Court. He was released conditionally on Friday after serving two-thirds [as published] of his jail term. Having been in prison for almost 10 years, the man, who was born in Klaten on 28 November 1920, however, spoke enthusiastically. He was even not reluctant to talk about his life. "Let's talk about politics," said Sanusi when asked about the technical aspects of his release. The former industry minister of the Republic of Indonesia in the Ampera Cabinet from 1966 to 1968 said that he would again be involved in social and mass activities after performing a hajj pilgrimage. "I have not changed," he said enthusiastically. Sanusi, who was an official of the Muhammadiyah [an Islamic sociocultural and educational organization] Central Executive Board from 1965 to 1985, said that he would strive to implement three main programs. First, he will strive for the democratization process in Indonesia. According to him, conglomeration, corruption, and the like stem from the stalled democratic development in Indonesia. In this regard, Sanusi vowed to remain critical of government policies. "But, I remain constructive," he continued. He claimed to have prepared a number of concepts to cope with these problems.
