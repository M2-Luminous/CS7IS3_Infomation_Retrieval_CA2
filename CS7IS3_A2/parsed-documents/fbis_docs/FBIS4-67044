In addition, the Colombian Government, because it believes the necessary climate of constructive understanding between the two governments is not being served, flatly rejects the fact that a political leader, in this instance Senator John Kerry, has used his post and the post's inherent prerogatives, such as the legislative branch's political control procedures, to grant privileges to, listen to, and believe false charges by a confessed criminal against Colombia, its institutions, the private sector, and even the media. Such a position represents an attack on Colombian society and its authorities because it casts a shadow of suspicion and implies corruption, or at least general complicity with drug traffickers, in a country which is well-known to have made the greatest possible sacrifices and which has achieved the greatest results in the struggle against this scourge. The Colombian Government expects that judicial cooperation between the two countries can return to normal and that the channels of dialogue, exchange of ideas, and joint work between judicial authorities of the two countries can be kept open. To achieve this, the best possible joint efforts should be made to overcome any disagreements resulting from the difficulties inherent in the handling of such a complex matter. Finally, the Colombian Foreign Ministry wants to underscore the importance of cooperation because the absence of this can benefit only our common enemies--those interested in fanning the fires of discord and (putting obstacles) in the path of justice. [Signed] Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin
