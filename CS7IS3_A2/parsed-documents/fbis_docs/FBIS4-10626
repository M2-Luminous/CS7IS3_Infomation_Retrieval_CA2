I believe every Panamanian is sadder now than he was an hour ago. We have relived our past, scenes of our past. Our party was a main player in the struggle against the dictatorship and paid dearly for this in lives and material losses. This reminds the Panamanian people, however, that we must remember the past and avoid the mistakes made in the past and avoid returning to the past. Today, I would like to invite the Panamanian people to look forward. I would like to call on all the candidates to set their sights on the future. In the hopes of doing this, I made a friendly call in good faith to all the presidential candidates to join us and enter into a pact with the people to ensure a better future for all Panamanians and to assure us we will not return to those days of which we were reminded on television this evening. [Reporter] How would you describe the [words indistinct] president of the Republic? [Vallarino] This was simply a little sample of what happened in the past 22 years. This was something most Panamanians did not experience, because they were too young. Today's voters do not really know what happened between 1968 and 1989, when the dictatorship ended. Knowing our history is very important and this is part of our history. As I said earlier, it hurts to remember, but we must remember it. Just as I say it hurts to remember I also say it is necessary to look to the future. We must propose and present a better future to the Panamanian people. We can do this together. Once again I call on all civilians throughout the country, especially the presidential candidates, to join in a great crusade for the good of Panama. [Reporter] What political effect will this have only three weeks before the elections? [Vallarino] I do believe this will have a political effect. There are too many people who for one reason or another forget too quickly. There are others who knew nothing of this. This will help the Panamanian people do what they must do; that is, remember that voting is a serious thing and that our future and our children's future depends on this election. Let's not make another mistake. Let's look to the future with optimism, and let's remember the past carefully.
