This appeal was made by Tyll Necker, the president of the Federal Association of German Industry [BDI], at a congress of his organization in Bonn on the issue of "Germany's Role in the World." Positive developments have already taken place in some spheres, Necker said, referring to the Federal Government's Asia concept. Even now, Germany is the most important trading partner for many Asian countries, but the results are lagging behind expectations. German exports and the technology transfer to this part of the world only account for 10 percent of German foreign trade. German investment in the Asian-Pacific region amounts to 3-4 percent of total foreign investments. It is important not only to increase exports to promising regions but to be present on location and to invest, Necker emphasized. One has to think of new forms of cooperation with local companies. "Package solutions that not only supply plants but also run them, thus earning funding and payment, are necessary," he said. The BDI president sharply criticized the trend toward new protectionism in connection with environmental and social standards. This is not the right instrument to secure international environmental standards or standards for employees. Lower wage costs are often the only competitive advantage developing countries have. Necker demanded that they should not be stripped of this advantage. At the Congress, Saarland Minister President Oskar Lafontaine, of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], warned against hasty European monetary union. As a result of economic developments, the Maastricht timetable cannot be kept. Lafontaine said that "any automatism would be fatal." He called for better coordination between national banks in the European Union [EU]. National strategies are anachronistic. The deputy SPD chairman came out in favor of a joint European approach to solving problems such as unemployment. Lafontaine emphasized that common European foreign and security policy must start from cooperation between Bonn/Berlin and Paris. Wolfgang Schaeuble, chairman of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] Bundestag group, called for a collective approach to solve international security policy. Maintaining the ability to be a good member in the alliance and a good partner is of top priority, but greater emphasis must also go to elements of development and environmental policy. NATO and the European Union must be further consolidated. Within the framework of growing international responsibility, Germany must participate in the military protection of stability with equal rights and duties, Schaeuble demanded. Peace and security cannot be had for free. [passage omitted]
