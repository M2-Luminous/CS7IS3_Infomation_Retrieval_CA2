FBIS TRENDS-25MAY94-Russia/Ukr Russia-Ukraine Russia-Ukraine BSF Command Fuels Russia-Ukraine Tensions in Krym SUMMARY Russia's Black Sea Fleet (BSF) command appears to be making common cause with the new Pro-Russian Crimean leadership, criticizing Ukraine on BSF issues and supporting Crimean officials' calls for a role in Ukrainian-Russian negotiations over the division of the former Soviet fleet. Most recently, the BSF command has appeared to deliberately fuel Russian-Ukrainian tensions and aggravate the already difficult relationship between Krym and Ukraine by spreading incendiary and unsubstantiated rumors about Ukrainian military actions in Krym. END SUMMARY Russian Black Sea Fleet officials have made repeated attacks on Ukrainian stands in the BSF talks and demanded that the Crimean Government be brought into Russian-Ukrainian negotiations over the fleet: -- Following the 21-22 April round of talks on the status of the fleet, the BSF Press Center issued a statement criticizing the Ukrainian side as being "unprepared for compromise" and for insisting that the Russian BSF and Ukrainian Navy both be stationed in Sevastopol. The statement said that the Ukrainian position contradicted "not only the logic of military organizational development . . . and the will of the presidents" but also the latest decisions of the Sevastopol City Soviet that the Ukrainian fleet should be moved (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 28 April). -- In a joint statement on 26 April, BSF Commander Admiral Eduard BaIt in, Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov, and Chairman of the Sevastopol City Soviet Viktor Semyonov appeared to blame Ukraine for the breakdown of the latest round of talks on 21 April, charging that "struggles for political power and the Ukrainian presidency" could turn the negotiations into a "military conflict." The statement decried "attempts" to "lay blame for a possible break-up of Ukraine's statehood" on Krym and urged the Russian and Ukrainian presidents to resume talks and "act as guarantors of peace" in Krym (ITAR-TASS, 26 April). -- In an interview with Interfax on 26 April, Chief of the BSF Headquarters Rear Admiral Petr Svyatashov criticized Ukraine's insistence that Meshkov be excluded from negotiations between Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy. Svyatashov accused Radetskyy of placing himself above the law, asserting that Ukrainian legislation--which states that the Crimean leadership must be informed of the establishment of new military units and the disposition of troops--justifies Crimean involvement in the talks. BSF Stokes Crimean-Ukrainian Disputes In addition to taking anti-Ukrainian stands on issues related to the BSF itself, the BSF command appears to have exacerbated the potential for Crimean-Ukrainian conflict by issuing unsubstantiated reports of Ukrainian troop movements. After Crimean Acting Internal Affairs Minister Valeriy Kuznetsov claimed to the Crimean legislature on 18 May that Ukrainian Deputy Internal Affairs Minister Valentin Nedryhaylo and spetsnaz troops had attempted a "coup" against the Crimean leadership (UNIAN, 19 May), sources from the BSF Headquarters were cited in ITAR-TASS as reporting that "Ukrainian home guards and special forces numbering 1,000" and a "group of saboteur swimmers" had been dispatched to Krym (19 May), and that a Ukrainian military field hospital was being set up in Kherson Oblast preparing to receive wounded people from Ktym "in the near future" (Kiev World Service, 19 May). Neither of these reports has been confirmed by other media. In at least one case, Russian media have censured the BSF command for its inflammatory statements. A 4 May Izvestiya article entitled "Black Sea Fleet Press Center Continues to Spread Disinformation" asserted that citizens of the CIS "suffer acutely from [a] misunderstanding" of Russian-Ukrainian relations as a result of news agencies "succumbing" to "manipulation" by the BSF Press Center. The article highlighted early May media coverage of an allegedly "wicked" attack on the official car carrying the wife of BSF Commander Baltin, and countered that, according to the Sevastopol internal affairs chief, Major General V. Beloborodov, the BSF official car tried a "double-pass," nearly causing a collision, prompting the other driver involved--an excitable person"--to express his feelings toward the driver and Baltin's wife "in uncensored form." The Sevastopol Internal Affairs Administration stated officially that there had been no "attack" on Admiral Baltin's wife. Crimean Position on BSF These stands by the BSF leadership have supported demands put forward by Meshkov and other officials in Simferopol and Sevastopol to play a prominent role in the talks: -- Meshkov reportedly stated that it would be "most logical" if the BSF question were resolved by Krym and Russia alone (ITAR- TASS, 5 May). In a press conference after his 30 January election victory, Meshkov was quoted as saying that the fleet must "be a single unit, belong to Russia, and be based at Sevastopol" (Interfax, 2 February). -- On the Russian Defense Ministry's "Slavyanka" program, Crimean Deputy Premier Yevgeniy Saburov sharply criticized Ukraine for attempting to reap the economic benefits--which he claimed rightfully belonged to Krym--of a BSF settlement with Russia. Saburov asserted that Ukraine's refusal to allow full Crimean representation in the talks suggested a "mercenary interest in making use of the benefits of the Russian proposal" and demanded that any decisions must "benefit Sevastopol, the fleet, and the families of the sailors who live there." He also stated flatly that a joint fleet is "out of the question . . . it must be a Russian fleet" (Moscow Radio, 12 May). -- Chairman of the Sevastopol Administration Mykola Hlushkov, in an appeal to Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk, reportedly deemed it "necessary" that Sevastopol city leaders take part in BSF negotiations to ensure that Russia and Ukraine address the question of economic assistance to the region (UNIAR, 28 April). -- After discussing the BSF issue, the Sevastopol City Soviet reportedly recommended to Kiev that the Ukrainian Navy headquarters and other installations be relocated out of Sevastopol (Segodnya, 21 April). Ukraine Rebuffs BSF, Minimizes Crimean Role While Ukrainian official statements have in the past criticized actions and statements by the BSF command (Kiev Radio Ukraine World Service, 16 March; Kiev Ukraine Radio, 14 April), Kiev recently appears to have stepped up its rhetoric against the BSF command's actions. Following the coup rumors, a 19 May Ukrainian Defense Ministry statement vehemently decried the "misinformation" circulated by the BSF as "malicious falsehoods carrying out open subversive activities" on Ukraine's sovereign territory (Kiev World Service, 19 May). Ukrainian officials have consistently tried to exclude Krym from the BSF negotiations. Although Kravchuk in a 26 April Rossiyskiye Vesti interview acknowledged that Krym has a "role" in the talks, he emphasized the need to "ensure that Krym does not drive [Ukraine and Russia] or their peoples apart." Nezavisimaya Gazeta on 22 April reported that, before the 21 April BSF negotiations began at the BSF Headquarters in Sevastopol, Radetskyy declared that the talks could riot proceed "with the participation or even in the presence of" Meshkov or Sevastopol's Semenov, both of whom subsequently left the room. A "high-ranking" Ukrainian diplomat was quoted as saying that resolution of the BSF issue requires that Ukraine "reject the politicking of the Crimeans and talk with the real owners of the fleet" (Izvestiya, 15 April). Outlook The apparent BSF support for the Crimean leadership and its spreading of the inflammatory rumors are likely to fuel Ukrainian suspicions of Russian meddling in Krym and intransigence over division of the BSF. If not checked, these BSF actions risk providing Kiev with its own pretext for intransigence in the negotiations or, at worst, provoking Ukraine to additional actions to assert what it views as its legitimate authority in Krym.
