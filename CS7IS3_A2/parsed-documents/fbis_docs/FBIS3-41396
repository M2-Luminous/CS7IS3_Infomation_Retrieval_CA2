And he admitted in reply to questions from Independent TD Tony Gregory that the figure could be as high as 7,000. "However, it's estimated that--excluding persons attending the community services established by the Eastern Health Board--approximately 1,850 persons are receiving treatment for drug abuse in various treatment centres." A total 352 people are on the methadone and maintenance programmes in the satellite clinics and a number of others are receiving treatment from general practitioners. The services now in place and those being developed have been introduced as a result of the strategies prepared by the National Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse and the National AIDS Strategy Committee, explained the Minister. And he told the TD: "The deputy can be assured I regard this area as a priority and have made provision in the 1994 estimates to develop these services further." Mr Gregory said that in spite of very dedicated staff the satellite clinics provided "little more than a Band Aid service." In some instances two counsellors were looking after in excess of 100 addicts, and a waiting list of nearly 200 others.
