The organization says that it has received a Russian report according to which nuclear submarines to be scrapped from the Russian Pacific Fleet are also being brought to a submarine shipyard near Archangel. According to Bellona's information, this concerns 150 submarines which have a total of 278 nuclear reactors. The Norwegian environmental organization assumes that Russia will continue dumping reactors into the Kara Sea in the summer. According to Bellona, this is indicated by the fact, among other things, that Russia did not sign the London treaty banning the dumping of nuclear substances into the sea, which became valid at the beginning of last week. Bellona today published in Murmansk its extensive research report on radio-active emissions in the Kola area.
