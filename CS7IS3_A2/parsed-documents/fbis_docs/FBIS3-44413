Provincial party committee Secretary Xie Shijie yesterday attended and relayed the spirit of the sixth provincial party committee second plenary session at the study class at which provincial party committee Deputy Secretary Qin Yuqin also made a speech. Secretary Xie Shijie pointed out in his speech: The sixth provincial party committee second plenary session, which concluded on 21 December, had implemented to the letter the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the spirit of a recently concluded national economic work conference. The important plenary session had also made specific arrangements for Sichuan's work in 1994. After briefly reviewing Sichuan's work in 1993, Secretary Xie Shijie spelled out the following tasks and requirements for 1994: 1. To strive to acquire a correct understanding of the current situation, enhance a sense of opportunity, press ahead with all- round development, and intensify a sense of historical responsibility. 2. To closely integrate reform, opening up, and construction, adopt an overall point of view, concentrate on key aspects of work, and quicken the pace of economic development. 3. To keep close watch over new developments and new problems, continually and firmly grasp two key aspects of work at the same time, safeguard social stability, and push ahead with social progress and development. Comrade Qin Yuqin stated in his speech: During 15 days of theory study, county party committee secretaries from across Sichuan have conscientiously studied Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, all documents issued by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and the spirit of the recently concluded national economic work conference. They also listened to a number of work reports and scored relatively gratifying results in theory study. Thanks to these study activities, all county party committee secretaries have now acquired an in-depth understanding of the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, which constitutes the essence of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, as well as the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, which constitutes the main theme of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. They have also further emancipated their minds, successfully removed a variety of ideological obstacles hampering Sichuan's development, deepened their understanding of such a question as why a socialist market economic structure should be built, enhanced comprehension of the basic principle underpinning socialism with Chinese characteristics which is continually and firmly grasping two key work aspects at the same time. Comrade Qin Yuqin also called for continually and profoundly studying and conscientiously implementing all strategic tasks laid down at the 14th CPC National Congress, further updating ideological concepts, and cultivating a fine style among broad masses of party members and cadres, especially leading cadres at and above the county level, in order that all comrades will attach importance to theory study and respect science.
