Effectively this decree suspends the publication of all newspapers and journals, since the 25-30-percent increase in the value of printing enterprises' fixed capital is leading to approximately a 500-percent increase in prices for printing services! This cannot be borne either by a single publishing house, even the most prosperous one, or the reader, who has already paid newspaper and journal subscriptions and at excessively high prices. Alas, however hard this is to come to terms with, yet another cruel blow is being aimed at the press, glasnost, freedom of speech, and what are virtually Russian democracy's most significant achievements. Each time it follows the peak of the latest political action, in this case the Federal Assembly elections. It is even somehow embarrassing to recall the government's repeated promises to sort out the questions relating to prices for printed publications, mail service chaos, and customs barriers hindering newspaper and journal distribution. The promise to privatize printing bases with the participation of journalists was simply not kept.... Concerned by the situation that has developed, on 30 December leaders of the Union of Journalists of Russia, the Union of Journalists of Moscow, the Association of Publishers and Chief Editors, the Committee To Protect Freedom of Speech and Journalists' Rights, and the Foundation for the Protection of Glasnost, as well as the chief editors of almost all central and leading Moscow newspapers, delivered a statement to Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. The appeal suggests avoiding this blow against freedom of speech either by means of targeted subsidies or by establishing a special procedure for implementing this decree in the spheres of printing, mail, communications, and paper production. Otherwise, the appeal says, "we will have no option but to appeal to readers and to the people, urging and asking them to defend their newspapers and journals, their right to be well-informed on matters of state, society, and the world.... Finally, our journalists' collectives will simply have to stop work, and this means that both print shops and publishing houses will be idle. We state that we are prepared to suspend the publication of our publications as early as in the 'parliamentary week' -- from 10 through 17 January 1994." The journalists are not joking. Yesterday at a press conference in which leaders of the Union of Journalists of Russia, the Union of Journalists of Moscow, the chief editors of KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA, NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, VECHERNYAYA MOSKVA, and MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, IZVESTIYA's deputy chief editor, and others took part, the formation of a strike committee by Moscow newspapers was announced. The government has virtually ignored the appeal. Although, for the sake of objectivity it must be admitted that when the conference was drawing to an end a possible 5 January meeting between Russian Federation Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and members of the Association of Publishers and Chief Editors was announced, citing Boris Mironov, acting chairman of the Russian Federation Committee for the Press.... Vsevolod Bogdanov, chairman of the Union of Journalists of Russia, stressed that the impending action is a forced measure. According to him the final decision whether to carry out the protest action will be made 5 January. [Knyazkov ends] The following natural question is probably being asked by readers: How do KRASNAYA ZVEZDA staffers react to their colleagues' statements and actions? What will they do if other publishing houses' publications are suspended? KRASNAYA ZVEZDA is a newspaper with special status, a military newspaper. Most of its journalists wear shoulder boards. A strike, the suspension of publishing, which to our civilian colleagues are a legal if extreme form of protest, would be a grave violation of the law to us. We cannot fail to take into account that in the current conditions the central military newspaper is often the most important or else the only source of information for many Army and Navy garrisons and units, including remote ones. At the same time KRASNAYA ZVEZDA workers are, of course, in solidarity with the protest action by Russian publications' journalists. Everything they are protesting -- the monopolists' price diktat, the destruction of the press distribution system, the state mail service's disgraceful work, the creation of artificial customs and currency barriers hindering a newspaper's contact with its readers -- all this is very familiar indeed to us too, we are constantly experiencing all this for ourselves. The government's latest act in reevaluating fixed assets is hitting KRASNAYA ZVEZDA hard too. We add our voice to that of our colleagues and urge that measures be urgently taken to create acceptable conditions in which the newspaper market and the distribution system can function. The survival of the press is now at stake.
