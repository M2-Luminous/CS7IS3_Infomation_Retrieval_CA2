The newspaper's editor in chief, Domas Sniukas, said the decision to change the name was made by the board of the closed joint-stock company Tiesa. "Some supported and some were against the decision," Sniukas said. TIESA was founded in 1917 as a communist paper. During post-war years it was the official newspaper of the Lithuanian Communist Party and was "reorganized" in 1990. The newspaper represents the interests of the ruling Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party. TIESA, with its daily circulation of 30,000, is the fourth biggest newspaper in Lithuania. It will have 24 pages starting July 1. Sniukas said the paper will become livelier and popular with "more non-politics and non-economics." Professional skills of the 30-member staff is still the newspaper's main problem, he said. In Sniukas' words, the daily will now pay more attention to sale but not subscription.
