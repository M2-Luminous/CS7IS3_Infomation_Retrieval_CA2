These problems are also on the horizon for other industrialized countries, with the exception of Japan and Ireland, which over the past four years have eased public debt pressure on the GDP, but they are particularly evident in Italy where the deficit is far above the GDP and pension costs represent 21 percent of public spending, the highest among the Group of Seven (G-7) most industrialized countries. The pension question in Italy will become even more serious following last week's ruling by the Italian supreme Constitutional Court that even those with more than one pension could benefit from minimum pension treatment. A ruling that was retroactive to 1984 and could cost Italy as much as 10 billion dollars. According to BIS calculations, the pressure of pension costs on the Italian GDP will double in 50 years, passing from 11 percent in 1990 to 22 percent in the year 2040. Italy, like many other countries, is seeking to raise the retirement age, reduce benefits and introduce retirement funds. These measures, the BIS pointed out, aim at defusing the pension "bomb" and give public budget more flexibility. "Given the future pressure caused by the general aging of the population" the BIS report said, "and the pressure this will exert on public spending, a phenomena which has already hurt the credibility of economic authorities in the current recessive phase, many governments will have no choice except move towards tight fiscal policies which aim at consolidating the debt to ward off undesired effects on financial markets". Last year, the BIS report recalled using OECD data, Italy's net deficit reached 112 percent of its GDP, up fro 96 percent in 1989, greater than the average 10 percentage point growth among G-7 countries. The BIS also warned about the "vulnerability" of public debt in connection with interest rates, stressing how "In Italy some 65 percent of the deficit is at short-term rates or at an index adjusted rate. This makes it highly susceptible to rate fluctuation," as demonstrated in the 1992-93 currency crisis. "The credibility of economic authorities and budget plans" the BIS report observed, "plays an essential role in determining changes in fiscal policies. Medium-term budget plans, in order to have an effect on the level of debt, public spending and interest rates, must generate positive expectations." [passage omitted]
