Sladkov; from the "Vesti" newscast] [Text] In the range of problems connected with insuring our country's security, the main question is the protection of Russia's present borders. This view was expressed by Valeriy Manilov, deputy secretary of the Russian Security Council, at a meeting with journalists today. Preserving Russia's unique scientific and military-scientific technology, halting the outflow of intellectual and scientific potential to the West, stabilizing Russian policy in the Asia- Pacific region, and solving the problem of the Black Sea Fleet should become equally important areas of the Security Council's work, Valeriy Manilov said. The increasingly unstable economy is a source of considerable danger for the country, Valeriy Manilov believes. The Security Council intends to play a special role in the further establishment of Russian political links with the United States and the countries of Western Europe. The first step is the prompt examination of options for Russia's entry to the Partnership for Peace program. [Begin Manilov recording] There is a pressing need to consider all the consequences and results of joining, and above all, to take account of Russia's status as a great power by definition.
