He stressed: At present, special efforts should be made to solve the issues on the understanding, basic ideas, and methods for successfully carrying out political and ideological work under the market economic conditions. It is necessary to create a brand-new situation in the political work of the people's courts and make new contributions to building a court contingent with strong fighting capacity that can be greatly trusted by the party and the people and guaranteeing the comprehensive fulfillment of all work tasks of courts.
