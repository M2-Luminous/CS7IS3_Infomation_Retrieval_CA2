Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri yesterday expressed "surprise" that the envoy had chosen to go public with his remarks instead of conveying his message directly to him when they met on Monday. While refusing to comment directly on Mr. Lambertson's statement, Army Chief Gen. Wimon Wongwanit said he felt "deeply bitter" after hearing the accusation. The sour reaction by Mr. Prasong and Gen. Wimon was sparked by Ambassador Lambertson's speech at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Thailand on Thursday night, when he expressed concern over the alleged ongoing cross-border contacts between Thailand and the Khmer Rouge, saying the U.S. wanted the Khmer Rouge to be isolated. The U.S. envoy also questioned the implementation of Thailand's policy which "has at times been less than clear." Foreign Minister Prasong conceded that cross-border contacts with the Khmer Rouge continued due to the close relations between Thais and members of the Khmer Rouge which were forged a long time ago. But he insisted that the contacts had nothing to do with the Government because Thailand had sealed the border and banned trade with the guerrilla faction in accordance with a resolution of the United Nations Security Council. "We honored the resolution of the United Nations Security Council," Sqn. Ldr. Prasong reiterated. "But the fact that the Khmer Rouge have maintained contacts with people in the area is due to their relations from the past," he added. The UN Security Council issued a resolution early last year requiring countries neighboring Cambodia [to] close the border and stop trading with the Khmer Rouge. The Foreign Minister said he was surprised as to why the U.S. envoy did not raise his concerns over the border contacts with him when the two met at the Foreign Ministry on Monday. Mr. Lambertson accompanied Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs John Shattuck on a visit to the Foreign Ministry. Sqn. Ldr. Prasong seemed to be furious at complaints filed by other countries that Thailand maintains contacts with the guerrilla faction, so much so that he raised the matter with Australian Ambassador to Thailand John McCarthy, who called on him yesterday. The Foreign Minister even challenged those who made the allegation to visit the border with him to clarify their suspicions. "From now I will invite any individual or groups who make allegations against Thailand to inspect the border with me so they can see the facts with their own eyes," he said. Sqn. Ldr. Prasong said the Khmer Rouge has not been outlawed and continues to have contact with the Cambodian government. Gen. Wimon said the allegation that the Thai military was still backing the Khmer Rouge made him feel bitter. Gen. Wimon said the allegation, though incorrect, was accepted as the truth by a number of people who did not know any better. "We have to have faith in Thai people and the army by not believing the allegations made by other countries," said the 59-year old commander. The army commander made the comment while in Lop Buri Province, where he inspected an army exercise conducted by the 2nd Cavalry Division in Phatthana Nikhom District. "We feel deeply bitter over such an allegation," the army commander said. Gen. Wimon said the Thai army had lost a large number of soldiers while doing their duties along the Thai-Cambodian border. The last incident occurred early this week when a new army officer who just graduated from the Chunlachomklao Military Academy died when Khmer Rouge guerrillas and Phnom Penh forces fought a brief battle on Thai territory. He said the army officer died when he stepped on a booby-trap planted near the border. "This young officer died as a result of fighting between the two Khmer groups," said Gen. Wimon. "They (Cambodians) have caused a lot of suffering to us," said the commander. He said that the army would adopt stiffer military measures to deal with the problem along the border area. Commenting on US Ambassador David Lambertson's statement expressing concern that the Thai military still had contact with the Khmer Rouge, Gen. Wimon refused to be drawn into an argument. He urged reporters to raise the question instead with Ambassador Lambertson who made the allegation. A colonel attached to the Army Secretary said the army would not comment on the ambassador's statement, saying that it was the duty of the Foreign Ministry. The officer admitted that a number of senior army officers were surprised to learn of the ambassador's comments. They said they found it hard to believe that he would actually make such a statement.
