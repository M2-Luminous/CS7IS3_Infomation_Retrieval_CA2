The Palestinian News Agency, WAFA, indicated that Ivanov acquainted brother Abu-'Ammar with the outcome of his talks with the Israeli prime minister and foreign minister. Brother Abu-'Ammar laid out for the Russian envoy the PLO's basic demand that protection for the Palestinians in the occupied territories be ensured before the talks can be resumed. Brother Abu-'Ammar reiterated the PLO's position that the United Nations must secure protection for the Palestinians and disarm Jewish settlers. The brother president, WAFA adds, told the Russian envoy he was disturbed that the UN Security Council found it hard to pass a resolution that would make it possible for the peace talks to resume and for secure protection for the Palestinians throughout the occupied territories to be ensured. The meeting took place in a cordial atmosphere and demonstrated that the Palestinian and Russian viewpoints were identical. According to a Palestinian source, brother Abu-'Ammar earlier received the U.S. ambassador in Tunis, John McCarthy, to discuss continuing consultations about a UN Security Council resolution on the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. Russia is widely thought to be in favor of a resolution providing for international protection for the Palestinians in the occupied territories, while the United States and Israel are opposed.
