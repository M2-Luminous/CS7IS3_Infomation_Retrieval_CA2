The panel gave its advice to Kanzaki in granting charge cut applications by Japan Telecom Co., DDI Corp. and Teleway Japan Corp., as the three companies all planned the same reduction and sought approval for their plans. At the moment, conditions are not ripe for free competition among the firms because of continued quasimonopolistic control by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT), the council said. The three firms all proposed an average 12.3 percent cut in the general leased circuit charge for new medium-distance categories. The three companies also sought approval for an average 10.3 percent cut in their high-speed digital transmission service charges. However, the council recommended to the minister that the proposed charge reduction plans be approved without revision. The rate cuts will be put into effect on April 1.
