The sixth party congress set forth the renovation policy and created a turning point in the cause of socialist construction in our country. The seventh party congress evaluated the results of five years of carrying out the renovation process according to the socioeconomic development platform and strategy. It also put forth the orientations and measures for conducting the renovation process in a far-reaching and uniform manner. The international situation has developed quickly and become complicated since the seventh party congress. The socialist regimes in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe have collapsed. The independence and sovereignty of a number of countries have been challenged by policies based on power and imposition. The hostile forces are stepping up their activities in a bid to undermine our people's cause of national construction and defense. Once again, our revolutionary undertaking is facing harsh challenges. The international situation presents new opportunities, however. The strength and determination to struggle for national independence and sovereignty have been consolidated. The trends of cooperation and development have prevailed in the world community. The revolutionary forces have learned valuable lessons from their temporary setbacks. The success of our country's renovation policy has further consolidated our people's strength and position, thus creating the conditions for us to overcome difficulties and take advantage of good opportunities to serve the cause of national construction. Faced with new challenges and opportunities, our party and people have adopted a firm political stance. The resolutions of the party Central Committee's Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Plenums have concretized and further developed the line set forth by the seventh party congress, resolving a series of practical problems on the domestic and diplomatic fronts based on actual international developments and real-life situations. We have persisted in the renovation undertaking, accelerated socioeconomic development, broadened the process of democratization, firmly maintained political stability, consolidated our national defense and security capabilities, diversified our diplomatic activities, and gradually overcome the impact of blockade and embargo. The National Party Conference has the duty to assess the implementation of the seventh party congress resolution and evaluate the actual results of the renovation undertaking since the sixth party congress. The objectives of this are to clarify further a number of issues relating to the process of socialist construction in our country and define major policies and measures to implement the seventh party congress resolution successfully and lead the revolutionary undertaking in our country forward. Part One: The situation concerning the implementation of the seventh party congress resolution. I. Achievements 1. The great achievement of primary importance is the fact that we have succeeded in overcoming the socioeconomic crisis to a very important extent. The crisis began in the late 1970's and early 1980's. It lasted for many consecutive years and became most serious from 1986-88, with inflation at a gallop. Another menace occurred in 1991. Thanks, however, to the great efforts of our party, state, and people, our national economy not only held fast but recorded outstanding achievements and overcame sluggishness and recession. The economic growth rate has remained very high and steady for the past three years. Inflation was cut from 67 percent in 1991 to 17.5 percent in 1992, and then to 5.2 percent in 1993. The GDP shows an average annual increase of 7.2 percent, compared with the 1991-95 target of 5.5 to 6 percent. Agricultural production has developed in a relatively comprehensive manner. The food grain issue has been resolved satisfactorily. The output of food grain in 1993 amounted to nearly 25 million tons, thus exceeding the target for 1995. Industrial production is growing at an average annual rate of 13 percent, higher than the 8 to 10 percent target set in the five-year plan for 1991-95. The productivity of a number of important sectors and products -- such as electricity, crude oil, steel, and cement -- has increased. The communications and liaison system has expanded rapidly through the use of new equipment and technology. Many sectors -- such as building, transport, trade, travel, and other services -- have developed. The economy is undergoing structural changes. A number of production and business sectors have emerged. Foreign economic relations have expanded, becoming more diversified and multilateral. We have overcome the results of the unexpected drop in trade with our traditional market, broadened our trade exchanges with newer trading partners, and increased our annual export volume by nearly 20 percent. By the end of 1993, some 836 foreign investment projects had been licensed, with a registered capital of $7.5 billion. We have begun to attract more development aid and preferential capital loans from various governments, and have normalized relations with international financial and monetary institutions. The economy has achieved some initial capital accumulation. Although this is still small, a broad section of the population has seen their lives improve. A multisector economic system is taking shape. State firms are beginning to be rearranged and re-registered. State firms with long histories of operational losses have been reduced in large numbers, while the number of state firms with effective operations has increased. Generally speaking, the state-run economic sector is continuing to develop. It controls key fields of activity and is playing an essential role in the national economy. The state-run economic sector's share of the GDP increased from 34 percent in 1990 to 39.9 percent in 1992. Agricultural cooperatives have developed much clearer orientations for renovation since the party Central Committee's fifth plenum. The autonomous role of peasant households has been affirmed. A number of new formats for economic cooperation have emerged. The Land Act officially gave peasants the right to the long-term and stable use of the land. This has helped the peasant household-based economy gain momentum in development. Individual economies and private capitalist economies have developed remarkably. Share-holding and partnership enterprises, which are attracting capital investment from various forms of ownership, have emerged in increasingly large numbers. The market system, which is under state management along socialist lines, is becoming a driving mechanism in the economy. The amendment of laws and the continued renovation of various systems and policies on planning, pricing, the exchange rate, finance, banking, labor, wages, and the land have created a more favorable environment for various firms to develop dynamism, self- motivation, and a sense of self-responsibility in production and business. The state has accumulated more experience and made progress in the macromanagement of the national economy. In parallel with economic development, the resolution of various social issues and the implementation of various social welfare policies have been given more attention. Thanks to an increase in production and services, market prices have become relatively stable and the lives of people in various urban and rural areas have been improved. The number of rich households has increased while the number of needy households -- especially the number of underfed households -- has been reduced. The people's basic need for food and clothing has been met in a more satisfactory way. The construction of houses, roads, electrical facilities, and health establishments has developed in various rural and urban areas. Democratic rights -- especially economic democracy -- have developed gradually. The people are free to work according to the law. They feel more secure about putting their money into production and business, thus creating more jobs. Various policies -- such as the policy of tackling unemployment; the policy of eliminating hunger and poverty; the policy toward war invalids, families of fallen heroes, and people who have performed meritorious deeds for the revolution; the policy of providing assistance to disabled, helpless, and homeless people; and the policy of helping needy students return to school -- have been carried out satisfactorily. Educational activities have made some progress in fighting degradation, diversifying various educational formats, rearranging the school network, consolidating the system of specialized schools and selective classes, and building general education schools for ethnic minority students. The popularization of education has begun to develop satisfactorily. Vocational training and the study of foreign languages and computer technology have developed in various cities. Science and technology have started to develop as a driving force. Scientific and technological studies have been linked with social requirements. Many research and application projects -- especially in agriculture, fisheries, consumer goods, and export goods -- have developed their practical value. They have helped to increase economic results and improve technological knowledge. The system of state-level scientific study programs has become more centralized, and for the first time has included programs on social science and the humanities. Cultural activities have become more lively. Cultural exchanges with foreign countries have been expanded. Literary and artistic works have become more copious in terms of content and theme, and more diversified in terms of form, category, and means of expression. The information system has made new steps in development with the expansion of radio and television transmission coverage to various districts throughout the country, including a number of mountain and high-altitude areas and distant offshore islands. Health care activities for the improvement of the people's health have shown great progress in various fields, such as preliminary health care, expanded immunizations, and the control of epidemics and social diseases. Requirements for essential medicine have been partially met. Physical education and sports has achieved encouraging results. Work on population and family planning has been carried out correctly, leading to an increase in the number of people voluntarily registering for the birth control program. 2. The second important achievement is the continuation of political maintenance and consolidation. Because of our success in many areas of renovation -- especially the socioeconomic achievements, the party's skillful leadership, and the political awareness of the country's people and soldiers -- we have survived the recent international political shock. The party's leadership role has been strengthened, the state's management efficiency has been heightened, democracy has been broadened, and national defense and security have been guaranteed. The people's confidence in the party, state, and renovation undertaking has increased and public movements for socioeconomic improvement have developed. After the seventh national party congress, our party -- especially the party Central Committee, the Political Bureau, and the Secretariat -- accelerated party building work, considering this to be a duty of crucial importance to the entire revolutionary cause in our country and to our party. The third party plenum confirmed that economic development is the central duty and party building is the fundamental duty. It clarified conceptions on party building work when the party is a ruling party, and defined principles for the party's organization and activities. It outlined the duties for consolidating the unity and unification of the entire party. It renovated and strengthened logical and ideological work and consolidated the party organization system. After more than a year of party building work, we have improved and heightened our knowledge and responsibility toward party committees and party members. We have rearranged the party organization system and reestablished cadre committees to oversee party committees and youth unions in state organs and mass organizations. The function and role of grassroots party organizations, together with their working procedures and personnel management regulations, have been established. Party principles -- especially the principle of democratic centralism for the restoration of order and principles -- have been executed. Party management and work attitudes have been revamped in a more democratic, collective, and appropriate manner to ensure close and efficient party leadership and expand the positive role of state organs and mass organizations. We have concentrated more on training and admitting new party members. In 1992, admission of new members increased by 39 percent over 1991. In 1993, it increased by 30.7 percent over 1992. The party has continuously renovated its thinking and paid more attention to logical and ideological work. It has clarified concepts and principles for guiding the renovation cause and has gained more leadership experience. Party cadre have become more mature and active, and have gradually grown accustomed to leadership and management work in the renovation undertaking. Our social democracy has made significant strides over the past two years, together with the construction of a law-governed state of the people, by the people, and for the people. The most prominent event was the promulgation of the 1992 Constitution. That helped to institutionalize rapidly the party's line on national construction along socialist lines. The implementation of constitutional stipulations in the fields of politics, the economy, culture, education, industry, security and national defense, and the citizen's fundamental rights and obligations -- together with the introduction of many new legal documents and regulations -- have further accelerated the democratization process in our social activities. The Fatherland Front and mass organizations have diversified their activities to broaden the national great unity block, motivate the public to carry out its political duties, accelerate social activities, provide good care for the people, and protect their interests. Mass motivation work has been given more attention by party committees at different levels. Coordination between state organs and the fatherland fronts and mass organizations has been strengthened more than ever in motivating the public to take part in law-building work; the planning of national policy; the formation of local authorities; and the implementation of the policies relating to the socioeconomy, security, and national defense. The armed forces, together with the public, have made many efforts to accelerate the renovation cause in the areas of national defense and security, and in developing their own strengths. They have executed their duty to protect the socialist fatherland; guarantee political stabilization; and safeguard national independence, sovereignty, and integrity in a satisfactory manner. We have successfully implemented the great strategic adjustment in national defense, reduction in military personnel, and the strengthening of the universal defense system. We have built regional defense networks in provinces and cities, adjusted the strategy for national security protection, revamped our military activities in the new situation, gained better knowledge regarding the current situation, and become more efficient in fighting the activities of hostile forces.
