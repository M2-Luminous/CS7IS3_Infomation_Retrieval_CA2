For the purpose of making grant and cooperative agreement awards, funding preference is defined as the funding of a specific category or group of approved applications ahead of other categories or groups of approved applications in a discretionary program, or favorable adjustment of the formula which determines the grant award in a formula grant program. This statutory general preference was implemented in Fiscal Year (FY) 1993 following publication of a proposed Federal Register notice (57 FR 60212, dated December 18, 1992) which announced the implementation methodology for FY 1993.
