Reports were delivered by Finance Minister Hryhoriy Pyatachenko and First Deputy Economy Minister Valentyn Popov. The Economy Ministry worked out two versions of the main indices of the plan for 1994 on the basis of different price rise indices against 1993, one estimating that prices will rise 7.4 times and the other 4.45 times. The intention of the government and the Ukrainian National Bank to operate a tough monetary policy in 1994 was taken into consideration, and the indices under the second version were submitted for the Cabinet of Ministers' consideration. During the discussion of the plan It was stated that the gross domestic produce last year exceeded 100 trillion [as received] karbovantsi at current prices. The national income generated fell 13 percent against the 1992 level and labor productivity 10 percent. The catastrophic decrease in investment activity continued. Due to growing inflation, last year's volume of investments from the state budget turned out to be exhausted almost entirely as early as in the first six months of 1993. Agricultural producers completed last year in difficult conditions, and none of the beet growing regions, in particular, fulfilled the state order. The overall progress of denationalization, privatization, and corporatization of enterprises was held up by the imperfect legislation and partial blocking of small-scale privatization by local councils, state administrations, and ministries. The meeting determined seven state priorities in the economy for 1994, ranging from speeding up the development of agro-industrial sectors, to designing and manufacturing weapons and military hardware. Bilateral and multilateral trade and economic relations between Ukraine and the CIS and Baltic states are expected to improve in 1994. It is forecast that the volume of foreign credit that will be attracted this year will be $697 million. In 1994 the policy of further delimiting state and enterprise finances will continue. It is planned to hold a news conference when the Cabinet of Ministers' meeting ends. UNIAN will have the details in the evening bulletin.
