This change is for known reasons, the most important of which is that the leadership does not want the negative details of life to turn into a phenomena leading to laxity and apathy toward solvable issues. In life, he who believes in grand principles should not say that there are insoluble issues. It could be that not all matters are as one might wish, but nothing is insoluble. Some solutions may need time and capabilities that happen to be unavailable. But to impair the human will, this will lead to impotence, which starts as a feeling and turns into an effect with universal impact. Therefore, it is impermissible for the Ba'th state to age, grow old, or become flabby. It should remain youthful and wise at the same time. These remarks were made during a meeting between the leader president and a number of writers, journalists, and editors in chief. Hamid Yusuf Hammadi, minister of culture and information; 'Udayy Saddam Husayn, head of the Cultural Forum in Iraq; and Nuri Najm al-Marsumi and Naji Sabri al-Hadithi, under secretaries of the Ministry of Culture and Information, attended the meeting. His excellency, may God watch over him, added: Based on this, the leadership began to take care of issues that used to be within the tasks of ministers or directors general. This is because when small things impact on large and medium issues concerning the peoples' psychological makeup, and impact real life on the level of economics and politics, then the leaderships' actions derive their legitimacy from what we have just described in the people's life. The leadership wants the people to be happy. In accordance with our concept, happiness does not always come from material life, but when the stage and circumstances affects the material life of the people, it is necessary for the leadership to play a role in generating a feeling of happiness. His excellency said: Within the historical context of rights and duties, the Iraqis have proven that they are qualified to do their duties, and that they deserve to enjoy their rights. Here, there will be no need to invoke history to interpret citizens' stands in light of the past, but this needs constant awareness. Under difficult circumstances, if awareness is not as it should be, there will be no strength to overcome an ordeal or a difficult circumstance, even though there is genuineness. During the meeting, discussions dealt with a host of issues related to citizens' lives and daily affairs, the role of media in providing the citizens with new information and analyses, and in bolstering their awareness in a way to promote their strength and determination to overcome the effects of the unjust blockade on our great Iraq.
