The pro-Beijing daily, in a report from Changchun City in Jilin Province, called the agreement a measure to accelerate the birth of a northeast Asian economic triangle centered on the Tuman River. The triangle runs from Chongjin port in North Korea to Yanji City in China and Vladivostok in Russia -- all near the Tuman River. The United Nations Development Program (UNDP), South and North Korea, China, Russia and Japan are trying to develop the Tuman River basin as a special economic zone. The state-run Yanji Trading Co. of China has, in a series of contacts with North Korea, agreed to invest 370 million yuan (37 million U.S. dollars) in joint development of Chongjin. When the project is completed, South Korean, Taiwanese, U.S., Japanese and Hong Kong ships will be allowed to call at the port, the paper said. It did not reveal the amount of investment by North Korea. Under the agreement, Yanji will jointly develop the port with North Korea, build a 95km-long road between Chongjin and Hoeryong and erect a hotel with a floor space of 30,000 square meters. The paper said that the joint development will greatly increase the berth and cargo handling capacity of Chongjin port and promote economic cooperation and trade between northeast Asian countries.
