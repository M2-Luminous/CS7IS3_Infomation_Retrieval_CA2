Before the election leader of "Solidarity-80" Marian Jurczyk walked out of the congress along with a group of several dozen activists connected with him to protest, as he put it, against undemocratic solutions of problems, unjustified attacks and demands of measures that are not consistent with the trade union's statutes. The delegates who did not walk out with Jurczyk resolved that they constitute a majority and have the right to continue the debates. They recalled the National Commission, chaired by Jurczyk, and elected the new one with Dolniak as chairman. They decided also to move the seat of the "Solidarity-80" authorities to Warsaw. Jurczyk, not complying with these decisions, on his part announced that the second part of the congress will be held in Olsztyn. The congress debating in Swinoujscie, Szczecin Province, on Friday and Saturday was to specify new goals of the trade union and amend its statutes. From the very beginning it was held in the atmosphere of heated disputes.
