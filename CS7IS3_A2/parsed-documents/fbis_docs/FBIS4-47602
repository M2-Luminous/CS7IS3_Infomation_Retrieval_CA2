TABLE OF CONTENTS INTRODUCTION PARLIAMENT THE COMMISSION THE COURT OF JUSTICE EUROPEAN INVESTMENT BANK UNICE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY CEDEFOP THE DUBLIN FOUNDATION EUROSTAT Part I: Impact of EU Institutions on European Business INTRODUCTION This special issue of the West Europe Economic Review summarizes a series of articles appearing in the Paris business daily LES ECHOS from 5 January to 23 March 1994. The articles discuss the main EU institutions which affect the conduct of business in Europe, either through their regulatory, advocacy, or consultative functions. The articles include interviews conducted by the authors with special interest group spokespersons commenting on the advantages and problems inherent in dealing with these institutions. According to the articles, the Treaty of Rome, which founded the European Community, largely ignored the business community--with the exception of the steel, aircraft, and agriculture industries. During the 1960's and 1970's the Community focused almost entirely on agriculture. However, with the advent of the Single Market in January 1993, the Community made European industry a priority and set out to coordinate and merge the various member state regulations and laws which govern its conduct. Moreover, the EU is now trying to go a step further by providing national companies a means to incorporate on a European level. When the Maastricht Treaty was ratified at the end of 1993, the authors claim the EU finally "put business in its rightful place, neither forgotten nor privileged." It made the European company one of the major components of European Union, either directly through social welfare decisions, the development of vocational training, and Community industrial policy or indirectly in changing the framework of economic policy to coordinate EU fiscal legislation in preparation for a single currency. (Dian I. x733-6286) EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT Following the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty in 1993, the European Parliament has increased its scope of responsibility, extending its ability to participate in legislative decisionmaking, budget control, and oversight duties--a fact European companies are poised to take advantage of, according to Strasbourg special correspondent Jacques Docquiert in the 26 January edition of LES ECHOS. These companies are intensifying their lobbying efforts in the halls of Parliament and a representative of a large European company claims it is more and more often in Strasbourg, seat of the Parliament, that future EU regulations are made or unmade. This company representative argues that for European business to ignore Parliament, "which is still too often the case, is to misunderstand the Community decisionmaking process and to deprive oneself of the opportunity to influence Eurodeputies, who are often more sensitive to the interests of public opinion than of the Eurocrats" in Brussels. Interview With Bruno Dupont, President of Euralia Bruno Dupont, CEO of small business lobbying group Euralia, notes that the extension of Parliamentary authority after Maastricht Treaty ratification included the oversight of EU industrial policy. He maintains that while most companies have not yet realized this, it is fundamental for those firms which want not only to anticipate regulatory changes but also to evaluate their impact on company plans, to make discussion with EU deputies integral to their interaction with the Community. British companies have already largely taken into account Parliament's increased power over issues as sensitive as financial services, technology, and the environment. Dupont additionally suggests that all EU medium- and large-sized companies should make their views known to Parliament independently from their professional federations and associations, which can only act in consensus on issues. Asked about Parliament's current priorities that affect EU companies, Dupont made the point that EU deputies are distributed among 10 policy groups and 18 permanent commissions. The priorities of each deputy will depend on which group or commission he is a member of. Additionally, each deputy must be accountable to his own member state and priorities will be influenced by the diversity of these representatives. Traditionally, Dupont states, consumer protection and the environment have always been two permanent priorities of the Parliament which directly concern companies. In Dupont's view, the major issue today for the Parliament which will affect companies is unemployment. He sees the Parliament as being called on to foster an improved business climate by changing direct and indirect taxation, clarifying competition policy, providing transparency in EU legal coordination, and making such coordination profitable for companies. On the other hand, the Parliament will be asked to integrate further small business into the Community by opening government markets to them and allowing them wider participation in EU programs. THE COMMISSION According to Jacques Docquiert, writing on 12 January, the Commission is the key institution of the European Union and has a long tradition of contacts with businesses. He points out that the Maastricht Treaty has not changed the Commission's scope of authority or its relationship with professional federations. Its mission under the Treaty of Rome is intact: to propose legislation and regulations to the Council of Ministers to provide for the smooth functioning and the development of Community policies. The Commission is supported by a strong bureaucracy of some 16,700 employees coming from each member state and divided into 23 General Directorates. These "Eurocrats" and their institution have for some years been accused of usurping power, overregulating EU business, and "all sorts of evils" by adversaries of the Brussels technocracy. The reality is different, Docquiert claims. Although the Commission, in addition to the 726 bills it had written since its inception to the end of 1990, had to submit 380 supplementary bills to the Council of Ministers for consideration between 1989 and 1992 to prepare for the Single Market, it is in fact, only the Council of Ministers that has decisionmaking authority in 80 percent of Community matters. Moreover, the Maastricht Treaty's new concept of subsidiarity, under which legislation is handled at the member state level and only reaches the Community level if it cannot be resolved, should put an end to this "Eurocratic regulatory bulemia," Docquiert claims. The Commission and Business "The dialogue between the Commission and the business community functioned well before the Maastricht Treaty," notes Riccardo Perissich, director general of the Industrial Affairs and Internal Market Directorate, the DG3, "and should continue to function smoothly." However, Perissich points out that there is no model to follow and no single office to go to to have action taken on an issue. A company representative arriving in Brussels where the Commission is located and can be derailed by the number of actors and directorates working on the same directive proposal, Perissich acknowledged. Companies or professional groups which are just starting to lobby the Commission must first learn where to go and whom to approach. The Commission has traditionally dealt with EU federations or industry associations, which cooperate to defend a common position with varying success depending on the industry. The chemical, pharmaceutical, and steel industries for example, rely on old traditions "perfectly broken in." In other industries, such a tradition does not exist and national federations or individual companies must seek out Eurocrats to lobby in order to change opinions or push a certain agenda. This lobbying can take three forms: appoint a European representative within the company, open a bureau in Brussels, or use a legal firm or consultants on an ad hoc basis. The choice often depends on the financial means of the company. Perissich contends that small and medium-sized companies are disadvantaged in this effort and must often rely on national industrial federations to plead their cases. Docquiert notes that French companies have been late to open bureaus in Brussels, doing so only at the end of the 1980's, considerably later than their counterparts in Germany and in Britain. Interview With Etienne Crespel, Director of the Permanent Representative Office of Alcatel-Alsthom Etienne Crespel, head of lobbying efforts for France's electronics firm Alcatel-Alsthom, points out that computer and telecommunications manufacturers have for several years met together in a round table, with the approval of the Commission, to consult and devise strategic policies. He refutes those who say French companies began lobbying "a little too late," noting that before the Single Market Act was signed in 1986, EU regulatory evolution was slow and not sufficient to closely monitor the Commission's work. However, with the advent of the Single Market in 1991, the pace of regulation and EU directives has picked up to the extent that large French industrial companies have decided to establish bureaus in Brussels. THE COURT OF JUSTICE Isabelle Graviere writes on 19 January that the Court of Justice, which was created in 1952 and oversees EU treaties and the harmonization of Community legislation, arbitrates disputes between EU companies and the Commission, a member state, or a competing company. The Court meets every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday to hear cases--on agriculture, competition, social policy, taxes, transportation, labor issues--many of which directly concern European companies. The growth of the court's casework has grown parallel to that of the Community itself. It has heard 7,000 cases since 1952, covering 400 issues since 1978. To cope with this flood of work, the Court asked the Council to establish an additional court, which they did in 1988. The new court which aids the Court of Justice is called the High Court. Development of the High Court The High Court, which had 635 pending cases at the end of 1993, is also swamped, according to Graviere, and the length of deliberations and the difficulty of agreeing on a final opinion among judges of different countries, education, and languages may discourage companies from bringing grievances to it. French companies, however, often bring cases before the High Court, according to the French High Court judge Jacques Biancarelli, in part because they have a more internationally driven corporate strategy than do German and British companies. However, German companies traditionally have called on both the Court of Justice and the High Court for issues such as taxation and the free movement of companies. The High Court is composed of 12 magistrates, each assisted by one public auditor (soon two). At the Court of Justice there are 13 judges, one per member state plus the president. Each is assisted by three public auditors and by six general attorneys. In both cases, the judges are named for a term of six years by common agreement by the member states. These terms are renewable. Governmental agreement on judicial appointments, however, is no guarantee of ultimate judicial consensus on different issues. Disagreement often adds to the length of deliberations. Interview With Hugues Calvet, Sales Vincent Georges & Associates Attorney Hugues Calvet, refuting Biancarelli, claims that French companies are not very active before the Court. It is not that they have no legal differences to settle, Calvet states, but that they are "underdeveloped" when it comes to managing their legal affairs. They tend to consider being contentious as being "parasitic" and consequently a company legal strategy rarely exists to the extent it does in Anglo-Saxon countries or even in Germany and the Netherlands. Nonetheless, the Community legal system represents a way for companies to obtain a fair competitive environment. Moreover, Calvet notes, Court decisions which have declared French business regulations as incompatible with European law have produced "attacks of conscience" within the French Government. One such case was when the Court declared France could not forbid women from working at night. As a result of successfully challenging this French law, companies realize that at the European level they can change the legal framework within which they conduct business. More often, however, companies are concerned with integrating Community law into their corporate practices in order to "avoid surprises" and litigation. In Calvet's view, the Court is very accessible. He points out that litigation before the Court is free, although the company must support the cost of its lawyers. Even though the duration of legal procedures has lengthened over the last few years, it is comparable to an equivalent litigation in national courts, and perhaps less time-consuming. Calvet adds that over the years, a number of individuals and very small companies have won their cases from the Court. Cases Heard by the Courts High Court: --All cases brought against the Commission by "physical or moral persons (particularly companies)," with the exception of antidumping cases. --CECA: cases brought against the Commission by virtue of the Community Steel and Coal Treaty. Court of Justice: --Antidumping cases. --Cases brought because of nonobservance of Community law by member states. --Incompetency cases: Cases brought before the Court because of legal omissions by Community institutions. --Prejudicial dismissals: National judges, in case of doubt about the interpretation of Community law, can ask the Court for legal interpretation. --Appeals: Can be brought against any decisions handed down by other courts. EUROPEAN INVESTMENT BANK Isabelle Graviere in the 2 February edition characterizes the European Investment Bank (EIB) as the "first among European banks." Indirectly for the small- and medium-size company projects, directly for larger ones, the EIB contributes to financing an important share of EU company investments. As Europe's financial arm, the EIB is without doubt one of the EU institutions with the most immediate impact on EU companies. This is the case, Graviere points out, because the EIB loaned 19.6 billion European Currency Units (ECU's) last year and 1.895 billion ECU's the year before for projects involving EU firms. The EIB's mission obligates it to finance investments which help the Community realize its economic objectives: development or "reconversion" of poor regions, which applies to nearly 40 percent of its loans; loans to assist company competitiveness; support for small- and medium-sized companies; development of trans-European transportation, telecommunications, and energy networks; environmental protection and improvement of the quality of life; reduction of energy dependence; and the rational utilization of natural resources. To do this, the EIB uses several financial "tools," which Graviere details below. Individual Loans and Global Loans The EIB directly funds up to 50 percent of the total loan requirement for projects costing 17 million ECU's or more. It also provides lines of credit to financial organizations which in turn lend to small- and medium-sized businesses or to local governments. Such loans are under the supervision of the EIB. Last year, 5,351 small- and medium-sized companies and 783 public works projects initiated by local governments benefited from such credit for a total of 2.6 billion ECU's loaned at competitive rates, made available because the EIB takes no commission and is deemed to be a AAA borrower by rating agencies. According to EIB information officer Henri Marty-Gauquie, France makes the most use of EIB loans. To date, the EIB has made loans to 2,985 small French businesses and 480 French infrastructure projects. Following the December 1992 European Council in Edinburgh, the EIB created an additional funding pool of 5 billion ECU's which was to be loaned out in 1993 and 1994. In December 1993 the fund was increased to 8 billion ECU's: 7 billion are destined for financing investments for the trans-European transportation, telecommunications, and energy networks and 1 billion for small businesses at a preferred loan interest rate of 2 percent. Of the 8 billion ECU's, 4.5 billion have been disbursed. Graviere notes that while politicians find this amount too small, EIB Vice President Alain Prate defends the sum as a significant contribution to investment effort. Finally, the EIB is helping to establish the European Investment Fund (EIF). The ElF, which was created by the Council of Edinburgh to guarantee infrastructure projects and small business investment, will be a separate entity from the EIB. It is currently being ratified in Italy and in Greece and will become operational this summer. A team has begun to define the EIB's priorities and its loan selection criteria, following methods practiced by the EIB. The EIB employs 800 employees, split between a team of some 50 engineers who study the technical feasibility of projects, a research department with 50 economists who verify their economic viability and appropriateness for EIB funding, and some 100 financial experts in a dozen geographic teams who control the bank's financial arrangements. Interview With Patrice Compin, Caisse Centrale des Banques Populaires Patrice Compin, responsible for EIB relations at France's Caisse Centrale des Banques Populaires, states that the EIB provides his company an opportunity to take part in a European initiative. Furthermore, the EIB guarantees the Caisse the ability to diversify its debt structure and offers financing compatible with loans the Caisse offers companies. The EIB also allows the Caisse to borrow at a cost 10 to 15 percent below that of the market. Compin noted that 14 of 30 regional banks in his group have agreements with the EIB dating from 1992 which involve a total lending amount of 750 million francs (Fr). To date, the EIB has dispersed Fr500 million of that amount to finance some 986 projects. Compin, in detailing the criteria for EIB financing, stated that the size of the company must not surpass 500 employees and those with less than 100 are a priority. The cost of the project also must not be more than 25 million ECU's to be eligible for loans valued between 20,000 ECU's and 12.5 million ECU's. Geographic location is also a criteria since the EIB targets certain less- developed regions or those in the process of converting their industries. Finally, the industry is important. Currently the EIB gives priority to industries which can save energy or preserve the environment. UNICE Isabelle Graviere, writing on 5 January, describes the Union of Industrial and Employers Confederations of Europe (UNICE) as a representative body for employer organizations from 22 European countries. Since the Single Market was established, it has become an active lobbyist at the EU Commission. With the Maastricht Treaty now ratified, along with its social agreement concluded by 11 of the 12 EU member states (Britain excepted), Graviere anticipates that UNICE will have wider latitude to carry on a "social dialogue" with other EU organizations. The mission of UNICE today is essentially one of communication and lobbying. It must in effect inform its members of Community projects, laws, and directives. It must also present employers' concernsto EU legislators before any definitive decision is made on economic, fiscal, social, or legal matters which concerns its members' companies or industries. UNICE primarily lobbies the EU Commission but also holds discussions with the Council, the Parliament, and the Economic and Social Committee, which has codecisionmaking authority on certain issues. UNICE also deals with EU institutions which are more specialized such as the Patent and Trademark Office. Working Practices Headquartered in Brussels not far from the Commission, the small 40-odd permanent staff of UNICE organizes working meetings nearly daily. Twice a year the presidents of the member federations and five UNICE vice presidents work out priority issues to be addressed. The issues are then referred to any one of five commissions- -economic and financial, foreign relations, social affairs, industrial affairs, and company affairs--which meet three times a year, and to more than some 50 technical groups which meet from two to seven times a year according to the importance of each issue. The permanent representative of some employers groups, such as the National Confederation of French Employers (CNPF), also have representative offices in Brussels to lobby for large national industries, also participate in UNICE meetings. Occasionally member states send their own specialists to participate in certain issues. For the past six years, UNICE has scrutinized 300 EU directives adopted for the Single Market, some of which are still under discussion. According to the UNICE secretary general, consensus among the membership is generally arrived at quickly despite their varying interests. More difficult is influencing EU decisionmaking. However, hard work pays off, Graviere notes, and cites the example of UNICE successfully putting all its weight behind preventing the adoption of a EU tax on carbonic gas. To more effectively represent EU companies and to increase its budget, UNICE established a support committee of some 20 large EU companies, including IBM Europe, Unilever, Shell, British Petroleum, Veba, and Iveco. No large French company is represented since the large computer company Bull withdrew because of budgetary problems. Neither are small- and medium-sized companies represented. They are represented by default through their national federations. UNICE meets with these federations once or twice a year. Interview With CES Deputy Secretary General Jean Lapeyre Deputy Secretary General of the European Confederation of Unions (CES) Jean Lapeyre, who points out that the Maastricht Treaty called for EU social partners to consult regularly, states that, unfortunately, dialogue has not intensified between the CES and UNICE since the treaty's adoption. He adds that UNICE does not want to increase social dialogue with unions until the treaty is fully implemented. Lapeyre stated that the CES would have liked UNICE, which agreed approved the text of the treaty, to have taken the initiative to foster such dialogue, especially on major issues such as vocational training. However, Lapeyre criticizes employers for doing nothing and not being ready for economic crises that may occur. While Lapeyre has not given up on UNICE, he argues that only through social dialogue can the EU take qualitative steps to produce laws which address general economic problems, a harder task than confronting objectionable individual company practices. However, Lapeyre contends that UNICE has not supported the establishment of European group committees which would provide a forum for such social negotiation. He concludes that only when EU employers become serious in proposing social dialogue and have a more constructive attitude will social partners find themselves around a negotiating table. EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY Denis Fainsilber writes on 16 March that the European Space Agency (ESA), which was established 20 years ago and is noted for successfully developing the Ariane missile and for having put into orbit some dozen scientific probes and satellites since 1975, has an "industrial mission" to fulfill by providing R&D opportunities to member state aerospace companies. However, ESA is facing a budget crisis brought about by Europe's recent economic recession and has had to put its space ambitions on hold for the next two years as it tries to find a market niche between the equally tight-budgeted Russian and U.S. space programs. ESA must wait to find out its place in the joint Russia/U.S. Columbia space platform project and is on "standby" status until the discussions over the project's fate are concluded, probably late in 1995. ESA in the meantime is trying to improve its current operations by obtaining a budget based on ECU's by 1 January 1997. The agency points out that each ECU invested in its contracts generates 3.2 ECU's for EU industries and that 20 percent of these benefits come directly from ESA's space sector. However, ESA member states acknowledge that ESA undertook too many projects during the late 1980's and that in the future the agency must reverse this trend. As a result, the 1994 budget, which is Fr16.67 billion, is 10 percent lower than 1993, after having increased each year prior. It is expected to remain the same for the next five years. Guarantee of Industrial Return According to Winfried Thoma, chief of ESA contracts, the agency's guarantee to provide "industrial returns" on EU investment in the agency's projects limits the agency's freedom of action. While the agency must find for each program the best cost/benefit industrial relationship, it must also assure each member state benefits equivalent to its financial contribution. When contracts are let out to bid, ESA cannot allow the free market to work or else the large manufacturers from France, German, or Italy would consistently be awarded the agency's contracts, leaving the smaller EU countries "in the dust." For the agency to function as an EU institution, it must encourage competition and allow smaller member states, which are dependent on EU programs, to share in the work. For example, the XXM satellite and the earth stations for the Envisat satellite were handled this way, according to Fainsilber, who cited sources at ESA as confirming the program was not controlled by large industrialists. However, it is becoming more and more difficult for smaller companies to compete, Fainsilber claims. The European space industry is in the process of restructuring, with five of the largest companies--Germany's DASA, France's Aerospatiale and Arianespace, Italy's Matra Marconi Space and SEP--monopolizing 74 percent of the business, compared to 57 percent in 1984. Fainsilber cites industry experts as predicting that the consolidation of the industry will continue because of the current decrease in market potential. Another form of ESA's "industrial return" and of subtle balance among member states is its 2,000 member workforce, which is recruited in part on criteria of nationality and national financial contribution. While ESA's headquarters are in Paris, its research center, the European Research and Space Technology Center (ESTEC), is in Noordwijk in The Netherlands. ESTEC has 1,200 employees and manages most of ESA's programs. The rest of the agency is in Darmstadt, Germany and in Frascat, Italy. Because of the constraints of balancing these "returns" among member states, the agency, which manages some 60 programs, has had trouble completing programs in a timely manner, Fainsilber claims. The Hermes program, for example, used up enormous sums of money and time but in the end was never completed and was cancelled. The agency has viewed its cancellation as "therapeutic," however, and has since turned to space programs that are sharply less expensive for space transport. ESA Budget Weakness One of ESA's main weaknesses, according to Fainsilber, is its budget system, which is the reason for it trying to obtain an ECU- based budget by 1997. Critics of the system, "which has poisoned the life of the organization for years," according to ESA Budget Chief Jean Vuagnat, question how the agency has held together for 20 years. The system converts member states' contributions in national currencies into a unit of account whose conversion rates are determined when the budget is passed. The rate is largely artificial. Two years later, the Agency retroactively adjusts the conversion rates with some countries receiving a credit, others a bill. In the future, the ESA would like to use the ECU as the basis of contributions and contract prices, to correct the artificiality of the current system. According to Vuagnat, after the EU currency crises in 1993, there are few real opponents to the change. (The hard copy version of this Review includes a graph of ESA's 1994 budget, a pie chart on how it is allocated, and a breakdown of member state financial contributions) Interview With Marc Giget, Director General of Euroconsult Euroconsult head Marc Giget contends that ESA has a significant role to play in relation to U.S. and Russian space programs, as well as an independent role in space development, and thus will continue to provide Europe an industrial return. Giget notes that NASA's budget is 4.8 times larger that ESA's but claims the difference is essentially due to the absence of "autonomous access programs" for flights based in Europe, which are very costly and absorb the majority of civilian space budgets for the United States and Russia. In other areas such as satellites, ground observation units, and missiles, ESA programs are very comparable to its competitors, Giget claims. Furthermore, future large infrastructure programs will be developed with international cooperation, in which ESA will be a major partner. Neither NASA, whose budget has been reduced, nor the Russian RKA, in full budgetary crisis, can alone finance these projects, which are no longer political priorities. To compete, Giget concludes that Europe's space industry must reorganize as did Europe's civilian aircraft industry before merging into Airbus Industrie. Fainsilber points out that while NASA's budget is less than five times that of ESA, it has 25,000 employees compared to ESA's 2,000. Nonetheless, he argues, ESA operations are complex, linked to its role in coordinating space policy for 13 member states whose views are sometimes very different. While the EU Commission has criticized ESA for managing this role in a "pragmatic" way in order to fulfill its mission of providing an "industrial return" for large and small companies alike, Giget notes that the Commission also manages its own R&D programs with a "political return" in mind and with a "systematic salting" of benefits--a more perverse system in its dilution of Single Market goals than ESA's. In any event, Giget claims there is no European R&D program that has found a better solution in the current state of European integration and that if change is desirable, "it is not necessary to throw the baby out with the bathwater," since ESA is one of the rare examples of real scientific and technical European cooperation with a world reputation. CEDEFOP Isabelle Graviere's article on 23 March states that the European Center for Development and Vocational Training (CEDEFOP) promotes close social welfare coordination among member states, especially in the domain of vocational education. To fulfill its mission during its 20 years of existence, CEDEFOP has developed its research and information capabilities and coordinated them with European employers and labor unions for the EU Commission. In fact, the Commission is CEDEFOP's primary consumer, ordering research from the organization and using it for policy decisionmaking. The center, explains Ernst Piehl, its director since 1984, is at the source of numerous Community initiatives, such as the Erasmus European Exchange Program and the Regional Training and Development Program, which was launched by CEDEFOP before subsequently becoming the responsibility of the directorate for regional development and policy, DG16. Industry Colloquiums One of CEDEFOP's greatest contributions to coordinating EU social welfare policy is that it provides a venue where representatives of member state governments, the Commission, and EU labor and employment unions can discuss and negotiate common social policy. This three-party function is played out at the Administrative Council three times a year. Additionally, CEDEFOP organizes colloquiums, both institutional and industrial, where representatives can meet. A colloquium was organized for the retail industry three years ago, for example, which resulted in negotiations to coordinate and define European job skill descriptions. For 1994, CEDEFOP plans to have colloquiums for the textile and naval construction industries. Additionally, CEDEFOP organizes meetings among Community advocates of various EU programs such as the continuing education FORCE program or COMETT, which promotes links between companies and university. Research and publications from CEDEFOP's work is distributed freely, such as in its quarterly bulletin, "CEDEFOP Flash." Graviere notes that CEDEFOP has been criticized for its centralized study and research approach to its mission. A recent audit of CEDEFOP activity recommended that CEDEFOP "mobilize the research centers in member states rather than endowing itself with a heavy research structure at the European level." However, with its 76-person staff and a budget limited to 12 million ECU's, the Center is limited. Moreover, its imminent move to Thessalonica, Greece, from Berlin will have a "revolutionary" impact on the institution, according to Graviere, who, however, did not explain further. Study Visits Among the activities of CEDEFOP, study visits are one of the most efficient means of creating industry networks among member states and diffusing information. Such visits are intended to provide training to EU companies in "performance systems" or new ideas, such as the German apprenticeship system which has been often cited during the current period of high EU unemployment as a good example of labor management. The networks established through these study visits are crucial to the "real convergence" of European business methods, Graviere concludes. Interview With Marie-Odile Paulet, UCC-CFDT Secretary General Paulet contends that the tripartite nature of CEDEFOP is the reason the organization works so well. As the head of a major EU labor union, Paulet sees CEDEFOP as having allowed the principal actors in vocational training to exchange ideas and decide policies together, facilitating the coordination and convergence of European union. However, Paulet notes that CEDEFOP has three main weaknesses. First, the time it takes each of the 12 member states to sufficiently recognize and understand the needs of vocational training throughout the Community, a slow but indispensable task to Europeanize training. Secondly, CEDEFOP's use of nine languages, which burdens its work and lengthens the time to publish study results. Lastly, the change over the last 20 years which has required the EU to reposition the organization as the needs for training and EU institutions have changed. In Paulet's opinion, CEDEFOP's most exemplary accomplishment is its documentation of different professional training systems in each of the 12 member states. She characterizes such work as indispensable to European construction and praises CEDEFOP for the studies it has done on defining professional qualifications, for providing comparative data on most of the basic occupations within the EU, and its continuing work on defining job skills for new EU occupations. These studies, Paulet claims, have already been used by labor and employer unions during industry negotiations. THE DUBLIN FOUNDATION In the 16 February LES ECHOS, Isabelle Graviere notes that the Foundation for Improvement of Living and Working Conditions--most often called the Dublin Foundation--is one of two EU organizations, the other being CEDEFOP, which allow three-party dialogue on subjects which concern industry productivity and labor issues. Each member state is represented by officials from government, labor, and management. Created in 1975 to help the Commission in research, the Dublin Foundation helps formulate EU policy on issues such as access to employment, organization of work, health and security, participation of employees, role of public services, and environmental protection. The Foundation conducts polls, colloquiums, and studies on these issues, analyses the findings, and publishes the results. Its conclusions, sometimes accompanied by recommendations, are provided to the Commission as well as member state governments, employers, employee organizations, and to the general public. Recent, Current Studies The Foundation's priority is to study the link between better work conditions and company profitability and then to influence EU legislation. Below are examples of past and future Foundation studies: * Studied construction worksites to determine the causes of worksite deaths. Resulted in a Community directive on construction worksite safety in 1992. * Published a study on workplace stress in 1993. Has initiated a study to rethink the traditional organization of companies and to increase the importance of training and quality of operators. * Published a "Glossary of Industrial Relations" to compare industrial terminologies and practices in the different member states. * Will participate in the Community's white paper on employment. It will study the issues brought up by each member state about their employment policies. * In 1994 the Dublin Foundation will conduct the second EU study on the work environment to verify improvements or degradations in work conditions in the EU. * Additional studies frequently requested by companies include problems with unskilled labor, lack of appropriate equipment, occupational rigidities, noise and air pollution, and night work. Interview With Jacques Combe, CNPF Representative Combe, who represents France's Confederation of French Employers (CNPF) at the Dublin Foundation, points out that the Foundation's difficulty in translating its findings into concrete actions in the workplace is its major weakness. Moreover, he notes that it is difficult for it even to formulate recommendations if they will in any way constrain member states. Combe claims this weakness is because the Foundation is not well known. Unlike agencies created to oversee the coordination of Community regulations, such as the Patent Office, the Dublin Foundation is an "upstream" organization whose task is to define what exists and to determine what is needed in the EU workplace. EURO STAT Eurostat has seen its functions expand greatly over the last few years in response to the increased pace of European union, evolving from an in-house body concerned with gathering data on EU policies to the Community's premiere statistical watchdog which supplies companies and governments with all EU statistics, not only those linked closely to EC policies. It's priority, according to Isabelle Graviere writing in the 9 February edition of LES ECHOS, is to furnish its consumers with all statistical information useful to analyze and make decisions. A "satellite" General Directorate under the Commission, Eurostat has developed its analytical tools over the last few years to include Community industrial activity. It has reformed its methods, increased its investment in people, and expanded its cooperation with professional organizations. It will soon add new fields to its repertoire, including providing statistics for service industries, construction and public works, and small businesses. Eurostat, located in Luxembourg, has six departments, five of which are "operational" and are organized around economic activity sectors: economic and monetary convergence, foreign and inter- Community trade, companies and energy, social and regional statistics, and agriculture, fishing, and the environment. Eurostat coordinates and cooperates with other Commission directorates, Community organizations, and with EU companies and professional organizations to determine their statistical needs. It holds an annual meeting with the 12 representatives of national statistical organizations to coordinate policy and it is developing a dialogue for this purpose with EU companies. Expansion has brought some problems to Eurostat. It has gone from 12 to 18 members, including those countries in the European Economic Area, and is developing an interest in East Europe. This geographic enlargement, according to Yves Franchet, Eurostat director since 1987, has raised the question as to whether Eurostat should be more independent as well as whether it should do more to apply the principle of subsidiarity, contracting work to national organizations. Some economic sectors remain less covered than others. Manufacturing (where a majority of large companies are concentrated which are easiest to gather data on) has seen real progress, Graviere writes. This is not the case with services, construction and public works, and small businesses. However, when the Community adopts the Special Nomenclature of Activities of the European Communities (NACE) and establishes company catalogs which contain polling information, Eurostat will then be able to increase its reporting in these sectors. Interview With Yvonick Renard, CNPF Statistical Study Group Head Renard remarked that, unfortunately, little of the data from Eurostat is usable in industrial matters, principally for reasons of detail and timeliness. While the economic polls Eurostat conducts with company panels for the Economic and Financial Affairs Directorate, DGII, are certainly useful, Renard points out that they lack a common statistical reference base and therefore lose a large part of their viability. Renard notes that Eurostat underwent a "quiet revolution" when it changed the EU's official list of products and businesses to comply with consolidated customs offices' lists, or Intrastat lists, in January 1993. This change has affected the statistical management of companies, Renard claims. It allowed economic information to be much more comparable than in the past. However, the operational use of these Intrastat lists is weak and needs to be quickly improved in such areas as orders, investments, cost of production, and cost of employment. Equally positive, according to Renard, is the increased cooperation among EU statistical organizations and EU professional organizations. The latter, both on the EU and the national levels, constitutes a very dense network of industrial data. Within the framework of the DEBA group, established to promote cooperation among EU professional organizations, this data is synthesized in up- to-date economic studies and reports on the Single Market and shared with the public. Renard concludes that the importance of viable Community data for all the member states was evident when the Maastricht Treaty was negotiated. However, the data should not be at the exclusive use of the Community and its dialogue with professional groups should be increased, he argues. Technically, coordinating statistics throughout the Community remains difficult as witnessed in the reticence of certain member states to establish a common classification of company activities. Eurostat Publication Eurostat publications are listed in "Catalogue Eurostat - Publications and Electronic Services" under nine principal themes. Below are six of the themes most relevant to businesses: General Statistics: The most popular in this group is "Europe in Numbers" and "Basis Community Statistics," in which data is compared to Europe's major economic partners. Economy and Finance: Eurostat publishes country statistics, such as on the Russian economy, and sector analyses, such as on consumer prices in the EU. Population and Social Conditions: Consists of statistical data on unemployment. Energy and Industry: These publications have the largest audience, especially the one entitled "Panorama of Community Industry," which is published every two months in coordination with the DG3. Foreign Trade and Balance of Payments: Consists of a monthly publication. Services and Transportation: Among its works is "Retail Trade in the Single Market in 1993."
