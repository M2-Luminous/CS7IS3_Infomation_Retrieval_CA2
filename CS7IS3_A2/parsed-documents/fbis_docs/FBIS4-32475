Today we mark an official holiday in Croatia, to honor Croatian antifascism. This day has a special meaning for all of Croatia, and particularly for Istria. On this day, democratic and sovereign Croatia shows that the antifascist struggle is one of its foundations. In this antifascist struggle, in the difficult and crucial days of World War II, Croatian patriots helped preserve the Croatian nation and create a democratic, independent, and sovereign Croatian state. This day was forgotten in former socialist Yugoslavia and in socialist Croatia when it was part of Yugoslavia--in other words, it was falsified. Instead of marking 22 June, when in 1941 Croatian antifascists began their struggle against fascism, it was a struggle for a Croatian state and not for a Yugoslav state. Instead, authorities of socialist Croatia proclaimed 27 July as the day of antifascist uprising, the day when Serbs from Bosnia and Knin began fighting against the Independent State of Croatia [NDH, Nezavisna Drzava Hrvatska]. The Serbs from Bosnia and Croatia fought not because the NDH was linked with fascist Italy and Germany but because it wanted to be Croatian. Serbs and Chetniks from Knin were those who established links with fascist Italy, and they would do the same today if they could. Therefore, the current democratic and sovereign Croatia was the one which set the matter straight as it will do with everything else in Istria and the Croatian nation. [applause] I happened to know, or shall I say, I was honored to know, personally the man who on 22 June 1941 led 40 Croatian communists from Sisak to the forest of Brezovica, thus starting the antifascist struggle in Croatia. This struggle was against fascism but also, as I said, for a free Croatia. It was Vlado Janic, nicknamed Capo, a Croatian man, a Croatian worker, a communist, but nonetheless a man who knew by heart the main ideas of Antun Starcevic [19th century Croatian intellectual] and the Radic brothers, Antun and Stjepan Radic [prewar political leaders championing Croatian independence], a man who [interupted by applause] fought that antifascist war in Croatia with this idea of an all-Croat struggle. In Belgrade he was the one who ordered the arrest of Punisa Racic, the man who murdered the Croatian leader Stjepan Radic in the parliament in Belgrade, and brought him to justice. This is what is essential in Croatian antifascism, and this is what we are accordingly going to pay deserved tribute to, as an integral part of the Croatian people's struggle for freedom. [applause] Viewed as a whole, this antifascist struggle by Croatia was one of the greatest, not only within the confines of the countries of the former Yugoslavia but in Europe, as well. There is no truth in all those stories, which were meant to fool both the Croatian and the international public, according to which this partisan, national liberation struggle in Croatia was a Serbian struggle alone. In the partisan antifascist movement--in Croatia's partisan army--Croatians accounted for over 60 percent. There were 28 percent of Serbs and all the other nationalities, including Italians, Hungarians, and even Germans and Ruthenians. Hence, the armed force of Croatia's antifascist struggle was Croatian. Understandably, a higher proportion of Serbs than Croats took part in it because the Croats had been truly divided in that period when battles of global proportions were being waged between the antifascist coalition and the axis forces. The leadership of the antifascist struggle in Croatia was in Croatian hands. At the helm of this antifascist struggle in Croatia was Andrija Hebrang, a Croatian communist but also a Croatian patriot. There was also the Croatian poet Vladimir Nazor, who worked here in Istria. It is here where he wrote his beautiful poetry in the Istrian dialect. After all, there is nothing accidental in the life of a people or a movement. If we say that Croatian patriots, such as those I have just mentioned, were at the forefront of Croatia's antifascist struggle, then we should also mention that it was also Croats who led the antifascist struggle across all of Yugoslavia. Josip Broz Tito was a communist, but he was a Croat, too. Ivan Ribar [Croatian communist killed during World War II], was at the helm of the AVNOJ [Antifascist Council of the People's Liberation of Yugoslavia]. He was a Croat, too. [applause] In that leadership of the antifascist struggle of both Croatia and Yugoslavia, prominent positions were also held by the representatives of Istria, representatives who favored the Croatian character of Istria and who fought for the survival of the Croatian identity in Istria and for having Istria as an integral part of Croatia. [applause] It seems that even you in Istria have forgotten that Ante Mandic was also one of the most distinguished and well-known people of this kind. During the First World War, he was the man who advocated the unification of all Croatian lands and their liberation from Italian occupation. He was on the Yugoslav Council during the First World War. In the Second World War he joined the antifascist struggle here in Opatija. Later he became a ZAVNOH [National Antifascist Council for the National Liberation of Croatia] deputy and a deputy of the AVNOJ. As a well-known democrat he was even a royal deputy at the time the Karadjordjevic dynasty was ousted and federal Yugoslavia was established. Hence, Istria has contributed its share to the leadership of the antifascist struggle. This antifascist struggle was of particular importance to Istria because the antifascist struggle [pauses].... not only in Istria, for if there had been only that which could have survived as antifascist in Istria then Istria would not have survived as being Croatian as it would have been subjected to the Italian fascists and the German Nazis. [sentence as heard] Istria could have survived at that time, and it can survive today, but only as an integral part of Croatia. Those who [interrupted by applause, pauses].... And this is one of the reasons why [applause] the state holiday devoted to the antifascist struggle is celebrated here in Istria. We are also celebrating this date because the antifascist struggle waged by the Croatian people as a whole enabled Istria to become reunited with mother Croatia--not only Istria, but Rijeka, Zadar, and the Adriatic islands as well. This antifascist struggle enabled Croatia to become a constituent part of the global democratic coalition and, on the basis of this, to gain the right to build its independence and sovereignty, to become a recognized member of the international community. The celebration of antifascism in Istria should also be marked so as to recall that all that Istria went through before was the worst tragedy for Croatian national consciousness and the Croatian nation. Many have forgotten this. They are even promising Istria some kind of better days. If this is so, let us recall what has been happening to Istria in the recent past, since World War I, from the London Treaty to the Rapallo Treaty, since the time the European imperialists wanted to settle their accounts and imperialist divisions by using Croatia and Croatian lands. Following World War I, at the time of the disintegration of the Hapsburg monarchy, genuine Croatian patriots were advocating Croatia's unification with Serbia and other south Slav lands, not so much because of illusions but because of practical political interests and needs, in order to prevent the implementation of the London Treaty by which the European powers promised not only Istria but also Dalmatia to Italy, and, if unification did not materialize, Slavonia and Bosnia to Serbia. Therefore, Croatian patriots--those from Istria as well, people like Ante Mandic--were thinking of ways to prevent the disaster from occurring. This was accomplished through the creation of the new state. Dalmatia did not become part of Italy, Slavonia and Bosnia were not taken away from Croatia, but Istria remained under Italian occupation. And what happened? Members of other nations comprising the Hapsburg monarchy were immediately released from internment camps, but not Istrian Croats and Slovenes. They remained imprisoned. What ensued was a lurid time for the Croatian people in Istria. The Italian occupation authorities began persecuting everybody, from the common folk to the most influential people, from the peasants and laborers, teachers and priests to everything that had meant something among the people. [sentence as heard] Under the pretext that they were looking for weapons, the Italian carabinieri were searching Croatian homes, stealing all valuable objects, and setting Croatian homes on fire. For instance, in Krnica in 1921 fascists killed two peasants and locked up 89, set 26 houses on fire, and looted the area. This unbearable situation led to the well-known uprising of miners in Labin in 1921, and on 28 February 1921 the Labin republic was proclaimed. The reasons for this were not just social and [word indistinct] but also national. The main witchhunt continued against all those who kept the Croatian spirit alive in Istria, above all against teachers and priests. It is estimated that in the first days of Italian rule about 2,000 public workers were interned in Sardinia and Lipari near Trieste. Many were expelled from Istria, and their places were taken by Italians, including village sisters, teachers, and others. A (?Krk) bishop (?Mandic) was imprisoned, and Andrija Karlin from Trieste was expelled. In Italy in 1919 35 Croatian priests were interned, and 23 priests were imprisoned. One hundred and eight priests and 180 lay priests were expelled across the border, and 15 [word indistinct] convents were closed down. Most serious crimes were committed during the elections of 1921. Even when it was not an entirely fascist state Croatia took advantage of the fascist movement, giving it financial and moral support. This movement and its paramilitary formations, the Black Shirts, used all methods of terror: beating, intimidation, and preventing the expression of Croatian national consciousness. Decrees of 1923 to 1927 changed Croatian names and surnames, as well as names of places, to Italian ones. One decree even banned what they called ridiculous non-Italian names. Gentlemen, try to recall these times and how important it was, despite all of this, to preserve the Croatian consciousness, but only through links with the Croatian state and not through a desire to separate Istria from Croatia. [applause] In these years the majority of Croatian and Slovene schools in the Slovene part were banned. The Italian language was introduced as a mandatory subject in (?382) schools. Italian teachers were brought in and the Croatian ones expelled. In the Croatian part of the Koper district alone seven Croatian schools either came under Italian administration or were shut down. The same fate was shared by 19 schools in the Pazin district, 34 in the Pula district and all but two in Porec district. All Croatian papers, newspapers, and books were banned. Of all the writings in Croatian only the book of prayers remained: Our Father, Thy will be done. This will is sometimes under duress but it will be done by the being that is the essence of all Croats. [sentence as heard] The abolition of all Croatian educational, economic, [word indistinct], and sports associations, the abolition of all organizations, led to the Italianization and de-Croatization of Istria. Fascist terror in Istria assumed such proportions as rarely seen in Europe. By resorting to open terror, they stage-managed various show trials: The most notorious one in Istria was the one of patriot Vladimir Gortan and his comrades from Berm. It would be impossible to recount all the hardships Istria had gone through during the Italian fascist occupation. In one year alone--1934-35--our people were sentenced to 431 years in the dungeon. While the Croats were persecuted and jailed in this way, the Italians and the pro-Italian independence seekers were buying up Croatian land and doing what some are using today to claim that Istria is Italian. This persecution and impoverishment of the Croatian people in Istria resulted in the expulsion of some 100,000 Croats from Istria. Of this number, some 70,000 Croats moved to Croatia and other southern Slav countries while around 25,000 emigrated to North America and around 5,000 left for Belgium and France. This exodus of the Croatian people from Istria was joined by another 40,000 Croats from the regions occupied by the Italian occupation army following the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1941. All of this persecution, this terror, this policy of Istria's de-Croatization did not achieve the desired results. But the consequences of this will even be exploited today as an impetus for continuing such policies. No wonder the demographic picture of Istria was altered with the persecution of Croats and the colonization of Italians--not only officials and Carabinieri, but also workers, [word indistinct], road builders, lumberjacks, teachers, and others. The demographic picture was not the only thing that had changed. This left a deep psychological and political imprint. To hell with that, gentlemen, brothers, and sisters, we shall heal these wounds and we shall not allow Istria to be ruled by the consequences of such a situation. [applause] This is how Istria entered World War II, when the antifascist struggle began in Croatia. The antifascist leadership of Croatia, headed by Andrija Hebrang, immediately comprehended its historic task: that it should kindle and organize the antifascist struggle in Istria. From the very first day of the antifascist struggle in Croatia it considered Istria to be an inalienable part of the antifascist struggle and a constituent part of Croatia. It directed the antifascist struggle on such a basis, and I personally know Istrians who were in Zagreb at the time and whom the leadership of Croatia's antifascist struggle was sending to Istria and Gorski Kotar to organize the antifascist struggle in Istria from Gorski Kotar. [applause] Of course, the Italian fascist occupiers were particularly bent on weeding out any possible form of antifascist resistance in Istria, and that is why the beginning of the armed struggle here, the organizing of Partisan units and bodies of antifascist authority was extremely difficult; so the antifascist struggle in Istria had to be directed from Gorski Kotar. The National Liberation Movement in Istria grew somewhat in size in 1942 when, led by the Communist Party of Croatia, a directive was issued, and district committees for Istria and other antifascist bodies of the antifascist struggle in Istria were formed. The fifth battalion of the Primorsko-Goranski Partisan Detachment was formed in Gorski Kotar in May 1942 with the task of going to Istria and setting in motion the antifascist struggle there. But the power of the Italian fascist occupier ... [pauses] and the oppression of the Croatian people in Istria was such that it was unable to provide support and so this battalion was unable to break through there. However, attempts to break up the antifascist struggle were resumed. In the second half of 1943 a group of fighters moved from the area of Ilirska Bistrica and pitched camp on (Planik) but was unable to maintain itself there either. It had to return to Gorski Kotar. With the repeated attempt of the Istrian Croats who were there, and as a result of the efforts of the Croatian antifascist leadership, an Istrian Partisan unit was re-formed in the area of Gerovo and sent back to Istria. The Istrian detachment known as Vladimir Gortan was founded in August 1942 from the Istrians who fought in Gorski Kotar and in other Croatian areas -- and they were in all Croatian regions, something which indicates the unity of Croatian Istria. In September, following the capitulation of Italy, a general uprising of the Croatian people broke out. It was led by antifascist organizations. Italian military formations were disarmed, and virtually the whole population of Croatian Istria took part in this general Croatian uprising. About 9,000 Italian soldiers were disarmed. About 18,000 people took part in this antifascist movement at that time. By 11 September 1943 virtually the whole of Istria was liberated, apart from Pula, Koper, and Izola. The National Liberation Committee for Istria proclaimed the unification of Istria and Croatia on 13 September 1943. The proclamation says: The spirit of Istria has remained unsubjugated. We did not want to become obedient slaves. In these decisive moments our people have demonstrated a high level of national consciousness. They have proved to all and sundry that Istria is a Croatian land and that it will remain Croatian [applause]. Let those who do not like to hear these words here today ponder this historical document. This historic document further says: Relying on their own resources and not waiting for others to bring them freedom, the Istrians rose and stormed the barracks, seizing arms which are to be used in defense of their right to liberty; they opened wide the notorious prison gates and released the proud sons of unsubjugated Istria; never again shall we allow others to manipulate our fate; the Italian garrisons are in our hands; Italian soldiers are fleeing our soil; the people are taking the helm into their own hands for the first time in history; Istria is joining the motherland and is declaring unification with the rest of our Croatian brothers [applause]. We are firmly holding these arms, the proclamation told Istrians. Let us stand at the bulwark of liberty and let us not allow anybody to take it away ever again; we must remain masters in our own home; the proclamation ends by saying "Long Live Croatian Istria" and by hailing the members of the antifascist democratic coalition, Yugoslavia among them. This decision by the Istrian (?National Liberation) Council on unification with Croatia was confirmed by ZAVNOH, the National Antifascist Council for the People's Liberation of Croatia, on 20 September 1943, which on this occasion anulled all treaties, pacts, and conventions concluded by the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and later the NDH [Independent State of Croatia] in relation to Istria. In mid-September 1943, the main HQS of the Croatian Partisan army sent a large number of military commanders to Istria to organize new units. The operative HQS for Istria was formed here in Pazin on 23 September. The First Istrian Brigade, Vladimir Gortan, was also formed in September, as well as the Second Istrian Brigade, the First Partisan Ucka Unit and the Second Pula Unit. At the same time a brigade and unit were formed in the Slovene part. However, what ensued was the occupation of Istria by the German Nazi army. This occupation was just as oppressive, so oppressive that it managed to push back the partisan forces; moreover, it again gave free reign to those who had ruled during the Italian fascist occupation, the pro-Italian independence seekers, and all those anti-Croatian elements. Italian secessionists in Istria were emboldened by this occupation. Of course, the Croatian leadership did not give up the idea to continue the antifascist struggle in Istria, to nurture the Croatian spirit in Istria, and to create conditions for Istria's unification with Croatia after the war. In such circumstances and regardless of the difficulties encountered in the military sense, representative bodies of the antifascist movement were being formed in Istria. In addition to the Provincial National Liberation Council -- which was later renamed the Regional Council -- there were three district councils: in Pazin, Buzet, and Pula; there were 13 district councils, 37 municipal councils, 3 city councils and 330 local village councils with more than 1,800 deputies. The number of fighters increased again -- from 1,300 in February 1944 to more than 4,000 in April. At that time the leadership of the Croatian antifascist movement decided to form new Istrian brigades. The Vladimir Gortan Istrian Brigade was formed on Mount Ucka on 1 April. A conference of the Croatian antifascist youth of Istria was held the same day, and was attended by some 800 delegates. The Pino Budicin Battalion was formed of fighters of Italian nationality on 4 April near Bale. The Ucka partisan unit was formed on 6 April and the second Pula unit was formed on 11 April. However, all these would not have been sufficient to liberate Istria, and the Croatian leadership passed a decision to form the 43d Istrian Division in Gorski Kotar. This division included the 1st, the 2nd, and the 3d Istrian Brigades, while the Buzet-Porec unit was formed as an auxiliary unit in Istria. All in all, upheld by the spirit of Croatian Istrians and by the special concern of the Croatian antifascist leadership, the antifascist struggle in Istria was continuous. About 30,000 soldiers took part in the antifascist struggle. Five to six thousand fighters fell in this struggle -- the figure is not precise, it is high time that the precise figure is established. There were about 25,000 members in the youth antifascist organization. I have already spoken about the national power committees. There was also a women's antifascist organization. Those Istrians who were forcibly mobilized into the Italian Army joined the overseas brigades after the capitulation of Italy. These brigades later became part of the partisan units. The Italian and German occupying forces in Istria killed -- according to the information at my disposal -- 4,285 of its citizens; 21,509 persons were taken to concentration camps; 5,595 houses were burned down or destroyed. In this antifascist struggle Istria gave a large contribution toward the toppling of fascism, its liberation, the annexation with Croatia and toward the victory of antifascism in Croatia. Istria has 10 people's heroes: Olga Ban, Dragomir Bencic, Mateo Benussi, Mate Blazina, Tino Budicin, Jurica Kalac, Joakim Rakovac, Jovan Stokovac, Joza Suran and Agustin [last name indistinct]. Istria has a lot to be proud of -- with its contribution in the antifascist struggle. This contribution and the lives which Istria had given put us under the obligation to honor the proclamation of Istria: that Istria has been and will always be a Croatian land. [applause] Despite the fact that during the fascist occupation and the antifascist war a large part of the Italian minority stayed close to the Italian occupying authorities -- which resulted in strong hatred between the local Croatian population and the Italian minority -- nevertheless, a process was under way even at that time to create an alliance between Croatian patriots and Italian democrats and antifascists. This helped to provide the possibility for setting up Italian units and for laying the foundations of cooperation between the majority Croatian people and the Italian minority in the region at a later stage and today. However, the victorious end to the antifascist war in Croatia and former Yugoslavia, as I said, under the leadership of the Croats Andrija Hebrang and Vladimir Nazor in Croatia and Josip Broz and Ribar in Yugoslavia -- and this was not a coincidence -- this victorious end which resulted in the genuine integration of Istria in the mother country, this victorious outcome, meant that the dreams of the Croatian patriots within the Renaissance Movement and generally of the Croatian people in the region had come true. But, during the socialist Yugoslavia and socialist Croatia they were let down even, as I said, when it came to the anniversary day and in everyday politics, in particular. Today Istria must remember that Croat statehood in Istria, that the antifascist struggle in Istria, could not have been possible without those Istrian champions of the Croatian Renaissance Movement who had close links with the Croatian nation's 19th Century Renaissance Movement, in general. Juraj Dobrila, Dr Dinko Vitezic, Matko Bastijan, Matko Mandic, Dr. Anton Mahnic, and Dr. Matko Laginja, a lawyer and writer who at the time of the creation of the common state was in charge of the initiative to incorporate Istria in the mother country, were all Croatian champions of the Renaissance Movement in Istria. Of course, a special place among these is reserved for Vjekoslav Stincic, and Bozo Milanovic, a priest who took up and further promoted the traditions of the Croatian Renaissance Movement and who, in the socialist period after World War II and at the Paris Conference, had the courage to say that Istria was Croatian and could be neither Slovene nor anyone else's. This was recorded in international diplomatic (?documents) [applause] I have already mentioned Dr. Anton Mandic -- not just because he played a prominent role as a Croatian politician from Istria between the two world wars, but also because after World War II he was the one who was aware of something that tends to be ignored today, the man who was aware that Croatia [as heard] would have to be extensively linked with its mother country of Croatia, who tried to persuade Josip Broz as far back as 1945 and 1946 to have a road and rail tunnel built under Mount Ucka to link Istria with Croatia. He also suggested other measures -- and I personally spoke to him about them. People of this type are often forgotten nowadays and instead, ideas are promoted which advocate that Istria be singled out as something special. In the socialist period Istria was neglected because the Croatian communists who came to power in Zagreb after Hebrang did not know how to pursue a correct national policy. Theirs was an internationalist policy. I personally heard them say that in socialism it did not matter whether Istria was Croatian, Slovene, or Italian. These people were playing games with the fate of both Istria and Croatia. But those times have long gone. The centuries-long struggle of the Croatian people in general and of Istria in particular ended with the creation of the independent and democratic Croatia which will know how to compensate for the evil deeds and injustices committed against Istria. These are, above all, reflected in the fact that foreign occupation, or more specifically the Italian occupation, and the anti-nationalist and anti-Croatian policy by socialist authorities, resulted in the gradual reduction of -- and not just by Italian but also earlier by the policy of the Habsburgs -- resulted in the gradual reduction in the size of the Croatian population in Istria. Any normal person must take heed of the fact that in 1846 there were 134,455 Croats living in Istria, that in 1919 there were 181,605 Croats in Istria, and that in 1981 that number was 134,890 -- or as many as 140 years ago but fewer than 70 years ago -- and that between 1981 and 1991 the number of Croats in Istria dropped to 111,593. These are the consequences of Istria's special position and of a policy designed to alienate Istria and to undermine its Croatian identity. [applause] Present-day democratic Croatia can and must rectify the situation. [applause] The state and political leadership of present-day Croatia, who, despite the unfavorable domestic and international situation, knew how to go about creating a democratic, independent, sovereign, autonomous Croatia, to ensure not merely its international recognition but to see it accepted within the world international system as a serious factor in creating a new international order in this part of southeastern Europe -- this leadership will know how to resolve all problems facing the Croatian people and the Croatian state in Istria. This Croatian leadership will know how to ensure Croatia's economic, cultural and democratic development. But we shall not allow ideas which -- whether those who promote them in the name of Istria's alleged special position like it or not -- we see as direct continuation of the situation which led to Istria losing some of its Croatian characteristics. So let me repeat: Just as Croatian national consciousness was maintained in Istria by virtue of the fact that Croatian revivalists from Istria were linked with Croatian revivalists in the 19th Century, so the antifascist struggle in Istria could develop and bring both the victory of antifascism to this movement in Istria and the decision, adopted in 1943, to join and unite with the homeland of Croatia. This was because Istria's antifascist struggle was linked -- and not merely linked but had its foundations and drew its strength from and had its base in the entire antifascist struggle in Croatia. Hence the reality of Istria today -- including political, economic and any other reality -- can advance and develop only if linked, or if you like only if linked even more closely, with Croatia than all the other counties of Croatia, precisely because Istria has suffered such consequences and because claims are being made [applause]. And ladies and gentlemen, dear Croatian brothers and sisters, and all citizens of Istria, as a result of all those theories and political programs which talk of Istria as a separate entity and of Istria as a transborder region and of the demilitarization of Istria, of the separate Istrian people, of the self-sufficiency of Istria and even the exploitation of Istria by the rest of Croatia are not only harmful but possibly dangerous and fateful. Those behind these ideas -- whether they are aware of this or not -- these are all a continuation of those policies and that situation which brought about such circumstances that made us feel the consequences in Istria of foreign government and of the foreign political occupation about which I have spoken. These theories and these political programs -- regardless of how many democratic trappings they may have -- play into the hands of those who, both publicly and in secret, stress rights, not only in Istria but also in Rijeka and Dalmatia. And it should not be forgotten that in earlier times Italian irredentists and imperialists knew how to exploit the supporters of Italian rule in Istria and Rijeka and the idea of denationalization. They would even cede Rijeka to Italy, which otherwise, according to peace treaties, was not envisaged for unification with Italy. So they knew how to use these phenomena on our territory and they would know how to exploit these regionalist ideas today just as formerly the pro-Italian independence seekers did, [applause]. Naturally, the Croatian people, which have demonstrated their national and democratic maturity, which have established their own independent and democratic state, their sovereign state, will not allow these ideas to develop into a real threat. [applause]. And as I have said, this democratic Croatia itself will know how to bring Istria into Europe. Furthermore, Croatia was a constituent part of Europe throughout its history and was at the top in terms of all civic activities, as a constituent part of central Europe. What has happened in the last 20 or so years when it was Balkanized has not changed anything in essence, while today, as I have said, Croatia is a recognized factor in the world with which all relevant and important European and world factors reckon. Today, democratic Croatia not only has friends and allies but it has an international position which enables it to defend its sovereign rights and enables it to liberate still occupied territories with the aid of the international community if possible. If this is impossible then all means will be used with the understanding of the international community because the international community is aware that democratic Croatia is conducting a just, peaceful policy and that it wants to be a factor of peace and cooperation between the nations in this part of Europe. [applause] We must not allow any regional ideas which would be a continuation of pro-autonomy and pro-Italian movements in a negative sense in this territory but we also must not forget that Italian fascist occupiers -- even though they were ostensibly allies of Pavelic's NDH -- established links with chetniks from Knin during World War II and that they are doing the same today, that they are being visited by certain Italian senators in Knin and at their gatherings. They are even making some ridiculous jokes about establishing some kind of relations. Therefore, even today we have these trends in our territory and despite political and other changes they are present all the time -- an attempt to cooperate between Italian fascist imperialism and irredentism and greater Serbian imperialism -- this has to be borne in mind here in Istria all the time. [applause] This association of Italian fascists and irredentists and the Knin rebels against Croatia looks funny and it is funny, but it could be tragic if we were to forget that even the smallest of dangers can become a huge threat if it is not taken into account. Democratic Croatia wants to cooperate with democratic Italy and to secure all ethnic minority rights for the Italian minority in Istria and Rijeka, in accordance with international conventions. However, we demand the same for the Croatian minority in Italy, from Trieste to [word indistinct]. The Croatian minority in Italy is larger than the Italian minority here. We demand reciprocity. We hope that the present regime in Italy will continue the policy of its democratic governments: good-neighborly relations with Croatia and Slovenia. We hope that they will respect all agreements and treaties signed after World War II. Croatia is open and ready and wants relations which are as friendly and wide-ranging as possible with democratic Italy. It is prepared to discuss all issues regarding the rights of an ethnic minority but as I said this must also be true for the Croatian minority in Italy. I believe that in democratic Italy the kind of wisdom will prevail which led Italy out of fascism into the fold of the world's democratic countries which also signed these agreements upon which we are today building our mutual relations. Consequently, if we do not attach too much importance to what is being articulated as an irredentist and imperialist drive toward Istria, Rijeka, and Dalmatia, we nevertheless must not ignore such phenomena precisely because they are being linked with Serbian imperialism and its anti-Croatian policies in Croatia and the area of the former Yugoslavia as a whole. This is why we favor a situation whereby we can develop in every way, by all means, friendly and good-neighborly relations with the Italian people and the democratic Italy. Ladies and gentlemen, my dear friends, as I have said, Croatia has won friends and allies in the whole world due to the stability of its democratic system and the correctness of its policies. Today, Croatia can say that it has friends and allies in the world's most powerful power, in the United States. We also have friendly relations with huge China at the other end of the world. We also have friendly relations with the European Union [EU] and friendly relations with the main EU countries and with Islamic countries. Croatia's international position is such that it also safeguards the stability of Croatia's internal development. In economic terms, despite all the consequences of war, Croatia has in a sense performed an economic miracle to the surprise and bafflement of serious people and those who were not sympathetic to us. Our government has managed to slash the inflation rate to an extent achieved by few countries in Europe. Or rather, none of the ex-socialist countries has managed to do so to the same extent. We have today our national currency, the kuna which is already a stable convertible currency [applause]. This national currency of ours has already been included among the world's financial indicators. Croatia is still, understandably, facing its main task -- to liberate its occupied areas [applause]. As I said, we are going to continue our policy; on our part we are going to do everything to bring about a peaceful incorporation in agreement with the international community and with its support and that of the United Nations, so the UN Security Council resolutions on the incorporation of these areas into Croatia can be implemented peacefully. Understandably, if these efforts remain futile and if the international community and the UN turn out to be helpless then the Croatian people as a sovereign people will be capable and will know how to use all means to restore the constitutional and legal order across their entire homeland. [applause] Let me finish, please. I understand the impatience and justified anger of our refugees, from Baranja and Vukovar to Rijeka or Dubrovnik, to Banija and Kordun. At the same time I call on them: be patient for a little while, trust this Croatian state leadership who knew how to establish an independent and sovereign Croatia, who knew how to win friends and allies. We shall know how to do everything possible to liberate Croatia's occupied areas without casualties. We are also going to do everything we have to -- if we have to -- to help you return to your homes, to the ruins of your burned-down houses. We are going to help you restore them. I have been meeting you all over Croatia. Understandably, you cannot remain homeless while Serbian occupation forces reign on Croatian territory. Consequently, the sovereign and democratic Croatia has known and will know what it wants. We needed friends and allies in the world and we knew how to win them. On the other hand, the world's democratic forces need a stable and democratic Croatia. This is the kind of Croatia that will remain because the Croatian people have realized that they have restored Croatian sovereignty through their sacrifices and skills in all Croatian regions, in all Croatian areas, counties. What remains is what I said was their immediate task. But this Croatia has its position in the international order. This Croatia is today respected by everyone, including those who at some stage did not want it to exist. The antifascist struggle of the Croatian people in the whole of Croatia, including Istria, hugely contributed to the very foundations of this democratic Croatia. Without the contribution of the antifascist struggle there would be no independent and democratic Croatia today. This is something the democratic Croatian authorities will bear in mind. Likewise, members of Croatia's antifascist movement in World War II must bear in mind the fact that Croatia is preoccupied with the problems of its current war and with everything else we are facing today, so it has not been able to pay enough attention to those members of the antifascist movement who were partly in the service of Croatia's state freedom and Croatian statehood idea, just as they were also -- if they were members of the Serbian people -- gripped by the idea that a Croatian state should not be allowed to exist. [sentence as heard] Consequently, these members of the antifascist movement of Serbian nationality must also understand this reality; they must understand that the essence of antifascist struggle in Croatia was the struggle for Croatian freedom, for Croatian statehood. I want to recall that even the Serbian units in Banija and Kordun were flying the Croatian flag. This is the essential feature which decisively characterized the antifascist movement of Croatia. This is why we have incorporated antifascism into the foundations of Croatian freedom, Croatian statehood. Likewise, all members of the antifascist struggle must understand that they must get rid of their notions if what they saw in it was a struggle against some kind of independent Croatian state. This desperation of the Croatian people in World War II, this very complex situation, was to some extent clearly reflected in the situation brought about in the wake of the proclamation of independent Croatia, in the rebellion of the Serbs from Knin and elsewhere, who were directly instructed by the Yugoslav communist army and Belgrade. Consequently, all of this is a reality suggesting that we must bear in mind these problems in their entirety, including the antifascist struggle as well as the struggle for Croatian freedom and a Croatian state. Hence, let us pay eternal tribute to the honour and glory of members of the antifascist struggle of Croatia and of Istria within the same context. Long live Croatian Istria in this democratic and sovereign Croatia.
