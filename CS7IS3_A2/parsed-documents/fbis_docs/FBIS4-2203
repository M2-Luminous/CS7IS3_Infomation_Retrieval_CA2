The major tasks of the meeting are to conscientiously carry out the guidelines of the national meeting on propaganda and ideological work, and to mobilize all levels of leaders, all Communist party members, and all comrades on the propaganda and ideological front in the region to further seek unity of thinking, enhance morale, grasp the overall situation, and do a solid job to create a new situation in propaganda and ideological work in order to continuously push forward reform, opening up, and modernization of the region. At this point, I would like to dwell on three issues. 1. The issue of the important significance in doing the propaganda and ideological work well during the new situation. An important meeting with overall significance, the national meeting on propaganda and ideological work was held not too long ago by the CPC Central Committee at a critical moment when China was building a new socialist market economic system and carrying out the modernization drive. Important speeches made by central leading comrades Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, and Ding Guangen at that meeting have profoundly expounded upon the importance of the propaganda and ideological work during the new period, have set forth major missions that should be shouldered by propaganda and ideological work departments in building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and have called on the whole party to strengthen and improve leadership over propaganda and ideological work in a bid to raise propaganda and ideological work to a new level. The fundamental principles and the major tasks set forth by that meeting are characterized by the distinctive feature of the times, are major policy decisions adopted by the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core, to carry out the principle of "taking a two-handed approach and being tough with both hands," and are the strategic dispositions for ensuring the triumphant progress of the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Successfully implementing the guidelines of that meeting in line with the realities of the region is of great, immediate and far- reaching historical significance in carrying out the work principle of "seizing favorable opportunity to deepen reform, expand the scale of opening up, promote development, and maintain stability," in promoting the reform, development, and stability of the region, in bringing up new generations of people who are politically aware, morally-sound, well-educated, and well-disciplined, in consolidating and developing socialist relations among all nationalities, and in building socialism with Chinese characteristics. All Communist party members in the region, leading cadres at all levels in particular, must fully understand the great significance of the national meeting on propaganda and ideological work, conscientiously study the documents of that meeting, profoundly comprehend the guidelines of that meeting, and make great efforts to truly implement the work ideas and various dispositions defined by that meeting in doing practical work. Within the magnificent cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the propaganda and ideological front is an important front shouldering the important task of providing spiritual motivation, ideological guarantee, and intellectual support. Our party has always attached high importance to propaganda and ideological work. Since the third plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has made many brilliant and distinct expositions on strengthening the party's propaganda and ideological work. He has repeatedly stressed the necessity of putting propaganda and ideological work in an extremely important place and actually paying attention to the work without any slackness. The third generation of the party's leading collective, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core, has paid extremely high attention to propaganda and ideological work and has set forth a series of correct principles, policies, and demands on the propaganda and ideological work under the new situation. We should profoundly comprehend and earnestly implement these principles, policies, and demands. As far as our Inner Mongolia Region is concerned, strengthening propaganda and ideological work is of especially important significance. First, our region is located in the border area where the economic and cultural conditions are relatively backward, the reform and economic development tasks are very heavy, and the tasks of emancipating the mind and changing concepts are more arduous than any other place. Thus we are required to widely create public opinions and open a path for unceasingly emancipating the mind, changing concepts, and accelerating reform and development through our propaganda and ideological work. Second, as China will issue the greatest number of reform measures this year than in any previous year, we will face many difficulties. Particularly in places like our region, which is restricted by conditions in various aspects, people are relatively weak in withstanding the reform strain and will thus have more ideological problems. This requires our efforts to strengthen guidance through our propaganda and ideological work, help the people correctly recognize the situation, and understand reform in an effort to more extensively mobilize the masses to support and participate in reform and to guarantee success in reform. Third, ours is a regional autonomous region of minority nationalities and a major region where the current international hostile forces have stepped up their efforts to implement the strategy of "westernization" and "disintegration" in our country. The activities of "Pan-Mongolism" have been aggravated abroad and class struggle still exists to a certain degree in China. We are facing a fairly complicated struggle in political and ideological spheres. Thus we are required to strengthen propaganda and ideological work and strengthen education on the political situation, on the Marxist nationalities concept and the religious concept, and on our party's nationalities policy and religious policy. Only thus, can we effectively resist the plots of " westernization" and "disintegration" of the hostile forces at home and abroad, consolidate and develop an excellent situation of stability and unity in our region, and effect a long period of order and stability in the border areas. In the face of this new situation and new task, we must pay greater attention to propaganda and ideological work. This work must be strengthened and not weakened; and be improved and enhanced and not be allowed to remain stagnant. During recent years, our region has made great achievements in propaganda and ideological work, and played a positive role in the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Party committees at all levels have paid attention to promoting and guaranteeing the accomplishment of all tasks through propaganda and ideological work. The situation in which the whole party attends to propaganda and ideological work is being formed. Generally speaking, all departments on the propaganda and ideological front are capable of carrying out their work in line with the party's basic line, and have submitted themselves to and served the central task of economic construction, conducted education on the party's basic theories and basic line, on patriotism, collectivism, socialism, and national unity, done much work to introduce our region's typical cases and experience in reform and development, to strengthen spiritual civilization in the urban and rural areas and external propaganda work, and to invigorate the cultural sphere, and made new progress in many aspects. The regional party committee and government are satisfied with the propaganda and ideological work and trust the ranks of propaganda and ideological workers. While recognizing the achievements, we should also recognize that our propaganda and ideological work is not compatible with the development of the current situation. The party and government leaders in some localities have failed to pay sufficient attention to propaganda and ideological work, and have the problem of being "soft with one hand and tough with the other hand" in practical work. Efforts are needed to adopt a clear-cut stand and further enhance the ability to specifically conduct propaganda and ideological work; strengthen theoretical study and propaganda in close connection with reality, and provide support and guarantee for reform, development, and stability; and further improve cultural and economic policies. To solve these problems, we must further conscientiously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, profoundly understand its essence, and strive to enhance our awareness and steadfastness in implementing this theory. Persisting in the principle of "taking a two-hand approach and ensuring that both hands are tough" is the basic principle of building a socialism with Chinese characteristics as set forth by Comrade Xiaoping under the new historical conditions. This basic principle demonstrated gigantic forces and produced profound influence when there was severe unrest in the international situation, major domestic reform was being carried out, and the western hostile forces were launching "westernization" and "disintegration" strategies against us. We should proceed from reality to study this important idea of Comrade Xiaoping and emphatically solve the following three ideological and practical problems. First, we should firmly define the awareness of "taking a two- hand approach." In building socialism with Chinese characteristics, we should not only replace poverty with wealth but also replace ignorance with civilization to form a healthy, scientific, and civilized way of life. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out during his inspection of south China in 1992: "To catch up with the `four little dragons of Asia' in the next 20 years, Guangdong should not only promote its economy and improve the social order and the general mood of society but also surpass them in building material and spiritual civilizations. This is the so-called socialism with Chinese characteristics." The party as a whole is warned that socialism with Chinese characteristics is a socialism characterized by highly developed material and spiritual civilizations. In their real life, some comrades regard economic construction as a "tangible task" and a "real target" and the improvement of party style and administrative honesty and the ideological and political work as an "intangible task" and an "impractical target." So, they placed the improvement of party style and administrative honesty and the ideological and political work in a marginal position. We must clearly define that the basic line of the party is to take the economic construction as a key link. This key link must be neither obstructed nor attacked. The work in various spheres must be focused on, be submitted to, and serve this link. The stress on "taking a two-hand approach" is aimed at ensuring the central link of economic construction through the improvement of spiritual civilization. We must profoundly understand that when the spiritual civilization is ignored, the material civilization will not develop well and we will be divorced from the party's basic line of "one center and two basic points." Comrade Xiaoping said that "if the spiritual civilization is not strengthened, the material civilization will be damaged and we will regress in the course of building the material civilization. It will be impossible for us to win success in revolution and construction if we only rely on material conditions." At a meeting of political bureau standing committee members that was held in 1986, Comrade Xiaoping further stressed: "If common practice regresses, the success in economic construction will become meaningless. The deterioration in other aspects will bring about economic deterioration. If the tendency spreads unchecked, a world where corruption, theft, and bribery run rampant will take shape. Comrade Xiaoping's statement is pregnant with meaning and provides the people with food for thought. The party committees at various levels should approach from the high plane of the successful strategy of building a socialism with Chinese characteristics to fully understand the importance and urgency of building the party's propaganda and ideological work and firmly foster the awareness of "taking a two-hand approach." This is the prerequisite as well as the ideological foundation for realistically and consciously paying attention to the propaganda and ideological work. In principle, some comrades understand the importance of strengthening the construction of the spiritual civilization and the ideological and political work. However, in doing their practical work, they think that the party and the government should divide the work of building spiritual and material civilizations. They think that the ideological and political work is a matter for party committees and propaganda and ideological work departments and that the ideological and political work is not related to their professional work. Thus, the phenomena of "the two hands" divorced from each other results. We must understand that although our comrades work at different posts and their specific tasks are different, their major target is identical and all of them are working to liberate and develop productive forces, safeguard the reunification of the motherland and the great unity of various nationalities, and build a socialism with Chinese characteristics. Therefore, the party committees and governments at various levels should persist in the principle of "taking a two-hand approach," all comrades of the party, regardless of their jobs, have the duty to assume responsibility for building both spiritual and material civilizations. We must neither isolate the material civilization from the spiritual civilization nor set one against the other. Second, we should profoundly comprehend the exposition that "the biggest mistake lies in education" and enhance the concern. In 1989, in light of the tendency to neglect ideological and political education, Comrade Xiaoping set forth, in a clear-cut stand, the exposition that "the biggest mistake in the past decade was in education." He said: "Upon sober reflection, we assess the mistake in education to be even more serious than that of inflation." In 1992, while dwelling on the question of how to ensure long-term stability and order of the state, he pointed out: "Both persons failed, opposing bourgeois liberalization instead of focusing on the economic issue. Therefore, they cannot be forgiven." Comrade Xiaoping pointed out earnestly: "It cost us a dozen years to achieve today's results in building special zones, but it will only take a single night to destroy. While easy to destroy, it is difficult to build up. Failing to watch out for signs of problems, something will go wrong." Obtaining a profound understanding of these expositions is of great significance for us in strengthening propaganda and ideological work. The current overall situation, the economic and political situation, and the international environment we now face are favorable to us. However, the ideological problems within the party and in society are extremely complicated, various kinds of instable factors remain, and the task on ideological and political work are extremely arduous. In addition, some of our comrades are immersed in specific affairs, are not serious about politics, and lack a sense of concern. Some comrades remain indifferent to negative feelings, are reluctant to criticize erroneous speeches, and even chime in with such speeches. If we allow these problems to go unchecked, they will certainly lead to the spreading of evil trends and erroneous ideas. In particular, if we pay no attention to guiding our cadres and the masses through education and let various sorts of mistakes, reactionary ideas in particular, spread unchecked in the process of building the socialist market economic structure, not only will our economic construction, reform, and opening up be adversely affected, but our morale will also be dampened and our cause, ruined. Third, we should conscientiously implement the measure of "being tough with both hands." In the past few years, we shouted loudly for building spiritual civilization and strengthening ideological and political work whenever there was a meeting, but, the results were not good enough. The essential reason was the failure in implementation. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out straightforwardly: It is not that we have failed to stress the adherence to four cardinal principles, the ideological and political work, the opposition to bourgeois liberalization, and the opposition to spiritual pollution, but that we have fallen behind in consistency, taking action, and even talk about them." He exhorted the whole party that "in building spiritual civilization, in improving the party style, and in improving the atmosphere of society, we must be resolute without any slackness and must begin with specific affairs." Comparing our work against this instruction of Comrade Xiaoping, we can actually find some problems that cannot be neglected. First, we have not been resolute enough. Although some measures have been adopted, they are not dynamic enough to have formed a prevailing atmosphere. Second, our measures have been sometimes resolute but sometimes slack. Some comrades have forgotten propaganda and ideological work when the work is smooth, and when confronted with problems, they became suddenly attentive to propaganda and ideological work. Third, some comrades do not have the courage to solve problems beginning with the specific incidence of their own localities and units, and do not have the courage to talk about and manage the obvious problems, and then let these problems go unchecked for fear of running risks and giving offense. To actually change this situation, party and government leaders at all levels of all units as well as all comrades of the party must enhance party spirit, adhere to principles, and actually attend to practical work with the spirit of being responsible for the interests of the party and the people. They should not only map out plans and measures for strengthening propaganda and ideological work but also do their work in a down-to-earth manner and truly carry out what they have written and said in order to truly turn the ideological and political work from being merely ideology to practical work and yield great results in this regard. 2. On the current main tasks of the propaganda and ideological work front. Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out at the national propaganda and ideological work conference: The propaganda and ideological front must firmly grasp the fundamental guide of the theory on building a socialism with Chinese characteristics, "arm the people with scientific theories, guide the people with accurate mass media, portray the people with lofty spirits, and mobilize the people with outstanding works." This "fundamental guide and the work in four aspects" are to make an overall arrangement and work out a good idea for achieving the propaganda and ideological work in the course of accelerating the setup of the socialist market economic system. The basic propaganda and ideological work tasks at present and in the foreseeable future as set forth by the region according to this spirit are as follows: We should work closely in line with the overall situation of reform, development, unity, and stability; arm the masses with the theory on building a socialism with Chinese characteristics; conduct propaganda on the party's basic line, principles, and policies among the masses; educate the masses with ideas of patriotism, collectivism, and socialism; mobilize the masses' enthusiasm with the goal of becoming fairly well-off and seeking common wealth; seek unity of thinking; have firm confidence; unite with the people; mobilize the cadres and people of various nationalities; bring their enthusiasm, creativeness, and arduous and pioneering spirits into greatest play; and create a good social mass media environment and provide forceful ideological and political guarantees for realizing the region's two current fighting goals. A. We should grasp theoretical study so that the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics will take root in the hearts of the people. Arming the cadres and the people with the theory on building a socialism with Chinese characteristics is the primary task of the propaganda and ideological work front as well as the key to achieving propaganda and ideological work. The propaganda and ideological work conference set higher, new demands on fulfilling this task. We must conscientiously implement this spirit and solidly deepen the study of the theory on building a socialism with Chinese characteristics. The organizational and propaganda departments under the party committees at various levels should make overall plans, including both long-term and short-term arrangements. The main contents of the study are to study volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and the "decision" of the third plenary session of the 14th party congress. We should prominently grasp the study of the leading cadres at or above the banner and county level, particularly the key groups. In study, the key groups at various levels should combine theories with practice, seek unity of thinking, perfect policy decisions, sum up experiences, promote the organic combination of the work, and strive to deepen their study and better apply what they have studied. Through the study of the key groups at various levels, we should guide the broad masses of party members, cadres, and people to engage in the study. From now on, we should educate party members mainly with the theory on building a socialism with Chinese characteristics so as to have the broad masses of party members and cadres grasp the theoretical essence of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, to answer and handle various practical problems, to be able to profoundly understand and comprehensively implement the party's basic line of "one center and two basic points," to be able to deeply understand and grasp the basic viewpoint of developing the socialist market economy, to be able to accurately understand and handle the relationship between stability and reform and development, to be able to accurately understand and constantly persist in the basic principle of "taking a two-hand approach and ensuring that both hands are tough," and to be able to play an exemplary role in persisting in the purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly. As far as our Inner Mongolia is concerned, one of the most important aspects in studying theory is to persist in using the Marxist nationalities concept and nationalities policy to arm the broad masses of party members and cadres of various nationalities. The party's nationalities theory and nationalities policy are a component of the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The broad masses of cadres across the region, particularly the party leading cadres, should firmly cultivate the Marxist nationalities concept, study and grasp our party's basic theory and basic policy on solving the nationalities issue, and study and understand the ideology and thesis of Comrade Deng Xiaoping on nationalities issues and work. Through conducting realistic, in-depth, and extensive education on nationalities theory and policy, we should strive to grasp the basic viewpoint, clarify the rights and wrongs on some major issues, and reach a common understanding. At present, we should further unify thinking and enhance understanding on the following basic viewpoints: A united multinational country with a long history, China's territory has been developed jointly by the people of various nationalities and created a brilliant Chinese culture; Over a long period of relocation and fusion, the people of various nationalities have formed a Chinese nation whose people are closely interrelated and bonded strongly with the sense that being a part of the Chinese nation is the spiritual tie linking the people of various nationalities together, and the idea that "all nationalities are indispensable to one another" as the ideological basis for safeguarding national unity and promoting common prosperity; All natural resources in the localities are the commonwealth of the Chinese nation, and translating the natural resources advantages into economic advantages is the common task for all nationalities; The essence of the party's policy on nationalities is aimed at developing minority areas and realizing common prosperity among the people of various nationalities; We should stress essence and not form in observing minority areas; We must uphold the "three essential criteria" in assessing the work of minority areas; In essence, the issue on the uneven development in various localities is an issue of the history of society and economic development and is absolutely not an issue of inequality among the people of various nationalities; A process is required in narrowing the gap between minority areas and developed areas and realizing common prosperity; Promoting great unity among the people of various nationalities and maintaining political and social stability in minority areas is the overall situation of the party and the state and is where the fundamental interests of the people of various nationalities lie; An important method used by hostile western forces in dissolving socialism is that of using the nationalities issue and religious issue to disintegrate China, which not only means disaster for the various nationalities in China, but also for the whole world; Our struggle against a small number of national splittists is a conflict between ourselves and the enemy to the people of various nationalities, the splittists. With a common understanding, we will be able to build a strong line of ideological defense to oppose "westernization," and "disintegration," narrow the market for the activities of the national splittist force to maximum, eliminate interference, realize a long period of order and stability in the border areas, safeguard the unification of the motherland, and accelerate development in our region and the common progress and prosperity among the people of various nationalities. B. We should correctly guide public opinions to serve in-depth reform, to accelerate development, and to safeguard stability. Grasping correct media guidance is aimed at mobilizing the masses of people of various nationalities to actively participate in reform and in the modernization drive. We should apply all sorts of propaganda and media means, implement the party's theories, line, principles, and policies of the new period among the masses of people through solid and effective work, publicize the situation and tasks to the people, clearly explain the new problems and new contradictions emerging in the course of reform to the masses, provide a strong ideological and political guarantee for accelerating reform and opening up, and create a good media environment for developing the economy and promoting national unity and social stability. This year is critical to deepening the reform and accelerating the development of the region. In deepening the reform, we should emphatically make breakthroughs in five aspects, that is, to make new breakthroughs in establishing and perfecting the socialized comprehensive service system in rural and pastoral areas; in transforming the mechanisms of industrial and commercial enterprises; in reforming financial and tax systems; in reforming pricing and financial systems; and in conducting organizational reform, changing government functions, and carrying out reforms in subsidiary fields. After making breakthroughs in these five aspects, we will be able to create a new situation in overall reform. At present, because the people have different positions and interests, and use different angles to approach issues, various sorts of ideological problems will naturally exist. This requires our party committees at all levels and our comrades on the propaganda and ideological front to strengthen investigation and study, to master in a timely manner the changes in the people's ideas and feelings, to do a good job in giving ideological persuasion, resolving contradictions, and harmonizing public feelings, and to guide, in a clear-cut way, the masses to comprehend, support, and participate in reform. At present, the most important and urgent task is to purposefully do the propaganda and ideological work for the difficult and hot issues for the common concern of the masses. For instance, the issue on how to approach the gaps between the development of the region and advanced localities. Through the guidance by mass media, we should make the people definitely understand the following facts: At present, the region's general situation of economic development is good, and the region has made a very great progress if compared with the past. There are many-sided reasons for causing the gaps between the region and advanced localities, the gaps exist between those who have become prosperous first and those who lag behind, and this kind of gap will be hard to avoid in a certain period of time. In accelerating development, we should stress solid work and efficiency rather than blindly competing with one another in a race for speed. In accelerating development, we should make best possible use of the rich natural resources of the region's agriculture and animal husbandry to engage in large-scale cropping and breeding in a bid to increase the value in an even faster manner. In accelerating development, we must deepen reform, overcome the ideas of "waiting, depending on, and asking for someone else," and get rid of the defects of "common big pots," "iron rice bowl," and "egalitarianism." In accelerating the pace of making the region become prosperous, we should depend on the concerted efforts and arduous struggle of the people of all nationalities and should be aware that it is of no avail to blame God and men and being negative and pessimistic is detrimental to development. The region enjoys exceptional advantages and has tremendous potentials in developing the economy and thus the bright prospects in invigorating the region's economy should be fully understood. After reaching a common understanding of these issues, we will be more confident and vigorous, create a new spiritual outlook, and obtain an ideological foundation and motivation for achieving success in our work. For another instance, anticorruption is also a hot issue with which the masses are concerned. It should be noted that the people's dissatisfaction with corrupt phenomena is a manifestation of their concern with the party and their hope of making the party strong and pure. As the propaganda and mass media departments of the party, we should guide the masses to have a correct understanding of the opposition to corruption. In this regard, we should define the following several basic viewpoints: The main trend of our party is good, the overwhelming majority of party members and cadres are honest and clean in performing official duties and are conscientious in serving the people. In opposing corruption, the attitude of the CPC Central Committee is resolute and the measures are effective, and the regional party committee and most party organizations in the region have been brave in tackling and dealing with corruption. Corrupt phenomena are serious, and the anticorruption campaign is a long-term task, which cannot be accomplished in one stroke. We should be ideologically prepared to deal blows to corruption firmly and unremittingly and should also embrace the sense of urgency. In launching the anticorruption campaign, we should stress discipline and the legal system and should depend on the masses to build up a powerful momentum of mass media instead of launching movements. Correctly launching the anticorruption campaign in line with the arrangements of the CPC Central Committee will not affect economic construction, reform, and opening up, but will provide important guarantees for reform and construction. Our party will always oppose corruption and will certainly be able to achieve results at each stage of anticorruption and gradually reduce the phenomenon of corruption to the lowest degree. To accurately grasp the focal points of the orientation for mass media it is necessary to grasp various media. Media, such as newspapers, publications, and radio and television programs, are key means to achieve the propaganda and ideological work. Therefore, these news mediums should bring into full play their special characteristics and advantages in guiding the mass media; persist in the principles of unity, stability, vigor, and propaganda by giving positive examples; accurately grasp the orientation for propaganda and mass media; positively support and develop accurate and healthful mass media; overcome lopsided and irresponsible mass media; and resolutely eliminate and end harmful mass media. Our mass media must really conform to the principles and policies of the party and actually stand for the majority of the people's opinions and interests. We must never support the mass media that are not suitable to the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the party's basic line and basic policies, and the party's policies toward nationalities and religions, and that are not conducive to the national unity and the reunification of the motherland. Further strengthening external propaganda is an important aspect of accurately grasping the orientation for mass media. Success in external propaganda is of great strategic and realistic significance in expanding Inner Mongolia's international and domestic influence; promoting the economic, scientific and technological, and cultural exchange between our region and the outside world; and forming a good external environment that is conducive to deepening reform, expanding the scale of opening up, and accelerating the pace of development. We must further strengthen the awareness of external propaganda, use the geographic advantages, use various channels and forms to disseminate Inner Mongolia, have the outside world understand Inner Mongolia more clearly, and have Inner Mongolia walk toward the whole country and the whole world with wide strides. C. We should well grasp the ideological education and strive to advocate a good mental outlook and a good social practice. The fundamental purpose of strengthening the ideological education is to cultivate new persons with ideals, morality, education, and a sense of discipline. At present, we should focus our efforts on educating the broad masses of cadres, people, and youngsters with the spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly as repeatedly advocated by Comrade Mao Zedong; the spirit of having ideals, morality, education, and a sense of discipline as repeatedly stressed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping; and Comrade Jiang Zemin's 64-character pioneering spirit so as to have these spirits become the strong spiritual pillars of the socialism with Chinese characteristics as well as the social practice in the new age and to further forcefully resist the influence of such corrosive ideas as money worship, hedonism, and out-and-out egoism. According to the demands of the new situation of setting up the socialist market economic system, at present and in the foreseeable future, the party committees, the governments, and the propaganda and ideological departments should emphatically solve the following few problems by conducting the ideological education in a clear-cut and vivid manner. First, we should educate the people to have firm confidence in socialism, foster lofty ideals, and consciously engage themselves in the great cause of building a socialism with Chinese characteristics. Second, we should enhance the cadres and people's confidence in deepening reform and accelerating development and guide them to be inspired with enthusiasm, work hard, and tide over difficulties. Third, we should educate the cadres and the people to foster the ideas of ardently loving the motherland and showing concern for the collectives and to accurately handle the relationship between the interests of the whole and those of the part and between the interests of collectives and those of individuals. At the time of conducting the ideological education, all departments and units should closely proceed from their work realities and the broad masses of cadres and people's thinking to do their jobs well, solve problems ahead of them, stress real efficiency, and avoid practicing formalism. At the same time, we should also conduct education on building our country and conducting all undertakings through thrift and long years of hard work, and on professional ethics, social morality, and basic national and regional conditions. We should make the people understand that in such an economically underdeveloped area like ours, arduous struggle and building the country through hard work should be an important guiding ideology during the whole course of economic development and that any acts of going in for ostentation and extravagance, parading one's wealth, and engaging in extravagance and waste are incompatible with the demands of the times and the desire of the people. Even when we become rich in the future, we should also actively promote the spirit of arduous struggle and building the country through hard work. Through extensive and in-depth education, we should also promote the progressive, sound, and civilized way of living, promote the revolutionary spirit of unselfishness and selfless dedication, and enable more people, particularly young people, to correctly cultivate the concept on value and on the outlook on life, to enhance their sense of the legal system, and to consciously observe law and discipline, professional ethics, and social morality. It is necessary to educate cadres and the masses to recognize the basic national and regional conditions, link the work they are engaging in with the overall development situation of the region, and consciously contribute to accelerating Inner Mongolia's reform, opening up, and economic development. To strengthen ideological education of the new period, we must pay attention to summing up experience, promoting typical examples, and unceasingly enhancing the ideological work of the whole society. We should stress the exemplary role, moral quality, and strength of educators while conducting education and strive to create a social environment and cultural atmosphere for enhancing educational results. We should give democracy full play; respect, understand, and care for the people; adopt the forms and methods that are easily accepted and welcomed by the masses, make all activities imbue with education, and guide the masses to conduct self education and mutual education. In short, we should give full play to the positive role of ideological education in correctly guiding the people's social value orientation, social morality, and social ideology. D. We should attend to literary and artistic creations and provide more healthy and rich spiritual products for the people of various nationalities. As far as the literary and art front is concerned, to implement the guidelines of the national propaganda and ideological work conference, it must pay special attention to producing outstanding literary and artistic works on promoting the main melody and manifesting the regional and national characteristics, and at the same time, promote the creation of various literary and artistic works to satisfy the daily increasing needs of the people of various nationalities. To invigorate literary and artistic creations, we must uphold the correct orientation of serving the people and socialism and implement the principle of letting "a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend." Speaking from the angle of leadership, first, leaders should grasp the orientation; second, they should formulate good policies; and third, they should organize and coordinate the work well and create a good environment for invigorating literary and artistic creations. It is necessary to adopt effective measures to enhance the quality of creations, exert efforts to produce a number of outstanding works, such as films, television programs, literature books, dramas, music, dance, folk arts, and artistic works. Propaganda and cultural departments at all levels should produce good literary and art works in an effort to guide literary and artistic creations. In publication work, we should uphold the orientation, deepen reform, maintain the characteristics, and play a greater role in building the two civilizations in the whole region. We should support and protect the literary and artistic works with quintessence of national culture and a fairly high value. We should continue to implement the principle of "achieving development on the one hand and eliminating pornography on the other" to promote healthy development in Inner Mongolia's cultural undertakings. It is hoped that all literary and art groups, writers, and artists will fully understand their noble mission, live up to the high expectations placed on them, raise spirits, go deep into the reality of life, devote themselves to work, and create a number of outstanding works that reflect the spirit of this era and the local and national characteristics and that are artistically appealing. Meanwhile, the efforts of various fields should be mustered and effective measures adopted to greatly rectify the cultural market so that notable results can be achieved in a short time. In developing cultural undertakings, we should gear them to the needs of the masses, rely on the masses, and mobilize the forces of the entire society to make Inner Mongolia's mass cultural activities vivid, lively, rich, and colorful. 3. On strengthening party leadership over propaganda and ideological work. Now that the major principles for the propaganda and ideological work have been defined, the key to the next step of work is to publicize the guidelines of the party Central Committee and the regional party committee at the grass-roots levels in a down-to- earth manner. This requires that our party committees at all levels further strengthen leadership over propaganda and ideological work, firmly grasp the initiative in doing propaganda and ideological work, and make the work more fruitful through practical and effective work. First, we should attach great importance to the party's propaganda and ideological work and grasp the initiative in leadership work. Propaganda and ideological work has a strong political, policy, and ideological nature. While paying close attention to and achieving success in reform, opening up, and economic construction, party committees at all levels should conscientiously strengthen and improve leadership over propaganda and ideological work. They should list propaganda and ideological work high on their agenda, study it on a regular basis, draw up the principles, tasks, and work focuses of the propaganda and ideological work for different periods, and devote more energy to guiding and helping propaganda departments to discuss and address major issues and to raise work levels. Major leaders of party committees should concern themselves with the propaganda on major issues, and propaganda departments should participate in major political and economic activities so that propaganda and ideological work will more directly permeate the party's central work. When formulating strategic plans for economic and social development, party committees and governments at all levels should include the development of propaganda and cultural work in the general plans. Whether party and government leaders attach importance to propaganda and ideological work and whether they have the ability to carry out propaganda and ideological work should be regarded as important criteria to judge whether they are politically strong and have a high leadership level. As long as our leaders fully understand the important position and role of propaganda and ideological work, they will be able to actively carry out ideological and political work and fundamentally grasp the initiative in propaganda and ideological work. Second, we should change work styles and pay close attention to implementation of work. All departments, units, and comrades on the propaganda and ideological fronts should vigorously conduct investigation and study and seek truth from facts when doing specific work. Intensifying investigation and study is the basic skill for a success in propaganda and ideological work. Comrades on the propaganda and ideological fronts should go down to the grass- roots levels to learn about the actual conditions and develop their investigation and study in both range and quality. They should establish more ties not only with cadres but also with the masses; learn more not only about typical experiences but also about the specific conditions in large areas; and conduct not only in-depth investigation but also in-depth study. On the basis of having a good knowledge of first-hand materials, we should explore something with a regular pattern and guiding significance, and make propaganda and ideological work more specific. Seeking truth from facts is the basic demand for guaranteeing success in propaganda and ideological work and the work style and attitude that propaganda and ideological workers should have. Propaganda departments at all levels should formulate objectives for fulfilling the task within a certain stage and measures for guaranteeing the fulfillment of the task in line with the work plans proposed by the central authorities and the regional party committee, pay attention to sharing the work with departments of the corresponding level and responsibilities with the lower levels, combine the efforts of both, and implement the measures well. We should make each and every propaganda unit and propaganda worker clearly understand his responsibility, perform his own work well, and guarantee that all propaganda and ideological tasks will be well implemented. Third, we should strengthen coordination and form a joint force. Propaganda and ideological work is a project involving the whole society which must be accomplished with the coordinated efforts of the whole party and all sectors. Party committees at all levels and all grass-roots party organizations in enterprises, the rural areas, organs, schools, and neighborhoods should emphasize this work. Administrative departments at all levels and the mass organizations, such as the trade unions, Communist Youth Leagues, and women's federations, should grasp this work in line with their own work. All departments on the propaganda and ideological front should grasp this work specifically and form a lively situation in which the whole party, the higher and the lower levels, and all sectors jointly grasp and manage propaganda and ideological work. Propaganda and ideological departments at all levels should be good at maintaining coordination with other departments, exchange information regularly, establish ties, and seek understanding and support from all sectors. Investments are needed in strengthening propaganda and ideological work. All localities should actively support propaganda and ideological work in terms of financial and human resources in line with the actual economic development situation, gradually improve propaganda means and cultural facilities, and create a good environment for propaganda and ideological work. Fourth, we should emancipate the mind, deepen reform, and enhance vitality for the development of propaganda and cultural undertakings. To strengthen the party's leadership over propaganda and ideological work, we must uphold the reform principle, regard reform as a motivation, and promote the entire propaganda and ideological work to a new height. To reform propaganda and ideological work, we must uphold the principles conducive to strengthening and improving the party's leadership over propaganda and cultural undertakings, giving full play to the enthusiasm and creation of the propaganda and cultural workers, invigorating and developing the propaganda and cultural undertakings, and building the "two civilizations," and realize the demand proposed by Comrade Jiang Zemin on "changing functions, improving relations, streamlining administration, and raising efficiency." The basic ideas of reform are to further reform and improve the leadership system and leadership form of the party and government in propaganda and cultural units; cultivate the socialist cultural market concept and gradually establish a new pattern of cultural work that fits the market economy; accelerate the pace of reforming the internal management system and operational mechanism of the entire propaganda and cultural front and promote the transition from cultural work to cultural industry; strengthen the institutionalization and standardization of propaganda and cultural work and enable the people to have laws to abide by and regulations to follow in carrying out propaganda and ideological work; promote and develop various forms of "link-up" between cultural units and enterprises; and actively expand external cultural exchange and strive to make a large number of cultural products enter the international market. To reform propaganda and ideological work, we must persist in attaching prime importance to social efficiency, and under this basic precondition, realize an integration of economic and social efficiency. On the basis of having a good knowledge of first-hand materials, we should explore something with a regular pattern and guiding significance, and make propaganda and ideological work more specific. Seeking truth from facts is the basic demand for guaranteeing success in propaganda and ideological work and the work style and attitude that propaganda and ideological workers should have. Propaganda departments at all levels should formulate objectives for fulfilling the task within a certain stage and measures for guaranteeing the fulfillment of the task in line with the work plans proposed by the central authorities and the regional party committee, pay attention to sharing the work with departments of the corresponding level and responsibilities with the lower levels, combine the efforts of both, and implement the measures well. We should make each and every propaganda unit and propaganda worker clearly understand his responsibility, perform his own work well, and guarantee that all propaganda and ideological tasks will be well implemented. Third, we should strengthen coordination and form a joint force. Propaganda and ideological work is a project involving the whole society which must be accomplished with the coordinated efforts of the whole party and all sectors. Party committees at all levels and all grass-roots party organizations in enterprises, the rural areas, organs, schools, and neighborhoods should emphasize this work. Administrative departments at all levels and the mass organizations, such as the trade unions, Communist Youth Leagues, and women's federations, should grasp this work in line with their own work. All departments on the propaganda and ideological front should grasp this work specifically and form a lively situation in which the whole party, the higher and the lower levels, and all sectors jointly grasp and manage propaganda and ideological work. Propaganda and ideological departments at all levels should be good at maintaining coordination with other departments, exchange information regularly, establish ties, and seek understanding and support from all sectors. Investments are needed in strengthening propaganda and ideological work. All localities should actively support propaganda and ideological work in terms of financial and human resources in line with the actual economic development situation, gradually improve propaganda means and cultural facilities, and create a good environment for propaganda and ideological work. Fourth, we should emancipate the mind, deepen reform, and enhance vitality for the development of propaganda and cultural undertakings. To strengthen the party's leadership over propaganda and ideological work, we must uphold the reform principle, regard reform as a motivation, and promote the entire propaganda and ideological work to a new height. To reform propaganda and ideological work, we must uphold the principles conducive to strengthening and improving the party's leadership over propaganda and cultural undertakings, giving full play to the enthusiasm and creation of the propaganda and cultural workers, invigorating and developing the propaganda and cultural undertakings, and building the "two civilizations," and realize the demand proposed by Comrade Jiang Zemin on "changing functions, improving relations, streamlining administration, and raising efficiency." The basic ideas of reform are to further reform and improve the leadership system and leadership form of the party and government in propaganda and cultural units; cultivate the socialist cultural market concept and gradually establish a new pattern of cultural work that fits the market economy; accelerate the pace of reforming the internal management system and operational mechanism of the entire propaganda and cultural front and promote the transition from cultural work to cultural industry; strengthen the institutionalization and standardization of propaganda and cultural work and enable the people to have laws to abide by and regulations to follow in carrying out propaganda and ideological work; promote and develop various forms of "link-up" between cultural units and enterprises; and actively expand external cultural exchange and strive to make a large number of cultural products enter the international market. To reform propaganda and ideological work, we must persist in attaching prime importance to social efficiency, and under this basic precondition, realize an integration of economic and social efficiency. In conducting reform in the propaganda and ideological work, we should also display the spirit of daring to do and try. We should boldly explore things as long as they conform with the demand of the party's basic line, with the demand of building socialist spiritual civilization, and with the law of self development of propaganda and cultural undertakings. We should also bravely renew these things so that we can find out a way of reinforcing the vigor of propaganda and cultural work through reform and of promoting the prosperity and development of these undertakings. Fifth, we should realistically enhance the construction of leading bodies and personnel's contingent among the departments in charge of propaganda and ideological work. This represents an organizational guarantee for successfully conducting the propaganda and ideological work. Leadership of departments in charge of propaganda and ideological work and every cadre in these departments must act in unison politically with the CPC Central Committee and the autonomous regional party committee. They should strictly enforce the political and working disciplines and no one is allowed to go his own way. The propaganda and ideological work must be favorable for reform and for developing and stabilizing the whole situation. By no means should we have the propaganda and ideological work add to turbulence. Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out: "To upgrade the quality of cadres, we may select so many measures for this purpose from various angles. However, what is most important is to upgrade the accomplishment in Marxist theories of the broad masses of cadres and particularly of leading cadres." Comrades engaging in the propaganda and ideological work should even pay attention to upgrading their accomplishment in Marxist theories. They should fully discern the importance of enhancing the study of Marxist theories and of applying Marxist theories to arming themselves from the high plane of the historic tasks undertaken by propaganda and ideological workers; of the strategy of safeguarding the reform, development, and unity; and of stabilizing the whole situation. Propaganda departments at all levels should formulate or implement the plans for holding theoretical training classes to vigorously train in a systematic way and in group a large number of comrades who actually and practically know well the basic theories of Marxism and Leninism. By regarding these comrades as backbone personnel, we should have them bring along the theoretical study on propaganda and ideological fronts across the region. Efforts should be made to maintain the stability in the contingent of propaganda cadres and to direct cadres on the propaganda and ideological front to foster the spirit of having self-respect, being self-possessed, and self-progressed; as well as to enhance their sense of glory, mission, and responsibility in engaging in the propaganda and ideological work. Party organizations at all levels should enhance the ideological education among cadres in charge of propaganda work and teach them to be loyal to the party's propaganda undertakings, to ardently cherish their professional work, to perform their duties thoroughly, and to make contributions selflessly. The emphasis of successfully building the contingent of personnel is to enhance the work of building leading bodies on the propaganda and ideological front. Efforts should be made to upgrade the political and ideological levels of staffers among the leading bodies and to enable the leading bodies at all levels on the propaganda front to be the leading core with unified thinking, pure party spirit, heightened spirit, unity, and practical work style. In line with the personnel affairs criterion of four requirements and the demand of having both ability and political integrity, propaganda departments at all levels jointly with the organizational departments should select a large number of comrades who have the theoretical level of Marxism, as well as ardently cherish and know well the propaganda and ideological work, to enter the leading bodies at all levels on the propaganda and ideological front. Party committees and governments at all levels should show concern for the comrades on the propaganda and ideological front in the fields of politics, ideology, work, and livelihood so as to enable them to give better play to their talent and to continuously make new contributions. The new situation and tasks of establishing the systems of socialist market economy and realizing the two periodical fighting targets set by the autonomous regional party committee have set forth new and higher demands for the propaganda and ideological work and also provided broad scope for the work. Leading cadres in party organs at all levels and comrades on the propaganda and ideological front should bravely assume the heavy duty imposed on them by the age, heighten their spirit, enhance their confidence, be willing to do work in a down-to-earth manner, boldly create something new, and strive to create a new situation in the region's propaganda and ideological work!
