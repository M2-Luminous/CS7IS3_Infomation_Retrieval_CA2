In a defensive reaction in the face of the fury and indignation of the Islamic world, the Zionist regime has announced that it is ready to pay reparations to the victims of the al-Khalil catastrophe. However, the custodian of the two holy mosques has, in an unexpected move, accepted the responsibility of paying reparations on behalf of Israel and has even sanctioned the amount. It is not clear what Saudi Arabia's role has been in the massacre of the fasting worshipers in the shrine of the Prophet Abraham -- peace be upon him -- that it has even surpassed Israel in payment of reparations and has even gone a step further and said that it is ready to do so on behalf of Israel. Amid all this, one must not ignore the role of Washington. Right from the outset, Clinton and his associates tried their best to cover up the catastrophe and to call on the Arab side participating in the negotiations with Israel to be indifferent to it and to continue their talks, even in the current circumstances. Even though 'Arafat stooped to immense degradation and lowliness and gave a positive response to this request from Washington, the other Arab countries suspended the peace process. Thus, the question arises: What is the motive behind Saudi Arabia's nauseating attitude in intervening in the al-Khalil incident? Has this been the Saudi stance right from the outset? Is Riyadh under pressure from the United States and Israel to display such generosity? Do the Saudis consider themselves accomplices to Israel's crime that they are seeking to absolve themselves by proposing to pay reparations? These and scores of other questions arise from this nauseating Saudi attitude and each indicates ambiguities in this major catastrophe. Thus, facts and figures indicate that the al-Khalil tragedy is far deeper than can be imagined and, in fact, is the "common weak spot" of the United States, Israel, and the al-Sa'uds. Is this a new test for gauging how despicable the Arab reactionaries are? What were and are the objectives of Washington and the Zionists in continuing such actions? These are questions that, once answered, will yield other information and strong clues that will reveal that the objective was to degrade the Arabs and that this was not an accidental or unexpected incident. Why is Saudi Arabia's concern greater than that of Israel and the United States? Why is it making pledges instead of Israel? The fact is that Israel is seeking to put the revolutionary front of Palestinian forces in a defensive position in every possible way. The al-Khalil massacre on Friday was an action with many motives that was carried out to intimidate the Muslims who do not leave the mosques empty even in the early hours of Ramadan. These actions by Israel were carried out with the al-Sa'uds paying the expenses. Saudi Arabia's offer to pay reparations to the victims of Israeli atrocities will encourage the Zionists to embark on greater carnage of the oppressed Palestinians, and the stance of the custodian of the two holy mosques will make him appear to be the defender of Israel before the Muslims. This indicates that instead of taking the side of the Palestinians and the victims of the disaster, the custodian of the two holy mosques has taken the side of the criminals and the Zionist usurpers. 'Arafat has adopted the same stance and does not even have anything to say. He acquiesces to everything proposed by the United States and Israel with his eyes and ears closed. Prior to this incident, he did not have any respect in the eyes of the Palestinian nation and the revolutionary forces, but the al-Khalil catastrophe has dealt such an irrevocable blow to his prestige that it is unlikely that he will ever recover. The contemptible reaction by 'Arafat on the al-Khalil tragedy proved that not only is he not the spokesman of the Palestinians, he is not even a Palestinian. This is because he has tried to declare the case of this crime closed and to ignore it. The subtle point that needs to be noted with regard to this incident is that all the criminals and those who compromised have been disgraced and have lost all their credibility before the honorable Palestinian nation and the Islamic world. Experience has once again proved that there is no solution but the annihilation of the usurpist Israel and the complete removal of this cancerous tumor from the center of the oil-rich region of the Islamic world. Those should be condemned even more than Israel who claim to be friends of the Palestinian nation but are, in fact, accomplices in Israel's atrocities. This is the issue that needs to be understood and that increases the responsibility of all of us.
