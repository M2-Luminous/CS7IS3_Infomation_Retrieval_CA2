Last month, border guards detained 1,112 trespassers, among whom citizens of Afghanistan, Turkey (Kurds), Vietnam, Syria, and some Balkan countries constituted 78 percent. The authorities confiscated from the border violators, in particular, smugglers, 2.5 tonnes of technological mercury, more than three tonnes of nonferrous metals, over 30 units of various types of weapons, 340.3 kilograms of narcotic raw materials, and so on. The State Committee for Borders points out that, with the strengthening of border and customs control, the activity of those criminal groups that struggle for influence on the railroad transport system and that accompany the contraband goods by road has intensified.
