The price rises in December led to a new rise in the level of inflation which, according to previous assessments, reached almost 200 percent. Incomes of the consolidated budget for January-November 1993 were 33.718 trillion karbovantsi, 8.765 trillion karbovantsi in credits from Ukrainian banks were drawn into the budget to cover the planned deficit and a number of other expenses. The mobilization of the budget's incomes took place in difficult conditions: a considerable number of enterprises, organizations and institutions and also citizens violated the tax law, actually underestimating earned income and profits and delayed making payments to the budget. Expenditure of the consolidated budget for January-November was 38.673 trillion karbovantsi. Of this figure, 12.464 trillion (32.2 percent of total expenditure) were directed at the implementation of measures for the social protection of the population; 8.944 trillion (23.1 percent) for the financing of socio-cultural measures, and 8.725 trillion karbovantsi (22.6 percent) for the national economy. The financing of expenditures on defence was 1.639 trillion karbovantsi and 1.096 trillion karbovantsi for maintaining law enforcement bodies. The consolidated budget of Ukraine was fulfilled with an excess of expenditure over income of 4.955 trillion karbovantsi. The emission of money in 1993 was 12.299 trillion karbovantsi which is 25 times more than in 1992. In the fourth quarter alone an additional 7.537 trillion karbovantsi entered into circulation of which 3.776 trillion karbovantsi took place in December. Creditors' debts between Ukrainian enterprises and organizations and economic subjects of former USSR countries declined in November by almost 40 percent and was 5.7 trillion karbovantsi at the beginning of December while debts grew by 15 percent reaching 4.6 trillion karbovantsi. Creditors' debts of Ukrainian enterprises with Russian trading partners declined by 38 percent (from 8.2 trillion karbovantsi as of 1 November to 5.1 trillion karbovantsi by 1 December) and with Turkmenistan by 96 percent (from 588.1 billion karbovantsi to 24.3 billion karbovantsi respectively). In total over 11 months of 1993 creditors' debts grew by 17 times and debtors' debts by 10 times. In 1993 measures were carried out to form a hard currency market in Ukraine. As a result of this, the volume of currency sales at the Ukrainian interbank currency exchange rose continuously throughout January-August. Thus, if $7.3 million were sold during trading in January, in March the figure was 40.4 million, in June -- 122.3 million, in July -- 142.7 million; trading in German Marks: in April -- 5.1 million, in June -- 11.5 million, in July -- 12.9 million, in August -- 16.8 million; trading in Russian rubles: in April -- 11.6 billion and in June -- 74.2 billion. However, from August to September the volume of sales of these currencies began to decline at exchanges and in October only $29.3 million, 3.3 million German marks, and 10 billion Russian rubles were sold. During the year there was a sharp drop in the exchange rate of the Ukrainian karbovanets in relation to foreign currencies. Thus, if during trading on 5 January 1993 the exchange rate was 798 karbovantsi to the U.S. dollar, during trading on 28 October it was 31,000 karbovantsi. During trading in April the German mark was being sold at 1,886 karbovantsi but at the end of October it was 19,300 karbovantsi and the Russian ruble was 3.5-4.3 karbovantsi and 25 karbovantsi respectively. During 11 months of 1993 (compared with December 1992) prices for consumer goods and services increased by 54 times, by 57 times for foodstuffs, and by 70 times for non-food products. Average monthly salaries for workers in the state sector of the economy increased by 19 times in the 11 months of 1993 and in November amounted to 307,200 karbovantsi which is almost 40 times lower than the value of the minimum consumer budget. At the beginning of 1994, 123,400 citizens who required help to find work were registered in employment establishments. Of these 83,900 were granted the status of unemployed.
