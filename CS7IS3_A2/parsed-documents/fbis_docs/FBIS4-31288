[Horn] I am much better now, even though this appliance, which weighs 7 kg, does create certain difficulties, particularly in bed. But let us talk about politics. [DER SPIEGEL] What Hungary's goulash communism failed to accomplish in decades in power was achieved by the first freely elected conservative government: With their first election victory, the former Communists are now more popular than ever. [Horn] What can be so bad about 54 percent of Hungarians having cast their vote in favor of us Socialists? The overwhelming majority of voters are salary-earners and employees; all in all, the election result reflects the reality of the structure of Hungarian society. [DER SPIEGEL] Does this not sound like the former Lenin disciple Horn, who, although he cut through the barbed wire at the border with Austria in 1989, thus making it possible for thousands of GDR refugees to leave the country, has stuck to socialist ideas at the same time? [Horn] By asking such a question you are ruling out that man learns from experience. My process of rethinking did not only start yesterday or the day before. I was one of those who sought and found contacts with West European social-democratic parties as early as in the mid-seventies, primarily with the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]. Therefore, in the course of the years, we went through the school of social democracy, studying in practice the social market economy, pluralist democracy, and the thinking that is guided by free enterprises.... [DER SPIEGEL] And then you forfeited the people's trust. In 1990 people voted against the old system without knowing the new one, while now the Hungarians seem to be longing for the old days. [Horn] I do not want to rule out that our success does not have to be attributed in parts also to a certain longing for the past security people had in their lives. Yet the people do not want to return to state ownership or the one-party system, they only want competent experts now. The current government has speeded up our victory through its stupid policy. This is what highlighted the contrast between what we stood for and the anachronism of these politicians even more. The Hungarian right even tried to arouse a nostalgia for the arch-conservative Horthy regime instead of meeting the challenges of our time. [DER SPIEGEL] You do not have any problems with turncoats and old single-party cliques? [Horn] Of course, we also have them in Hungary. I have heard of people who now all of a sudden address others with comrade again, while only one year ago they would have protested against it. But any deal requires two persons. It depends on the party whether we will tolerate nepotism and whom we rely on for support. [DER SPIEGEL] Corruption is also widespread in Hungary. Can you say with a clear conscience that there were no irregularities in the way the assets of the former Communist Party were dealt with, and that you are morally legitimized to control these machinations? [Horn] Excuse me -- the Socialist Party has given account of the former party assets to the very last penny. This has been confirmed by both the state prosecutor and the Audit Court. Apart from that, I can promise only one thing: We are firmly determined to fight mercilessly against any form of state corruption, and to depose from office anyone from among the ranks of our party who is even faintly suspected of corruption. [DER SPIEGEL] Four years ago the conservatives made similar promises; a little later the reforms got stuck. Everyday life became dominated by the shadow economy and Mafia-like structures. Is there not a danger that the Socialists could suffer the same fate? [Horn] Despite the absolute majority, we intend to rule in a coalition. I am starting from the assumption that we will submit an offer to this effect to the Alliance of Free Democrats, since our programs are similar in many points. A social-liberal coalition might create a wide democratic basis. We want to enter into vivid dialogue with society, and practice a new political style. [DER SPIEGEL] Will Hungary's relations with its neighbors change, relations that have been tense for a long time as a result of Hungarian minorities? [Horn] What we will not change in our foreign policy is Hungary's Western orientation, in which I would like to give priority to Hungarian-German relations. Should I become prime minister, my first journey will probably take me to Bonn. Hungary's further fate will depend to a large degree on whether we manage to intensify relations with Germany. Moreover, we need a better associate membership agreement with the European Union [EU]. Then we must also seek a new beginning in our relations particularly with Romania and Slovakia, countries with which our problems have deteriorated regarding the Hungarian minorities. [DER SPIEGEL] Will Budapest give the signal for further victories by reformist Communists in the former East bloc? [Horn] I do not think that the voters in any country will look to their neighbors for election results. There is not a trend toward the left in eastern Europe; the only thing that matters is that the right-wing conservative parties have failed everywhere in this part of Europe. This should really be their problem.
