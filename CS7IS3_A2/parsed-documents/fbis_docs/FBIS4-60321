They fabricated these explosions as they have become accustomed to fabricating many things to counter their own cheap acts and activities. The Ministry of Defense in the Democratic Republic of Yemen categorically denies any responsibility for such an act. Citizens are not a target for any military action. It now appears that this gang is no longer able to do anything except to direct destruction against every house in Yemen. This is because it sparked off the war against the people. The Ministry of Defense in Aden warns against such criminal acts and misleading justifications. The lives of the citizens will not be as cheap as the advocates of war and crime believe. They have plunged thousands of people, even minor ones, into a dirty war which does not serve anybody except their narrow and selfish interests.
