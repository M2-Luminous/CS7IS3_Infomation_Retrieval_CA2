Background Implementation of the provisions of the Clean Air Act (CAA), as amended in 1990, will require regulation of many small businesses so that areas may attain and maintain the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the emission of air toxics. Small businesses frequently lack the technical expertise and financial resources necessary to evaluate such regulations and to determine the appropriate mechanisms for compliance. In anticipation of the impact of these requirements on small businesses, the CAA requires that states adopt a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (PROGRAM), and submit this PROGRAM as a revision to the Federally approved SIP. In addition, the CAA directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to oversee these small business assistance programs and report to Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing a PROGRAM are set out in section 507 of Title V of the CAA. In February 1992, EPA issued Guidelines for the Implementation of Section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (Final Guidelines) in order to delineate the federal and state roles in meeting the new statutory provisions and as a tool to provide further guidance to the states on submitting acceptable SIP revisions. The States of New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have submitted SIP revisions to EPA in order to satisfy the requirements of section 507. In order to gain full approval, the state submittal must provide for each of the following PROGRAM components: (1) The establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide technical and compliance assistance to small businesses; (2) the establishment of a State Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory process; and (3) the creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP. EPA proposed to conditionally approve New Jersey's and the U.S. Virgin Islands' SIPs and fully approve New York's and Puerto Rico's SIPs for the establishment of State PROGRAMs on December 21, 1993 (58 FR 67383). A detailed discussion of each state's PROGRAM and EPA's evaluations of the PROGRAMs is contained in the above cited Federal Register . In addition, a thirty day public comment period was provided in the December 21, 1993 Federal Register . Comments were received only on New York's PROGRAM. For New Jersey, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, no comments were received. II. Summary of Submittals A. New Jersey New Jersey has met all of the requirements of section 507 of the CAA by submitting a SIP revision on January 11, 1993 that implements all required PROGRAM elements or delineates milestone dates for when any remaining PROGRAM elements will be enacted by November 15, 1994. The final plan was adopted by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and Energy (DEPE) on January 11, 1993.
