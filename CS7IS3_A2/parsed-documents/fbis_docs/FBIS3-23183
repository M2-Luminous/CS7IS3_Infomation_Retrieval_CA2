The survey--being detailed in tomorrow's Irish Independent newspaper and on BBC TV's On the Record--coincides with this weekend's Sinn Fein annual conference in Dublin. It also highlighted large support for a security crackdown on all para-military groups if the terrorism continues. The poll was carried out last Wednesday in the Irish Republic by Irish Marketing Surveys and on Wednesday and Thursday in Northern Ireland by Ulster Marketing Surveys. It came at the height of growing speculation over the timing of the long-expected response of the IRA and their Sinn Fein spokesmen to the Downing Street peace declaration. Earlier tonight, Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams made it clear in his keynote speech to the party conference that more time was required for consultations about the joint Anglo-Irish declaration. The cross-border survey showed a 79 percent endorsement of the principle in the Downing Street declaration that it would be wrong to impose a united Ireland in the absence of the freely-given consent of a majority of people in Northern Ireland. And an all-Ireland figure of 76 percent--80 percent in the Republic and 68 percent in Northern Ireland--supported the decision of the London and Dublin governments to go ahead with new inter-party talks on Ulster's future, given that the republican movement has so far failed to reply to the peace statement. Of those questioned on the southern side of the border, 94 percent agreed with calls on the IRA and Sinn Fein to renounce violence. In Northern Ireland the figure was 85 percent--87 percent of the Province's Protestants and 82 percent of the Catholics. The security clampdown was supported by an average 75 percent in the two parts of Ireland. In Ulster the move was backed by 88 percent of the Protestants and 61 percent of the Catholics. Adults over the age of 18 took part in the survey--1,053 in the Irish Republic and 863 in Northern Ireland, reflecting population and other factors.
