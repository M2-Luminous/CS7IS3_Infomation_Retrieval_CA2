Ford is prepared to fully participate in the development of China's automobile industry." This statment was made by James Paulsen, newly-appointed president of Ford's China operations, during an interview with this correspondent at Ford's world headquarters. Ford, the second largest automobile manufacturer in the United States and the fourth largest in the world, established operations in China on 1 March to coordinate automobile business related to China. As Paulsen stated, its top priority is to establish as early as possible a joint venture with vehicle assembly lines in China, and to help modernize China's automobile industry. Business exchanges between Ford and China go back a long time. As early as 1978, Henry Ford II visited China and was received by Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. The 750 F-series trucks it later sold to China were the first of its kind imported from the U.S. since 1949. In 1984 and 1985, Ford entered into negotiations with China to establish an automobile joint venture; Ford sold over 3,000 and 6,200 vehicles in China in 1992 and 1993 respectively. Paulsen told this correspondent: "Ford was the first to undertake efforts to establish a joint venture with China. This will be helpful to our cooperation with China. .... [ellipsis as published] Our goal is to produce the best quality products suited to the Chinese market." [The 0239 GMT version reads: "Compared with other automobile companies, Ford was the first to undertake efforts to establish a joint venture with China. This will help better ensure that ours products will be the best among all the joint-venture automobile enterprises in China in terms of quality and value. Our goal is to produce the best quality products suited to the Chinese market."] This correspondent has learned that the number of people involved in the China operations at Ford's world headquarters has increased to over 60. Ford's operations in China are now mainly in the form of component manufacturing, technology licensing, and joint scientific and technology research. All its operations are successful or making progress. Last year Ford established dealers in 10 major Chinese cities, and its service facilities are expanding. "The considerable base of China's automobile industry may serve as a basic condition for cooperation between China and Ford. Ford's investment in China will continue to focus on things like vehicle technology," said Paulsen. Last October, Ford supplied $800,000 to establish a vehicle technology fund together with the China National Science Foundation. Grants for 25 basic research projects will be officially awarded in April this year. This shows Ford's cooperation with China is more oriented to the future, according to Paulsen. Ford personnel told this correspondent that the naming of a president for operations in China equivalent in rank to vice president of the head office clearly indicates the company's resolve to enter the Chinese market. [The 0239 GMT version reads: Ford personnel told this correspondent that the naming of a president for operations in China equivalent in rank to vice president of the head office clearly indicates the company's resolve to march into the Chinese market with great strides]. Paulsen will soon move his office from Ford world headquarters to China. Paulsen, who visited China last year, told the correspondent: "I very much want to go to and work in China. I am eager to learn about China's business environment and automobile industry; I also want to learn about China's culture, humanities, and history." Speaking of the domestic debate in the United States regarding China's most-favored-nation [MFN] trade status, Paulsen said he hopes the Clinton administration will support Ford and other automobile companies in their efforts to expand overseas. He said: "As a businessman, we hope the government will extend China's MFN trade status." He believes the Clinton Government's decision in June regarding China's MFN trade status will mark a turning point in Ford's operations in China.
