FR940706-2-00127 FR940706-2-00075 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION [Docket No. 55&hyph;60117, License No. SOP&hyph;11160, IA 94&hyph;014] Order Prohibiting Involvement in 10 CFR Part 55 Licensed Activities (Effective immediately) In the Matter of: Stephen Mignotte, Senior Reactor Operator. I Stephen Mignotte (Mr. Mignotte) held Senior Reactor Operator License No. SOP&hyph;11160 (License) issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR Part 55. The license authorized Mr. Mignotte to manipulate, and to supervise the manipulation of, the controls of the nuclear power reactor at the New York Power Authority's (Facility Licensee) Indian Point 3 Nuclear Power Plant in Buchanan, New York. On November 23, 1993, Mr. Mignotte resigned his employment with the New York Power Authority, which caused the License to expire. Additionally, the Facility Licensee, in a letter dated December 23, 1993, informed the NRC that the New York Power Authority no longer had a need to maintain Mr. Mignotte's operating license for the Indian Point Unit 3 Nuclear Power Plant. II The responsibilities associated with a Senior Reactor Operator license issued pursuant to 10 CFR Part 55 require that individuals be fit for duty while performing safety-related activities at the facility. The character of the individual, which includes the individual's trustworthiness, is a consideration in issuing an operator license. See Section 182a of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2232a). In determining whether or not an individual seeking a license to be a reactor operator or senior reactor operator has the necessary character and trustworthiness, the Commission takes into account any history of illegal drug use by the applicant. Prior to May 26, 1987, each applicant for a reactor operator or senior reactor operator license was required to certify that the applicant had no drug or narcotic habit on the Certificate of Medical Examination, NRC Form 396. Since that time, the NRC has required an evaluation of the applicant prepared by a physician as part of a license application. See 10 CFR 55.23(a). This evaluation is presented on a Certificate of Medical Examination, NRC Form 396. See 10 CFR 55.23. Among the factors to be considered by the certifying physician are factors such as use of illegal drugs or abuse of alcohol. See Form 396; see also ANSI/ANS 3.4&hyph;1983, Section 5.2.2. In accordance with 10 CFR Part 26, the Facility Licensee established a program to provide reasonable assurance that nuclear power plant personnel are not under the influence of any substance, legal or illegal, which affects their ability to safely and competently perform their duties, including measures for early detection of persons who are not fit to perform licensed activities. In addition, licensed operators are required by 10 CFR 55.53(j) to refrain from use of illegal drugs, including marijuana and cocaine. Licensed operators are also required by 10 CFR 55.53(k) to participate in 10 CFR Part 26 fitness-for-duty programs established by the Facility Licensees. III On November 23, 1993, Mr. Mignotte, while on duty as a Senior Reactor Operator at the Indian Point 3 facility, was requested by the Facility Licensee to provide a urine sample to the nurse at the plant after being randomly selected as part of the routine fitness for duty chemical testing program required of the Facility Licensee by the NRC pursuant to 10 CFR 26.24. After receiving a sample from Mr. Mignotte, the nurse checked the temperature of the sample, noticed that it felt ``cool to the touch'', and found that the temperature was below specifications in 10 CFR Part 26, Appendix A, ยง2.4(g)(14), for acceptable urine samples. As a result, Mr. Mignotte was requested to provide a witnessed urine sample to the Facility Licensee in accordance with the same section of the Appendix. Mr. Mignotte provided a second sample which was subsequently determined, on November 30, 1993, to contain both marijuana and cocaine above cutoff levels specified by the Appendix. After the witnessed urine sample had been collected on November 23, 1993, Mr. Mignotte was suspended from licensed duties and he subsequently resigned that same day. These facts were provided to the NRC by the Facility Licensee, in letters dated December 23, 1993 and January 3, 1994, and were discussed in the report of an NRC inspection conducted January 12&hyph;13, 1994. The results of the second, witnessed urine sample indicate that Mr. Mignotte used illegal drugs, which is a violation of the conditions of his license imposed by 10 CFR 55.53(j). Furthermore, his performance of licensed duties while under the influence of illegal drugs is also a violation of the conditions of his license imposed by 10 CFR 55.53(j). Based on the temperature of the first urine sample provided by Mr. Mignotte and the fact that the first sample yielded negative results when tested for illegal substances while the subsequent, witnessed sample yielded positive results, I conclude that the first sample was a surrogate false sample, submitted by Mr. Mignotte in an attempt to conceal illegal drug use. 10 CFR 50.5(a)(2) prohibits any employee of a licensee from deliberately submitting to the NRC, a licensee, or a licensee's contractor or subcontractor, information that the person submitting the information knows to be incomplete or inaccurate in some respect material to the NRC. The urine samples collected within the context of a licensee's chemical testing program pursuant to the requirements of 10 CFR Part 26 represent information material to an access authorization and fitness-for-duty decision. Therefore, Mr. Mignotte's deliberately submitting inaccurate information material to the NRC in the form of a false sample is a violation of 10 CFR 50.5(a)(2). In addition, Mr. Mignotte violated 10 CFR 50.5(a)(1) by deliberately providing to the Facility Licensee a surrogate urine sample that he knew to be inaccurate at the time he submitted it and which, but for detection, would have caused the Facility Licensee to be in violation of 10 CFR 50.9(a). Mr. Nignotte's failure to comply with the prohibition against illegal drug use and his attempts to circumvent the chemical testing program to avoid detection of illegal drug use while employed by the Facility Licensee are violations of the conditions of Mr. Mignotte's license imposed by 10 CFR 55.53 (j) and (k), and demonstrate an intentional disregard for the important obligations of a licensed operator.
