The document was approved after inclusion of the supplemental adjustments [ajustes subsidiarios] that already had been negotiated by Itamaraty and IAEA, which were imposed by senators who even threatened to reject the project. The adjustments will preserve Brazilian technological secrets, but will permit special ABAC and IAEA inspections of any nuclear materials produced by Brazil. Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, who was fully satisfied with the agreement, will be able to travel to Bonn -- he will leave on 21 February on an official visit to Germany -- without fearing that his interlocutors may threaten to adopt retaliatory measures, which would have been likely had Brazil failed to ratify the agreement. A report indicated that ABAC is making an inventory of Argentine and Brazilian nuclear facilities and materials, and the IAEA will make an inspection in the two countries within the next 60 days. For Brazil, the ratification was something totally new because the country had never ratified a nuclear safeguard agreement. The quadripartite agreement is broader than the Tlatelolco Treaty, which includes all Latin American countries. The voting on the ratification of this treaty had been postponed (perhaps for today or a date after Carnival). Today's debate, which lasted more than two hours, developed after a Senate request for an amendment, which was finally approved and establishes that "all changes to supplemental adjustments will be approved by Congress."
