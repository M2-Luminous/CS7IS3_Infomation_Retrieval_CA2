An artillery and infantry attack was carried out at 0635 [0535 GMT] from the direction of Travnik and Slimena towards the Vitez area against the [Croat] defense forces comprising the Stjepan Tomasevic Brigade and the Travnicka Brigade in the area of (?Smrinka) and Nevic Polje. Forty inmates from Travnik prison, who have been promised an amnesty if they break through the positions of the Croat Defense Council [HVO], are also in the aggressors' formations. After fierce fighting the attack was repelled. The HVO suffered one killed and two wounded, and the indications are that the Muslim army suffered at least five killed and many wounded. In addition, the defenders succeeded in seizing an M-84 machine gun. An attack of similar strength was also repelled in the area of Kruscica in the region of (?Sofe). At 0750 [0650 GMT] the enemy army continued the attack it suspended last night on the (?Buhina Kuca) region and the Vitez-Busovaca road. Here the aggressor is trying to expand the territory it occupied yesterday, which is 100 metres by 150 metres. In the fierce and [word indistinct] fighting for every house and every square metre the HVO formations are, for the time being, thwarting the intentions of the Muslim army. As regards the often mentioned Vitez-Busovaca road, it is worth saying that it has been out of action throughout the period of Muslim aggression, so there is no question of the cutting of communications between Vitez and Busovaca. According to information which has reached the area of Vitez so far, the consequences of yesterday's Muslim offensive are serious -- seven killed and 35 wounded, while 35 people are listed as missing, and of these 14 are women, of whom it is known that they have sought refuge in a safe village not far from the focus of yesterday's Muslim offensive.
