The military conflict in Chiapas has not ended. The fact that a cease-fire was achieved and a first round of talks has started does not mean the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] will lay down its weapons. They expect the agreements will be signed, it was stated in Guadalajara by Msgr. Ruiz, who added that the war is still on. [Begin Ruiz recording] Perhaps it is believed the war has ended so it is not visualized. There is a war, there is a cease-fire, and there was a mutual determination -- although not in writing yet -- to gather forces where they are right now, without subsequent mobilization. A dialogue has started but no peace accords have been signed yet. However, this has been forgotten in the country. [end recording] He said the Chiapas conflict is the shortest war in the world and the one which resulted in a dialogue the fastest. Msgr. Samuel Ruiz arrived in Guadalajara for the Sixth Latin American Congress on Social Medicine, during which he questioned the health aid given to socialist countries like Cuba.
