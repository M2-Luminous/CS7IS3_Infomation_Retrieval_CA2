Yeltsin, 63, interrupted a week's rest on Tuesday [15 February] to meet with Major, but then returned Wednesday to his residence in Zavidovo, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of Moscow, where he was still resting Thursday, spokesman Dimitriy Shevchenko told AFP. "The president is suffering from a cold, nothing more," the spokesman said, adding that any "political speculation" about his health was "unpatriotic." Yeltsin apparently caught cold on February 3, during an official visit to Georgia. He rescheduled his budget statement to parliament, originally due on Friday, for February 24. His ill health came at a time of high diplomatic tensions over NATO's threat to bomb Bosnian Serbs if they do not pull back their heavy weapons from Sarajevo by midnight GMT Sunday. Russia opposes the ultimatum. Last week, U.S. President Bill Clinton tried unsuccessfully for two days to reach Yeltsin at his dacha to discuss the crisis. Washington blamed the failed communications on "technical" problems. The two men finally talked on Friday.
