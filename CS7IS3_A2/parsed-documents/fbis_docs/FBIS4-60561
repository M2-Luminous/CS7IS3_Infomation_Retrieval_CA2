Crowds lined the streets here as the bodies covered in white shrouds were carried aloft on stretchers from the central mosque to the At-Tahrir (Freedom) cemetery. "Death to 'Ali Salim al-Bid" they chanted at the cemetery gates, as the funerals of the first nine victims took place. They included three children, one of them a toddler buried next to its mother. Officials in Sanaa said at least 13 people were killed and more than 100 injured when the missile struck a densely-populated area of the capital late Monday, destroying houses and damaging a hospital. Meanwhile a southern military spokesman in Aden said 400 northern troops had been killed in fierce fighting around the key military base of Al-'Anad, which the south had recaptured from the north. Fighting has raged around the base, 60 kilometres (36 miles) north of the southern stronghold of Aden, since civil war broke out on May 5 between troops loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and forces headed by his southern rival al-Bid. The base, at the gateway to the road to Aden, was seized by northern troops on May 17. There had been no confirmation or denial from Sanaa Wednesday that it had lost control. In the capital, Monday's missile attack provoked outrage among mourners who gathered to witness the funerals. "This is a criminal act. More rockets will increase our determination to cleanse our Yemeni land of the criminals' dirty bodies," said Husayn al-Sayaghi, a 42-year-old engineer. At least 22 surface-to-surface missiles have been fired by southern troops into the north of Yemen since the start of hostilities. The north has also retaliated by firing missiles on Aden. Koranic verses were chanted during the burials, as gravediggers lowered the bodies into the graves and then filled them in with stone blocks and wet clay. They had been brought in Red Crescent vans to the central Qubbat al-Mutawakkil (Dome of the Faithful) mosque for prayers, before being taken to the cemetery. In Aden a spokesman said that troops from the newly declared Yemeni Democratic Republic had inflicted "heavy losses on enemy troops on all the war fronts." Witnesses said northern troops had kept up the pressure on southern troops deployed around Aden in a bid to defend the city from a northern advance. A southern spokesman said in Kharaz Bab el-Mandeb, west of Aden, "all enemy units had been wiped out" by troops, while in Abyan in the east of Aden "hundreds of northern troops had been killed or wounded" in a southern counter-offensive. Fighting was still reported in the vital oil-rich province of Shabwah. [passage omitted]
