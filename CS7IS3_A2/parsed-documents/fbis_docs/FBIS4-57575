FBIS4-57575 "drlat098_i_94005" FBIS-LAT-94-098 Daily Report 10 May 1994 Nicaragua Finance Minister on World Bank, IMF Agreements Finance Minister on World Bank, IMF Agreements PA1905151594 Managua BARRICADA in Spanish 10 May 94 pp 1, 8 PA1905151594 Managua BARRICADA Spanish BFN [Report by Roberto Larios] [Text] Last week in Washington, the government concluded negotiations on the agreements known as ESAF [Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility] and ERC-II [expansion unknown], after succesfully obtaining $27.5 million in loans on top of those that the World Bank and the IMF had already approved for a total of $259 million. Finance Minister Emilio Pereira reported this yesterday at a news conference. Given that the negotiations concluded last week, Pereira described as "extraordinary" the fact that the first disbursements "will not come from originally budgeted resources, but from those that were allocated to four African countries that failed to implement their economic programs and left intact the $120 million the World Bank had budgeted for the next three years." The first loan disbursement -- about $67 million in support of the balance of payments -- will be made on 24 June. The agreements will be ratified at board of directors meetings at the World Bank on 21 June and at the IMF between 22 and 30 June. Pereira reported that besides reviewing the loan contracts, the Nicaraguan ambassador to Washington has been authorized to sign the loan contracts on behalf of the Nicaraguan Government as soon as the board meetings end. These loans will be used immediately to pay for imports made since January. The Central Bank is already lining up import bills, up to a maximum of $20 million, in order to pay them as soon as the loans are disbursed. The IMF and the World Bank "gave their full approval" to the letters of intent sent by the government, Pereira added. He said that the World Bank's Nicaragua Consultative Group will meet on 16 June in Paris. The meeting will focus exclusively on Nicaragua. The discussion on Honduras and Guatemala has been suspended "because those countries failed to implement their economic programs on schedule," the minister said. Consultative Group's Agenda The agenda approved for the Consultative Group's meeting includes a review of the progress thus far and a review of the 1994 plan. The second session will analyze the medium-term agenda, 1995-96, when Nicaragua will try to secure additional development resources. Finally, at the closing session, "before the countries say how much they will contribute to support us, we will discuss the government's priority programs and will focus on social programs to ease poverty and on a program to reform the public sector," Pereira added. The minister said that World Bank President Dr. Preston and the President for Latin America Dr. Burky will visit Nicaragua in September. The government committed itself to continue implementing the ESAF and to immediately issue three decrees, the first eliminating ministers' discretionary power to issue fiscal decrees, the second requiring the government to publish such decrees in the official newspaper LA GACETA, and the third abolishing taxes on luxury goods and on selective consumption, replacing them with a temporary protection tariff and a specific consumption tax. The government also committed itself to "fully promote" the privatization of Nicaraguan Telecomunications and Postal Services Institute. This process is expected to conclude in September. A bill will be introduced in the National Assembly for this purpose. 2,000 Take Advantage of the PML [Job Mobility Plan] Pereira reported that 2,000 state workers have taken advantage of the PML since last September; 260 new applications were filed in the past two months. The minister said: "We see no problem in reaching our goal" of having about 5,000 citizens take advantage of this plan. In fact, "there is actually competition among the unions, which are asking us to "apply it here first." [quotation marks as published] Pereira denied reports that he will be transferred to the Nicaraguan Embassy in Washington. "This ministry has been the target of many attacks since 1990, including media campaigns to discredit us, reports that I am sick, threats against my mother telling her to pick me up at a place known as Cuesta del Plomo at midnight, and obscene phone calls to my wife," he added. The minister said such reports are part of a campaign to destabilize the government. "I am here to stay. I am a father, I have seven children and one of them has undergone seven open-heart operations. I returned to Nicaragua, never to leave again," Pereira added.
