Since the 1970s large-scale projects were carried out in Moscow to reveal and eliminate radioactive landfills. In all, 1,200 such landfills grounds were revealed, most of them in south and south- east Moscow. Now that a part of documents has been lost, the sites of these landfills, the volume of work carried out to clear them up and the composition of isotopes influencing changes in the radiation level, are not known. There is a danger of radioactive contamination, especially during new residential construction. Okhrimenko said that they are drafting a special document, called ecological passport of residential and public construction, according to which a package of geological inspection and anti- radiation measures should be carried out in sites of potential residential construction.
