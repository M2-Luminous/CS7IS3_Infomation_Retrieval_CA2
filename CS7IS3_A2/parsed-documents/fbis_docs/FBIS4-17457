This was stated in an ITAR-TASS interview today by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko who is paying an official visit to Hanoi. At their meeting in Moscow on 15 April the Russian and Ukrainian presidents instructed their foreign ministers to complete the preparation of the draft treaty. In this connection Leonid Kravchuk invited Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation, to pay an official state visit to Ukraine. The invitation was accepted. We hope that the interstate treaty will be signed during this visit, the Ukrainian foreign minister said. Referring to the talks in Sevastopol between the Russian and Ukrainian defense ministers, A. Zlenko stressed that "the decisions adopted at the April meeting of the two presidents must be carried out." The accords already reached on dividing up the fleet and separate basing of the two countries' naval forces must be implemented. By adhering to these accords, without backing away from them, we can make progress toward a solution of the Black Sea Fleet problem. If, however, attempts to reinterpret the decisions made by the two presidents continue, I think we will again find ourselves deadlocked as we try to settle this "extremely complex" question, A. Zlenko noted.
