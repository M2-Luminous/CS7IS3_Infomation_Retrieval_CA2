On 9 May, Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori indicated that his government would wait at least 10 days for experts to raise their proposals to improve the draft of the letter of intent before sending it to the IMF. Economist Alejandro Indacochea, an Advanced Business School board member, noted that Fujimori's proposal was positive "because the publication of such documents had been considered taboo by former governments, which guarded them as if they were top state secrets." Indacochea pointed out, however, that it would be impossible to voice an opinion on the letter of intent unless the annexes on the committed economic targets become known, and he asked the government to publish them as soon as possible. The economist added that there is a point missing in the document "involving the overvaluation of soles against dollars and its negative impact on the trade deficit, which has not been overcome in four years and must be reversed."
