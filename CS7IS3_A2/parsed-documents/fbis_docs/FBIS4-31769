"This has to be associated also with the PNTCD leader Corneliu Coposu's stands taken on a possible amendment of the Constitution, to the effect of restoring the monarchy in Romania," the release reads. "As a matter of fact, it is strange to see justice protected by the leaders of a party that has so far accused systematically the justice of `obedience to the power,' while President Ion Iliescu has never uttered such accusations, his only preoccupation being to see to the observance of law and human rights, as established by the Constitution." "The PDSR assesses that by the above statement the PNTCD is trying to accumulate political capital in the context of the street events announced for the period ahead, being also an attempt of the PNTCD to strengthen its shaken position and monopoly in the Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR]." According to the PDSR, "the statement of the PNTCD's leadership discredits its own party, the more so as it is a parliamentary party with a certain weight in the political life." "Under the circumstances created by the statement of the Steering, Coordination, and Control Bureau of the PNTCD and by Mr. Corneliu Coposu's statement, the Central Executive Bureau of the PDSR expresses its hope that the PNTCD will reconsider its own political strategy and its representatives will focus their efforts in parliament on the problems under debate, on the major issues marking now the country's political life."
