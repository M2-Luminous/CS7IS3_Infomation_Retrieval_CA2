FR940318-0-00235 FR940318-0-00023 Foams Unacceptable Substitutes 1End-use 1Substitute 1Decision 1Comments CFC&hyph;11 Polyolefin HCFC&hyph;141b (or blends thereof) Unacceptable HCFC&hyph;141b has an ODP of 0.11, almost equivalent to that of methyl chloroform, a Class I substance. The Agency believes that non-ODP alternatives are sufficiently available to render the use of HCFC&hyph;141b unnecessary in polyolefin foams. Substitutes Acceptable Subject to Narrowed Use Limits 1End-use 1Substitute 1Decision 1Comments Electronics cleaning w/CFC&hyph;113, MCF Perfluoro-carbons (C5F12, C6F12, C6F14, C7F16, C8F18, C5F11NO, C6F13NO, C7F15NO, and C8F16) Acceptable for high-performance, precision-engineered applications only where reasonable efforts have been made to ascertain that other alternatives are not technically feasible due to performance or safety requirements The principal environmental characteristic of concern for PFCs is that they have long atmospheric lifetimes and high global warming potentials. Although actual contributions to global warming depend upon the quantities of PFCs emitted, the effects are for practical purposes irreversible. Users must observe this limitation on PFC acceptability by conducting a reasonable evaluation of other substitutes to determine that PFC use is necessary to meet performance or safety requirements. Documentation of this evaluation must be kept on file. For additional guidance regarding applications in which PFCs may be appropriate, users should consult the Preamble for this rulemaking.
