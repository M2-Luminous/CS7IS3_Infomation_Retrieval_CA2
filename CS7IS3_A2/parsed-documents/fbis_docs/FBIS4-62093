One Mercedes Is Sufficient"] [Text] It became known Tuesday evening that the Russian president had agreed to the proposal by the State Duma Defense Committee to increase defense spending this year to 55 trillion rubles [R]. This committee's proposals, sent to the premier, bear the endorsement of Boris Yeltsin: "I deem it expedient to agree." As is known, the figure of R37.1 trillion for defense features in all the versions of the government draft, including the one submitted once again to the Duma for discussion 11 May. Back at the beginning of March, when the sum of the proposed military spending became known, the military department together with the military-industrial complex mounted an extensive campaign for the radical revision of that figure. Upward, naturally. Until very recently, however, the military was losing this war for money. Blackmail by military industrialists, who had declared at the beginning of March that such a budget would lead to the closure of 3,000 enterprises in the military-industrial complex, failed to make the expected impression. Pavel Grachev's March memorandum to Boris Yeltsin had no direct consequences, although, according to the newspaper SEGODNYA, it gained the president's endorsement: "I share the defense minister's concern." Two months later -- two months which the military lobby, to all appearances, did not waste -- there came a series of conferences of interested persons and departments in this regard. They culminated in a discussion of the problem with Yuriy Baturin, the president's assistant for national security. Everyone there naturally claimed that national security demands a sharp increase in defense spending. Two months ago the military's appetite extended to R80 trillion. Given the total budget expenditure planned at the time of R183 trillion, this meant that almost 44 percent of all state spending would go on defense. It should be pointed out that even high-ranking nonmilitary experts in the government were speaking of the unrealistically low level of defense spending planned for this year. Their chief argument was that the sector of the economy associated with defense cannot be cut back as fast as the whole of the rest of the country's economy. The maintenance of personnel (wages, clothing allowance, etc.) accounts for the lion's share of the expenditure. This part cannot be sharply reduced for the very reason that an officer being transferred to the reserve must receive 20 times his monthly salary and other benefits, which add up to a tidy sum. In such a situation it is cheaper for the Ministry of Defense to maintain the military than to reduce it. There are grounds for believing that the chief internal spring of the military's financial activeness is the fact that it has ALREADY PLACED THE DEFENSE ORDER FOR 1994 IN THE SUM OF R28.3 TRILLION, WHILE THE EXISTING BUDGET GIVES IT NO MORE THAN R5.5 TRILLION FOR THIS At the last conference with Baturin the chief opponent of the military lobby (ex officio, at least) -- Andrey Astakhov, deputy minister of finance -- showed sympathy toward the sphere which he supervises. He said that it is necessary to add to the military's money, but within the limits of the overall figures for state expenditure already defined. There are no grounds for doubting that only the first part of the deputy minister's sentence will be taken on board. True, the new figure for military spending remains just a project at present. Acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin's telephone conversation with the premier on this subject, which took place Wednesday morning, did not turn this proposal into the government's position, but neither did it cancel it out. If the military succeeds in seeing this operation to seize the treasury through to its logical end, it will receive 28 percent of all the state expenditure in the present budget or almost half of the budget's actually expected income. The existing draft budget allocates 20 percent of expenditure to defense. Knowledgeable people in the government say that if parliament approves a 50-percent increase in military spending, it will be practically impossible to avoid allocating this money, regardless of actual income. It will be sufficient for Grachev's Mercedes to drive peacefully into the Kremlin. A very tough instruction to the Ministry of Finance follows after every such drive: Allocate money! Money will be allocated even if this takes half the treasury's money, even if Russia is left a country with the largest number of servicemen per head of the civilian population.
