Get to Work, Comrades!"] [Text] According to the calculations of specialists, only two years are needed for beginning launches of light boosters from the new Russian cosmodrome Svobodnyy. And although a special decree of the government on its establishment and a directive of the president of the Russian Federation on the designation of Aleksandr Vinidiktov as the head of the Main Center for Tests and Use of Space Equipment is expected in the immediate future, the Military-Space Forces are already in action. The end of the cold war brought to the brink of extinction the one-time most powerful branch of the armed forces: the Strategic Rocket Forces. Under the conditions of the agreement on reduction of strategic aggressive arms (START II) the two powers are continuing the process of mutual disarmament, thus reducing the confrontation to a lower level. According to the agreement, up to the year 2003 in Russia, in particular, surface intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) of six types will be destroyed, including the heavy RS-20 (SS-18 in the American classification) which caused the greatest worry beyond the ocean. This 30-m "cigar" was the most powerful missile in the world and not without reason in the United States was nicknamed the "Satan." With a launch weight of more than 200 tons it carried 10 individually guided nuclear warheads (the power of each of which was equal to 11 of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima) and it could transport 8.8 tons for a distance of 11 thousand kilometers. The latest American 10-warhead Peacekeeper ICBM with a launching weight of 88 tons could deliver only 3.95 tons for this same distance. As a result of implementation of Start II, only one kind of ICBM will remain in Russia -- the solid-fuel RS-12M (SS-25) -- both in the now-existing mobile variant, and in the permanently based variant to be developed. This creation of Votkinsk machine builders (Udmurtia) has no standard-produced analogues in world rocket building. The first to be destroyed will be rockets developed and constructed at earlier times: RS-10 (SS-11), RS-12 (SS-13) and RS-16 (SS-17). In addition, those ICBM which are constructed outside Russia, in the Ukraine, will be removed from the armament of the Strategic Rocket Forces: these are the RS-20 and the RS-22 (SS-24). American ICBM also will be destroyed (the Peacekeeper, known in our country as the MKh) or will be rebuilt into single-warhead missiles (Minuteman 3). By the beginning of the 21st century some of the 20 Russian regions of deployment of combat rocket complexes of the Strategic Rocket Forces will cease to exist. Until recently Svobodnyy-18 remained the most easterly region of deployment. The armament there consisted of 60 RS-10 ICBM aimed at targets of the probable enemy. It so happened that a similar decision on the reoutfitting of the defense facility at Plesetsk into a space facility was made almost 30 years ago. Now the same decision has been made with respect to the rocket division at Svobodnyy-18. It is very simple to blow up the tens of silos outfitted with unique equipment, which, however, had already been partially done at Svobodnyy-18. But the defense capability of Russia and its guaranteed access to space would remain in question due to the unresolved status of Baykonur and the possibility that the Kazakh side will advance ever-newer leasing conditions. Accordingly, the former military facility will be preserved, but it will play a different role, as the Main Center for Tests and Use of Space Equipment, as part of the Russian Military Space Forces. As planned by the Military Space Forces, the Svobodnyy cosmodrome in the initial stage will consist of two launch pads. After two years, in 1996, light space boosters of the Rokot type will be launched directly from the former silos. They also were constructed on the basis of RS-18 (SS- 19) combat missiles and already have been twice launched from Baykonur. Later three additional silos will be allocated to the Rokot. But the principal task of Svobodnyy will be the launching of heavy boosters, for which two additional launch facilities will be constructed. Now the NPO Energiya, Khrunichev Scientific Production Center and the Makeyev Design Bureau at Miass (Chelyabinsk Oblast) are developing projects for a new generation of heavy two-stage boosters to be called the Angara-24. Among the requirements imposed on the future rocket the most important is ecological cleanness. As the fuel for it specialists most likely will use nontoxic components -- liquid oxygen and hydrogen, as well as kerosene. The first stage and the nose cowling will fall to the ground. In the future the first stage will become multiply reusable and will make a gliding descent to the launch site. The second stage will be put into a reference orbit by command and will burn up in the atmosphere. The deployment region of the rocket division occupied several tens of square kilometers in Amur Oblast. With the reoutfitting of the facility the area will be reduced in size and lands will be returned to the oblast. Svobodnyy-18 -- the "capital" of the cosmodrome and the former military city -- is located approximately 200 km from Blagoveshchensk. As stated by Vladimir Polevanov, doctor of geological and mineralogical sciences, administrative chief of Amur Oblast, clear sunny weather prevails here 300 days a year. In winter, in January, there are only several days when the temperature drops to -30 degrees. Even melons and grapes grow here in summer. Amur Oblast is a far-outlying province of Russia. The head of the oblast is convinced that with the appearance of the new cosmodrome the region will "boom"; not only state investments will come here under the federal program for construction of the spaceport, but money will begin to be invested for development of the infrastructure, industry and commerce. In addition, due to the cosmodrome the oblast will receive new technologies and jobs, will receive profits from possible commercial launches and information from satellites launched at Svobodnyy will help in exploring regions where minerals may be present. Most of the local population for the time being is against the plans of the Military Space Forces and the oblast administration. The people feel that launches of space rockets are more dangerous than the nuclear warheads positioned here earlier. Here an unprecedented flourishing of the environmental movement also is noted, despite the fact that the future builders of the spaceport vow to preserve the ecological purity of the region. The Russian Space Agency (RSA) also is wishy-washy about the new idea. The opinion prevails at the agency that the project is unrealistic because Russia does not have the funds. It is true that the disapproval of the RSA may be related to the desire that the Military Space Forces not "retreat" from Baykonur, where they fully support all launches. So that the words of Colonel-General Vladimir Ivanov, commander of the Military Space Forces, that Svobodnyy is "not a retreat, but on the contrary, an active advance," have a dual meaning. On the one hand, this is a base for the development of Russian unmanned cosmonautics. On the other hand, it represents a strengthening of the position of the Military Space Forces in its relations with Kazakhstan (in the event of the next unrealistic demands which it advances with respect to Baykonur) and in its relations with the Russian Space Agency, which will be forced to play second fiddle at Svobodnyy if it becomes the sole possible place for implementing manned programs.
