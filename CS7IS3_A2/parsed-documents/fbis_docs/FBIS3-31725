[Draskovic] My people are not only situated on the hills around Sarajevo, but are also living in the city. Since the beginning of the war there have always been more Serbs in Sarajevo than around the city -- and they suffer more. This is the wrong place and the wrong time to side with the Bosnian Serbs demonstratively. [Hamann] Do Bosnia's Serbs no longer deserve any support from Belgrade? [Draskovic] By destroying Sarajevo, Karadzic has destroyed Serb tradition. He does not represent the Serb nation, merely an extremist minority. I belong to a great nation; it is my duty to defend the honor of the Serbs. But the propaganda is in the hands of the extremists. [Hamann] Is peace in Bosnia possible as long as Milosevic is president of Serbia? [Draskovic] Do not be surprised if Milosevic and (Croatian President) Tudjman present themselves as peacemakers now. This is not logical, this is not honest -- but this is politics. I am worried that the world might forget that the key to peace lies in Bosnia itself. The international community has the duty to extend the example of Sarajevo to all of Bosnia, until the ultimate aim, disarmament down to the knives, has been achieved. This would require 50,000 UN soldiers. [Hamann] What would the effect on Serbia be? [Draskovic] After disarmament in Bosnia, the democrats in Serbia and Croatia will grow wings. New people will be in power here overnight. [Hamann] But people are hardly prepared to bring the regime down. [Draskovic] How could they? The sanctions have not harmed Milosevic, but me. Of my supporters, 300,000 have fled Serbia. If the West wants to support democratization, it will have to lift the embargo.
