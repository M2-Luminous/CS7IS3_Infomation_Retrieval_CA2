Li Lanqing, CPC Central Committee Political Bureau member and State Council vice premier; Wang Bingquan, National People's Congress Standing Committee vice chairman; and Wan Guoquan, Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee vice chairman; met with 207 representatives and had a picture taken with them. While meeting with the representatives, Li Lanqing said: It is my great pleasure to meet you, representatives of advanced self-employed workers, and to congratulate you on the honor you have received. As is known, a socialist market economy consists of various economic sectors, with public ownership as the mainstay. It is a long-term national policy to encourage them to compete on equal terms, promote each other, and develop simultaneously. In recent years, individually owned and privately owned economic sectors have developed vigorously mainly because of, first, the party's opening up policy and, second, the hardworking pioneering spirit and diligent labor of individual workers. They have played an important role in promoting economic development, which is obvious to all. Individual workers should run their businesses according to the law, develop their undertakings through honest labor and managerial expertise, and contribute to China's economic development. It is hoped that they will always remember the Chinese virtue of using one's fortune to help others, and will lead local people to achieve common prosperity. Meanwhile, we should advocate the spirit of readily helping others and donate funds to promote educational undertakings. Li Lanqing said: Among self-employed workers, there are heroes and models, in addition to outstanding entrepreneurs. One of the representatives commended at the current meeting is an individual worker from Zhejiang who was burned and injured while trying to put out a fire. People are touched by his heroic deeds. We hope that other workers will bring into play his self-sacrificing spirit and make joint efforts to further develop economic and achieve fruitful results in building spiritual civilization. In his speech, Wang Bingqian said: Individually run and privately run economic sectors are placing an increasingly conspicuous role in promoting production, bringing about social prosperity, enlivening circulation, making things more convenient for everyday life, providing employment, and safeguarding social stability. At present, there are some 17.6 million individually run industrial and commercial units employing a total of over 29 million people. They have formed an important and indispensable force in China's socialist construction. Engaged in honorable undertakings, individual workers should be protected by the state laws, recognized by society, and respected by the people. The meeting was sponsored by the Communist Youth League Central Committee, the State Industry and Commerce Administration, and the China Association of Self-Employed Workers.
